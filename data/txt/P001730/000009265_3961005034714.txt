NSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
Credit and Project Summarv
Borrower:           Republic of Mali
Benficiaries:       Ministry of Equipmtent and Transportation (MET)
R6gie du Chemin de Fer du Mali (RCFM)
Amount:             SDR 46.1 million (US$65 million equivalent)
Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity
Cofinancinu:        BOAD (US$10.7M), FAD ($14.3M), FED (US$50M), IsDB (US$53.6),
Canada (US$7.1M), France (US$17.9M), Germany (US$19.8M), EIB, OPFC
(amounts to be determined)
O-lending:          For the track rehabHlitation and studies subcomponents, RCFM  will receivc
funds in grant form; for the other subcomponents, amounts will be onlent at
7.5% interest per annum, repayable over 20 years, with 10 years grace.
Program and Project
Qjectives:          The proposed project is part of a sector-wide program  to support the
Government of Mali's efforts: (a) to strengthen the sector's management and
performance through reorganization and local capacity building; (b) to
restructure the transport sector's parastatals; (c) to modify the regulatory and
instiutional framework in order to promote increased private sector
participation in the provision of services and the execution of works; (d) to
rehabilitate and maintain a priority network of transport infrastructure; and (e)
to improve the transport operation's efficiency, and reduce transport costs.
Description:        The proposed project is designed around the Government's five-year (1994-
1998) program of sectoral reforms contained in the Declaration of General
Trmnsport Sector Policy, supported by a parallel donor-assisted program of
investments in the trarsport sector. The program has four components; IDA
will participate in the fmancing of the following: (a) a capacity building and
training componnt to support the reorganization of transport services, and to
implement sector policy measures, notably the final liberalization of the
transport industry, the upgrading of road maintenance by reorganizing its
agencies and work methods and allocating adequate resources, the
restructuring of public enterprises and the improvement of the efficiency of
international transport corridors; (b) a road component focussing on (i) the
routine maintenance of a priority network of 9,000 km; (ii) the rehabilitation



ii
or periodic maintenance of 1,170 km of paved roads and 2,870 km of earth
roads and tracks; (iii) the improvement of 500 km of rural tracks outside the
main agricultural areas, and the purchase of ferries, (iv) the implementation of
specific works to improve the environment and safety along selected project
roads; (v) the improvement of Bamako's main urbsn road system; (vi)
technical studies and supervision; and (vii) the purchase of equipment for
routine road maintenance; (c) a railway cmponent focusing on (i) the
execution of the first tranche of a 10-year track rehabilitation program, and
the construction of a freight terminal in Bamako-Korofina, (ii) improvement of
the telecommunication system, (iii) the purchase of three medium capacity
locomotives and rehabilitation of equipment; (iv) logistical equipment, and (v)
studies to implement the railway restructuring policy and transform RCFM
into an autonomous and fully commercial enterprise with reduced personnel.
The fourth component is an investment component for airports to finance
both safety equipment for the Timbuktu and Bamako-Senou airports and
technical studies. This component is fully fmanced by cofinanciers.
Proiect Benefits:   The project is designed to modernize the administration of the sector and,
most importantly, to reduce transport costs. The overall appraisal of the two
principal program components (road and rail, accounting for about 95% of
program costs) yields an internal rate of return (IRR) of 28%, more than
double the discount rate (12%) adopted (the rates of subprojects range from
178% for periodic maintenance for a semi-urban road to 12% for the last
rural track included in the program). The sensitivity tests carried out show
rates of return higher than 12%). The project is also expected to result in
many other indirect benefits that cannot be quantified. It will enhance the
transport sector's efficiency by realigning the functions of its administration,
restructuring its public agencies to give them a firmly commercial character
and  irpving their operational capacities. The program will have a high
economic and social impact on the populatioL tnrough reduced transport costs,
the 280,000 person/months of jobs it will create, and the promotion of small
local firms to meet the increased demand expected to arise through the
multiplier effects of the incomes generated by the program.
Project Risks:      The principal project risks stem from the fact that the Government may not be
able to implement all the desired reforms in the sector, or to remove the
obstacles to the mobilization and allocation of adequate financial resources for
counterpart funding and, in particular, for routine road maintenance.
Secondly, the Mali transport agencies' institutional capacity to manage the
program is weak. For RCFM, the risk would derive from insufficient
integration of international freight services with SNCS.  These risks are
minimized by the strong ownership demonstrated by the Government during
project preparation, the rapid fulfillment of all conditions of negotiations,
monitoring of the annual public investment programs and key indicators of
RCFM activities, continued coordination with other financing institutions, and
strengthening of sector management through reorganization and capacity
building.

REPUBLIC OF MALI
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND
A. Country Macro-Economic Background
1.1    Mali is a vast, sparsely populated Sahelian country with limited natural resources. The bulk
of its agricultural production takes place along the Niger River and in the southern third of the
country. The habitually long distances between agricultural production areas and consumer centers,
along with the poor condition of the country's transport infrastructure, make for high domestic
transport costs and temporary inter-spatial disequilibria in agricultural markets. However, recently-
enacted measures aimed at liberalizing the regulatory framework have increased competition in the
ansport industry and have resulted in more efficient service.
1.2    After several false starts, Mali began its adjustment effort in earnest in 1988 and has since
implemented a wide range of economic and institutional reforms. These have included complete
domestic marketing and price liberalization, reforms to the regulatory framework and tax regime,
public enterprise restructuring, and progressive elimination of trade distortions. The civil service
wage bill has been kept in check, and the share of social sector expenditures in the recurrent budget
has been steadily increased. These measures have improved the economic incentive system and have
allowed greater play of market forces in determining economic outcomes.  Furthermore, the
transparency and efficiency of public resource allocation has improved. Real GDP growth has gone
up from an annual average of less than 2% during the first half of the 1980s to an average of about
3.7% between 1988 and 1992. The public sector's fiscal position also improved from a deficit of
12% of GDP equivalent in 1991 to 9.6 % in 1993.
1.3   Progress in restoring macroeconomic balances, however, remains slow in a fragile political
context that has seen three government changes between April 1992 and February 1994. During the
second half of 1992 and for much of 1993, the financial recovery program began to falter. Revenue
performance was weaker than anticipated, and while overall spending was within the programmed
limit, some expenditure items (notably student scholarships) increased significantly in response to
pressure from various social groups. The fiscal deficit, despite some improvements, remained higher
than expected. Furthermore, balance-of-payment performance has been adversely affected by the fall
in the world market price of cotton, the main export crop. More importantly, until recenty the
p agram was unable to achieve significant improvements in Mali's external competitiveness and, as a
result, the economy was not able to generate the growth rates needed to allow improved standards of
living and the alleviation of poverty.
1.4    On January 12, 1994 the govermnents of the CFA zone-of which Mali is a part-decided to
devalue the CFA franc by 50% in foreign currency terms. This decision should give a new boost to
Mali's ongoing structural adjustment efforts and provide a greater chance for success in stimulating
the economy and, ultimately, achieving the sustained growth necessary for raising the standards of
living. A new Policy Framework Paper (PFP) has been agreed on with the Government for the 1994-
96 period. This outlines important measures, accompanying the devaluation, which are necessary to



2
help restrain inflation and to ensure that significant real depreciation is attained. Other features of the
PFP include continued focus on human resource development, improved efficiency in agriculture and
the provision of basic infrastructure services (notably transport), and the continuation of public
enterprise reform and reforms to the regulatory and incentives framework.
1.5   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy to Mali will continue to focus on promoting human
resources and developing the private sector development, extending and rehabilitating basic productive
infrastructure, improving macroeconomic management, and building institutional capacity. IDA
lending to Mali in the next few years is expected to increase substantially to support the Government's
expanding adjustment effort and to assure that output growth recovers significantly. An emergency
Economic Recovery Credit has been approved already, and planned operations include a follow-up
adjustment operationi, and new investment operations in agriculture, infrastructure, and human
resources. The transport sector project is an important part of IDA's assistance stra jy for Mali
since it will allow improved access to, and efficiency of, transport services, which are critical for
ensuring a quick and strong supply response and stimulating growth.
B. Country/Sectoral Background
1.6   The transport sector is a key factor in Mali's development. Based mainly on subsistence
agriculture subject to a highly unpredictable climate, the Malian economy depends heavily on foreign
trade (40% of GDP) and, therefore, on the efficiency of its international transport systems. Total
imports of various basic consumer and capital goods in 1992 were estimated at nearly 600,000 tons
(including 200,000 tons of petroleum products) valued at CFAF 180 billion, while 1992 exports
totaled nearly 200,000 tons (cotton accounting for nearly half) worth CFAF 87 billion. The
development of local trade, spurred by the increased activity in population movement and in rapid
urban growth, has made domestic transport particularly important. Overland transport accounts for
most of the trade traffic, with annual volumes on the order of 1.1 billion ton-km (tk) (25% by rail)
and 2.2 billion passenger-km (pk) (10% by rail). Transport contributes some 5% of GDP and has
posted average annual growth rates of about 4% in the last few years (see Annex 1 - GDP, and
Annex 2 - Government revenues). Given the country's size and its landlocked position, the
development of Mali and the competitiveness of its economy depend more than usual on the
operational efficiency of its transport system which currently faces a number of problems.
1.7   Because it is landlocked, Mali's imports and exports are dependent on the neighboring
countries' overland routes and seaports. Until recently, Government intervention in intional
transport (particularly through freight allocation and rate-setting) was party responsible for the high
cost of international transport cqaivalent to about 30% of the country's import bill. About half of
international traffic is by road (mainly from Abidjan), while the rest is by rail (from Dakar). Road
transport suffers from poor performance and insufficient competition in the trucking industry and
from a lack of adequate maintenance of road infrastrucrre. Rail transport has shown significant
improvements in operational and financial performances in recent years, but the Re'gte du Ohemin de
Fer du Mali (RCFM) still needs to develop a decidedly commercial orientation and improve
collaboration with the Senegal railway company, the Socidte Nationale de COiemins de Fer du Senegal
(SNCS) into a true partnership. River barge transport services are provided by the private sector for
part of the year when the Niger river permits navigation; the parastatal Conpagnie Malienne de
Navigation (COMANAV) has also intermitently operated freight and passenger service at a loss
downstream from Koulikoro. Two new airlines, Mali Timbuktu Air Service (MALTAS) and Air



3
MALISA, were created in 1990 and 1993, respectively, with more than 80% private sector
participation to provide local air transport services; and Mali rejoined the international carrier Air
Afrique in 1992. As a result of the receht devaluation of the CFA franc, the volume of imports is
expected to decrease somewhat; the share of international transport in the country's import bill may
decrease from 30% to about 20% to 25% since only a part of the fuel price increase is being passed
on the users, with the rest being absorbed through a decrease in fuel taxes. For domestic traffic,
which plays a crucial role in food security during recurring periods of drought and is handlic
predominantly by road, the impact of the devaluation is again expected to be muted since vehicle
operating costs are expected to increase by some 40%, i.e., well below price increases of imported
goods.
1.8    While efficient and competitive transport is necessary to the country's development, transport
infrastructure is expensive to construct and maintain, thus placing heavy demands on the scarce
available resources. The parity change of the CPA franc will increase road maintenance costs by
some 40% (in CFAF). Therefore, it will be more essential than ever that future investment and
maintenance works be carefully screened with particular emphasis on maximizng potential foreign-
exchange savings.
H. SECTOR STRATEGY AND ISSUES
A. Strategy
2.1    To bring the transport sector in line with Government's macro-economic adjustment reforms,
the then Ministere de l'Equipement et de l'Habitat (MEH) decided in early 1991 i. set up a Transport
Sector Committee (TSC) which brought together all the sector's operators, public and private, in a
first-ever attempt to bring a particiatorv approach to bear on identifying key sectoral problems and
developing solutions. The TSC mnet a number of times and, with the assistance of facilitators brought
in for this purpose, prepared a draft Declaration of General Transport Sector Policy (DGTSP). This
was fully discussed with IDA and formally adopted by Govermnent on Novemnber 2, 1993 (Annex 3).
The Policy introduced fndamental changes in sector objectives in five major respects. It pledged its
commitment (a) to encourage competitiveness and give a bigger role to the private sector in the
transport and public works industries; (b) to restructure public enterprises, particularly the RCPM,
and to replace force account works in the highway sector, including road maintenance with works by
contract; (c) to use economic criteria in transport investment choices; (d) to give infrastructure
maintenance tie highest priority in resource allocation; and (e) to take more responsibility for rural
roads, in particular, and the environment, in general. The new strategy is discussed fully in the Mali
Transport Sector Memorandum (Report No. 12095-MLI, green cover issued in October, 1993).
2.2 The DGTSP next translated these general objectives into a series of more detailed sub-
objectives, all geared towards transforming the main obstacles into a smooth operation of the sector
and boosting its efficiency at all levels and over all sub-sectors: (a) raising the efficiency of the
transport sector administration by redefining its functions and reorganizing and modernizing its
services; (b) improving the efficiency of international transport corridors; (c) stepping up competition
between land freight modes and enterprises; (d) absorbing the surplus capacity of the trucking
industry; (e) restructuring public enterprises to upgrade their performance by making them fully
commercialy viable; (f) upgrading road maitenance by reorganizing its agencies and work methods



4
and allocating adequate resources; (g) improving infrastructure cost recovery; (h) substantially
increasing attention to rural trarsport; and rinally, (i) enhancing transport safety, particularly in
passenger transport. To ensure realization of these sub-objectives, the D(GTSP proposes
implementation of a series of institutional, organizational, regulatory and financial measures and
restructuring of public enterprises. All these measures have been agreed upon by the Government
and IDA.
B. Issues
2.3    Generally speaking, the transport sector administration has not evolved in over two decades.
The local administration is fragmented into a number of independent, specialized services representing
the ministry and it continues to suffer from serious understaffing at all professional levels. Therefore,
the central administration has not been able to perform its design, planning, regulatory, leadership and
supervisory functions as required, and instead has confined itself to routine management tasks,
notably the inefficient execution of road works by force account. Serious capacity building efforts are
required to remedy this situation.
2.4    The transport sector's recent evolution and its medium-term development prospects reflect the
structural adjustment policy initiated by Malian authorities in the early 1990. Until the end of 1990,
the transport system was closely controlled by the Government through the national transport office,
Office National des Transports (ONT). The rigidities inherent in this type of administration
considerably impaired its efficiency and took its toll on the Malian economy. The recent abolition of
the ONT and the liberalization of transport tariffs constitute a major step forward; they have already
allowed for a more flexible management of the system. Competition between transport modes and
enterprises, nevertheless, remains generally insufficieLt and the temptation to reintroduce regulation to
protect the interests of certain transport sector operators is still present. This was demonstrated by
certain interventions during the Conference of Transport Authorities and Operators (Conference des
Etats-Gbieraux des Tranwsports) held in March 1992.
2.5 The Government withdrew from the road transport industry during the 1980s, but it continues
to be directly involved in transport services through three public enterprises: the RCPM (railways),
the Aeroports du Mal (ADM) (airports) and the COMANAV (river shipping). The restructuring of
these public enterprises is a component of the medium-term strategy for the transport sector. The
object of the strategy is generally two-fold: (i) to make these enterprises commercially viable, and
(ii) to terminate government financial assistance to their operations.
2.6    The restructring plan of the COMANAV was decided upon by the Government on April 28,
1993 and it is now under implementation. It is based on privatizing its metal construction and other
auxiliary activities, as well as converting its river transport activities to a smaller-scale commercial
operation. The Govermnent wiUl expedite presentation of the findings of the ongoing studies
concerning ADM's management set-up and its conversion into a mixed-capital company with
substantial management autonomy.
2.7   In the future, the Dakar/Bamako rail corridor will face increased competition from the
Abidjan/Bamako road link for international freight traffic, RCFM's main market. The railway will
play an essential role in the Malian transport system only if the competitiveness of rail transport and
its quality of service can be substantially improved, and transport costs, reduced. Improving the



5
financial performance of RCFM is also required for sustainably suppressing all Government financial
operating contributions (except for possible compensation to cover public service obligations). The
key actions which will be taken to achieve these objectives are: (a) restructuring RCFM into a fully
commercial enterprise; (b) implementing a staff rationalization program; (c) significantly enhancing
commercial and operational integration of international freight services provided by RCFM and
SNCS; and (d) selectively rehabilitating infrastructure and improving operational efficiency.
2.8    RCFM's staff decreased slightly from 2400, in 1988, to 2300, in 1992, but despite continuous
improvements in staff productivity, it remains largely overstaffed.  Unit staff costs increased
significantly in 1991 and 1992 due to the Government's decision to increase wages. The total staff
cost/revenue ratio, which was very favorable in 1989 (19%), deteriorated accordingly (29% in 1992).
It is now reaching a point beyond which RCFM's financial situation would be seriously jeopardized.
Telecommunication facilities are defective and hinder operational efficiency. The track needs to be
selectively rehabilitated. Freight terminal facilities in Bamako are inadequate. Improvement is also
needed in locomotive maintenance and utilization, as well as in wagon control. Substantial progress
has been achieved in RCFM management's commercial approach to railway activity, and this process
has been enhanced by a contrat-plan covering the 1992/1993 period. The main obstacle to improving
the competitiveness of the Dakar/Bamako rail corridor in international freight transport is the
insufficient and ineffective cooperation between RCFM and SNCS in the fields of marketing,
commercialization and traffic organization.
2.9    Rail and road transport enterprises have evolved in different directions over the last decade.
If the efficiency of international rail transport has improved considerably, road transport continues to
suffer from excess capacity due mainly to the acquisition of additional trucks for the purpose of
transporting food aid during the severe drought of the mid-1980s. As a result, transport prices have
been falling steadily for several years to the point that they now cover only a fraction of the
operators' true costs. This prevents any modernization of the fleet, and leads to overloading practices
that severely damage the road network. Thus, the road transport industry is experiencing a serious
crisis. Surface freight transport is characterized, first of all, by excess fleet capacity.
2.") Over the past two decades Mali has put substantial effort into the development of its transport
infrastructure, particularly its road network. Nevertheless, its road density remains one of the lowest
in West Africa, with 1.18 km of road per 100 kmin, compared to 3.1 for the West African Economic
Community, the CommunautO Economique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (CEAO), as a whole. Inadequate
resources allocated to the maintenance of the road and rail networks, lack of rational programming,
and the inefficiency of force account routine maintenance have led to substantial maintenance backlogs
and have accelerated the deterioration of the existing network. IDA's Fifth Highway Project (Credit
1629-MLI) even devoted part of the Credit, until 1991, to the routine maintenance of the priority
network to reduce the cumulative backlog. The Letter of Transport Sector Policy signed in October
1990 and the examination of annual investment plans under the adjustment program slowed this
process.
2.11   Since the Road Fund was abolished in 1990, the actual resources allocated to routine road
maintenance (about US$4.6 million a year) have condinued to fall below the theoretical appropriations
set forth in the natonal budget, and far short of the real needs (estimated at US$7 to 8 million a
year), despite the large volume of govermnent revenues contributed by road users. Maintenance
scheduling, already inefficient, becomes very much a hit-or-miss affair under these conditions.
During the 1985-1992 period, total expenditures on the road ietwork averaged approximately US$32



6
million a year (1.4% of GDP). New construction represented 43% of that total, with rehabilitation
and periodic maintenance representing 37% and routine maintenance, only 20%. External financing
accounted for nearly 80% of the total.
2.12   Annual requirements to keep the existing road network in good repair-without any
expansion-are estimated at US$36 million (3.3% of the renewal value of the network, estimated at
US$11 billion), i.e., about the same level of road expenditures as over the period 1985-92, but with
projected maintenance expenditures that are 70% higher. Preventive periodic maintenance is essential
to protect the paved network. In the DGTSP, Goverment undertakes to limit investments in the
1994-98 period to those provided for in the project and it will allocate the following minimum annual
amounts (calculated aftei devaluation) to the routine road maintenance budget:

2.13 The major element of the strategy concerning financial relations between the Government and
the transport sector pertains to the recovery of infrastructure costs. The objective is to ensure, over
the medium term, that infrastructure maintenance and renewal costs are borne entirely by users, each
in proportion to the cost generated by its infrastructure us.
MI. LESSONS LEARNED AND RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT
A. Previous IDA Operations in the Sector and Lessons Leamed
3.1 In just under three decades, IDA has financed five highway and three railway projects for a
total of (current) US$130 million.  The implementation of all these projects was marked by
administrative sluggishness, procurement delays, slow disbursements, insufficient resource allocation
for routine maintenance, inefficient execution of works by force account, payment delays to
contractors, and poor programming of investments and works. A tendency to favor new investments,
often with inadequate rates of return, over maintenance has been persistent throughout the period.
3.2    The most salient lessons from the ongoing Fifth Highway Project are the following:
(a)    procurement delavs have been the single most serious problem;
(b)    maintenance performed by force account was lower in quality, but higher in cost than
if the works had been contracted out to the private sector;
(c)   it has been difficult to get an accurate picture of the cost of force account works
because Government did not keep adequate project accounts;



7
(d)   the issues of rural roads and the environment were not explicitly addressed;
(e)   the cost and price of transport decreased, especially for international traffic, but these
savings were not passed through in the reduction of prices of consumer gocjs;
(f)    project-by-project efforts to develop a more rational approach to investment planning,
to strengthen institutional capabilities and to improve sub-sector performance have had
little success; and
(g)    donor coordination has been weak and little synergy has developed.
3.3   These past experiences have been translated into the design of the proposed project as follows:
(a)    Design of a transport sector program which places transport development in a policy-
based, sect3r-wide framework developed by the Government and supported by all
donors. Government and IDA cooperated closely in carrying out joint sector work to
analyze issues and devise action plans for restoring sector efficiency. The Government
then called a meeting of donor agencies to discuss the strategy and solicit donor
agency support for implementing it over the next five-year period;
(b)    The necessity of implementing polica  reforms through a coordinated investment
Program.   This keeps the focus on the broad sectoral and development
objectives-particularly where economic and financial ministries are concerned-to
resolve critical issues related to sector financing and strategic policy-seting on issues
such as restructuring public enterprises and increasing the role of the private sector.
The proposed program and project investments are geared directly toward attaining
the goals set out in the DGTSP; and
(c)    The need to carefully define the mechanics of resource allocation for routine
mnaintenance and to ensure quick payment of local contractors, if the development and
strengthening of the role of the private sector is to succeed. This requires the
reorganization of the public administration and a revolution in the way of thinking in
public works construction and in the provision of transport services. The proposed
project foresees the establishment of an autonomous account in a commercial bank for
routine road maintenance managed by the Direction Nauionale des Travaux Publics
(DNTP), and the execution of works by private sector companies under delegated
contract management, notably to a private agency, AGETIPE-Mali.
B. Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.4   The reform program launched by the Government in the transport sector calls for support to
improve the sector's efficiency in order to reduce transport costs, help make the Malian
economy-paricularly the export sector-more competitive, and stmulate the development of
agriculture by opening up isolated rural areas in coordination with the Ministry for Rural
Development. The institutional reforms proposed are geared toward modernizing and streamlining
the administration, withdrawing it from management and execution of works and provision of
services, and strengthening its investment planning, programming, and supervision capabilities. The



8
new orientation aims at strengthening the role of the private sector, both in the transport industry,
where administrative constraints will be eliminated, and in public works, where the proposed
measures will foster the development of local contractors and engineering firms.
3.5     Considering Mali's resources, external aid is needed to successfully implement the reform
and investment program. With its long and extensive experience in the transport sector, IDA's
participation would be essential to assisting Government in coordinating the contributions of all
donors in the framework of a sectoral program that includes priority projects offering reasonable rates
of return, together with support for reform measures.
IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Program and Project Objectives
4.1    The proposed Transport Sector Program was designed to tackle the persistent problems of
Mali's transport sector by replacing the earlier, and consistently unsatisfactory, project-by-project
approach with a sustainable framework for implementing a coherent, sector-wide development
strategy. Thus, the proposed program pursues a continual process of sound sector policy making
translated into rational investment decisions tied to Mali's macroeconomic background and absorptive
capacity. In selecting the sector program approach, a choice had to be made between a smaller,
single subsector project versus an all encompassing sector-wide operation. Because of the need to
develop a rational sector development strategy, and to reduce distortions within the sector, both in
terms of investment planning and resource allocation, the latter option was chosen. In the Mali
context, a subsector project approach could neither achieve the required fundamental sector reform,
nor could it meet the criteria of sustainability. It has led Government to elaborate its Declaration of
General Transport Sector Policy, which constitutes the framework for the program supported by the
IDA project and by those of the other donor agencies active in the sector.
4.2   The methodology used in designing the sector program included the following steps: (a)
preparing a thorough analysis of all subsectors (Transport Sector Memorandum) in close association
with the TSC and the Govermment to arrive at a broadly internalized consensus on sector issues and
the need for change; (b) combining sector analysis and strategy development with project preparation
missions using the seminar approach to attract multi-disciplinary groups from the Government, as well
as private sector representatives, focussing on the need for a new sector development strategy and the
formulation of policy measures to implement it; and (c) forging alliances within the donor
community, heretofore uncoordinated, and between donors and Government, to adopt a common
approach to a balanced sector development in order to ensure consistency between strategy and
program financing.
4.3    The principal program and project objectives are:
(a)   to strengthen the sector management and performance through reorganization and
local capacity building;
(b)   to restructure the transport sector parastatals;



9
(c)   to modify the regulatory and institutional ;ramework in order to promote increased
private sector participation in tne provision of services and execution of works;
(d)   to rehabilitate and maintain a priority network of transport infrastructure; and
(e)   to improve the efficiency of transport operations and reduce transport costs.
B. Program and Project Description
4.4   The proposed program is designed around the Government's five-year (1994-98) program of
scctoral reforms contained in the DGTSP, supported by a parallel donor-assisted progran of
investment. Since existing infrastructures do not have any capacity problems, the investment program
focuses essentially on their conservation and consolidation. The program has four components:
(a)    a capacity building and traiing  conmonent focusing on  support for the
implementation of sector policy measures, the modernization of sector administration,
and the reorganization of transport services. This component will be fully financed by
IDA;
(b)   a road component to finance a five-year program focusing on the rehabilitation, and
routine and periodic maintenance of a priority network accompanied by environmental
actions, improvement of rural tracks, purchase of ferries and equipment for rouine
road maintenance, and improvement of Bamako's main urban roads system. This
component will be cofinanced by donors. The IDA project will finance some 19% of
this component;
(c)    a railway component designed to help the Govermment and RCFM  implement the
program to restructure the railway business and put it on a more commercial footing,
and finance a five-year investment program, focusing mainly on improving traffic
safety and preserving existing assets. The IDA project will finance some 28% of this
component; and
(d)   an airport component to finance safety equipment for the Timbuktu and Bamako-
Senou airport and various studies. This component is fully financed by other donors.
Capacitv Building and Trainin Comlonent (US$5.6 million, fully financed by IDA)
4.5   In light of the poor results obtained under earlier road and railway projects in the area of
development of the Government's management capacities, the project puts particular emphasis on
capacity building. In accordance with recent regional directives, technical assistance and training
needs have been carefully reviewed. The technical assistance program is based on the following three
basic concepts: (a) external support will be provided by short-term consultants who will assist with
work program organization and prenaration, carry out technical tasks that the local personnel are
unable to perform by themselves, monitor the performance of other tasks, and provide advice and
guidance when necessary; (b) groups of local and external consultants will be encouraged to bid
jointly, particularly for studies, with a view to developing capacities in the Malian private sector.

Agreement was obtaied dwing negotatons that all executing agencies will have adequate
counterpart staff in place before the begining of any technical assistance assignments (para. 5.3(a)).
The summary of estimated consulUing services is presented, in staff-month, in Table 4.1 below,
including studies, training (Centre de Perfectionnement des Transports et des Travaux Publics -
CPTP) and project audits:

4.6    Modendzaton of Sector A     aton. The lack of sufficient resources and expertise on
the part of the two main Directorates responsible for administering sector activities-the Direction
Nationale des Trnsports (DNT) and the DNIP-has led to weaknesses in sector management and
inadequacies in the sector's store of scientific knowledge (insufficient and incomplete statistics).
Resource allocation has been dominated by political choices, or choices of donors, rather than by
economically-dmied priorities. The sector approach adopted for this project is geared towards
the development of Mali's programming capacities. The definition of a clear strategy and an optimu
investment program reflecting the macroeconomic framework is expected to ensure not only a more
rational use of scarce resources, but also an improved coordination of external aid.
4.7   Investnt gig          . It was confirmed during negotiations that investments in the
transport sector would be limited to those included in the program adopted by the Government and
specified in its January 4, 1994 letter. All actions not included in the program would require prior
approval from IDA. Throughout the period of program execution, the Government will prepare and
submit to IDA and all co-donors by July 15 of each year at the latest, a rolling three-year investment
program for the transport sector, ranking projects according to their relative economic prority, and
taking into account the Govermnmet's infrasuc     maitenance capacity and the financial capacities
of the Govermment and/or its relevant agencies and enteprises (para. 5.3(b)). Delivery to IDA of a



11
letter confirming Government's five-year transport sector investment program was a condition of
Board presentation (para. 5.4(a)). Each annual program will subsequently be adopted by the
Government in agreement with the donor community.
4.8    The technical assistance to the DNT (capacity building - 27 person/months) will help
strengthen its general studies and planning capacity, and develop its role as transport monitoring
agency through reorganization and computerization of DNT's units. It will help in:
(a)    setting up a monitoring unit, charged with establishing and maintaining a transport
data bank, and to train the unit staff;
(b)    re-registering the vehicle fleet and computerizing vehicle registration (gray card) files;
(c)    organizing and carrying out information and sensitization campaigns oriented toward
freight carriers on a series of sector-related issues;
(d)    reviewing the Traffic Code and promoting the adoption of its implementing
regulations (transport of hazardous materials, special convoys, road signs, penalties
for violations, etc.), road safety and user sensitization campaigns, providing
instruction on the Highway Code in schools, specialized training for driving school
instructors and driving test examiners; and
(e)    acquiring miscellaneous office equipment (computers, photocopiers, etc.).
4.9    The consulting services for studies (34 person-months) will cover the following:
(a)    analysis of the legal framework governing transport, and revision of the road-user
taxation system to improve the recovery of road infrastructure maintnance and
renewal costs. The studies will be carried out during the first year of project exewtion
effectiveness; study recommendations will be reviewed with IDA and implemented, as
agreed, no later than two years after credit effectiveness, as confirmed during
negotiations (para. 5.3(c)); and
(b)    other studies, to be mutually agreed with IDA, and preparation of a future project.
4.10   In addition, a vehicle inspection program will be set up. Inspection is to be contracted to one
or more private finrs accredited by the Ministry of Transport; they will be paid with proceeds from
vehicle inspection fees. The TOR and a list of vehicle inspectors acceptable to IDA were delivered as
conions of negotiations.  The signing of a contract with the consultants hired to provide the
technical assistance mentioned in 4.8 and 4.9(a) above is a condition of effectiveness (paras. 5.5(a)
and (b)), while the signing of the agreement(s) with the firm(s) responsible for vehicle inspection is a
condition of disbursement of the DNT technical assistance subcomponent. Agreement was reached
during negoftations that vehicle inspections will be carried out by independent private firms in
coordination with the re-registration exercise (para. 5.3(d)), that it will be launched no later than six
months following credit effectiveness, and that the first vehicle inspection campaign will last for at
least two years, until re-registration of all of the existng vehicle fleet is completed. Vehicles not
meetng the technical inspection reqirements will be taken out of circlaon and placed on a



12
temporary three-month registration to allow time to make the necessary repairs. If the vehicle does
not pass inspection a second time, the registration will be permanently withdrawn.
4.11 The assistance to the DNTP (capacity building: 20 person-months) will focus on two aspects:
(a) DNTP's internal reorganization, which will cover the overhaul of its accounting systems and
computerization, installation and testing of the new accounting system, and training of DNTP staff
(..apacity building); (b) setting up of road network management systems, organization of its network
management unit, and establishment, testing and maintenance of a road data bank, and an investment
programming system. TOR and a short-list, acceptable to IDA, for this technical assistance were
delivered as a condition of negotiations. A technical and financial audit of the Centre National de
Recherche d'Experimentation pour le Btiment et les Travaux Publics (CNREX) will be carried out
with a view to its reinforcement. An inventory of rural roads will be taken and will include a
definition of their status, the services responsible for them, the method of financing their
maintenance, and their construction and maintenance standards. The consultants will assist in the
purchase of computer equipment and vehicles required for the restructured directorate, as well as in
the purchase of axle weighing equipment.
4.12   The training subcomponent covers support for the operation of CPTP, estimated at 36
person-months of expatriate experts and 80 person-months of local personnel for courses given
locally, plus some specific short-term training courses abroad within the framework of a training
program intended both for administration staff and private contractors' personnel (see Annex 4 on
provisional training program from a study, which was carried out in late 1993, to determine the
sector's training needs with overall training program, detailed by specialty and modules, local training
and training abroad, training centers identified, costs, etc.). Specific seminars on environmental
aspects will be organized for those involved in the road subsector, particularly for regional directors
and chiefs of local authority subdivisions. As agreed during negotiations, CPTP will be allowed to
train staff from the private sector in transport sector specialties not taught in other centers in Mali
(para. 5.3(e)).
4.13   The local Project Coordinator will be provided with technical assistance during project start-
up to develop the monitoring system for the Sector Program and ensure its satisfactory launching; he
will also receive logistical support. The signing of a contract for this assistance is a condition of
effectiveness (para. 5.5(a)).
Road Component (US$208 million, of which US$40 equivalent is IDA-financed)
4.14   The road component is, by far, the most important under the program and covers five
subcomponents. The first of these is routine mainenance (US$33.7 million) for the priority network
of roads, covering a total of nearly 9,000 km, is financed mostly by the Government.  The
Government will allocate the necessary resources as indicated in para 2.12 and guarantee their
availability by paying them monthly in advance into a separate account opened in a coinmercial bank
in the name of, and managed by, the ministry responsible for roads. This account was opened as a
condition of negotiations. The delivery to IDA of an "arr&e" modifying the Arrete creating the
routine road maintenance special account was a condition of Board prese on (para. 5.4(b)). This
component will be executed mainly by private contractors (75% at least), with only a small part
carried out by force account (25%), as indicated in the DGTSP. Contract management for al
routine road maintenance to be carried out by private contractors will be delegated to a private



13
agency. This agency will be governed by the terms of an agreement to be concluded with DNTP and
by a procedures manual, both of which must be acceptable to IDA. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that routine maintenance is to be handled by delegated contract management for the
entire life of the project. The delegated contract mnanager, at least during the first two years of the
project, will be AGETIPE-Mali (para. 5.3(f)).
4.15   The second subcomponent concerns the periodic maintenance (US$52 million) of 778 km of
paved roads, 819 km of earth roads and 615 km of classified tracks, and the rehabilitation (US$66
million) of 383 km of paved roads, 857 km of earth roads and 660 km of classified tracks in the
north. The works will be carried out entirely by private contractors; priority will be given to the
paved network to ensure that it is safeguarded and consolidated. The IDA project would finance
periodic maintenance/rehabilitation of 413 km of paved roads and 188 km of earth roads estimated to
cost US$25 million or some 20% of this subcomponent.
4.16  The third subcomponent consists of the construction of about 500 Ikn of rural tracks and
the procurement of four ferries (US$14 million) to serve zones that presently lack reliable road
access. These tracks, located outside the present major agricultural project areas such as those of the
Campagnie Malienne de D&veloppement des Textiles (CMDT), or the Office du Niger cotton zones,
will be constructed to open up regions that are underserved, but which possess agricultural potential
that they have the ability to develop.  Lhe communes, or other beneficiary authorities, will be
equipped under the project with non-mechanized small-scale routine maintenance equipment financed
by the Government to maintain the tracks. The communities concerned could participate in the
construction works, for which labor-intensive methods may well be competitive, following the recent
change in CFAF parity; the choice of subprojects was made in coordination with the Ministry of
Rural Development. The IDA project will finance 123 km of rural tracks (US$3.0 million) and the
procurement for two ferries (US$1.3 million) or some 28% of the cost of this subcomponent.
4.17   The fourth subcomponent concerns the implementation of specific works to improve the
environent and safety along the roads improved under the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation
subcomponent (planting, improvement in villages, safety, etc.). The amount of this subcomponent is
about 5% of the periodic and rehabilitation program (US$5.9 million-IDA financing: US$1.3
million).
4.18   The fifth subcomponent comprises improvement of the Faladie-Pont des Mas road and
its connection with the new bridge over the Niger River in Bamako (US$23.8 million). This project
was approved and financed before the adoption of the DGTSP; IDA will not participate in the
financing of this component.
4.19 The sixth subcomponent covers studies, supervision and delegated contract management
(US$8 million) in connection with the road works under the project. IDA will finance 36% of this
subcomponent (US$2.9 million), covering the AGETIPE delegated contract management and the
engineering studies and construction supervision of the subprojects financed by IDA.
4.20   The seventh subcomponent finances equipment and parts (US$5 million) for routine road
maintenance. The equipment will be procured by or for the new equipment rental company. IDA
will not participate in the financing of this subcomponent.



14
Rail ComRgnent (US$32.5 million, of which US$10.2 million equivalent financed by IDA)
4.21   The program supports a major effort to restructure RCFM, with the main objective of putting
its operations on a financially sustainable commercial basis and eliminating the need for any
operational subsidies. Details of the restructuring policy are described in Annex 5. It will be
supported under the project through the execution of the 1994-98 tranche of a longer-teiim investment
program (US$53.57 million) agreed on between RCFM and the donor community. The investment
program is technically sound and economically justified. It covers (a) studies and technical assistance
financed by IDA (US$0.70 million); (b) infrastructure improvements (track rehabilitation and freight
terminal - US$21.5 million; IDA financing: US$9.5); (c) telecommunications (US$1.3 million); (d)
rolling stock (US$5.7 million); (e) miscellaneous logistical equipment (US$3.3 million). The rail
component will be financed by the Caisse Franfaise de Developpement (CFD), the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and IDA. IDA's contribution will finance studies and
technical assistance, construction of the Bamako-Korofina terminal, and the acquisition of ballast for
the track rehabilitation program.
4.22   The first subcomponent consists of studies, supervision of works, and short-term
consultancies (about 50 person-month) to improve traffic organization and set up new bodies to
facilitate technical and commercial integration of international freight and passenger services with the
SNCS.
4.23   The second subcomponent relates to infrastr  e rehabilitation and maintenance:  (a)
execution of the first tranche of a 10-year track rehabilitation program - this first tranche will focus
on those stretches of track in particularly bad condition where derailments are frequent; and (b)
transfer of the freight terminal, whose inadequate layout is the reason for the inefficiency and high
cost of its operation, from its present location in downtown Bamako to the Korofina site. This
transfer will free up high-value land in the center of Bamako for urban developmnent purposes, and
will also ease freight operations. Part of the cost of the new terminal will be borne directly by the
private sector (container terminal under construction, storage facilities).
4.24   The third component will involve the itrprovement of telecommunications systems through
the rehabilitation of the highly dilapidated existing network, and the imnprovement of operations
through the creation of a dispatcher/train radio network and a local radio network for the Bamako
area.
4.25   The fourth subcomponent, rolling stock, comprises (a) the acquisition of three shunting
locomotives (1,100 hp) to replace locomotives to be written off; (b) replacemnent of vacuum-braking
systems on part of the freight car fleet by compressed air-braking systems. The use of air brakes will
increase the safety of movement of heavy trains (those carrying petroleum products and containers)
and will prevent accidents such as the derailment that occurred in Bamako in early March 1993.
4.26 Logistical equipment, the fifth subcomponent, concerns: (a) rehabilitation of a tamping
machine, service railcars and small railgang cars for the maintenance of tracks and the
communications network; (b) purchase of minor equipment for track maintenance; and (c) equipment
and tools for the rolling stock shops and miscellaneous other purposes.



15
Aip_ort Component (US$7.8 million, fully financed by co-donors)
4.27   This component covers: (a) installation of safety equipment at the airport in the tourist city of
Timbuktu; (b) improvements in the Baniako airport consisting of fencing around the airport to prevent
people and animals from coming in and straying over the runways and other security measures; and
(c) studies of future programs for airports that could be implemented in the event of an acceptable
rate of return and a favorable macroeconomic context. The public agency ADM, in liaison with
ASECNA, will be responsible for the execution of this component.
C. Program and Project Cost and Financing
4.28   The total cost of the program, including routine road maintenance, is estimated at US$254
million, excluding taxes in Mali, and including physical but not fmancial contingencies. Of this, the
proposed IDA credit of US$65 million equivalent will finance 21% of the program, excluding duties
and taxes. The exchange rate used in the estimate is US$1 = CFAF 600; estimated inflation indices
are in Table 4.2. Program costs are summarized in Table 4.3 below, the IDA project costs are
separated out in Table 4.4, and a detailed breakdown by component is given in Annex 6. The
foreign exchange components are around 86% in the program (which includes the routine road
maintenance), and 92% in the project, the only local currency costs being for local personnel.

4.29   The portion of the IDA Credit relating to the rail component will be onlent by Government to
RCFM on the following conditions:
(a)   the track rehabilitation and studies subcomponents will be conceded to RCFM in grant
form; and
(b)   for other subcomponents, the amounts will be onlent at a 7.5% interest rate, with 10
years grace and a 20 year repayment period. The exchange risk will be assumed by
RCFM.
4.30  This arrangement will be covered in a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
RCFM. Signature of a subsidiary agreement acceptable to IDA, is a condition of disbursemet for
the railway component (para. 5.6(a)). A draft Project Agreement has been concluded between IDA
and RCFM.

Fiancin Plan
4.31   Following the donors' meeting in Bamako in mid-May 1993, a number of institutions have
declared their intention to participate in financing the proposed program. These include the Fonds
EuropEan de DEveloppement (FED), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), Canada, France and
Germany. Two credit agreements have already been signed with the African Development Fund
(FAD) and the West African Development Bank (BOAD) for construction of the Bamako urban roads.
The Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has also expressed interest in participating
in the financing of the project. All co-financing will be on a parallel basis, with each participating
institution managing its own subprojects in accordance with their respective rules. At present, there
remains a financing gap of US$20 million. Should the external contributions to program financing be
insufficient, the Government will increase its participation, or the road component in the outer years
of the program will be reduced accordingly. The financing plan is presented in Tables 4.5 and 4.6
below; they include financial contingencies.

4.32   As regards the financing of routine road maintenance, agreement was confinned during
negotiations that Government will:
(a)    make monthly payments to the separate routine road maintenance account to be
established in a commercial bank, (see para 4.14 above) managed by the ministry
responsible for roads, of the amounts agreed as necessary for routine road
maintenance execution (para. 5.3(g)(i)); and
(b)    ensure that funds necessary to pay in a timely manner for routine maintenance work
performed under delegated contract management are transferred by the ministry
responsible for roads into an account opened for the purpose by the agency serving as
delegated contract manager before start of works (para. 5.3(g)(ii)).
It was a condition of Board presentation that funds would be deposited into the special account for
routine maintenance (para. 5.4(c)).
D. Program and Project Implementation
4.33   The program will be implemented by the ministries responsible for finance, for transport and
for roads and by two independent agencies (RCFM, and ADM-ASECNA) under the supervision of
the respective donors. To facilitate successful implementation and good coordination among the
executing agencies and with the co-financiers, a Coordinating Committee composed of representatives
of the ministries and agencies mentioned above and the Chamber of Commerce will be formed to
oversee program execution. A Project Coordinator acceptable to IDA will be in place throughout the
project. The Coordinator will be provided technical assistance in the initial months following project
start-up to establish procedures for monitoring and follow-up, and for liaison and coordination with
donor agencies. The Coordinator will organize joint donors' meetings anually to agree on remedies
for any problems observed in project implementation. A formal mid-term review of the program
including all donor agencies will also be carried out (see para. 4.55). The Coordinator will assist the
executing agencies in handling procurement and disbursements procedures for the different donor
agencies. In addition, he will coordinate the documentation and reports to be prepared by each
executing agency, after which he will prepare the consolidated project progress reports. DNT will be
the executing agency for transport technical assistance, CPT? for training, DNTP for the roads
component and the relevant technical assistance, RCFM for the rail component, and ADM-ASECNA
for the airport component, under the supervision of the Direction Nationale de I'Aeronautique Civile
(DNAC).
4.34   For DNT, the vehicle registration, drivers' license and waybill administration systems will be
computerized in the first year following credit effectiveness. Vehicle inspection, subcontracted to
private agencies, will be carried out jointly with the re-registration of the automobile fleet and the
axle weighing exercise. The results of the first year's statistical survey will serve as a basis for
adaptation of the regulations covering violations and the respective penalties. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations that DNT will act on, and publish the results of, the vehicle inspection
no later than 18 months following credit effectiveness. Likewise, it will prepare the new regulations
covering penalties for violations. The new system of penalties will be applied starting the third year
of inspection (para. 5.3(d)). The results will also enable DNT to proceed at the end of the first year



21
with launching the study on the overhaul of the road-user taxation system, with a view to achieving
more equitable recovery of the road infrastructure costs imputable to different categories of users.
4.35   DNTP will be responsible for the road component (including the related technical assistance).
DNTP's accounting system and unit will be reorganized during the first year of credit effectiveness.
DNTP, supported by technical assistance, will set up and maintain a road data bank, and prepare the
annual routine and periodic maintenance programs and reports. The special credit account will be
managed by the ministry responsible for roads. The separate routine maintenance account opened by
the ministry responsible for roads, to which the Malian Treasury will deposit the allocations for
routine road maintenance, will be managed by DNTP. These deposits will be made monthly in
advance. The regional directorates will be involved in the programming process. They will also be
responsible for the implementation of the force account routine maintenance that is to be contracted
out.  The completion rates of routine maintenance work done under contract will be closely
monitored, with a view to ensuring that, at least, the minimum thresholds is respected. Experiments
will be done to check if the regional directorates can be entrusted with the responsibility of
supervising the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation work with the assistance of consultants. This
work will be fully cotitracted out. Agreement was obtained during negotiations on a technical and
fimancial audit of CNREX (with terms of reference (TOR) acceptable to IDA) to be performed on the
first year of credit effectiveness to determine the real capacities of this laboratory and the actions to
be taken to improve its efficiency (para. 5.3(h)).
4.36   Starting in the 1994 fiscal year, execution of the works, including those still carried out by
force account, will be by contract. Performance indicators, agreed upon during negotiations, will
be established and monitored by the management unit and the delegated contract manager (para.
5.3(i)). A price comparison and the quality of work of the two methods of implementation will be
made annually from the technical and financial audits of the special accounts of routine maintenance.
As agreed duimg negotiations, all technical studies for road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance
studies will need to be completed by the end of the second year of credit effectiveness (para. 5.3(j)),
so that priorities can be clearly identified, and investments optinized, within the framework of the
annual program reviews. All the other studies should be completed by the project's mid-term.
4.37   Consultants financed under the Fifth Highway Project are preparing legal documents for the
establishment of the public equipment rental company, that will manage operable public works
equipment former Societe a Materiel de Travaux Publics (SMTP) in a first phase which, if successful,
may lead to privatization of the compan,y over the medium term. The new company will rent out the
equipment both to the regional public works directorates and to private enterprises, charging all its
clients market rental rates. Agreement was obtained on the formal establishment of the SMTP as an
equipment rental company under conditions acceptable to IDA (new statutes, installation of its Board
of Directors, on the nomination of a company director, and on the adoption by SMTP's Board of
Directors of a business plan) as conditions of effectiveness (para. 5.5(c)).
4.38   RCFM  will be responsible for implementing the railway component. A Project Manager
designated by the Director General will coordinate implementation of the various subcomponents,
their supervision being the responsibility of RCFM agents. Adoption of RCFM's business plan and
new statutes acceptable to IDA, installation of its Board of Directors, and signing of the 1995-1997
contrat-plan, including the adoption by Government, within the three-year investment plan and in the
anmual budget, of detailed mechanisms to finance the program for staff cutbacks at RCFM, all
acceptable to IDA, are conditions of disbursement of the railway component (para. 5.6(b-e)).



22
Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the RCFM  will begin to implement its staff
reduction program no later than two months following credit effectiveness and the staff size will be
reduced to 1,700 at most by the end of 1995 and 1,500 at most by the end of 1998. The RCFM will
complete its staff reduction program no later than 1 months following credit effectiveness (para.
5.3(k)). The adoption by the Governments of Mali and Senegal of a joint action plan acceptable to
IDA for the technical and commercial integration of international freight rail transport services will be
a condition of disbursement of the component (para. 5.6(f)). The action plan will be monitored
quarterly.  The signing of service agreements (acceptable to IDA) between RCFM  and the
Govermnent for the operation of domestic passenger services under a public service obligation scheme
and amounts for corresponding to RCFM have been provided for in the Government budget (para.
5.6(g)).
4.39   ADM-ASECNA will be responsible for the implementation of the airport component-both
the infrastructure and the safety equipment subcomponents-supported by technical assistance as
required.
4.40   CPTP will implement the training subcomponent. The detailed annual programs prepared
under the study for the transport sector training needs (1993) will be reviewed annually; it will be
submitted and agreed on with the donors and IDA every year by July 15 at the latest. The first-year
program was agreed on during negotiations (para. 5.3(1)). The annual training program reports will
be submitted no later than August 15 each year. CPTP will be assisted by local and foreign teachers,
especially with courses targeting the private sector, carriers and public works contractors.
E. Project Sustainablity
4.41   The economic appraisal of the planned investments shows a 28% rate of return; tae existing
and expected revenues from road-user taxation and RCFM's billings cover all infrastructure costs, as
well as RCFM's operating costs. The sustainability of the project will be promoted by means of:
(a) institutional reforms to be introduced within the sector's administration to upgrade its planning and
management capacities; (b) reforms in transport regulations to allow the industry to develop;
(c) restructuring of the public enterprises to enhance their efficiency, and the passing on to users,
through the prices charged, of the full range of transport operating costs, including maintenance and
infrastructure renewal; (d) revision of the road-user taxation system to improve recovery of road-use
costs; (e) development of the Malian construction industry; (f) training and upgrading of sector
personnel; and (g) reduction of the annual infrastructure rehabilitation bill through introduction of
rational routine maintenance and preventive periodic maintenance.
F. r-rourement
4.42  With IDA assistance, Mali undertook a complete overhaul of its outdated and cumbersome
procurement legislation in 1992. A new and much streamlined framework is now in place, although
performance in applying it still leaves something to be desired. The legal framework for public sector
procurement consists of: (a) Law No. 90-06/AN-RM of February 19, 1990 creating the Directorate
General of Public Sector Procurement (Direction GCnfrale des Marches Publics); (b) Decree No. 90-
030/P-RM of the same date establishing the organization and functions of the abovementioned
Directorate; and (c) Decree No. 92-059/P-CTSP of February 14, 1992 establishing in detail the



23
responsibilities of all entities concerned with public sector procurement. The local competitive
bidding (LCB) procedures provided by the latter Decree are acceptable to IDA.
4.43    Procurement procedures and the corresponding amounts are set forth in Table 4.7 below:

24
4.44    All goods and works will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992). Contracts financed by other donors
will follow their respective guidelines. For IDA-financed contracts, the Bank's standard bidding
documents will be used for the project, and preparation of these documents is a condition of
effectiveness (para. 5.5(d)). All fixed price contracts will provide for an automatic price correction
factor due to delays in decision and exclusion of bid validity.
(a)    Civil Works:  all works under IDA financing will be procured by International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). Local contractors will be eligible for 7.5% domestic
preference as stated in Bank guidelines.
(b)    Goods: contracts for goods will be packaged for US$100,000 or more, and will be
procured by ICB. Contracts between US$50,000 and US$100,000 each are considered
small and unsuitable for ICB. They apply to small-scale procurement of vehicles,
computers, etc., which will be done through LCB and will not exceed US$0.50
million in total. Contracts less than US$50,000 each, up to an aggregate amount of
US$0.75 million, will be procured by International/Local Shopping Procedures, or
from the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office of UNDP. Procurement of
vehicles and computers will be handled by the Project Coordinator and evaluated by
the Committee fonned for that purpose.
(c)    Contracts or packages of contracts for the track rehabilitation subcomponent (railway),
estimated to cost an aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent of US$0.5 million,
shall not be awarded unless the financing of the rehabilitation of the Bamako-Diboli
track has been secured.
All contracts for goods, works and consultants will be reported quarterly as per the agreed format.
4.45   Review by IDA of invitations to bid, bidding documents and of proposed awards and final
contracts will be carried out as follows:
(a)    All contracts for goods and works estimated at $150,000 or more and contracts for
track rehabilitation will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures as outlined in the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992).
Where payments for such contracts are to be made out of the Special Account, the
two conformed copies of the contract, required by IDA should be furnished prior to
the first payment made out of the Special Account in respect of such contract;
(b)    For all contracts not governed by subpara (a), the terms and conditions of the contract
should not, without IDA's approval, materially differ from those on which bids were
asked or prequalification of contractors, if any, was invited. Where payments for
such contracts are to be made out of the Special Account, these procedures are
modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract, together with other
infornation required by IDA, shall be furnished to the Association;
(c)   the provisions of the subpara (b) do not apply to contracts on account of which
withdrawals from the Credit Account are made on the basis of statements of
expenditure; and



25
(d)   post review of contracts will be carried out on selective basis (one in four).
4.46 For all routine maintenance carried out by contractors and financed by the Government of
Mali, the delegated contract manager will follow the rules of procurement set forth in a procedures
manual adapted from the one used by AGETIPE-Mali, the executing agency for the Public Works and
Capacity Building Project (Cr. 2371-MLI). The procedures manual must be acceptable to IDA.
Force account routine road maintenance work will be perforned under sole-source "contracts" with
the regional directorates using model contracts prepared for the purpose. Performance indicators for
both types of execution will be established by the network management unit.
4.47  In order to successfully imnplement the program and the project, the Government may employ
consultants and experts whose qualifications, experience, terms of reference and terms of employment
are satisfactory to IDA. Such consultants and experts will be selected using principles and procedures
satisfactory to IDA in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultmts by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency published by the Bank in August 1981. IDA
will proceed to prior review for (a) all consultant contracts above the equivalent of US$100,000 for
consulting firms; (b) terms of reference for all contracts; (c) single-source contracts; (d) contract
amendments valued at more than US$100,000 equivalent for firms, or those that raise the total
contract value above these thresholds; and (e) any standard documents that the borrower intends to
develop and use repeatedly. Contracts with consulting firms below US$100,000 each, will be
reviewed on a selection basis (one in three). All contracts with individuals will follow Part V of Bank
Guidelines.
G. Disbursements
4.48 The proposed IDA credit will be disbursed as shown in Table 4.8 below:

4.49   The IDA credit will be closed seven years after its signing; however, disbursements may
continue to be made during an additional four-month period for items executed prior to closing. For
contracts requiring prior review, the credit will be disbursed on the basis of approved contracts for
the works, equipment and technical assistance subcomponents. Disbursement percentages shown in
Table 4.8 above are net of taxes in Mali. Disbursements will be based on CIF or border delivery
prices for imports, and on ex-factory prices for locally manufactured goods.  To facilitate
disbursement, the Government will open a Special Account in a local commercial bank to which, once
the effectiveness conditions have been met, IDA will disburse an initial amount of US$300,000,
equivalent to the estimated expenditure level for a three-month period. This account will operate
according to procedures and condition, acceptable to IDA. It will be replenished monthly, provided
reimbursement requests have exceeded US$100,000 equivalent.
4.50   Requests for withdrawal of funds are to be accompanied by supporting documents, except in
the case of civil works contracts under US$150,000 and purchases of goods and equipment under
US$25,000, for which disbursements will be made upon submission of statements of expenditure. In
these cases, the supporting documents will be retained by the executing agency which will make them
available for examination by IDA supervision missions and external auditors.  Disbursements for
subprojects financed by other cofinanciers will be made in accordance with the rules of the respective
institution.
H. Accounting, Auditng and Reportng
Accountina and Auditing
4.51   MET will be responsible for the overall project financial management. Project accounting
centralization, including the review of withdrawal applications, will be subcontracted to a private
accounting firm acceptable to IDA, throughout the project. The structure of the financial management
system would be evaluated by the auditor who will confirm to IDA, during the first quarter following
the signing of its contract, that the system is satisfactory, as agreed during negotiations (para.
5.3(m)). The auditor would be responsible for any training of project accounting staff. The project
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. The Ministry will
prepare quarterly reports on project progress covering accounting, budgetary, and financial aspects
with contribution from the agencies involved in project execution.
4.52 The project accounts, including the special account, will be audited annually, in accordance
with international standards on auditing by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The auditor's
reports with the project financial statements will be submitted to IDA not later than four months after
the end of each fiscal year through the Project Coordinator who will manage the auditing contracts.
The signing of the annually renewable project audit contract and project accounting contract, and the
establishment of project accounting systems acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness (para.
5.5(e)). The TOR for audits were agreed on during negotiations (para. 5.3(m)). RCFM's corporate
accounts will be audited by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The audit of RCFM's accounts for
FY92 conducted by an auditor acceptable to IDA were delivered as a condition of negotiatim s. A
technical audit will be carried out in the second year following effectiveness.

Reporting and Monitoring
4.53   Each executing agency will submit to the Project Coordinator quarterly execution reports for
each program  and project component summarizing progress achieved, problems encountered,
solutions proposed, and changes or adjustments to be made. The Coordinating Committee will review
progress against plans and take appropriate corrective actions. Agendas and minutes of committee
meetings will be prepared by the Project Coordinator and transmitted to IDA and other donors to
facilitate program and project supervision.
4.54   The Project Coordinator will submit the following to IDA and other donors: (a) project
quarterly progress reports, including those relating to routine road maintenance covering accounting,
budgetary, financial, physical, and costing aspects with contributions from the agencies involved in
project execution; (b) annual financial statements for each of the sector's public enterprises, and the
annual balance sheet showing all project and program expenditures, including the annual special
account balance sheets; (c) annual investment programs, including road maintenance programs, as
specified in para 4.7; (d) an annual report on implementation of the measures included in the action
plans; (e) anmnal training programs and balance sheets; (f) annual technical assistance programs and
balance sheets; and (g) a project completion report within six months following the credit closing
date.
4.55  Implementation of the overall program will be supervised by the respective donors who wiUl
jointly review progress during annual donors' meetings organized by the Project Coordinator. The
IDA project will be supervised every three months. Supervision missions will consist of field trips to
review financial and management practices, bidding and payment procedures and local enterprise
participation, and the policy and implementation (particularly RCFM's restructuring).   An
implementation schedule, key indicators and a supervision plan are given in Annexe 7 (A-). It was
confirmed during negotiations that the investment program and key indicators will be reviewed
during the annual meetings, while a mid-term review will examine overall project implementation
and objectives reached (para. 5.3(b)). More particularly, the review will (i) monitor program and
project implementation, and performance of the agencies involved in program implementation; (ii)
monitor implementation of the RCFM restructuring action plan; (iii) update the road program taking
into account the degree of road deterioration and the results of the technical studies; (iv) discuss and
agree on additional steps required for improved cost recovery in the transport sector; and (v) discuss
and agree on an updated program financing plan, including all available cofinancing sources.
I. Environmental Impact
4.56   The proposed project is classified as a "B" project with limited possible environmental effects.
The Environmental Action Plan adopted by the Government in the DGTSP covers the key
environmental actions to be taken. An environmental analysis of the ongoing Fifth Highway Project's
impact was carried out with the assistance of a consultant; its recommendations have been
incorporated into project. It is expected that the project will have substantial positive environmental
effects by providing better conditions on major roads that will benefit the rural and urban population,
and by improving road drainage which, in turn, will limit erosion.  Second, the analysis
recommended that attention be paid to the design and execution of civil works to alleviate the
potential risk of disturbance caused to people and the natural environment, and proposed ways in



28
which the project can help improve the environment, with some minor additional outlays which the
project has provided for.
4.57   Environmnental disturbances that might be caused by the civil works during-or as a direct
consequence of-their execution will be addressed through appropriate detailed design work,
provisions in contract documents for work, and work supervision (Annex 8). Suitable safeguards will
be incorporated into bid documents and contracts for works to minimize potential environmental
damage caused by road works-especially those involving drainage facilities, deforestation, risks of
erosion, handling of anti-erosion planting, handling of camps and workshops following completion of
works, local improvements in villages, and safety. Little impact, oie way or the other, will occur
where road and rail track rehabilitation will follow existing alignments, with minimal effect on current
land use. Nevertheless, dumping of used engine oil into storm drains, sewers or watercourses, lakes
and ponds must be strictly prohibited by regulations to be adopted as a condition of effectiveness
(para. 5.5(f)).
J. Impact on Employment and Poverty
4.58   EmDlovment. The Credit will help create jobs in both urban and rural areas. The wage bill
distributed locally will come close to US$25 million (9% of the total program cost). It will cover at
least 4,700 jobs over five years (280,000 person/months). Other jobs will be created indirectly
through the promotion of small local firms to meet the increased demand that will be created through
the multiplier effects of the income generated by the Project.
4.59   Poverty. It is expected that at least 50% of the temporary jobs created, particularly for the
rural roads subcomponent, will be offered to unskilled workers. In addition, the geographic location
of several subprojects outside the major development areas will make it possible to reach people who
have not previously been able to benefit from government investment, reducing transport costs will
reduce the prices of basic commodities, facilitate the accessibility of these areas and the mobility of its
population.
K. Economic and Flnancial Appraisal and Risk Evaluation
4.60   The proposed investments covering Mali's entire transport sector under the program represent
1.8% of GDP, a slight increase ove- those executed during the 1987-92 period. They affect
practically all of the regions of Mali. The overall appraisal of the two principal program components
(road and rail, accounting for almost 95% of the program cost) yields an internal rate of return (IRR)
of 28%, more than double the discount rate adopted (12%). The airport component includes safety
equipment justified by the avoidance of risks that would otherwise be run by air traffic. The program
is also expected to produce indirect benefits (access to market and social facilities, improved export
performance etc.) that have not been quantified.
4.61   The road component has an IRR of 28% (see Chart 4.9). It has been optimized through the
selection of subprojects according to their IRR.  These rates range from  178%  for periodic
maintenance of the semi-urban road Koulouba-Kati to 12% for the last rural track included in the
program. The HDM Im model was used for appraisal of the subprojects. The methodology used was
to compare "with" and "without" project situations, assuming construction as scheduled under the
program and with a five-year postponement. Projected traffic growth was based on recent trends in



29
fuel consumption (average increase of 3% per annum) and in traffic over sections, where regular
counts are taken. No diverted traffic was taken into account, and induced traffic represents only 3 %
of existing traffic on paved roads and 10% on earth roads. The overall IRR of the road component is
28% for around 45 projects totaling US$190 million. This is a much more satisfactory program than
that initially proposed before appraisal and which would have yielded an 18% IRR, for a total cost of
US$280 million.  The rates of return obtained are 40%  for periodic maintenance, 31%  for
rehabilitation and reconstruction, and almost 16% for new construction (Bamnako's urban road system
and rural tracks). A traffic variation of plus or minus 20% results in a corresponding variation of
around 5% of the IRR, without actually changing project classification. A cost variation on the order
of 20% was applied for certain sensitive projects. The present net value of these projects remains
positive.
4.62 The rail component has an IRR of 23 %. The economic appraisal is based on the reduction in
rail transport costs with project, the overall gains to the economy derived from the use of the Dakar-
Mali railway instead of the Abidjan route, and lastly, the reduction of maintenance and accident costs
and the postponement of certain heavier investments. The hypotheses used assume a 10% tariff
increase starting in 1993. Fuel traffic would increase by some 15% per annum between 1994 and
1998; container traffic would increase by 10% in 1993 and by decreasing percentages subsequently,
going down to 1% in 1997; the other international and domestic freight traffic would remain at the
1993 level during the period; passenger traffic would go up by some 8% in 1993 in response to
coaches newly placed in service, but subsequently, the rate of increase would be no more than 0.9%
per annum. All the sensitivity tests carried out still yield rates of return higher than 12%. If traffic
growth was reduced by 10%, the IRR would drop to 17%. A 20% decrease in alternative road
transport costs results in an IRR for the railways of 19%. A 10% increase in rail transport costs
would result in an IRR of 16%.

4.63   The financial evaluation indicates that the production sold by RCFM will progress throughout
the period under review (1993-98). External consumption will remain stable and will represent less
than one third of production sold. The value added will grow at a pace a little higher than that of
business activity. Personnel costs will decline heavily and will represent no more than 31% of value
added, against 42%  at the start of the period (the payroll will be trimmed from 2,400 to 1,500
employees in four years). The gross operating result will increase from CFAF 2 billion in 1993 to
3.5 billion in 1998. The operating ratio will reach 0.80 in 1997 (0.87 in 1994) and the ratio of staff
costs to value added will decrease from 0.53 in 1994 to 0.34 in 1997.
4.64   The benefits expected to result from the airport component are in the area of improved safety.
Enclosure of Bamako airport reduces a present risk of having cattle on the runways with the distinct
possibility of a collision between an animal and an aircraft during takeoff. The consequences would
range from the pilot simply having to abort takeoff and start his run over again, to the plane suffering
damage to its landing gear, to the aircraft actually exploding. In Timbuktu, the airport facilities are
geared to the safety of traffic both in the air and on the ground (fire-fighting equipment, runway
lights, fences, generator set, etc.). The benefits in terms of safety are reinforced by the possibility of
increasing the number of hours of aircraft use, currently 130 flight hours per month for two planes,
or less than three hours a day per plane. Normal use on regional routes is six hours a day. The
expected benefits may be estimated by doubling the number of aircraft flight hours.
4.65   The principal project risks stem from the fact that the Government may not be able to
implement all the desired reforms in the sector, or to remove the obstacles to the mobilization and
allocation of adequate financial resources for counterpart funding, in particular, for routine road
maintenance. Second, Mali transport agencies' institutional capacity to manage the program is weak.
The devaluation impact will result in increasing transport operating costs; therefore, the
implementation of the revision of user taxation and transport prices will be difficult. These risks are
minimized by the strong ownership demonstrated by the Government during project preparation, the
fulfillment of all conditionalities, monitoring of the annual public investment programs, continued
coordination with the other financing institutions, strengthening of sector management through
reorganization and capacity building.
4.66   For RCFM, the main risk would derive from insufficient integration of international freight
services with SNCS. The Malian side is firmly resolved, at the country's highest level, to promote
such cooperation, which has become all the more important following the recent devaluation of the
CFA franc and the opportunities it provides for more competitive exports. To guard against the
danger of a possible deterioration in the situation, RCFM's international traffic will be monitored on a
monthly basis, and performance indicators will be established and monitored regularly.
4.67   The contracting out of routine road maintenance is likely to encounter a few pockets of
resistance, but the conversion of the SMTP into an equipment rental company, the anmnal
programming of the maintenance works, and the consequent allocation of the maintenance budgets,
will leave the regional directorates with no alternative concerning the free availability of equipment
and the availability of budget allocations for force account execution of maintenance work. The
delegation of contract management to AGETIPE-Mali will allow for the rapid development of
contract-based activity and the disappearance of the force account system over the long term.

Dear Mr Vice Presidents
In connection with implementation of the Mali Transport Sector
Project, I have the honor to enclose the Declaration of General Transport Sector
Policy dated November 2, 1993, the corresponding Action Plans and the investment
program.
The Government notes with great pleasure the constant support
furnished by the World Bank for Mali's development program and would be glad if
IDA were to help finance the important transport sector project. The project is
designed around a priority investment program for the period 1994-98 with an
estimated base cost of CFAF 75 billion (CFAF 79.75 billion with the North Region
projects).
The Government is ready to receive an IDA mission to Bamako, as
announced in Mr. Peter Watson's letter of October 15, 1993, to examine the issues
involved in implementing the transport sector project.
I thank you for your excellent cooperation, and tender the assurance
of my high consideration.

1.  INTRODUCXION
In 1982 Mali began implementing a series of economic stabilization
and adjustment programs which have received very special attention since 1988.
Action has been taken to deregulate commercial prices, simplify the regulations
governing economic activities, and implement reforms of customs tariffs, domestic
taxation and the public enterprises sector. The result has been to improve the
work climate in the government sector and lighten the financial burden
represented by the public enterprises. This in turn has allowed the Government
to devote more resources to the priority sectors and bring the public finances
closer to balance. Favorable climatic conditions in 1990 helped Mali achieve
better than projected economic results, with real GDP growth of 2.4 percent.
Major events in 1991 included the March demonstrations, the advent
of a transition Government on April 5, the holding of the National Conference
from July 29 to August 12, and the establishment, in consultation with Mali's
partners, of a macroeconomic framework designed to limit the repercussions of the
events of March on economic growth, the budget situation and the balance of
payments. Those events, combined with a bad agricultural season, led to a fall
in real GDP of 0.2 percent.
The year 1992 was marked by the adoption of the Constitution on the
occasion of the referendum of January 12, the holding of the municipal,
legislature and presidential elections from January to April, and the formation
of a new Government on June 9.
With the aim of limiting receipts losses, the Government put the
emphasis on rebuilding and strengthening the tax and customs administrations and
improving revenue collection.   In addition, a number of tax reforms were
implemented, designed to strengthen the.: isticity of the tax system, rationalize
and simplify customs tariffs and facilitL.-e issues and recoveries. A number of
measures were also taken to strengthen control and monitoring of the budgeting
process, abolish price controls and improve government organization.   The
Government continued to implement the Public Enterprises Sectoral Adjustment
Program (PASEP), a number of other sectoral programs and the public investment
programs (PIP) and public investment budgets (BSI), in order to gain better
control of public expenditure and investment.
Despite the difficulties caused by the fall in cotton prices, the
Government is determined to implement all the reforms included in the program and
to pursue a more prudent macroeconomic policy. The medium-term (1992-95) goals
are to deepen the structural reforms so as to improve the incentives to the
private sector, strengthen the management of public resources, develop human
resources and improve natural resource management, while contiauing to apply
financial policies aimed at reducing government expenditure.  This strategy
should stimulate economic growth over the period 1992-95.
The transport sector has a key role to play in this strategy owing
to Mali's landlocked situation, the dispersion of economic activities over its
vast territory, the rapid growth of the urban centers, the importance of its
foreign trade and its marked integration in regional trade flows.   Because
transport is such an important factor in Mali's development and economic
competitiveness, government policy is designed to enhance the sector's
operational efficiency in the medium term by intensifying the actions aimed at
developing competition between transport modes and enterprises on a sound basis,



- 43 -
Ann-x 3
Page 4 of 28
improving the condition of the existing infrastructures, especially those of the
road and rail networks, by applying a suitable maintenance policy, and continuing
the process of opening up areas that lack easy access.
The Government' action is designed, among other things, to absorb
the excess capacity of the road transport industry; raise the efficiency of the
international transport corridors; pursue restructuring of the transport sector
public enterprises; improve the collection of infrastructure user charges,
reorganize transport administration and infrastructure maintenance; and enhance
the safety of and improve responsibility for rural transport and tracks.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Malian economy, based mainly on subsistence agriculture subject
to marked climatic vagaries, depends entirely on imports and therefore on the
efficient functioning of its international transport systems for the procurement
of numerous strategic commodities (notably petroleum products) and consumer and
capital goods. Recourse to food imports even becomes a matter of survival for
Mali during drought periods of the kind experienced during the first half of the
1980s.   Efficient functioning of the international transport systems is
imperative also to enable Mali's exports--particularly of fiber cotton, its
leading export, which accounts for 85 percent of export tonnage--to compete on
the international market. The dispersion of activities across a vast territory
(over 1.2 million km2), the pronounced disparities in population densities, rapid
urban growth and the ensuing development of trade flows have also made domestic
transport of goods as well as passengers particularly important.  Transport
accounts for 20-30 percent of the cost of most essential products. Increasing
the future competitiveness of Mali's economy will depend in large part on
improving the operational efficiency of its transport system.
Over the 1970s and 1980s Mali put a substantial effort, with the help
of its development partners, into developing its transport infrastructure,
particularly its road network. Despite this, its road density remains one of the
lowest in West Africa. The inadequacy of the resources available for maintenance
of the road and rail networks and the inefficiency of the method used to execute
road works have created substantial maintenance backlogs and accelerated the
deterioration of the existing networks.
For their part, the various transport enterprises have undergone
contrasting evolutions during the last few years.  While the efficiency of
international rail transport has improved substantially, the road transport
enterprises continue to suffer from inherited over-capacity, due mainly to the
excessive addition of trucks to meet the very heavy demand for food aid transport
in the mid-1980s. The necessary capacity adjustments are hindered by attitudes
of various kinds with harmful consequences. The transport industry thus finds
itself in serious crisis. As regards air transport, in April 1992 Mali acceded
to the Yaound5 Treaty setting up the company Air Afrique.
Both the sector's recent evolution and its radium-term development
prospects reflect the structural adjustment policy initiated at the beginning of
the 1990s and since reaffirmed. Up to the end of the 1980s the transport system
was closely controlled by Government through the National Transport Office (ONT).
The marked rigidities inherent in this type of administration greatly impaired
its efficiency and boosted its cost to the Malian economy. Management of the
sector will henceforth be bised essentially on market mechanisms. The recent
abolition of the ONT and 'lie liberalization of transport tariffs constitute a
major step forward and are already allowing more flexible management of the
system. Competition between transport modes and enterprises nevertheless remains
generally insufficient.

III   T TRANSPORT SECTOR STRATEGY
A.    SteoDina UD Comoetition in Land Freight Trans2ort
The mechanisms of competition operate very imperfectly on both the
international and the domestic land freight transport markets. Supply and demand
adjustment, as well as that of prices, which do not reflect the true cost of
transport operations, are inhibited by protectionist measures taken by countries
of the subregion, distribution quotas for traffic among carriers within the
transit countries, and the "taking turns" (tour de r6le) system instituted by the
unions, which allows the less efficient operators to stay in the market.  To
remedy this situation, the Government proposes to implement a medium-term program
of measures designed to boost competition, under which it will inter alias
(i)   continue to encourage systematic recourse to tendering for all
large-load transport operations by public or semipublic agencies or
on Government's behalf;
(i)   undertake negotiations with neighboring countries, in the context of
regional integration, with a view to amending the provisions of the
freight transport agreements as soon as rehabilitation of Mali's
road transport industry has been completed;
(iii)   improve the system of economic and financial information to carriers
on the structure of the industry and transport conditions.  The
National Directorate of Transportation (DNT) will develop its
function of transport monitoring agency, in cooperation with
professional organizations, so as to make adequate information
available and easily accessible to all transport operators. This
information will cover inter alia available transport capacities,
past traffic trends, market structure and development prospects,
agreements with neighboring countries, and so on.
S.    Absorbina Excess Road Transport Ca2acitv
As a result of persistent excess road transport capacity, transport
prices have been falling steadily for several years, preventing any modernization
of the fleet and leading to overloading practices that seriously damage the road
network.  The Government therefore proposes to take a series of short-term
measures designed to absorb this excess capacity within a reasonable time and try
to limit overloading:
(i)   revision of the Highway Code (Code de la Route) and its implementing
regulations;
(ii)   a motor vehicle re-registration program;
(iii)   an ongoing vehicle inspection program, subcontracted to independent
private agencies set up under Malian law, approved by the Government
and independent of the carriers; the inspection program will be
conducted in conjunction with the re-registration operation,
(iv)   strengthening of the current truck-loading controls;



- 47 -
Annexu3
Page 8 of 28
(v)   a carrier sensitizing campaign;
(vi)   preparation of regulations for the punishment of violations, after
examination of the initial results of the programs referred to at
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above;
(vii)   implementation of the re-registration, vehicle inspection and axle-
load control operations by the agencies referred to at (iil) above;
(ix)   prohibition, for a transitional period of three years (renewable),
of the importation of all used heavy trucks (total laden welght ln
excess of 15 t) over four years old.
The Government will moreover retain the current liberal provlslons
with respect to entry into the transport business and will not lntroduce any
restrictive legislation. It will encourage the development, in the medlum term,
of appropriate mechanisms of bank financing of vehicle purchases which should
slow any growth in capacity not justified by satisfactory profit prospects.
C.    Imiroving the Efficiency of the International Transport Corridors
The Government will seek to reduce transportatlon costs ln the
immediate future essentially by improving the efficiency of the exlstlng
international transport corridors, and in the longer term by seeklng other
corridors that meet the objectives of improved access, competltLveness,
profitability and subregional economic integration. To that end the Government
will:
(i)   pursue effective implementation of the TRIE procedures in road
transit, in cooperation with authorities of the transit countries,
and ratify the road agreement concluded with Senegal last March;
(iL)   continue to simplify customs procedures, limiting pollce controls
and upgrading the skills and working conditions of inspection staff;
(iii)   facilitate the development of rail terminal facilitLes in the Bamako
area;
(iv)   abolish traffic schedulLng and the issuing of loading permits by DNT
and Malian Warehouses in the transit ports;
(v)   abolish the requirement that Malian goods translt through Malian
Warehouses in Abidjan, Dakar and Lome, and transfer those facilities
to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Mali or privatize their
management, restructure them or return them to the port authorities
concerned in exchange for special conditions of treatment of Mallan
freight, after evaluating the best alternatlves and renegotiating
the old agreements;
(vi)   continue the process of consultation and agreement with the regional
countries on the medium-term development of sea traffic organizatlon
and examine the impact of the current traffic distributlon system on
the sea transport cost borne by the Malian economy;
(vii)   directly manage national sea traffic rights not exerclsed by Malian
shipowners, pending the devisal of a regional solution.



- 48 -
Annex"3
Page 9 of 28
It is proposed to implemert these measures in the context of
negotiation with the transit countries of the conditions of treatment of Malian
freight with the object of facilitating transit and bringing it under control.
D.    Passenaer Transport
Urban and intercity passenger transport takes the form mainly of road
transit services provided by private enterprise on market terms. Despite the
crisis situation of recent years, passenger transit has undergone substantial
development. While the quality of the services offered is sometimes rudimentary,
they do meet the effective demand without any government contribution.   The
expected improvement in infrastructure conditions following upgrading of the road
network should stimulate private operators to put better quality vehicles into
service more quickly during the next few years wherever demand justifies it. The
sector will generally speaking continue to develop on the current bases, and
government action will consist of improving transport safety, chiefly by
introducing vehicle inspection, as already mentioned with regard to freight
transport, and through road accident prevention campaigns.
Z.   Rural Transoort
Rural tracks and rural transport are a key factor in developing and
opening up the rural areas. The Government will prepare an inventory of the
rural tracks network (whose length is probably close to 15,000 km), defining
their status, the services responsible for them, and the methods of financing
their maintenance and construction. The Government will also, in cooperation
with local authorities and with the support of its development partners, initiate
integrated access and agricultural development operations together with pilot
operations to assist local authorities to assume direct responsibility for rural
track maintenance. it will also seek to put new river ferries into service at
carefully selected crossing points in order to further facilitate local access
and facilitate trade flows.
Ferries located on classified roads will be transferred under
concession to the SMTP, which will operate them autonomously on a commercial
basis.
F.    Air Transoort
Air transport demand is growing rapidly in Mali in both international
and domestic traffic, supplementing the land transport modes, particularly in
areas that otherwise lack reliable access. This trend is sharpening with the
development of tourism, a significant source of foreign exchange.
Following the dissolution of Air Mali and the joining by Mali of the
multinational company Air Afrique, the Government's current policy is geared to
promoting private enterprise and expanding regional cooperation under a national
civil aviation plan established under the aegis of the United Nations Development
Plan (UNDP) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The Government will also strengthen airport security in order to
combat traffic in drugs and other substances and terrorism.  It will give special
attention to safeguarding the existing facilities and equipment.
These operations will cover, essentially:



- 49 -
Annex 3
Page 10 of 28
(i)   airport infrastructures and the airfield equipment open to public
air traffic and handling domestic air trafficS
(ii)   radio-telecommunications and radio-navigation aidsl
(iii)   meteorology;
(iv)   air space and air traffic service;
(v)   personnel training.
0.    Restructuring the Transiwort Sector Public EnterRrises
Government withdrew from the road transport industry during the 1980c
and continues to be involved in transport services only through Mali Railways
(RCFM), Mali Airports (ADM) and lIali Shipping Company (COMANAV), which have the
status of public establishments. The Government will pursue restructuring of
these establishments, with a twofold purpose:   to convert them into firmly
commercial enterprises, and to terminate government financial assistance for
their operations.
Mali Railways (RCFM)
RCFM accomplished substantial management progress during the period
1986-90.   The quality of its services improved, with the result that it
appreciably increased its market share of international freight traffic. The
policy of stringency actively pursued, fox example in staff remuneration, enabled
it to post an operating surplus in 1990. The railway will continue to play an
essential role in Mali's transport system in the future; however, it will face
increased competition from the Abidjan-Bamako road transport corridor in
international freight transport, which accounts for much the greater share of its
operations. Developing railway traffic therefore calls for continued action to
boost rail transport efficiency and competitiveness, which will be pursued by
converting RCFM into a firmly commercial enterprise, managed autonomously in
accordance with competitive-sector principles and rules.
The restructuring measures to convert RCFM into a commercial
enterprise were defined in the 1992-93 RCFM contrat-plan.  They include inter
aliat
(i)   overhaul of the institutional framework for the railway sector
through adoption of a new "cahier des charges" and a new legal
status for RCFM to replace its current status of an industrial and
commercial public establishment and widen its management autonomy;
(ii)   action to rationalize RCFM's greatly excessive labor force and
overhaul its personnel statute and remuneration system;
(iii)   conclusion of agreement(s)  with the Government  for compulsory
operation, as a public service, of loss-making domestic passenger
services that the Government feels must be retained for reasons of
social policy and regional access;
(iv)   subcontracting of certain support activities to the private sector,
particularly  in  the  area  of  equipment  and  infrastructure
maintenance. Improving technical and commercial coordination with
Senegal Railways (SNCS) is another essential component of action to
boost international transport efficiency. To that end, RCFM will
work with SNCS to set up, in the first stage, a joint agency to



- 50 -
Annex 3
Page 11 of 28
manage and monitor the international wagon stock. The functions of
this agency could later be enlarged to include technical management
and marketing of international freight transport services on behalf
of the two networks. In international passenger transport, RCFN and
SNCS will seek to set up a privately-run joint affiliate in
association with external partners. Finally, in the longer term,
they will examine the possibility of unified operation of the two
networks with each Government retaining infrastructure ownership.
Mali ALrports (ADM)
Mali Airports (ADM), a public industrial and commercial establishment
(EPIC), manages Bamako-S6nou international airport and the country's domestic
airports.   New management approaches are currently under study,  including
conversion in the short term of Mali Airports into a mixed-capital company
endoi-ed with substantial management autonomy.
Mali shipping Company (COMANAV)
River transport plays a not inconsiderable role in freight and
passenger transport on the Xoulikoro-Gao navigable section of the Niger River.
It is provided partly by artisan launch operators and partly by Mali Shipping
Company (COMANAV), which also operates a shipyard and a cask- and drum-making
factory. Whereas the activity of the launch operators appears to be growing
steadily, that of COMANAV fell by half during the 1980s, while its operatintg loss
rose to a significant level. In addition to the internal management problems
inherent in its status of a public enterprise, the decline in COMANAV's activity
is due to the fact that its fleet is increasingly ill-adapted to navigation
conditions on the river. The activity of the artisan launch operators will not
merely be preserved but encouraged, and a river transport study will be conducted
to that end. Since large-scale works to improve the navigability of the river
involve heavy investments, in the future river shipping will be based
increasingly on light vessels. As for COMANAV itself, its restructuring will be
based on privatizing its metal construction and other ancillary activities and
converting its river transport activities to a smaller-scale commercial
operation. These actions to be implemented very soon.
B.   Finaeinag of the Tranasort Sector and Imorovinc  Infrastrueture Cost
Rcover
The policy of government withdrawal from the public transport
enterprises will lead in the future to abolition of all government financial
contributions to the execution of transport operations in the strict sense. The
sole exception will be possible contributions to compensate for government-
imposed public service requirements to operate structurally loss-making domestic
passenger services in isolated areas.
The major element of the strategy concerning financial relations
between the Government and the transport sector pertains to the recovery of
infrastructure costs. The Government will ensure, over the medium term, that
infrastructure maintenance and renewal costs are borne entirely by the users,
each in proportion to the cost generated by its infrastructure use.   The
Government will conduct a detailed study of sector financing and recovery of
infrastructure usage costs and take the appropriate measures.
In the particular case of rail transport, RCFM will bear the cost of
maintenance and renewal of the infrastructures it manages and pass the cost on
to users through its transport tariffs.



- 51 -
Annex 3
Page 12 of 28
Road transport taxation, which currently corresponds poorly to the
road infrastructure utilization costs generated by the various users, will be re-
examined with the object of improving infrastructure maintenance and renewal cout
recovery, particularly in the case of heavy truck and passenger transport
services.
Z.    Reoreanizing Road Infrastructure Administration and MaintenanceS
Mali's road network comprises some 15,000 km of roads, including
2,500 km of paved roads and 1,500 km of modern year-round dirt roads.  This
network is one of Mali's most important assets: its renewal value is estimated
at about CFAF 300 billion.   The heavy toll taken by heavy truck traffic,
particularly through the disastrous practice of overloading, and the
insufficiency of routine and periodic maintenance despite the efforts put in are
leading the Government to seek to remedy the situation by taking truly effective
action to combat truck overloading, improving and completely reorganizing road
maintenance and setting up suitable mechanisms to guarantee its financing. The
Government's policy in this field is spelled out below.
1.   A priority road network, on which maintenance is to be concentrated, was
defined recently with a length of about 9,000 km. Its annual maintenance
cost averages about CPAF 10 million. Regular allocation of the resources
for this purpose is an essential component of sectoral strategy.  The
Government will allocate adequate resources to ensure maintenance of this
network.
2.    The Government will reorganize the DNTP, which is currently responsible
for the entire road network except for certain rural tracks, in accordance
with the following principles:
(i)   The DNTP's headquarters administration will retain responsibility
only for general studies, general policy formulation, maintenance
programming and supervision.
(ii)   The local agencies will specialize in monitoring the road network
(setting up, updating and operating a data bank) and supervising
execution of maintenance works.
(iii)   Actual maintenance execution (including routine maintenance) will
eventually be entrusted almost entirely to private enterprises in
accordance with competitive procedures. The DNTP will be assisted
by a group of private consultants, provided with juridical status
and adequate operating resources and methods and possessing the
necessary expertise. The purpose of this formula is to obtain an
immediate improvement in the DNTP's operational efficiency and know-
how transfer to the benefit of Malian public- and private-sector
management staff.
The group will act as Project Authority for management of the
network and the programming of both routine and periodic maintenance
and as Delegated Contract Manager for routine maintenance and in
technical assistance for other works.
3.   Aware that the success of the new maintenance policy depends on the
development of private enterprises capable of performing the maintenance
work efficiently, the Government will facilitate lifting of the
constraints under which they operate by:



- 52 -
Annex 3
Page 13 of 28
(i)   relaxing routine maintenance contracting procedures and ensuring
rapid settlement of invoices;
(11)   giving medium-term work-load guarantees.
4.   The Government will open a special account at a commercial bank into which
the routine maintenance appropriations will be paid and which will be
regularly replenished by the Treasury. The account will be managed by the
DNTP in order to expedite payment for routine maintenance work.
S.    The Public Works Equipment Section (SMTP) will be converted into an
autonomously managed equipment-leasing enterprise to mako it more
efficient and provide access by private works enterprises to equipment
under optimum conditions. -he future enterprise will be privatized in the
medium term.
6.    The Public Works Refresher Training Center (CPTP) will also reshape its
activities to meet the private enterprises' training needs, in addition to
those of the Administration.
7.   The Government will provide support for the DNT's activities through
objective-oriented technical assistance to help it strengthening its
general studies, planning, regulatory and control functions and its role
of transport monitoring agency.
8.   The Government will conduct a general reorganization study of the
ministries with public works and transport responsibilities and proceed to
modernize their services, for example through basic and refresher training
activities.

IV.  ACTION PLAN FOR T   OPERATION OF RNSPORT SERVICES
Introduction
The purpose of the present Action Plan is to identify and program the
measures that need to be taken to achieve the objectives of Mali's national
transport sector policy (apart from road infrastructures, rail transport, air
transport and environment, for which separate action plans have been prepared),
particularly with respect to:
(a)   stepping up competition on the land freight transport market;
(b)   absorbing excess road transport capacity;
(c)   improving the efficiency of the international transport corridors;
(d)   passenger transport;
(*)   restructuring COMANAV and ADM;
(f)   improving infrastructure cost recovery.
A.    Steoginc_ UP Competition on the Land Transaort Market
Among the proposed measures, the Government undertakes to:
(a)   continue to encourage systematic recourse to tendering for all
large-load freight transport operations by public or semi-public
agencies. A Transport Ministry circular will be sent to the heads
of these agencies and other ministerial departments instructing them
to include tendering for transportation of their goods in the
contrats-plans of the agencies under their supervision;
(b)   include in the functions of the reorganized National Directorate of
Transportation (DNT) that of "transport monitoring agency". The DNT
will be given technical assistance to help it set up information
systems and personnel training by the end of 1994. The terms of
reference of this assistance will be presented by the end of
December 1993 and the assistance will be put in place in mid-1994.
S.    Absorbing Excess Road Transogrt Ca3acitv
The Government will implement:
(a)   A detailed study of the status of the vehicle stock, particularly
its condition and capacity after completion of the vehicle re-
registration and technical inspection campaigns.
(b)   Revision of the Highway Code (Code de la Route) and its implementing
regulations. In addition, regulations will be drawn up concerning
the transportation of hazardous materials and special loads. This
revision will take place by mid-1995 at latest.



- 54 -
Annex 3
Page 15 of 28
(c)   A motor vehicle re-registration program.  Technical assistance will
be provided to help the DNT prepare for this campaign and to
computerize the vehicle registration data bank by mid-1994 at
latest. The terms of reference of this technical assistance will be
drawn up by the end of 1993. The vehicle re-registration operation
should be fully completed by the end of 1995.
(d)   A vehicle inspection program, wi_ h the first inspection operation
coordinated with the re-registration operation during 1994.  The

VI. RAIL TRANSPORT ACTION PLAN
The railway plays an essential role it. Mali's transportation system.
In international freight transport, however, it faces stiff competition from the
Abidjan-Bamako road link--competition will sharpen further in the next few years
as a consequence of, for example, the road infrastructure improvements. The
policy for the rail subsector included in the Declaration of General Transport
Sector Policy is aimed essentially at improving rail transport efficiency and
competitiveness by converting Mali Railways (RCFN) into a firmly commercial
enterprise competing actively with the other transport modes and enterprises.
The main guideposts of this conversion of RCFM into a commercial
enterprise were set forth in the 1992-93 contrat-plan between the Government and
RCFM. The activities already started will be developed further during the period
1994-96. An RCFN corporate plan for that period will be prepared during the
second half of 1993 and adopted by RCFM's Board of Directors by December 15, 1993
at latest. On the basis of this corporate plan, a new contrat-plan for 1994-96
will be negotiated with the Government and will enter into effect in March 1994.
The principal measures to be agreed on in the corporate plan or the contrat-plan,
as appropriate, concern the following topics.
A.    Institutional Framework
The new modus operandi in rail transport is defined by the RCFM
cahier des charges approved by Decree no. 93-254/P-RN of July 23, 1993. Under
a new legal status, yet to be defined, the railway enterprise will be given total
management autonomy. Whatever legal form is finally adopted, RCFM be given full
authority in contracting and in setting its personnel management rules. The
composition of its Board of Directors will include significant representation of
the business world.
B.    DeveloDment of Commercial Activities.  Obliaatorv Public Services
RCFM will step up its commercial activities in the profit-making
segments of rail transport and continue to abandon loss-making services and
activities. In the case of international freight transport, which is the leading
area of railway activity, RCFM and Senegal Railways (SNCS) will seek to set up
a joint marketing affiliate; special attention will be given to developing
petroleum product and container transport. In international passenger transport,
RCFM and SNCS will seek to create a privately-managed joint affiliate.
PCFM will henceforth operate only such loss-making domestic passenger
services as the Government requires it to provide, as a public-service
obligation, under an operating agreement providing for payment by the Government
of an adequate contribution to RCFM; this matter will receive special attention
during negotiation of the 1994-96 contrat-plan.
C.    Imorovina Cooperation Between RCFM and SNCS
Improving RCFM/SNCS cooperation, which is currsntly inadequate, is
essential to boosting efficiency and competitiveness in international freight
transport.  In addition to setting up the joint services marketing affiliate
referred to above, they will step up their cooperation in the areas of wagon
fleet management and movement of international freight traffic.

Annex 3
Page 24 of 28
D.    Staff Rationalization
The goal of the program of action to rationalize RCFM*s labor force
is to achieve staffs close to the target numbers by the end of the period. It
will therefore be carried out during the period 1994-98.   It will be based
essentially on measures to give early retirement and encourage voluntary
resignation by redundant staff. It will be supported by an incentive program
designed to encourage former railwaymen to set up private enterprises able to
assume responsibility for certain activities currently performed directly by
RCFM, which will be subcontracted.   A new RCFM personnel statute will be
introduced and the remuneration system will be revised to improve the incentives
to raise productivity and accept responsibility. Finally, a personnel refresher
training program will be developed. A staff rationalization timetable will be
set by common agreement. This timetable will take into account the investments
to be made in the subsector affected by this rationalization.
3.    Manauement Improvement
RCFM will continue the activities already started with a view to
improving internal management, especially with respect to rationalizing rolling
stock maintenance, redefining track maintenance policy, simplifying management
procedures, and the use of PC data processing. The program of subcontracting of
ancillary activities (when financially and technically justified), currently
under preparation, will be implemented.
P.    Investment Program
Total investment in the rail transport subsector is estimated at CFAP
15 billion. The amount adopted for the period 1994-98 is CFAF 10 billion.
0.    Financial  qauilibrium of RCFM
Subject to effective implementation of the financial restructuring
measures provided for in the 1992-93 contrat-plan between the Government and RCFM
and government financing of the staff rationalization program, RCFM will ensure
break-even in its financial management over the period 1994-98. The Government
will ask the donors to finance the staff rationalization program.

VIU . AIR TRANSPORT ACTION PLAN
1.   obiectiv-I
The three objectives of the action Plan for air transport are to:
-     open up domestic and external access to the country;
-     promote rational utilization of civil aviation through application
of the new Code of Civil Aviation, which was recently updated for
that purpose and adopted by the National Assembly;
-     effect the necessary remunerative investments to meet normal air
navigation and airport safety conditions.
2.    Mature of the Ooerations
These concern, essentially:
(i)   airport infrastructures and airfield equipment open to public air
traffic and handling regular domestic air traffic;
(ii)   radio-telecommunications and radio-navigation aides
(iii) meteorology;
(iv) air space and air traffic services;
{v)   personnel training.
Implementation of these operations calls for self-financing of the
air transport subsector through mobilization of its resources to create a
National Civil Aviation Fund intended to guarantee the loans to be obtained from
the donors. The Fund will comprise remuneration in the form of fees for the
various services provided by the administrative and technical agencies--National
Directorate of Civil Aviation (DNAC), National Directorate of Meteorology (DNM),
Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA), and
Mali Airports (ADM)--for which a levy on turnover could be charged by way of
participation in the Civil Aviation Fund.
3.    1994-98 3meraencv Plan
The  immediate  investment  requirements  concern  the  following
operations:
-     expansion and strengthening of runways and movement areas on Samako-
S6nou Airport;
-     airport safety (fencing of facilities and separation of arrival and
departure flows) at Bamako-S6nou, Mopti and Timbuktu airports;
-     facilitation  (upgrading  of  airports,  runway  euipment  and
refuelling, etc. facilities) at Bamako-S6nou and Timbuktu;

VIIIt ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
The purpose of the Environmental Action Plan is to identify the
principal measures that need to be taken in order to achieve the objective of
reducing the potential adverse impact on the environment of:
(i)   transport infrastructure construction and maintenance projectsl
(ii)   the operation of transport systems;
(iii)   transport safety facilities.
Mali is characterized by a substantial level of environmental
degradation  due  to  unfavorable  climatic  conditions,   desertification,
deforestation and population growth, particularly in the cities. These factors
have major repercussions on soil erosion and decline in soil fertility and
therefore on agricultural development and health. Transport systems play a
significant role in this environmental degradation.
The environmental protection action plan drawn up as part of MaliL's
National Transportation Policy defines and programs measures in the following
areas:

REUPtBLIC OF MALI
TRANSPORT SECrR PROJEC
RCFM Restructuring Action Plan
1.    The restructuring measures to convert RCFM into a fully commercial enterprise in active
competition with other transport modes and enterprises have mostly been defined in the 1992-1993
contrat-plan, and they are presently being prepared or implemented. They include:
(a)   "cahier des charges" of railway activity providing for full deregulation of
commercial railway services (complete freedom for RCFM to set service
configuration ard tariffs), granting RCFM full management autonomy and
clarifying its relationship with Government (transfer of ownership of rail
infrastructure to the State, general conditions of provision of public service
obligation services, etc.). The decree approving the new "cahier des charges"was
signed on July 3, 1993;
(b)   adopdon of a new legal status for RCFM (satisfactory to IDA) and appointment of
its new Board of Directors;
(c) signature and implementation of contracts for passenger services operated under the
public service scheme (contract signed on May 7, 1993);
(d)   divestiture of non-railway related activities (hotels) and contracting out to the privat
sector of support activides in the fields of infstructure and equipment mantnnce
(under implementation);
(e)   design and implementationof a staff rationalization program; and
(f)   By end 1993, RCFM has prepared a 1994-1998 corporate plan ("plan
d'entreprise") in coordination with SNCS. The plan will be adopted by RCFM's
Board of Directors. A 1995-1997 contrat-plan will be negotiated by RCFM with the
Government in the first quarter of 1994 and signed before the end of 1994.
2.   Total RCFM staff (pemanent and temporary staff) will be reduced from 2,600 at the end of
1993 to 1700 at the end of 1995 and to 1,500 at the end of 1998. The reduction of 1,100 in total
staff will be reached through the normal retiremeat of 250 workers and through early retirement
and voluntary departure of 850 workers. Implementation details of the staff reduction plan was
negotiated between management and RCFM s labor union by end 1993 and ageed on measures
will be included in the 1994-1997 corporate plan and contrat-plan. The staff reduction progam
will be financed by the Government, with possible participation of donors. The cost of ithe
program (early retrement bonuses and voluntary departure incentives) is tentatively estimated at
CFAF 2.0 billion. RCPM will adopt a detailed financing mechanisms and listing of co ding
expenses in the Government three-year rolling investment program and in the annual budget.
RCFM will implement its staff reduction program within 2 months following IDA credit
effectiveness. As part of the staff rationalization program, staff rules applicable to railway sta
will also be revised following the change of legal status of RCFM.

Annex 5    Page 2
3.    Enhancing significantly commercial and operational cooperation between RCFM and
SNCS is one of the key elements to improving the competitiveness of the Bamako/DAKAR rail
corridor. Despite some progress made in the recent past -- notably the creation of a RCFMVSNCS
joint office for the management of the wagon pool in June 1993 -- achievements have been
disappointing and a clear vision for the future associated with an action program is lacking. Such a
program should likely target for the medium-term an unified technical and commercial management
of the Dakar/Bamako link, possibly through the creation of a private operating company (Senegal
and Mali Governments keeping the ownership of rail infrastructure). Policy in this field has to be
set jointly by the Governments of Senegal and Mali. In the first quarter of 1994, a meeting
between the two Governments and the main donors interested in the Dakar/Bamako railway will be
organized to examine various institutional options for the future and prepare an action program.
An action program, satisfactory to IDA, will be adopted by the Governments of Mali and Senegal
before the end of 1994.
Traffic Projections
4.    The 1994-1998 Corporate Plan to be prepared by RCFM (in conjunction with SNCS for
international freight and passenger traffic) will detail traffic projections. Preliminary tffic
projections were agreed with RCFM during project preparation (Annex 14). In 1997, freight
traffic would reach 312 million lakm (285 in 1992) and passenger traffic 230 million passenger/km
(208 in 1992). These preliminary traffic projections assume that traffic levels during the period
will remain similar to those levels achieved during the last past years, except for (a) petroleum
products from Dakar, for which traffic would increase from around 50,000 tons to 100,000 tons in
1998, under the assumption that the railway would take advantage of the opportunities offered by
the recent deregulation of petroleum product distribution in Mali and that traffic organization would
be completely overhauled (under a scheme under definition by an IDA-financed consultant to
SNCS); (b) containers, for which traffic would increase from around 100,000 tons to 130,000
tons under 1998, thanks mainly to the commissioning of the new privately managed Bamako
container terminal; and (c) domestic passenger traffic, which would continue to grow at a rate
slightly less than population growth.
Financial Projections
5.    Financial projections have been prepared under the assumptioais of preliminary traffic
projections mentioned above. The main results are presented in the economic and financial
appraisal. The net income throughout the 1994-1997 period is positive; critical to achieving this
result will be (a) the effective implementation of the staff rationalization program; and (b) the ability
of RCFM management to contain the trend of unit wages at an annual increase rate not exceeding
3%. A firm agreement on these elements will have to be reached between RCFM management and
the railway labor union and embodied into the 1994-1997 RCFM Corporate Plan.
Perfonnance Indicators
6.   Two main indicators will be used to monitor Jie global performance of RCFM during the
project and will be included in the 1994-1997 RCFM contrat-plan: (a) the gross cas' flow
("r6sultat brut d'exploitation") and (b) the ratio of total staff costs/value-added ("ratio frais de
personnel totaux/valeur ajout6e"). Subject to revision following preparation of the 1994-1997
Corporate Plan, targets for these performance indicators are set as follows:

7.   Specific aspects of the technical, conmiercial and financial performance of RCFM will also
be monitored at the level of the railway enterprise, notably in the fields of locomotive availability,
reliability and utlization, wagon and coach availability and utilization, track maintenance,
operatons, staff productvity. A tentative list of indicators is presented in Annex 12B. The final
set of indicators, as well as annual targets, will be included in the 1994-1997 RCFM Corporate
Plan.

REPUBLC OFMALI
TRANSPORT SECTOR ]PROJECT
Environment Action Plan
1.    The environmenWal aspect was neglected by the transport sector. A change of attitude where
stdies are concerned wil be sought through the assignment of at least one person to the DNTP to
take charge o. enviromnental matters. His initial task will be to persuade sector authorities (whose
approach is viewed by Malian environmentalists as far from transparent) to be more responsive to
environmental concems and to help them address the environmental aspect in road projects as far
upstream as possible; to do this, they would be encouraged, when tanking projec'. works, to use other
criteria to supplement those based on purely technical and financial concerns. All studies will
accordingly include an environmental section, comprising not only an environmental impact
assessment for a given prject, but a review of how that project can help improve the environment,
possibly with a few minor additional outlays. The next step will be coordination with other
socioeconomic sectors and with the environmental authorities to ensure that the relevant aspects are
duly addressed in project studies.
2.    Environmental concerns wiU also be addressed by means of actions of a more operational
nature in the field, both during rouine and periodic maintenance and in the context of the new
projects Certain possible actions are listed below:
(a)   Roads and reforestation, The project will seek: (i) to introduce short seminars,
tageting the regional and subdivision authorities, on the importance of plant cover,
*ii)to encourage critical review of the technical road criteria with a view to limiting
deforestaon; (iii) to foster the possibly forced reforestation of borrow areas once a
project is completed; (iv) to implement planting programs alongside roads and
slopes; (v) to initiate dialogue with the water and forestry authorities with a view to
coordinatng road constructon with other measures falling within their purview and
designed to facilitate massive reforestation; and (vi) to initiate with the
environmental authorities a study on the monitoring of plant cover development in
relation to the accessibility provided by the road.
(b) Roads and settlements. In the towns and viUages traversed by the road sections to
be built, rehabilitated or periodically maintained, the project will seek: (i) to create a
framework for dialogue with the local authorities with a view to identifying possible
technical improvements to be made to the project; (ii) to try out a number of
technical arrangements in the area either of local development (market, bus station,
roadside restaurant parking, etc.) or of actual road construction (widening of the
road as it passes through a village, speed bumps, separate lanes for bicycles and
carts, safety barriers, etc.); and (iii) in conjunction with the local authities, to set
up an accident statistics system.
(c)   Work mpdo. Through dialogue with the people who will be living alongside
the road the site managers will be able to determine the condition in which the site is
to be left when the construction crews depart. It is a fact that small-scale
improvements can be made at least cost when the equipment is still on site.
However, a certain number of arrangements will need to be considered in advance.

Annex 8
Page 2 of 2
The reuse of borrow areas as watering points will have to be examined with care,
provision must be made for laterite pits to be covered whenever they could cause
erosion of adjoining land, boreholes drilled for water supply during road
construction must be designed so as to be subsequently usable for agricultural
purposes, worksite detours should be designed for future use as bicycle and cart
tracks, certain bridges or culverts can be designed from the start to serve as water
retention works, etc.
(d)   Dumping of used oil. RCFM, the major trucking companies, service stations, and
public works contractors are particularly required to notify the competent
environmental authorities, for opinion and approval, of the location where they
propose to dump used engine oil and cobalt-containing coolants. Dumping into
storm drains or sewers or watercourses, lakes and ponds must be strictly prohibited
by regulations to be promulgated prior to Credit effectiveness, and a sensitization
campaign on this topic must be conducted among vehicle owners, businesses and
service station operators. Collection of used oil by DNTP, for use in dune
stabilization alongside roads in Mali's northern regions, should be tried out on an
experimentti basis.
