I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Petroleum is the dominant source of energy in Peru, supplying about
80% of the country's commercial energy requirements. There is scope for ex-
panding the role of hydropower and, to a limited extent, coal for future
electricity generation. Nonetheless, petroleum will still provide the major
part of Peru's energy requirements for the rest of this century. After having
been dependent on imported crude oil for many years to meet its petroleum
needs, Peru increased its oil production almost threefold between 1976 and
1979, enabling it to export crude oil in 1978 for the first time since 1958.
With this encouraging production trend, domestic consumption rose sharply
after several years of stagnation. Peru's continued ability to meet domestic
oil requirements beyond the mid-1980s, will be assured only if new oil
reserves are discovered and developed.
1.02     As a consequence, since 1980, the Government's strategy in addressing
Peru's future energy needs has been aimed at increasing petroleum production
through accelerated exploration and development while attempting to restrain
domestic demand and encourage efficient use of petroleum products, mainly
through pricing policy. In this connection, the Government has recognized
that petroleum exploration and development, particularly in the Amazon basin,
require more resources and technical expertise and management skills than it
can provide. Partly for this reason the Government has adopted legislative
and policy measures designed to attract foreign oil companies, several of
which have already committed substantial amounts of risk capital for petroleum
exploration in Peru.
1.03     The following paragraphs present a brief description of the hydro,
gas, coal, and other energy sources, along with a discussion of the
anticipated energy use patterns over the next several years. Section II will
treat the oil sector in a more detailed manner.
B. ENERGY BALANCE AND RESOURCE BASE
1.04     Peru has potentially large and diverse energy resources.  Proved and
probable oil reserves total about 800 million barrels, of which proved
reserves amount to about 715 million barrels. Gas reserves are relatively
small; according to PETROPERU, proved gas reserves amount to about 2,100 bcf
(49 million TOE) and an additional 775 bcf (18.6 million TOE) of probable
reserves are estimated. Peru has numerous hydroelectric sites with an econo-
mically potential capacity totaling 60 GW, of which only 1.7 GW have been
developed. Some coal deposits suitable for thermal power generation or for
metallurgical coke have been identified but most of the country has not been
adequately explored for coal. Warm and boiling springs exist in many parts of
the country but the size of geothermal resources is unknown. In Peru's rural
areas, wood is the single most important energy source, accounting for about
75% of energy requirements.



1.05     A summary of the Ministry of Energy and Mining's (MEM) estimate of
Peru's gross energy balance is shown below:
Primary Energy Source    % Share           End Use 1/            % Share
Oil                          60.0   Industry and Agriculture        36.3
Firewood and Dung            26.0   Residential and Commerce        36.2

Hydropower
1.06     With an average annual growth rate of 6.7% in installed capacity
since 1965, hydropower has been growing rapidly. While accounting for only
6.2% of Peru's primary energy source (8.4 % of commercial energy production),
its potential for continued growth is enormous, as current capacity of about
1,700 MW represents only about 3% of the country's estimated technically
viable hydro potential of some 60,000 MW. Development of a good part of this
potential, however, will involve tapping hydroelectric resources of the
Atlantic watershed since only 15% of potential sites are on the Pacific side
of the Andes.  Thus, most new sites would be far from demand centers, with
consequent increases in the cost of delivering energy to consumers. In any
case, MEM plans to develop as much of the country's hydro potential as is
feasible, and as part of its master plan for the central-north system, the
Ministry has specified some 30 hydroelectric power projects which are at
various stages of study. In this connection, a Bank-financed power engineer-
ing project (Loan 2018-PE) is helping to finance preparation of prefeasibility
and feasibility studies for 12 hydroelectric projects, totalling over 1,000 MW
of generating capacity, the construction of which must begin within the next
two to four years to meet accelerating power demand in Peru with a minimum of
dependence on thermal generation. To help meet the cost of hydropower expan-
sion, the Government, toward the end of 1980, initiated a program of monthly
electricity tariff increases averaging close to three percent per month in
real terms. The Government is maintaining a program of regular increases
during 1982, with the objective of enabling the sector to finance one-third of
its investment program from internally generated sources.
Natural Gas
1.07     Natural gas is not an important contributor to Peru's energy needs.
It is produced mostly as associated gas primarily in the coastal oil-producing
areas in the northwest around Talara, where it is used mainly as a fertilizer
I' Peru's total energy consumption amounted to about 12 million TOE in 1980.



feedstock rather than as a direct energy source. Most of the fields in the
Amazon region produce only small quantities of gas which is used for local
fuel requirements with the remainder either flared or injected to provide
additional lift in oil-producing wells. Peru's total gas output has
fluctuated between 64 and 86 bcf p.a. from 1970 through 1980. Production is
projected to total 70-75 bcf per year for the next five years (about 14
million bbls of oil equivalent).
1.08     Estimates of Peru's undiscovered gas resources range widely -- from
one to 11 trillion cf. As mentioned earlier, PETROPERU estimates proven and
probable reserves at 2,875 bcf. Proven reserves of PETROPERU's Aguaytia
fields in the Selva Central (Central Jungle) account for over one-half of the
nearly 970 bcf of non-associated gas reserves (proven and probable) in the
Selva. The proven reserves of this field, however, do not, at this time,
justify the cost of a pipeline from its isolated location to potential con-
sumption centers. The only other area with considerable potential is in the
offshore Progreso Basin; most of the potential producing areas in that basin,
however, lie in Ecuador's territory.
Coal
1.09     Peru has been producing coal since the latter part of the nineteenth
century. From about 1960 onward, much of the production and all exports of
coal ceased. Over the past 10 years, coal output has averaged only about
30,600 tpy, and in recent years accounted for less than one percent of Peru's
total energy sources. Thus, only a small part of industry's demand for coke
and coal has been met from domestic production. To fully meet its needs,
which are relatively modest, Peru imports about 40,000 tpy of coking coal and
about 144,000 tpy of coke.
1.10     Coal deposits -- ranging from lignite to anthracite -- have been
reported in 18 of Peru's 24 Departments. But even in central and northern
Peru, where the deposits seem to have the best economic potential, the coal
strata are subvertical, highly fractured, and the thickness as well as the
quality of the seams vary widely within short distances. While no reliable
record of cqal reserves exists for Peru, MEM estimates total "inferred
reserves" 1 at about 1.1 billion tons, of which anthracite constitutes about
880 million tons. Only 2.4% of this latter total represents "measured
reserves," for which tonnage has been computed from measurements in outcrops,
trenches, mine workings or drill holes.
1.11     Modest exploration efforts for coking coal are being made by
SIDERPERU for its Chimbote steel plant, and by MINEROPERU for coal to fire a
proposed ELECTROPERU power plant. Also, CENTROMIN has recently begun explor-
ing for coking coal to meet its own needs. Despite these efforts, Peru lacks
a systematic evaluation of its coal resources. All in all,.new financially
feasible coal mines could only be developed if exploration delineates suffi-
cient reserves, if the scale of production is large enough, and sizeable

thickness measurements are available.

markets, involving domestic and export market studies, are assured. In this
connection, the IDB is reviewing the possibility of making a loan to help the
Government define the country's coal resources, training in coal mining opera-
tions, and to assist in development of a specific coal mining facility.
Geothermal Resources
1.12     The absence of geothermal drilling programs in Peru precludes an
accurate estimate of proven reserves of this resource. From the properties of
hot springs in the country's areas of active volcanism, the geology of the
country, and analogy with proven reserves in northern Chile, U. S. Geological
Survey (USGS) geologists concluded, in a joint Peru-U.S. energy assessment in
1978-79, that the country probably has a large geothermal resource base com-
pared to the world average. A further study, financed by the Latin American
Energy Organization (OLADE) and performed by Italian consultants -- based on
geological studies only -- identified six areas in southern Peru which appear
promising; also, a consultant's study, financed by the New Zealand Government,
noted the possibility of geothermal development in Cajamarca in northern
Peru. Further geophysical and geochemical investigations would be desirable,
aimed at selecting the most promising areas and identifying drilling sites.
The Federal Republic of Germany is considering assistance to Peru for this
purpose.
Nuclear Fuels and Developments
1.13     Uranium has been detected in a number of places in Peru but none of
the occurrences has been of sufficient grade or size to warrant physical
exploration. While only limited exploration has been undertaken in the past
in the more accessible areas in the Western Andes, the most favorable areas
are now believed to be along the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera and in
the adjoining jungle area. In this connection, the Peruvian Institute of
Nuclear Energy (IPEN), working with UNDP/IAEA geologists, has divided the
country into exploration districts and is exploring 20,000-30,000 sq km of the
most promising terrain. The group will train Peruvians and acquire data for
the purpose of attracting foreign capital for exploration. IPEN is also
conducting research on nuclear energy using a zero power (10 watts) research
reactor provided by Argentina under an agreement for nuclear cooperation. In
addition, Argentina is providing a research center at Huangaral. There are
currently no firm plans for construction of a nuclear power plant in Peru.
Other Energy Resources
1.14     About 60% of Peru's land surface is covered by natural and cultivated
forests. MEM estimates the annual gross primary energy potential available
from this resource as greater than the gross primary energy currently consumed
in Peru. Virtually all of the forest lands, however, are located in the thin-
ly populated Selva (Amazon) region. Still, fuelwood and other forms of bio-
mass accounted for about 67% of all residential and commercial energy usage in
Peru in 1980, down from about 75% in 1970.



-5-
1.15     Despite Peru's enormous forest resources, depletion of wood supply --
and even serious deforestation -- is a problem in some areas. The Government
is making some effort to deal with this problem through its recently estab-
lished reforestation institute (PRONARE), but information is scarce on the
availability of wood in different regions or on present deforestation
problems.
1.16     Bagasse, animal residues, and other sources of renewable energy re-
present less than 5% of Peru's energy supply.
1.17     With the exception of small hydropower facilities, (typically 50-500
kW plants), other forms of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind
are quantitatively unimportant in Peru. Given the hydro potential in the
Andes, the dispersion of small rural centers, and lack of rural electrifica-
tion, small hydro-power is well suited to the Sierra. Prior to MEM's initia-
tion of the small hydro program in 1979, about 146 of such plants were operat-
ing throughout the Andes. Since 1979, ELECTROPERU, which is executing agency
for the program, has built a number of additional plants, bringing total in-
stalled capacity of small hydro to about 300,000 kW. ELECTROPERU has also
initiated studies on 50 more projects. The program is being financed from an
electricity tax levied on users by ELECTROPERU. In addition, the small hydro
program is receiving funds from USAID, the Federal Republic of Germany, and
Switzerland.
C. ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND OUTLOOK
1.18     In 1980, Peru's energy consumption totalled the equivalent of 87
million barrels of oil (12 million TOE), of which oil accounted for 60%, fire-
wood 24%, hydropower 6.2%, natural gas 4.7%, bagasse 2.5%, coal 0.6%, and
other non-commercial sources 2.0%, (Annex 3, Table 1). While Peru will con-
tinue to be heavily dependent on petroleum for its energy needs throughout
most of this century, there is some prospect that the rapid growth of both
hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations could reduce petroleum's shar7 to
about half of the country's total energy requirements by the year 2000.
Over the medium term, however, exploration for, and development of, oil
resources, petroleum pricing policy (paragraphs 2.13-2.15), and additional
conservation measures will have the most important influence on the country's
overall energy situation.
1.19     Consumption of hydroelectricity increased the fastest of all energy
sources from 1965 to 1980, with an average annual rate of 6.9%. The use of
petroleum also grew rapidly (6.3% p.a.) over the same period. On the other
hand, consumption of coal and natural gas increased very slowly, at 1.5% and
1.0% per annum respectively. As to noncommercial fuels, the consumption of
wood, dung, and yareta (a vegetable-based fuel) rose very little, at less than
1% per year, while less bagasse was burned for energy in 1980 than in 1965.

- 6 -
Petroleum accounted for about 80% of Peru's commercial energy consumption in
1980. (For past consumption trends and the demand structure for petroleum
products see paragraphs 2.31-2.33 below).
1.20     For the 1970-1980 period, the respective shares of total demand of
the residential and commercial, industrial, and transport sectors have re-
mained fairly constant. The residential/commercial and industrial/agriculture
sectors have each accounted for about 36% of energy consumption in the latter
year, with transport's share averaging about 22% (Annex 3, Table 2). Energy
consumption trends over the 1970-1980 period were marked by the substitution
of oil and gas products for non-commercial fuels.
1.21     Noncommercial energy in Peru is used principally in the country's
rural areas. Along with animal dung and the yareta plant, wood serves as the
main cooking fuel for rural households, especially in the Sierra. Little
charcoal is consumed. In spite of the rural areas' dependence on wood and
dung, however, the absolute level of consumption of these fuels has remained
fairly static over the last 10 years, so that their share of total energy
usage has decreased. This reflects the replacement of wood and dung as
cooking fuels by kerosene and LPG due, in large part, to the low, subsidized
prices of certain hydrocarbons. (Since 1976, the cost of fuelwood for cooking
has been higher than that of kerosene in many parts of the jungle and the
Sierra.) Rural migration to urban centers has accentuated this substitution.
1.22     The burning of bagasse by the sugar industry to produce heat for
sugar processing and electricity constitutes the main industrial energy use of
biomass. But this consumption has decreased since 1976, because of output
problems in the sugar industry and increased sales of bagasse as a feedstock
for Peru's paper industry. As to other agricultural residues, some cotton-gin
wastes are being burned for drying cotton. Alternate energy sources such as
geothermal, solar, and wind energy do not contribute to current energy
consumption (except for some water pumping by windmills in isolated areas).
1.23     MEM projections indicate that, with no radical change in sector
policy, the use of energy among final consuming sectors would not change
markedly between now and the year 2000. As shown in Annex 3, Table 3, how-
ever, MEM estimates that, if the Government succeeds in its efforts to develop
hydropower and coal, the use of these resources would increase substantially
as a percentage of total energy use in the country, while the share accounted
for by petroleum would fall fairly sharply and that of noncommercial energy
would rise somewhat by the year 2000.
D.  ENERGY SECTOR ORGANIZATION, PLANNING AND POLICIES
1.24     The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is responsible for coordinat-
ing all energy activities and for energy pricing. Under MEM's policy guid-
ance, various semi-independent bodies share operational responsibility in the
energy sector. ELECTROPERU, the national power company, is responsible for
electric power generation and distribution for the country as a whole;
ELECTROLIMA operates power facilities serving the Greater Lima area and



- 7 -
several utilities and mining companies produce and distribute electricity in
other urban areas. PETROPERU, the national oil company, is involved in all
phases of exploration, production, transportation, refining, and distribution
of petroleum products. Also, two private oil companies -- Occidental and
Belco -- have become increasingly active in Peru in petroleum exploration and
production. More recently, Superior and Shell have signed production-sharing
contracts and have begun exploration programs. Hamilton Bros-Petroinca has
also signed such a contract, and several additional foreign oil companies are
negotiating contracts or have shown interest in doing so. Coal exploration
and development are undertaken mainly by the state mining company, MINEROPERU.
Development and conservation of forestry resources are under the aegis of the
Ministry of Agriculture.
1.25     In recent years, MEM has become involved in energy planning and has
received a substantial amount of technical assistance for this purpose. The
UNDP, for example, has provided assistance for an energy balance study com-
pleted in 1976. MEM continues to update the energy balance, and based on this
work it has developed projections up to 1990 and 2000. The major assessment
of energy resources and planning mentioned earlier was carried out jointly by
the US Government and Peru and completed in 1979. Also, the Federal Republic
of Germany financed a survey of Peru's hydroelectric potential in 1979, and
has, together with the Bank, financed a power sector master plan completed in
1980.
1.26     While the Government has sufficient knowledge of the country's energy
situation to elaborate a comprehensive resource development program -- except
for coal resources and geothermal potential -- little progress has been made
in comprehensive energy planning thus far. For some time, the Government has
been considering establishment of a national energy council to develop and
coordinate sector policies, and to promote energy development. The issue of
creating such a council for these purposes, however, is not an active one in
Peru, largely because the Government's policy is to concentrate efforts on
developing the two main subsectors which have the greatest potential -- hydro-
power and petroleum.
1.27     As part of its demand management policy for energy, the Government
has taken some significant steps on the petroleum and electric power pricing
front. In addition, it has supported specific energy conservation efforts,
although a nationwide program to conserve energy does not exist. In this con-
nection, the recently approved Bank Loan (2117-PE) for a petroleum refineries
engineering project is designed, in part, to assist PETROPERU in reducing
energy consumption while improving efficiency in Peru's largest energy-inten-
sive industry -- petroleum refining. Also, energy audits have been carried
out for six of Peru's largest industrial consumers, and a study has been
arranged with a French organization to define priority areas for energy
savings, principally in the industry and transport sectors. In addition, MEM
is seeking ways to substitute coal and hydropower for oil in various
industries.



-8-
1.28     Since the Government is giving priority to acceleration of petroleum
exploration and development and to further expansion of hydropower, it has not
placed great emphasis on various other renewable energy technologies. None-
theless, a number of research studies sponsored by several Government agencies
are under way on wind turbines for water pumping, solar distillation and dry-
ing, solar water heaters and cookers, and biogas digestors. The mining sec-
tor, which is important in Peru, provides the greatest opportunity for the use
of renewable energy, specifically solar application for heating for water.
E. FRAMEWORK FOR PROPOSED PROJECT
1.29     The proposed project for enhancing petroleum production in the
Laguna-Zapotal oilfield is important to the Government's strategy for the
energy sector and, in particular, for the petroleum subsector. The basis for
this strategy is that, together with expansion of the country's hydropower
capacity, exploration for, and development of, petroleum resources are the
most promising means by which Peru can meet its energy requirements over the
next two decades. The importance of the proposed project, in quantitative
terms, is illustrated by the fact that the resulting increase in production --
ranging from 5,000 BD to 13,000 BD over the life of the project -- would, by
1985, meet about 8% of Peru's domestic demand for petroleum products and also
contribute substantially to the country's balance of payments improvement, an
important objective of the Government's overall economic development policy.
1.30     Within the petroleum sector, the proposed project would fit into the
Government's strategy of leaving to private oil companies the bulk of high
risk exploration as well as petroleum development in more difficult producing
areas; PETROPERU would develop its existing coastal fields where it has been
active traditionally and where the risk is low (as in Laguna-Zapotal). Else-
where, PETROPERU would operate only three areas in the jungle. Since the
results cf major exploration efforts of the private oil companies will not be
forthcoming until the latter part of the 1980s at the earliest, it will be ex-
tremely important, during the interim period, for Peru to increase its crude
output substantially in order to ensure continuation of its self-sufficiency
in oil. By making possible a rapid and substantial increase in petroleum pro-
duction, the proposed project would contribute significantly to the success of
the Government's strategy for the sector and to achievement of the country's
broader economic development objectives.
II. THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
A. PAST DEVELOPMENTS AND OVERVIEW
2.01     Peru's first oil wells were drilled in 1863, making it one of the
oldest oil-producing countries in the Western Hemisphere and, rapidly, a net
exporter of petroleum. However, during the late 1940s and 1950s, with gaso-
line and fuel oil prices among the lowest in the world and reduced producers'
profit margins, growth in domestic consumption outstripped that of production
so that the country became a net importer in 1958.  In 1968, following a



- 9 -
military coup, the Government nationalized the International Petroleum Company
(IPC), the producer of 90% of Peru's crude output.
2.02     While production from the traditional coastal and offshore producing
fields in northern Peru rose slowly throughout the 1960s, consumption conti-
nued to grow rapidly, and Peru became increasingly dependent on crude oil im-
ports to meet its own domestic requirements. To reverse this trend of in-
creasing oil dependence, the Government took measures at the end of the 1960s,
to stimulate exploration activity in Peru's Amazon basin east of the Andes.
Sixteen consortia, involvin, some 58 private oil companies, signed contracts
to explore for oil in the jungle.
2.03     The initial exploration success of PETROPERU and Occidental, however,
was followed by a number of unsuccessful exploratory wells by other contrac-
tors. These disappointments, the high cost of exploration in the Amazon
Basin, and a critical modification in U.S. tax legislation (paragraph 2.07)
contributed to the departure from Peru of 15 of the original 16 exploration
consortia by the end of 1976. In late 1979, the Peruvian Government updated
its petroleum law (paragraph 2.09) and arranged for U. S. oil companies to pay
income taxes directly to the Peruvian Treasury rather than through PETROPERU,
thus making the U.S. firms eligible for U. S. tax credits. These actions
permitted renegotiation of some of the existing contracts with foreign oil
companies, but were apparently not conducive to attracting new investment from
additional companies.
2.04     After the Presidential election in Peru, held in May 1980, the new
Government adopted a liberalized petroleum law (December 1980)1/ which again
encouraged a considerable amount of interest in oil exploration. As a result,
several foreign oil companies signed production-sharing contracts (paragraph
2.12) with PETROPERU, both offshore and in the Amazon region, and a number of
additional firms are investigating exploration opportunities in Peru.
2.05     In any event, following completion of the Trans-Andean Pipeline in
late 1977, oil production rose rapidly from 91,000 BD in that year to an
average of 150,000 BD in 1978, and 195,000 BD in 1980. Thus, production con-
tinued to increase and Peru has been able to export significant volumes of
crude and petroleum products. Revenues from these exports rose from US$52
million in 1977 to US$810 million in 1980, when they accounted for more than
20% of the country's total merchandise export earnings, as shown in Annex 3,
Table 4.
2.06     Current estimates of proven and probable petroleum reserves total
600-800 million barrels, sufficient to maintain production for another 9-12
years at current output levels. In the long term, however, significant addi-
tional petroleum production in Peru will depend on the extent of discoveries
by the private oil companies and PETROPERU, since current oil exploration,
even if successful, will not result in substantial output until the late 1980s
1/ See Annex 4 for a description of the terms for new oil contracts.



- 10 -
at the earliest.  Continued substantial export of oil in the medium term, and
possibly even Peru's self-sufficiency beyond the mid-1980s, will depend, in
large part, on the pace of investment in the development of existing fields
both by private oil companies and PETROPERU, and on domestic demand growth for
petroleum products. The pace of this latter growth, in turn, will, to a
considerable extent, be a function of the Government's pricing policy
(paragraphs 2.13-2.19).
B.   GOVERNMENT POLICY
Petroleum Exploration and Development Strategy
2.07     Historical Perspective.  In 1969, following nationalization of the
International Petroleum Company (IPC), the Government introduced a petroleum
law which prohibited the granting of new exploration and development
concessions to private firms. In 1970, the Government modified its
exclusionary policy and developed the "Peru Model" contract under which
private companies could explore for oil and eventually operate production
facilities. Production-sharing contracts with PETROPERU provided that the
contractor firm pay all of its own exploration, development and operating
expenditures, while receiving 50% of production, and PETROPERU was to pay all
contracitor tax obligations from its share. Because of its conceptual
simplicity and ease of implementation, the Peru Model provided the basis for
extensive interest by private foreign companies in exploration of the Amazon
region. Several fields were discovered by Occidental and PETROPERU in that
region, but all of the other consortia which signed contracts in the early
1970s fa'led to discover fields sufficiently attractive to maintain a presence
there; -  the last of these contracts was signed with Belco in August 1973,
after which the Government suspended the awarding of new contracts.
2.08     Following continued escalation in the cost of imported oil and reali-
zing that neither PETROPERU nor the Government had adequate technical or
financial resources to carry out the required level of exploration in the
Amazon area, the Government, in 1977, initiated an active campaign to attract
private foreign companies again so as to renew exploration activities. The
Government opened areas for contracts, both offshore and onshore, which were
previously reserved for PETROPERU. This resulted in signature, in April 1978,
of an exploration-production contract with Occidental for a second block in
the jungle (Block 1-B, see IBRD Map 16174) and a production-sharing contract
1/ A U.S. Internal Revenue Service ruling, which stated that income taxes
paid on behalf of U.S. companies would no longer be eligible for tax
credits in the United States, also contributed to the departure of these
companies. Moreover, in 1976, U. S. companies, in order to qualify their
exploration losses for an offsetting domestic (U.S.) tax liability,
abandoned their operations in Peru; these losses, under the new U. S. tax
code, would not have been allowable beginning in 1977.



- 11 -
with a consortium of private companies led by Occidental ("Oxy-Bridas") for
secondary oil recovery in the Talara area.
2.09     In the meantime, the Goverment carried out a review of the contrac-
tual framework for petroleum exploration and production in light of the
developments in the oil industry at that time. On December 6, 1979, it issued
Decree-Law 22774 which redefined the basis for contracts with private oil
companies. In particular, the new law provided for: (i) flexibility for
PETROPERU in negotiating the production-sharing contracts to take into account
the geological characteristics, exploration costs and presumed development
costs, and the option for PETROPERU to participate in joint ventures with
private oil firms; (ii) the carrying out by PETROPERU of all secondary or
tertiary recovery projects; and (iii) direct payments by the contractors of
income taxes to the Peruvian Treasury, thus making American firms eligible for
full tax credit in the United States.
2.10     While oil companies awaited with interest the results of the lengthy
renegotiations of contracts with Belco and Occidental to be completed in July
1980, they did not consider the terms required by the revised law sufficiently
competitive with those offered by other oil-producing countries. At about the
same time, the Oxy-Bridas production-sharing contract was also transformed
into a service contract.
2.11     Current Policy.  The new Administration elected to office in Peru in
mid-1980 reassessed the overall investment strategy in the sector. Additional
incentives were devised to attract new investments by oil companies needed to
maintain a satisfactory degree of petroleum self-sufficiency. As part of this
strategy, PETROPERU's role was confined to the relatively less risky explora-
tion and development activities which did not require special technology or
large financial requirements. This new policy was embodied in Decree Law
23231, issued on December 26, 1980, which includes two major features: (i)
execution of secondary recovery projects by PETROPERU in collaboration with
national or foreign companies on a contract basis (as in the case of Oxy-
Bridas instead of by PETROPERU exclusively); and (ii) introduction of a re-
investment tax credit scheme to attract both national and foreign companies
involved in successful oil exploration and production. Accordingly, foreign
companies can deduct up to 40 percent 1 (90 percent for national companies)
of their pre-tax Peruvian income for qualified investments in petroleum explo-
ration and development.
2.12     As a result of the new tax investment credit and expression by the
Government of active interest in encouraging private foreign investment in
petroleum exploration and development, the investment climate has brightened
considerably. In February 1981, Superior Oil signed a contract with PETROPERU
for an area in Block 2 in the Northern Jungle. Shell signed a contract in
July 1981 for exploration in Blocks 38 and 42 in the Lower Central Jungle
area. Belco signed a third contract in January 1982 for exploration in Block
1/ 50% south of the 7th parallel.

Z-28 offshore. Hamilton Brothers-Petroinca signed a contract in May 1982 for
Block 7 in the jungle. Union of Texas is negotiating for Block 6, also in the
jungle, and Elf is negotiating for blocks Z-8 and Z-9 offshore. (See IBRD Map
16174). Discussions have also been held with several other interested com-
panies, among them Cities Service, Sun and Deminex. In addition, companies such
as Mobil and Conoco, as well as a number of private Peruvian companies, have
purchased geological data on a number of jungle blocks. Based on the Bank
appraisal mission's review and discussions in Lima, exploration and development
investment of private oil companies and PETROPERU is projected to average about
US$500/600 million per year in the 1982-1985 period (paragraph 2.44).
Pricinig Policy
2.13     Following the sharp increases in international oil prices which began
in 1973, Government policy was based on protecting the Peruvian economy from
potentially disruptive effects of immediate price hikes required to reflect
international increases. Thus, domestic petroleum product prices, which had
not been increased since June 1969, were kept unchanged until June 1975. At
the same time, continued growth in petroleum product consumption at home,
particularly of gasoline, put a growing strain on Peru's balance of pay-
ments. Beginning in 1976, the Government therefore made a determined effort
to increase domestic product prices and to slow the especially rapid growth in
gasolines consumption. Regular gasoline prices were more than doubled in July
1976, followed by further increases in subsequent years, affecting not only
gasoline but all major refined products.
2.14     In 1980 -  an election year during which the political visibility of
price acti-Tns was very high -- the Government authorized two -rice increnses
which resulted in a weighted average price, in soles, of petroleum products
about 24% above the level prevailing on January 1, 1980. This actually
represented a substantial decrease in real terms since domestic inflation was
about 60% in that year. These price increases, ere, however, in line with
the pricing covenant included in Loan 1806-PE, 17 if the 30% increase, in
soles, which was delayed until January 5, 1981, is included. In 1981, how-
ever, the Government approved a series of further sharp price increases (in
March, July, September, and December), resulting in a 138% increase in product
prices (in soles) from the January 1, 1981 level, or a 36% annual increase in
real ter-ms (see Annex 3, Table 6 and accompanying Chart).
2.15     The level of prices in Peru which took effect on January 31, 1982,
the date of the first increase authorized in that year, is summarized below
for the major products and compared with corresponding prices then prevailing
in selected countries:
1/ Under the pricing covenant, the Government was to authorize four quarterly
increases of 10% each for ex-refinery prices in 1980.

Comparison between border prices (or "international prices"), which reflect
the opportunity cost of exporting these products, and prices then prevailing
in other Latin American countries and the United States, shown in the table
above, indicates that petroleum prices of certain products in Peru are signi-
ficantly below the international level. Although gasoline prices are equiva-
lent to international prices, the retail prices of kerosene, diesel and fuel
oil are still maintained at low levels. Peru's pricing policy for domestic
kerosene is based on socio-economic grounds, since that product is the prime
source of fuel for cooking and heating for the poor. This policy and the
subsidization of diesel oil and fuel oil, used in the transport and industrial
sectors, tend to distort consumption patterns and lead to imbalances in output
requirements of Peru's refineries.
2.16     Taxes on sales of petroleum products are an important source of reve-
nue for the Government. The two main taxes levied are: a consumption tax,
("impuesto selectivo al consumo") based on a percentage of the ex-refinery
sales price, which varies by both region and product, with gasoline taxed at
the highest rate (60%) and domestic kerosene taxed at the lowest rate 13%; and
the "impuesto general a las ventas," a sales tax which equals 16% of the ex-
refinery sales price plus the consumption tax for the product; in addition,
the Government levies an 8% road tax and a 6% transportation tax on ex-refin-
ery prices applied to gasoline sales. The current price structure for the
products for which prices are Government-controlled indicates that PETROPERU
receives on the average 53% of domestic retail prices. The table below shows
the price structure for major products as of June 1, 1982:
1/  January 1982 price levels as converted using exchange rates in effect at
that time.

2.17     The current price structure of petroleum prices is still inadequate
on three grounds: (i) the average retail price is still below the interna-
tional level, which reflects the opportunity cost of exporting the products.
Prices would need to be raised by about 12% (in US$ terms) on the average to
reach international levels, (ii) the inter-product price structure results in
uneconomic fuel choice in the sense that domestic kerosene is heavily subsi-
dized (resulting in a domestic price which is about one-fourth of the inter-
national price), and fuel oil and diesel oil are also subsidized as compared
to gasoline prices, which are at international levels, and (iii) the system of
ex-refinery prices, within the overall taxation framework for PETROPERU,
results in insufficient revenues from the company's domestic sales which, in
turn, has a detrimental effect on its finances and limits its capacity to
generate funds internally for its investments (paragraph 5.04).
2.18     The Government is fully aware of the deficiencies in its pricing
structure and PETROPERU is carrying out a hydrocarbon pricing policy study
being financed under Loan 1806-PE. The study is being undertaken with the
assistance of Arthur D. Little International (ADL) and is scheduled for
completion by April 1983. The aim of the study is to improve the analytical
base for making changes in the overall domestic price structure and taxation
framework.
2.19     Moreover, the series of substantial price increases which took place
in 1981 (paragraph 2.14) and thus far in 1982 have shown the determination of
the Government to progressively eliminate subsidies for petroleum products and
to remedy PETROPERU's poor financial performance. In the current year, the
Government has approved five price increases (January 29, March 1, April 3,
May 30, and July 4) which have raised the average price of petroleum products
by 60% in sol terms, or 19% in U.S. dollar terms, from the January 1, 1982
level. The average price of petroleum products is now the equivalent of
US$.73 per gallon (US$30.70 per barrel). In July 1982, the Government
confirmed its intention to continue its program of increases in dollar terms
for the balance of 1982 so as to reach international levels by the end of the
year (about US$34 per barrel), and to implement any further increases in 1983

required to enable PETROPERU to achieve the financial targets set forth in the
proposed loan agreement (paragraph 5.24).
Taxation Policy
2.20     The petroleum sector is an important source of revenues for the
Government, via sales and consumption taxes at the retail level and through
taxes on PETROPERU and its contractors as operating companies. The most im-
portant taxes paid by PETROPERU are:
(a) income taxes on its own operations, at a maximum rate of 55%;
(b) taxes paid on its own behalf and on behalf of foreign contractors, as
follows:
(i)  export taxes on crude and petroleum products, at 18.5% of the
FOB value;
(ii) import duties on capital goods, operating materials and equip-
ment ranging from 6-45%, depending on the good;
(iii) royalty taxes, at 8% of the value of the country's production
based on a weighted average of domestic and export prices;
(iv)  a special regionaJ  tax (called "canon" tax) paid on jungle pro-
duction, at 10%!' of the value of production based on a valua-
tion price equal to the domestic price minus transportation,
distribution and refining costs; and
(c) miscellaneous taxes paid on its own operations, such as employment
taxes, tax on equity, and sales and consumption taxes on materials
and equipment.
The overall impact of these taxes on PETROPERU's finances can be summarized as
follows:
1/ In 1982, a canon surtax of 2.5% was added, and the valuation price is now
computed on the basis of the weighted average of domestic and export
prices.

It should be noted that all these taxes, with the exception of the income tax,
are levied on PETROPERU regardless of its financial performance. In 1981
these taxes represented about 24% of its revenues and, although a deductible
expense, resulted in a strongly negative impact on PETROPERU's finances (para-
graph 5.05). In April 1981, however, the Government promulgated a Decree-Law
which will progressively reduce the export tax to about 3.5% of the FOB value
by 1984.
2.21     In the past, PETROPERU had also been responsible for payment of in-
come tax obligations of its foreign contractors.  This obligation was elimi-
nated by Decree-Laws 22774 and 22775 issued on December 6, 1979, which provide
that foreign oil companies operating in Peru are liable for paying their own
income taxes (55%) and profit remittance taxes (30% of net income after taxes)
directly to the Government Treasury. Contractors now remit taxes in kind to
the Treasury, which transfers them to PETROPERU as capital contributions to be
used for financing PETROPERU's investment program. The Government's invest-
ment tax credit scheme embodied in D. L. 23231 has reduced the contractor's
income tax obligations and therefore the level of automatic equity contribu-
tions to PETROPERU (see paragraph 5.07). D.L. 23231 does not provide,
however, that PETROPERU can benefit from the investment tax credit arrangement
which is reserved for foreign and Peruvian private oil companies under con-
tract with PETROPERU.

prcfit in that year.

C. PETROLEUM RESOURCES
Geology
2.22     Peru is comprised by four major geologic provinces, each of which
contains sedimentary regions with hydrocarbon-bearing potential: (i) the
coastal belt -- the narrow region lying between the Pacific coastline on the
west and the Andes Cordillera on the east; (ii) the Amazon region -- the low
jungle plain along the eastern and northeastern areas of Peru; (iii) the Andes
Cordillera -- the high and geologically complex north-south trending ranges
that form the backbone of Peru and separate the coastal belt from the Amazon
region; and (iv) the offshore regions lying between the Peru-Chile trench and
the coastline where up to four basins have been detected.
2.23     Almost all of Peru's petroleum production has been obtained, histori-
cally, from the northwestern coastal belt (IBRD Map 16174). The latest dis-
coveries have been based on gravity surveys in the mid-1950s, which led to two
major onshore fields, and on seismic surveys in the late 1950s and early
1960s, which led to seven offshore fields.
2.24     The three important sedimentary basins of the Amazon region, the
Maranon, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios basins are part of large asymmetric de-
pressions between the Andes on the west and shield areas to the east. Current
production comes primarily from the Maranon basin, which contains 22 fields,
all discovered by PETROPERU and Occidental Petroleum. The traps are predomi-
nantly faulted anticlines, located primarily by seismic surveys. The Ucayali
basin, which has characteristics similar to those found in the Maranon basin,
has two producing fields both under the control of PETROPERU. No oil produc-
tion has been established as yet from the Madre de Dios basin, although large
oil seeps are known.
2.25     The hydrocarbon potential of the third geologic province, the Andes
Cordillera, appears low and the complexity of its geology probably precludes
serious exploration efforts in the foreseable future. However, the now-aban-
doned Pirin Field is located in the Altiplano Basin and additional small
fields may be discovered in this region.
Reserves
2.26     Estimates of Peru's recoverable crude oil reserves vary widely for
several reasons, the most important of which are: (i) lack of sufficient
petrophysical well data in the northwestern coastal belt despite the great
number of wells drilled during the last 100 years, (ii) lack of sufficient
production history from the water injection project now being carried out by
Oxy-Bridas northwest of Talara, and (iii) insufficient production history of
the recent discoveries by both Occidental and PETROPERU in the Maranon.



- 18 -
2.27     On the basis of existing studies _Y  the current estimate for proved
reserves ranges between 550 and 715 million barrels, as shown below:

Source:  PETROPERU and Bank mission estimates.
2.28     Additional probable reserves are estimated at between 70 and 100
million barrels, including rese,rves from secondary recovery operations and ex-
tensions of existing fields. -   Also, reserves in the order of 30 million
barrels from heavy crude fields are classified under the "possible" cate-
gory. When proved and probable reserves are added, total reserves amount to
about 600-800 million barrels, or approximately 9-12 years of production at
present rates. Peru's reserves in the context of South America's total oil
reserves are small, amounting to only about 4% of the total for the continent.
2.29     The quantity of undiscovered reserves is much more difficult to
assess reliably. While estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves vary from
2-40 billion barrels, most of the higher estimates are based on expectations
for large stratigraphic traps ir the Amazon Basin and in deep water at the
edge of the continental shelf. Both require expensive technologies; for the
latter, the technology is still in the development phase and may not be viable
for the next 10-15 years.
Recent Production Trends
2.30     After stagnating through the first part of the 1970s, output started
to increase in 1977, as production from the jungle came on stream, and for
that year averaged 91,000 BD as compared with 76,000 BD in 1976. The year
1978 was an important turning point for Peru's production. Peru was not only
able to attain self-sufficiency but became a net petroleum exporter for the
first time since 1958. From an average daily production rate of 112,000 BD in

the first quarter of 1978, output increased over 50% to an average of 181,000
BD by the fourth quarter and averaged 150,500 BD for the full year, due ex-
clusively to a fourfold increase in output from Occidental's operations in the
northeastern jungles of Peru; production since then has levelled off in the
190,000-195,000 BD range. Total production in the period 1977-81 is summar-
ized below:

D. CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
2.31     Consumption of petroleum products -- which is supplied by about two-
thirds of Peru's domestic production -- increased at an average rate of 6.2%
during the period 1960-75. The domestic demand for petroleum products de-
creased slightly, however, in the 1976-78 period. This abrupt change in con-
sumption trend can be attributed mostly to the economic crisis then prevailing
in Peru (no real increase in GDP) and to implementation of sharp price in-
creases for petroleum products, starting in mid-1975, following a long period
during which prices remained constant. With the resumption of increased eco-
nomic activity in 1979 and 1980, and the decline of domestic petroleum prices
in dollar terms, d mand increased by about 4.8% in 1979 and 8.5% in 1980, to
reach 126,300 BD 2 in the latter year. In 1981, however, domestic demand in-
creased by only 2.6%, to about 129,600 BD, due mainly to the impact of the 36%
price increase, in real terms, in that year.
2.32     An historical comparison of GDP and consumption growth of petroleum
products shows that they are highly correlated. While GDP had increased by an
average of 4.5% p.a. in the period 1960-1980, consumption of petroleum pro-
ducts rose by an average of 5.2% over the same period, resulting in an esti-
mated long-run energy/output coefficient of about 1.15 in Peru. For 1982,
domestic demand for petroleum products is projected to grow by only 4.2%,
1/ Oxy-Bridas' operating contract in fields northeast of Talara resulted in
the shift of production from PETROPERU to Oxy-Bridas in 1978.
2/ Excluding PETROPERU's own consumption averaging 4,000-6,000 BD.



- 20 -
which would reflect, in part, the price increases in real terms targeted for
that year. Medium-term projections of demand, however, are based on a GDP
growth forecast of 5% p.a. in the period 1983-1990 and an energy/output coef-
ficient of 1.0, to take into account further price increases, the impact of
energy conservation measures, and the substitution of non-petroleum energy
sources such as hydroelectricity.
2.33     The trend in the structure of demand for petroleum products summa-
rized below indicates a growth of kerosene and LPG consumption as a result of
low absolute and relative prices of these products, and a decrease in gasoline
consumption, with a corresponding increase in diesel consumption resulting
from the conversion of trucks and buses from gasoline to diesel engines in the
mid-1970s and the relatively higher prices of gasoline (paragraph 2.13). The
rapid increase in middle distillates consumption indicates that Peru's exist-
ing refinery capacity will be insufficient to satisfy the demand for these
products in the mid-1980s.

E. REFINERIES, INDUSTRIAL PLANTS, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION
2.34     PETROPERU owns and operates two main refineries -- La Pampilla, near
Lima, with a capacity of 100,000 BD, and Talara, 1,000 km northwest of Lima,
with a capacity of 65,000 BD - which account for approximately 92% of total
refining capacity in Peru. In addition, PETROPERU owns four small refineries
in the jungle.
2.35     The refining industry in Peru faces two problems.  First, the two
major refineries are operated almost continuously without allowing for reason-
able maintenance. Moreover, energy consumption in the refineries is high, as
they were built at a time when energy was cheap and the main emphasis was on
keeping capital costs low. To help remedy this problem, the Bank's petroleum
refineries engineering loan (Loan 2117-PE), is helping PETROPERU's industrial
department carry out studies and develop programs for overhauling the mainte-
nance system, achieving energy saving, and improving the operational effi-
ciency of the main refineries.



- 21 -
2.36     The second problem relates to inadequate domestic refining capacity
to meet growing consumption of middle distillates. As indicated in paragraph
2.32, above, Peru will have to import these products some time between 1985
and 1990 if no additional refinery capacity for them is completed in the 1980s
and demand continues to grow at about 5% per annum. The size and configura-
tion of additional facilities required will, however, depend on overall energy
demand growth and the success of conservation and inter-fuel substitution
efforts. It is therefore important that future refinery investments be based
on careful planning and on an analysis of alternatives. Investments for the
refineries would also take account of priorities in the petroleum sector as a
whole.
2.37     In addition to running refineries, PETROPERU also operates a 300-tpd
ammonia plant, a 510-tpd urea plant, a 10,000-tpy isopropyl alcohol plant, a
5,000-tpy acetone plant, and a 7,700-tpy carbon black plant.
2.38     PETROPERU controls about 98% of the marketing facilities in the
country. Its transportation system includes principally the North-Peruvian
(Transandean) Pipeline built to take the crude oil from the jungle to the
coast. This pipeline, which starts at San Jose de Saramuro in the Selva, ends
in the port of Bayovar after crossing the Andes at 2,400 m above sea level
(See IBRD Map No.16174). The pipeline includes an 856-km trunk line which
came on stream in mid-1977, a 253-km Northern Branch linking the Occidental
Petroleum fields and a 204-km feeder line (Corrientes branch) which links all
PETROPERU fields. The main pipeline, working at 70% capacity, currently
carries an average of 135,000 BD.
F. DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
New Exploration Activity
2.39     The actions taken by the Government in December 1980, to modify the
petroleum law have shown very rapid results in attracting foreign investment
in exploration activities. Government plans for PETROPERU call for concentra-
tion by the company on development and production of its own oil fields while
maintaining petroleum exploration activity in Blocks 8, 31 and 35 in the
jungle and onshore in the Northwest Coastal area of Peru. The aggregate level
of exploration that can be anticipated over the next few years, although un-
certain, can be expected to be significant given the trend set by the recent
signing of exploration/production contracts.
2.40     Occidental's Amazon operations are expected to provide a little less
than half of Peru's total production over the next five years. With its high
exploration success rate having been maintained through 1981, Occidental
should be capable of maintaining production from these oil fields at 100,000
BD through 1986. The 1980-81 decline in primary production from existing
Belco and PETROPERU operations should be more than offset by the secondary
recovery and development projects projected to go on stream in the next few
years. Three major uncertainties will affect 1986-90 production: (i) the
level of PETROPERU's production from new finds, particularly near its current



- 22 -
Amazon operations, (ii) exploration success in newly-opened jungle areas by
private petroleum companies, and (iii) delay by PETROPERU in carrying out
planned development and secondary recovery projects.
2.41     Even on a conservative basis, which discounts any possible explora-
tion discoveries by companies such as Superior and Shell and others not yet
operating in Peru, aggregate crude oil output in 1986 should not fall below
200,000 BD. Actual and estimated domestic crude oil production, domestic
demand, and exports for 1980-86 are summarized below:

Exports
2.42     After supplying the domestic market, PETROPERU's share of the 1981
export market amounted to about 16 million barrels, which at an average export
price of US$35 per barrel, represented about US$550 million in revenue.
Domestic demand for petroleum products is expected to increase at about 4.2%
in 1982 and to increase at about 5% per annum thereafter. As a result,

Oil, assuming discoveries resulting from their current exploration pro-

- 23 -
exports which totalled about 22 million bbl in 1981, are projected to reach 25
million bbl in 1982, and decrease thereafter to about 21 million bbl in 1986.
2.43     Occidental and Belco export crude oil, which is refined outside
Peru. In 1981, PETROPERU exported about 6.5 million bbl of crude oil to Japan
under a long-term contract with prices adjusted quarterly. The balance of
PETROPERU's crude and petroleum products exports are sold on the spot market
mainly to other countries in the area.
Investment
2.44     Investment prospects for oil exploration and development in the next
three to four years look encouraging, mostly as a result of the recent Govern-
ment policy to attract new capital from foreign oil companies. On the basis
of discussions with all parties concerned, the mission believes that under
normal circumstances, the major elements are likely to be as follows:
i. Occidental would invest about US$200 to $300 million per annum in
developing its Amazon jungle contract areas to maintain its current
production level and for additional secondary recovery investments in
the Talara area (Oxy-Bridas contract).
ii.  Belco would invest about US$40 million per annum in new exploration
and development activities in its offshore blocks aimed primarily at
maintaining its current production levels.
iii. Superior would invest about US$20 million during the period from mid-
1981 to mid-1983 in drilling two exploratory wells. Investments
beyond that date would depend on the results of these exploration
activities.
iv.  Shell would spend a minimum of US$100 million over the next four
years in a two-stage exploration program (two exploratory wells in
the first phase and four wells in the second phase).
v. PETROPERU would spend about US$115 million in 1982, US$135 million in
1983, US$150 million in 1984, and US$180 million in 1985 for develop-
ment and production enhancement projects in known producing areas,
and to continue its exploration drilling effort in the Maranon basin
in the jungle.
vi.  Other foreign companies have expressed interest in undertaking explo-
ration activities, principally in the Amazon Basin and offshore. The
amount of investment in the next years will depend on the pace of
signature of new contracts, some of which are already at an advanced
stage of negotiations.
2.45     These investment plans would result in a total investment in explora-
tion and development activities of about US$1,800 to US$2,000 million in the
period 1982-1985. This amount implies that PETROPERU would still undertake
about 30% of the total investment, a share which appears reasonable compared



- 24 -
with past performance, although on the high side given PETROPERU's limited
technical and financial capabilities. The total amount of investment from all
sources will be heavily dependent on the degree of exploration success by
foreign contractors and the number of contracts signed with private companies
for exploration and development of the blocks allocated to them.
Role of the Bank
2.46     There are several cogent reasons for Bank involvement in the hydro-
carbon sector in Peru. Clearly, the sector deserves priority support because
the country's economic situation would deteriorate seriously if Peru fails to
remain a net exporter of petroleum beyond the mid-1980s -- which would happen
if no additional production occurs. The Government's policy -- which the Bank
has encouraged and which has been successful thus far -- is to promote invest-
ment by private companies for exploration and production in the jungle and
offshore, and in some areas on the coast. This policy also places a well-
defined limit to the scope of PETROPERU's operations.
2.47     The first Bank loan to PETROPERU (Loan 1806-PE, US$32.5 million) was
primarily designed to increase production in the short term through a produc-
tion rehabilitation program, and to prepare further investments through seis-
mic surveys and secondary recovery studies. Another objective was to streng-
then the technical and financial capability of PETROPERU, so that the company
could efficiently assume its role in the sector. The project got under way
more slowly than expected because of the complexity and diversity of the com-
ponents; a substantial delay in making the loan effective mainly as a result
of the change in government in mid-1980, shortly after the loan was signed;
inexperience of the Borrower with Bank procedures, this being the first Bank
loan for the petroleum sector in Peru; and PETROPERU's weak implementation
capacity. Substantial progress leading to a rapid increase in PETROPERU's
production has been achieved, however, over the past several months, which is
also reflected in the rapid increases in commitments and disbursements of the
Bank loan which totalled US$18 million and US$8 million, respectively, by mid-
June 1982 (Annex 7). As expected, by July of this year, financial commitments
had been made for most of the remaining equipment and materials to be pur-
chased under the project and a substantial additional increase in production
has been achieved by PETROPERU.
2.48     Bank lending to PETROPERU is also well justified.  PETROPERU, which
is Peru's largest public entity, remains important in terms of its acreage,
size, petroleum exploration and development activities, refineries, and
related industries. Its proposed production enhancement program, moreover, is
the key to ensuring Peru's self-sufficiency in petroleum until possible dis-
coveries by private company oil exploration are made later in the 1980s. In
addition, Bank involvement would help provide assistance to achieve further
improvements in the company's operating efficiency and financial performance,
thus improving the company's creditworthiness. And it has permitted the Bank
to serve as a catalyst for substantial amounts of co-financing for the pro-
posed project and to encourage private bank lending for future projects of the
same type in Peru.



- 25 -
2.49     As was the case in our policy dialogue during implementation of the
first petroleum loan, continued Bank lending in this sector would support a
further increase in the role for private companies, not only as suppliers of
equipment and institution-building services, but also as direct participants
in PETROPERU's operations. As a case in point, Bank encouragement played an
important part in the use of a project management firm in connection with the
proposed project. Bank involvement would also provide continued support for
improved energy policies on the part of the Government, particularly in the
crucial area of petroleum product pricing.
III. THE BORROWER
Background
3.01     The national oil company, Petroleos del Peru (PETROPERU), was estab-
lished by Decree-Law 17753 on July 24, 1969, following nationalization, in
October 1968, of the production and refining operations of IPC. At the same
time, PETROPERU absorbed the production operations of the Empresa Petrolera
Fiscal (EPF), a state-owned oil company with production operations in the
northern Peruvian coastal region near the acreage of IPC, and assumed respon-
sibility for management and administration of IPC's production and refining
operations. In 1973, PETROPERU acquired five other small companies which had
been privately owned. As a result of these acquisitions, PETROPERU now
accounts for 22% of Peru's crude oil production, 100% of refinery capacity,
and 98% of the marketing of petroleum products. PETROPERU was given status
equivalent to a private corporation by Legislative Decree 43 of March 4,
1981. This latter action gave PETROPERU somewhat greater independence from
the Government than in the past in some specific activities -- e.g., in the
matter of salary levels and procurement procedures -- thus permitting
PETROPERU to avoid personnel problems and procedural delays encountered in im-
plementation of Loan 1806-PE and other projects. Nevertheless, PETROPERU is
still very dependent on Government policies in the petroleum sector which
affect the company significantly.
Operations
3.02     PETROPERU is the official entity for conducting all Government acti-
vities in the hydrocarbon sector, including exploration, production, refining,
and marketing of all petroleum products, as well as activities related to
pipeline transportation of crude oil, fertilizer production, and petrochemi-
cals. PETROPERU, through a subsidiary, also has a small fleet of petroleum
tankers used to transport crude oil and petroleum products between the
Peruvian coastal ports as well as for river transport in the Peruvian Amazon
region.
3.03     PETROPERU produced on the average 42,000 BD in 1981.  Its refining
operations comprise six refineries which have an overall capacity of approxi-
mately 178,400 BD. PETROPERU has a network of storage depots and retail out-
lets throughout the country. Except in the case of lubricants, PETROPERU is
the sole marketer of petroleum products in the country. The other major



- 26 -
petroleum facility owned by PETROPERU is the 856-km Trans-Andean pipeline
(paragraph 2.38).
Organization
3.04     PETRG2ERU is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of nine mem-
bers. The Chairman of the Board is the company's highest ranking official.
Three members of the Board are appointed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines,
three by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Commerce, one member represents
the Armed Forces, and the remaining two members represent PETROPERU's profes-
sional and working-level employees, in accordance with Peru's industrial
legislation requirements. The present Board includes a high proportion of
individuals with experience in private business and industry. None of the
managers of the key operating departments, including the General Manager, is
represented on the Board.
3.05     The Board has responsibility for approving all policy matters related
to personnel administraton, general salary increases, investment decisions,
and budgets. Nevertheless, the Government's policy decisions concerning the
petroleum sector (prices, taxes, etc.) have a direct impact on PETROPERU's
finances which still limits the company's autonomy in an important way.
3.06     The Chairman of PETROPERU's Board is the company's chief executive,
although he has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Vice Chairman
and conceatraLes on policy matters. The Gcneral Manager, who reports to the
Vice Chairman and works in collaboration with the key operational managers of
the exploration-production, refining, and engineering departments, has respon-
sibility for day-to-day operational matters. The authority of the General
Manager is relatively limited, however, and many matters such as minor opera-
tional investment decisions are referred directly to the Doard.  The field
offices, whose managers report directly to the General Manager (see Organi-
zation Chart in Annex 5), have limited authority and routine operational
matters are frequently submitted to Lima for approval. The general lack of
managerial authority within PETROPERU and Government regulation of procure-
ment, salaries, and travel have contributed to the current weak institutional
situation of the company.
3.07     PETROPERU's management and organization is being reviewed at the cor-
porate level in the context of a study being carried out by ADL and financed
under Loan 1806-PE. The study provides a diagnosis of the main weaknesses in
PETROPERU's organization and recommends a series of measures to improve
PETROPERU's management capabilities and systems. Among the measures currently
under study is the "FIDEICOMISO," (or "trustee") concept, originally developed
by PETROPERU, which would relieve the company from responsibilities other than
exploration, production, transportation, refining and industrial activities.
Under this concept, PETROPERU would be treated on the same basis as its con-
tractors for exploration and production, and as a service company for its
refinery operations. Thus, PETROPERU would be relieved by the Government of
the financial and heavy administrative burdens it now bears directly on behalf
of the State. Adoption of such an institutional arrangement, which would
leave to the Government,instead of PETROPERU, the role of clearinghouse for



- 27 -
taxes and subsidies, could put PETROPERU on a sound financial base rapidly and
permit evaluation of its "real" financial performance (see paragraph 5.01).
3.08     In addition to elaborating alternative organizational structures
(regional versus functional), the ADL study mentioned above deals particularly
with (i) PETROPERU's logistics department, whose procedures are inefficient,
causing long delays in implementation of projects, and (ii) PETROPERTJ's plan-
ning department, which needs improvements if it is to carry out its tasks
effectively. PETROPERU has begun reviewing ADL's recommendations and is al-
ready planning to make improvements concerning (i), above, possibly with the
help of consultants. On (ii), above, terms of reference for consulting ser-
vices to improve PETROPERU's planning activities have been prepared in the
context of an investment planning study to be financed under Loan 1806-PE.
Staffing, Management and Salaries
3.09     The number of PETROPERU employees totals about 8,700, of which 1,800
are professionals. Approximately 1,400 of PETROPERU's staff work at the cen-
tral headquarters in Lima; the bulk of its employees are located in
PETROPERU's field offices, the most important of which are in Talara and
Iquitos (See Map No.16174). The Talara installation employs approximately
4,200 persons and the Iquitos office approximately 900.
3.10     PETROPERU's senior executives are generally competent and have exten-
sive experience in the petroleum industry in Peru. The company's middle
management, however, are much less experienced and have been weakened by the
loss of numerous technical and administrative staff over the past several
years. These losses have been primarily due to salary difficulties within the
company since 1976, when there was a resurgence of world petroleum activity by
private companies which provided alternative sources of employment for
PETROPERU's experienced operating personnel. The exploration and production
department in Lima, alone, lost almost 50% of its technical staff in 1978.
3.11     In 1980, the Government adopted a series of measures aimed at improv-
ing the salary structure of all major public sector enterprises, including
PETROPERU. In particular, such enterprises were freed from salary ceilings
which had severely limited their ability to raise compensation to competitive
levels. This action permitted PETROPERU to authorize a series of salary
increases, accompanied by additional benefits, starting in March 1980. Pro-
fessionals employed in PETROPERU now have salaries comparable to those of
Peruvians employed by private petroleum companies in the country and the man-
power drain to the latter oil companies in Peru has almost ceased. PETROPERU
is still, however, losing some of its most competent staff who emigrate to
oil-producing countries such as Venezuela and Argentina where they enjoy
greater responsibilities as well as more attractive salary packages. In the
context of the organizational structure study undertaken under Loan 1806-PE
(paragraph 3.07), this issue is being addressed by proposing the definition of
career development plans and benefit packages which would contribute to
retaining PETROPERU's most competent staff. Moreover, assurances were ob-
tained during loan negotiations that PETROPERU would, in accordance with its



- 28 -
statutes, take all action necessary to ensure that its professional salaries
would be competitive with those of private oil companies operating in Peru; in
addition it would inform the Bank at least every 12 months of any vacancies in
its exp:Loration and production departments and the actions it intends to take
to fill such vacancies.
3.12     In order to help remedy PETROPERU's past losses of experienced em-
ployees, Loan 1806-PE also included funds to train PETROPERU's staff in main-
tenance and repair of the facilities (pumps, workover rig) financed by that
loan, as well as in connection with the reservoir engineering studies also being
carried out under the aforementioned loan. The training programs being imple-
mented have been proceeding satisfactorily. It is therefore proposed that under
the proposed loan, the training effort be continued as part of PETROPERU's
supervision of the Laguna and Zapotal project (see paragraph 4.38).
Accounting and Auditing
3.13     PETROPERU's accounting and budgeting systems have long been inade-
quate as they were the result of an effort to standardize procedures inher-
ited from IPC, EPF, and other companies absorbed by PETROPERU, rather than to
develop modern financial and management information systems now prevailing in
the industry.  PETROPERU's internal audit department, under the direztion of a
Chief Internal Auditor, reports directly to the company's Board of Directors
and is subject to audit review by the Government's Office of the Comptroller
and Auditor General of Peru. No external auditing was undertaken until 1976,
and the external auditors were unable to certify PETROPERU's accounts for the
years 1976 through 1979, pending subsequent settlement, through the Govern-
ment, of taxes to be paid by PETROPERU and its contractors for these years.
As agreed under Loan 1806-PE, a considerable effort has been made, however, to
clarify PETROPERU's financial position in recent years and the 1980 and 1981
accounts have been certified by a Peruvian firm of independent external audi-
tors affiliated with a large U.S. auditing firm. PETROPERU would continue to
have its accounts audited by independent auditors and submit to the Bank each
year, no later than five months after the end of the fiscal period, an exter-
nally audited report of its financial statements.
3.14     With a view to addressing the problems described above, two addi-
tional studies were financed as components of Loan 1806-PE. The first, under-
taken by Price Waterhouse & Company, is aimed at modernizing PETROPERU's over-
all accounting, budgeting, and internal auditing procedures. Bank staff dis-
cussed the consultant's recommendations with PETROPERU's top management in
early 1982, and a phased action program will soon be presented to the Bank
for partial financing with funds from Loan 1806-PE. The second study, ini-
tiated in August 1981, by a Peruvian auditing firm associated with Price
Waterhouse in Peru, is aimed at helping PETROPERU carry out an in-depth study
of its fixed assets, including a much-needed physical inventory and book re-
conciliation, and assets revaluation and depreciation procedures. This study
was comp:Leted in June 1982, and PETROPERU has already taken steps to implement
the consultant's recommendations.



- 29 -
Insurance
3.15     PETROPERU carries adequate comprehensive insurance on all its facili-
ties and equipment against fire, blowouts, damage, earthquakes and theft.
Insurance agreements are entered into directly by PETROPERU, either with
foreign insurance companies or local insurance companies reinsured by foreign
insurance companies.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Background and Objectives
4.01     Historically, most of Peru's crude oil has been produced from the on-
shore and offshore northwestern coastal area close to Talara (Map IBRD 16175).
This area has been in production since the 1920s and until the early 1960s met
all of Peru's domestic oil requirements. More than 10,000 wells have been
drilled in the area and approximately one billion barrels of crude oil pro-
duced.
4.02     Current production from the Talara area is approximately 69,000 BD,
about one-third of which comes from PETROPERU's production operations.
PETROPERU's production in this area, however, has been declining steadily for
many years, down from 63,000 BD in 1965 to 31,000 BD in 1978, and 22,000 BDIl/
in 1981. Despite the large number of wells drilled and extensive production
history, a considerable volume of oil can still be recovered with little or no
risk through reactivation of old wells, further extension and infill drilling,
and possible application of secondary recovery methods in known producing
areas. However, PETROPERU's investment capacity has been curtailed by its
limited financial, technical, and managerial resources up to now, resulting in
a decline of its share of production.
4.03     After the departure of a number of its most experienced staff about
three years ago, PETROPERU came to recognize its major weaknesses in prepa-
ration, appraisal, and implementation of petroleum projects. While PETROPERU
is counting on the Bank-financed Petroleum Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1806-
PE) to help improve its capabilities to carry out studies on its own, it has
also financed several consulting firms to help perform priority field
investigations I . In particular, early in 1981, a private consultant helped
PETROPERU complete a feasibility study on the Laguna-Zapotal petroleum
production enhancement project. As a result, in late 1981, the Government
1/ Production from areas under the Oxy-Bridas operating contract with
PETROPERU excluded after 1978.
2/ An oil company, MAPCO, had carried out an evaluation of production
potential on the northwest coast near Talara, outside the Oxy-Bridas area,
but did not include sufficient technical and economic details required as
a basis for a specific project.



- 30 -
officially requested the IBRD to participate in the financing of this pro-
ject. The Bank concluded that the proposed project fitted well within the
overall development strategy for Peru's energy sector and would provide an
opportunity for supporting a high return priority project while achieving
further improvements in PETROPERU's operating efficiency and financial per-
formance. A Bank mission therefore visited Peru in October 1981, to appraise
the project, which would be part of an overall program aimed at increasing oil
reserves and enhancing production in some of the old oilfields of the area.
An important new element of the proposed project would be the employment by
PETROPERU of a project management service company (PMSC) from the private
sector to help implement and supervise the project (paragraphs 4.14, 4.21 and
4.23).
4.04     The objectives of the project, in keeping with the Government's
strategy for developing the petroleum sector in Peru, are to increase produc-
tion through more efficient exploitation of PETROPERU's Laguna and Zapotal
fields and to further strengthen PETROPERU's operating capacity.
4.05     PETROPERU holds title to the project area.  By law, all hydrocarbons
in situ belong to the State. Once extracted, they are the property of
PETROPERU.
Project Description
4.06     The project would consist of two main components: (i) enchancement of
existing oil production in the Laguna and Zapotal'fields; and (ii) consultancy
services and training.
1. Enhancement of Existing Oil Production
(a)  provision of infrastructure for carrying out the project, i.e.,
lodging and office space for both PETROPERU and project management
service company personnel, facilities for storage of equipment, and
related services;
(b)  acquisition of well completion materials and pumping equipment for
159 new wells and 76 existing wells to be worked over;
(c)  acquisition of surface facilities consisting of flowlines, separa-
tors, storage tanks, pumps, and related instrumentation;
(d)  provision of drilling, completion and recompletion, and well workover
services; and
(e)  services of a project management service company to coordinate and
supervise implementation and production operations of the production
enhancement program in the Laguna-Zapotal fields for the account, and
under the general supervision of, PETROPERU.
4.07     The drilling of about 159 new wells and working over of about 76 old
wells under the production enhancement component would be carried out over a



- 31 -
period of four years (1983-86) through contracts with drilling services com-
panies using four drilling rigs. This program is technically feasible and
reasonable in light of the expected production level and is consistent with
worldwide industry practice. Total incremental production would be 40 million
barrels over the life of the project.
4.08     Geologically, the Laguna-Zapotal project area (74 km2) _/ is part of
the complex of the Talara basin characterized principally by intensive normal
faulting which resulted in numerous large blocks distributed throughout
various structures. The large blocks themselves were further broken down into
several small blocks. Because of its effect on hydrocarbon reservoirs, the
intensity of normal faulting in the Talara region is an important factor in
the production performance of the wells and is usually taken into account when
new wells are drilled. The productive reservoirs in the Laguna-Zapotal pro-
ject area are overlapping and consist of the Echinocyamus (4,200 ft), Mogollon
(7,800 ft) and Amotape (8,400 ft) with 21, 76, and 19 productive wells, res-
pectively, in 1981. Total production averaged 5,300 BD in 1981, with 85% con-
tributed by the Mogollon reservoir.
4.09     The Echinocyamus reservoir is primarily constituted by quartzitic
sandstones with an average thickness of 400 ft, decreasing to the east due to
the Pre-Talara unconformity. The porosity and permeability of the Echino-
cyamus reservoir are 16 percent and 20 millidarcies, respectively. The
Mogollon reservoir is the most productive in the area with an average thick-
ness of 1,800 feet and is constituted primarily by quartz conglomerates and
sandstone intercalations. With an average porosity of 7%, the Mogollon reser-
voir is affected by faulting and its productivity is greatly improved by hy-
draulic fracturing. The 400-ft thick Amotape reservoir consists of quartzites
and shales intensively fractured and produces from it superior level. This
reservoir is lesser known because of its depth (8,400 feet) and very compli-
cated petrophysical characteristics.
4.10     Of the 159 new wells, 23 will be drilled in the Amotape reservoir,
109 in the Mogollon reservoir, and 27 in the Echinocyamus reservoir. The
wells not found to be productive in the Amotape, which is the deepest of the
three reservoirs, will be completed in the Mogollon, and those found to be un-
productive in the Mogollon will be recompleted in the Echinocyamus reser-
voir. The 76 existing wells will be worked over as follows: 55 will be re-
completed to produce from additional reservoirs in the same wells, 14 will be
reopened to production, and 7 will be stimulated to improve production. Out
of the 76 wells selected, 19 will produce from the Mogollon and 57 from the
Echinocyamus reservoirs.
4.11     The wells producing from the Amotape reservoir will need installation
of pumps 2-3 years after initial production. Since the wells producing from
the Mogollon and Echinocyamus reservoirs may require pumps from the start of
1/ See IBRD Map 16175.



- 32 -
production, the project accordingly provides for their installation, if re-
quired.
4.12     The topography in the project area is rather flat and permits easy
access via dirt roads which connect existing wells. Terrain conditions are
favorable for the laying of gathering pipelines and installing tank batteries
and puraping stations needed to send petroleum to storage tanks at El Alto
(IBRD Map 16175) about 15 km west of the project area. While the capacity of
surface facilities now in the area is sufficient for handling production from
existing wells, an expansion of storage tank capacity and the pumping station
will be necessary under the proposed project to handle additional production
from the new wells.
4.13     The project would provide living accommodations for PETROPERU staff
and contract personnel, office space, and storage hangars for the materials
and equipment -- all of which would be located near the project area but not
far from either Talara in the south or Mancora in the north.
4.14     While PETROPERU would be responsible for overall execution of the
project, it proposes to contract a project management service company (PMSC)
to be directly charged with day-to-day operational supervision and coordina-
tion of all subcontractors' work on behalf, and for the account of, PETROPERU,
including elaboration of detailed work programs and budget estimates, and
preparation and evaluation of, and recommendations on, bids for equipment,
materials, and services. The PMSC will report to a PETROPERU Project Unit
(PPU), which has already been established and will soon be staffed for this
project. The PPU will be empowered to authorize and approve recommendations
made by the PMSC. PETROPERU is in the process of hiring consultants to help
its PPU monitor the work of the PMSC. (For further details, see Project Imple-
mentation, paragraph 4.22 and 4.23).
2. Consultancy Services and Training
4.15     This component would provide consultants to:
(a)  help the PPU supervise the PMSC and undertake studies to upgrade the
production enhancement program as more information is obtained during
implementation;
(b)  help the PPU undertake studies to prepare similar projects in the
same area or adjacent areas, and;
(c)  train PETROPERU's less experienced operating personnel in the field,
with the PMSC, the PPU, and abroad. The trainees selected by
PETROPERU will be in addition to the operational staff required by
the PPU.
4.16     The first category of studies referred to above consists of an update
of the existing feasibility study for the proposed project as more data
becomes available during implementation. Calculations of reserves and
production performance (Annex 6) were made on the basis of the past production



- 33 -
production performance (Annex 6) were made on the basis of the past production
history (10 years) of the existing wells. While the reserves and production
performance calculated on this basis are correct, they do not reflect the
reserves which could be drained by full development of Laguna-Zapotal. These
reserves could only be determined if more pressure data were available.
Because of the scarcity of petrophysical and pressure data related to the
Laguna-Zapotal fields, the reserves and production potential of the project as
now calculated -- while substantial -- could be grossly underestimated.
Accordingly, during implementation of the new project, the PPU plans to
collect the necessary data while using the expertise of consultants to help
develop and apply good reservoir management practices to Laguna-Zapotal.
4.17     Under the second category of studies, the PPU will make an evaluation
as to whether or not the well spacing inherited from the IPC is justified
technically and economically. A priori, it seems that closer spacing could be
used without prejudice to oil recovery and with great economic benefit to
PETROPERU. The results of such a study might well have an enormous impact on
the level of Peru's recoverable oil reserves and production potential. Should
the results be successful, they could lead rapidly to several low-risk, infill
drilling projects in the Talara area which should very likely attract addi-
tional commercial bank financing.
4.18     Parallel to the studies referred to above, PETROPERU will conduct
feasibility studies for similar projects in areas adjacent to the Laguna-
Zapotal oil fields where PETROPERU is actually conducting production opera-
tions. These areas include all of "Area Lima", excluding areas under the Oxy-
Bridas contract (IBRD Map 16175). The studies will evaluate the geological
framework and production history of such areas and determine a development
program that is technically and economically feasible.
4.19     During loan negotiations, agreement with PETROPERU was reached
concerning submittal to the Bank annually, for comment, of updated versions of
the feasibility study for the project; and from time to time, as completed,
the results of studies on well-spacing, as well as feasibility studies for
similar projects in areas adjacent to Laguna-Zapotal, would be submitted to
the Bank for an exchange of views concerning the recommendations on a phased
program of development.
Status of Project Preparation
4.20     The feasibility study for enhancing production in the Laguna-Zapotal
fields -- carried out by PETROPERU with the help of a private consultant --
was completed in mid-1981, and formed the basis for Bank project appraisal.
The final feasibility report includes a description of the project area, its
geology, results of past drilling efforts, and the proposed program to be
implemented (number of wells, expected production, surface facilities, the
role of the PPU and of the PMSC, and cash-flow analysis).
4.21     PETROPERU has already prepared bidding documents for selecting a
PMSC, as well as a draft contract. It plans to send out bid invitations



- 34 -
shortly. PETROPERU's Board has also authorized establishment of the PPU,
which will be responsible for carrying out the project, and the company has
named a member of its staff with long experience in petroleum production
operations in the project area to head the PPU. Staffing of the PPU is under
way. In addition, PETROPERU has prepared terms of reference for the consul-
tants who will help the PPU and the Bank has already approved a short list.
Thus the management infrastructure required to carry out the project is pro-
gressing satisfactorily. In order to ensure prompt and effective launching of
the operation, PETROPERU will be required, as a condition of loan effective-
ness, to execute a contract with the PMSC selected, appoint the consultants to
help the PPU, and select trainees assigned to the PMSC and the PPU. To gain
time until the PMSC begins work in Peru, the PPU will start preparing bidding
documents for acquisition of materials, equipment, and services for the pro-
ject which will be reviewed and adapted by the PMSC.
Project Implementation
4.22     PETROPERU would be responsible for overall execution of the pro-
ject. The PPU, which would have day-to-day responsibility for the project,
will be staffed by engineers, geologists, and administrators who, with the
help of consultants, would ensure that the production enhancement program is
carried out according to a work program agreed upon by the PPU and the PMSC.
PETROPERU proposed, and the Bank agreed, that the PPU have sufficient autonomy
and be delegated the necessary authority to carry out the project effectively.
The project unit manager would report directly to the highest level of
PETROPERU's management and authorize and approve-contracts entered into, and
expenditures made, by the PMSC for the account of PETROPERU. The PPU would be
responsible for the definition of the overall program and final decisions on
contract awards.  With help from consultants, the PPU would also be respon-
sible for carrying out feasibility studies in the project area or adjacent
areas to define similar-type new projects and would prepare a training program
for its personnel in the field and abroad.
4.23     The PMSC would be responsible to the PPU for day-to-day operational
activities of the various subcontractors who, in turn, would carry out the
drilling and other specialized services (logging, fracturing and stimulation,
road infrastructure, etc.), the laying of pipelines, construction of surface
facilities, residences and offices for field personnel, and storage hangars.
The PMSC will prepare detailed technical programs and budgets required to im-
plement the project, prepare bidding documents, evaluate offers, and propose
awards to be authorized and approved by the PPU. The PMSC would be entrusted
with arranging for shipping, customs clearance and transport of equipment and
materials to the project site. It would also be responsible for hiring its
own foreign and local staff employed to carry out the project. Local staff
would, of course, be subject to Peruvian labor law. The PMSC would also sub-
mit, for PETROPERU's approval, technical recommendations to enhance produc-
tion. In this connection, in addition to receiving a fee to cover its overhead
and profit, the PMSC would be provided an incentive bonus for oil production
above an agreed-upon production target. These procedures are acceptable to
PETROPERU's management and have received the required approval from the



- 35 -
company's Board. As mentioned earlier, execution of a contract between
PETROPERU and the PMSC selected would be a condition of loan effectiveness.

Project Costs
4.25     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$240.0 million.  Of
this total, US$150.4 million, (net of duties and taxes), or 63% of total
costs, would represent the foreign exchange component. Costs of equipment,
materials, drilling and consulting services have been evaluated on the basis
of actual prices paid recently by PETROPERU for similar operations.
4.26     Physical contingencies have been estimated on the basis of an overall
composite 10% rate for equipment, materials, and consulting services. Price
contingencies are based on projected international price increases of 8% per
annum for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985, and 6% for 198o  Local cost con-
tingencies have been calculated in US dollar equivalents l on the assumption
that the internal inflation rate in Peru will be matched by continuous adjust-
ments of the exchange rate, which reflects Peru's policy in this area.
4.27     A total of about 600 man/months of services would be required of the
PMSC, based on estimated unit costs of about US$18,000 per man/month. Consul-
tancy services (about 110 man/months) have also been estimated on the basis of
unit costs of about US$18,000 per man/month, including travel, subsistence,
and overhead. This amount approximates costs for similar specialized services
recently financed under Bank loans in Latin America and is consistent with
prevailing fees in the petroleum industry.
4.28     Estimated costs of the project are summarized below:

component.
2/ Includes about US$24.0 million customs duties and taxes.

The proposed Bank loan of US$81.2 million (including the US$1.2 million for
the Bank's front-end fee) would cover about 33% of total financing require-
ments for the project (54% of total foreign exchange requirements). PETROPERU
would make available the equivalent of US$40 million for local cost financing,
mainly by providing equity. The remaining US$120 million would come from co-
financing sources in the form of export credits for equipment and part of the
services, and from commercial banks for the balance of financing required. In
order to maximize long-term funds, PETROPERU might also borrow from commercial
banks for interest payable during the early years of the implementation
period.
Co-financing
4.30     To help identify and negotiate co-financing for the proposed project,
PETROPERU entered into a contract with Bechtel Financial Services. With the
assistance of this firm, COFIDE, and Bank staff, PETROPERU made an intensive
effort to arrange for export credits and commercial bank loans in major
supplying countries. As a result, PETROPERU has received offers from the
official export credit agencies of Japan, the U.K., and the United States for
the equipment and some of the services required for the project. In the case
of all of these agencies, the financing of services would be conditional on
procurement of some equipment. Terms for the export credit would be 11-12
years, including grace periods of two-four years at about 12 percent p.a. plus
fees and other financial charges. In addition, Canadian, Japanese, U.K., and
U.S. commercial banks have shown considerable interest in helping to finance
the project. It is expected that firm commitments for the export credits and
the bulk of commercial bank financing will have been obtained by PETROPERU
before the proposed loan has been made effective.
4.31     Once similar projects in PETROPERU's production enhancement program
emerge from the studies proposed as part of the production enhancement pro-
ject, additional co-financing might well be forthcoming.  By that time, some
positive results from the Laguna-Zapotal project should be available and help
encourage potential lenders. Moreover, by then, PETROPERU's financial condi-
tion should have improved, thereby making the company a more attractive bor-
rower. The specific projects for which additional co-financing is contem-
plated would be either within the Laguna-Zapotal project area or in nearby
fields.



- 39 -
4.32     If additional co-financing for the project becomes available during
the course of implementation, consideration would be given by the Bank, at the
request of PETROPERU, to use loan funds to finance similar works in areas
adjacent to Laguna-Zapotal after their feasibility has been ascertained on the
basis of studies to be financed under the Bank loan.
Proposed Loan Terms
4.33     It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to PETROPERU with the guar-
antee of the Government at the current lending rate, plus the normal guarantee
fee, for a period of 17 years, including 4 years of grace. The principal
equipment items for the production enhancement component -- namely, the well
completion and pumping equipment, gathering lines, manifolds, separators, tank
batteries, and a pumping station -- have an average productive life of at
least 20 years; oil reserves in the project area are sufficient to sustain
production for at least the same period. On the basis of the above consider-
ations, and in view of PETROPERU's need for longer term financing -- given its
current weak financial position -- the loan terms mentioned above are recom-
mended.
Disbursement and Allocation of Bank Loan
4.34     The proposed Bank loan of US$ 81.2 million would finance the follow-
ing items:
(i)   100% of foreign expenditures for completion and recompletion ser-
vices under subcomponent (d), paragraph 4.06 (1);
(ii)  60% of total expenditures for drilling_/ and well workover services 1/
under subcomponent (d), paragraph 4.06 (1);
(iii) 100% of foreign expenditures for the services to be carried out by
the PMSC under subcomponent (e), paragraph 4.06 (1);
(iv)  100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for con-
sultancy services to be carried out under project subcomponents 2(a)
and 2(b), paragraph 4.15;
(v)   100% of foreign expenditures for training under project subcomponent
2(c), paragraph 4.15; and
(vi)  100% of the US$1.2 million represented by the Bank's front-end fee.
Retroactive financing up to of US$2.0 million would be made for expenditures
after July 31, 1982 for services of the PMSC expected to be contracted after
1/ Corresponding to two rigs during the first two years and four rigs during
the remaining period of the contract.



- 40 -
that date but very likely before the proposed loan is signed. This contract
is urgent because the services of the PMSC will be crucial to carrying out lt e
rest of the project. Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected as follows:_
Bank Fiscal Years
1983      1984       1985       1986      1987
(US $ Million)
Incremental         13.1       11.2      22.0       24.3       10.6
Cumulative          13.1       24.3      46.3       70.6       81.2
The loan would be fully disbursed by December 31, 1986.
Procurement
4.35     Drilling services to be financed by the Bank loan will be procured by
international competitive bidding procedures following Bank guidelines. Ser-
vices of a highly specialized type which are required for well completion/re-
completion, workover and drilling operations would be procured under limited
international tendering. Selection of the PMSC would be made in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (Part IV-Engineering Firms).
In the evaluation process a 65% weight will apply for the technical capacity
of the firm, and the remaining 35% to the firm's financial proposal which
would consist of its cost plus fee and production incentive bonus. Special-
ized consultants would also be selected following the Bank's guidelines for
procurement of consultant services.
Project Risks
4.36     The risks associated with the project are those inherent in petroleum
production. The lQng productive history of the Laguna-Zapotal fields estab-
lishes a high degree of confidence in the recoverable reserve estimates and
production levels of each of the three reservoirs in these fields. If one of
the deeper reservoirs is found to be unproductive, the well will then be re-
completed in the upper reservoirs, thus reducing the chances that any well
would be dry. Nonetheless, production from the fields has been calculated on
the assumption that only 83% of the wells would be completed as producers in
the upper reservoir. While PETROPERU has accummulated a considerable amount
of geological experience in the Talara coastal area and has competent geolo-
gists, it lacks personnel in reservoir engineering and project management and
operations to carry out the project on its own. Since a project management
service company will coordinate and supervise day-to-day operations, little
difficulty is anticipated in the implementation of this project.
1/ This disbursement estimate is not based on an historical profile normally
applied according to actual experience with Bank loans in various sectors.



- 41 -
4.37     There are some risks of delays in project implementation associated
with bid preparation and evaluation, contract award decisions by PETROPERU's
Board of Directors, and in customs clearance of equipment and materials and
their transport to the field. In order to reduce such risks, the Bank has
agreed with PETROPERU that preparation and evaluation of bids for equipment,
materials, and services be carried out by the PMSC which would also be
entrusted with arranging for customs clearance and transport of equipment and
materials to the project site. This procedure, which has been ratified by
PETROPERU's Board, is designed to avoid time-consuming clearances by various
committees within PETROPERU as well as by its logistics department, all of
which have proved to be very slow and inefficient in the past.
Training
4.38     PETROPERU has lost many of its experienced engineering and operating
personnel in the past four years. Operating personnel, as well as geologists,
engineers, and less experienced supervisors would therefore receive on-the-job
training both within PETROPERU's project unit. Technical support for train-
ing, would be provided in Peru by consultants and the PMSC, as well as
abroad. PETROPERU and the Bank have agreed thus far that at least five staff
members of the company will be trained in geological evaluation, reservoir
engineering, production operations, and project management. Approximately 60
man-months of consultant staff time has been allocated for this purpose.
Environmental Considerations and Safety
4.39     Sixteen housing units will be built for families and one residential
unit built for single workers. In addition, there will be a house for visit-
ing guests and a social club and restaurant for the use of the personnel. A
drinking water treatment plant is also programmed as part of the housing com-
plex and there is no shortage of water in the area. The housing units will be
constructed either near the town of Mancora in the north, or Talara in the
south, to take advantage of existing community services and benefits. The
topography in the project area is rather flat and semi-desertic but with a
good drainage system towards the ocean. No major environmental risks are
likely to result from implementation of the project since all fluids (drilling
muds, oil, etc.) are either used in a closed system or reused continuously
without being discharged on the ground surface. PETROPERU's overall safety
record has been good and safety practices routinely used are in accord with
acceptable petroleum industry practices.
Schedule and Reporting
4.40     The proposed project is scheduled to be completed by December 1986.
During negotiations agreement was reached with PETROPERU to issue quarterly
reports on the progress of each of the project sub-components.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
5.01     PETROPERU's financial performance must be analyzed in the context of
the specific role that the company plays in the petroleum sector. This role
is twofold: (i) the traditional role of an integrated oil company which in-
cludes exploration, development, refining, and distribution activities, and
(ii) the role of a national oil company with overall responsibility for devel-
opment of the petroleum resources of the country; in this context, PETROPERU
contracts to private oil companies the exploration and development of certain
areas, generally under production-sharing contracts, and pays to the Govern-
ment the taxes, other than the income tax, of these companies out of its
share. In addition, PETROPERU is the vehicle through which domestic petroleum
prices are subsidized. The second part of PETROPERU's role is heavily depen-
dent upon the Government's fiscal and pricing policies so that PETROPERU's
degree of financial autonomy is rather limited and its overall performance
difficult to assess. In addition, Peru has recently been confronted with high
inflation rates (about 60% in 1980, and 74% in 1981) which results in some
distortion of accounting figures as PETROPERU revalues only those parts of its
assets which have been financed by foreign exchange loans.
Past Financial Performance
5.02     After several years of poor financial performance due largely to
subsidized ex-refinery prices and a high tax burden, PETROPERU was able,
somewhat, to improve its profitability and overall financial position in
1980. This improvement was mostly due to (i) the implementation, in December
1979, of Decree Law 22775, which reduced the tax burden on PETROPERU, parti-
cularly concerning taxes paid on behalf of contractors (see paragraph 2.21);
and (ii) government equity injections totaling S/69 billion in 1980 -- S/45
billion over and above the Government automatic equity injection (see para-
graph 2.21). The financial covenants stipulated in Loan 1806-PE were met for
fiscal year 1980. The following table highlights the main financial indica-
tors for the past five years, based on audited accounts, and shows the improv-
ing trend in profitability (net income of S/6.9 billion in 1980 versus S/0.7
billion in 1978), liquidity (current ratio of 0.94 in 1980 versus 0.80 in
1978), and capital structure ( total debt/equity ratio of 79/21 in 1980 versus
93/7 in 1978). While these results indicated that the Government had taken
the necessary measures to achieve the financial improvements envisioned in
Loan 1806-PE for 1980, further corrective steps still remained to be taken in
the ensuing years to ensure long-term financial viability of the company.

Present Financial Situation
5.03     Although PETROPERU's financial condition had improved somewhat in
1980, the year of 1981 was characterized by a reverse trend in profitability
and a deterioration of the company's financial position. As a result, the
debt service coverage ratio was 1.2 rather than 1.4 and the quick ratio 0.5
rather than 0.7, as covenanted in Loan 1806-PE for 1981. Both covenants were
met for 1980. PETROPERU has been meeting its cash flow needs recently through
extensive short-term borrowings (about US$115 million equivalent by December
31, 1981). The following section describes the main factors which have been
causing this decrease in profitability. In brief, these factors are (i) the
continued financial subsidization of domestic prices, (ii) the still heavy tax
burden of PETROPERU, (iii) the decrease in PETROPERU's own production, and
(iv) the impact on PETROPERU of the investment tax credit introduced in 1981.
5.04     PETROPERU's domestic sales of petroleum products represented about
three-f'ourths of total sales by volume in 1981. However, due to the subsidi-
zation of petroleum products sales in the domestic market -- particularly
keroserLe, fuel oil and diesel oil (see paragraph 2.15) -- and because of the
high direct taxation rate on these sales, which results in PETROPERU receiving
only 53% of the average retail price, domestic sales account for only one-half
of PETROPERU's operating revenues. The ex-refinery price to PETROPERU for
domest'c sales of petroleum products averaged about US$14.0 per barrel in
1981 19, which compares to an average operating cost (including the cost of
crude) of about US$20 per barrel. PETROPERU has direct influence on only
about 26% of this cost (labor, materials,and services). The other 74% repre-
sents purchases of crude (42%), taxes (22%), and depreciation (10%). About
17% of PETROPERU's crude requirements is purchased from its contractors at
prices near international levels (average of US$33.2 per bbl in 1981) indexed
to a basket of OPEC crudes. PETROPERU is offsetting part of its losses in the
domestic market by gains in the export market where crude and petroleum pro-
ducts are sold at spot prices. The downward trend of spot market prices --
which had declined to the level of long-term contract prices in 1981 -- has
also contributed to the decrease in PETROPERU's profitability in that year.
5.05     Current tax policy of the Government requires PETROPERU not only to
pay heavy taxes on its own operations, but also to pay the taxes levied on its
contracitors' operations except for their income and profit remittance tax. Ex-
cluding income taxes, _ total taxes paid by PETROPERU represent about 24% of
its 1981 revenues. Taxes paid on behalf of contractors in that year amounted
to about US$180 million equivalent, which, when related to the 50% share of
1/ Taking into account the sale of jet fuel and various derivatives, e.g.,
lubricants, etc., at prices significantly above international levels, and
which represent 20% of domestic sales, but only 8% of the sales volume in
the domestic market.
2/ PETROPERU did not pay any income tax in 1981 in view of its negligible net
income in that year.



- 45 -
contractors' production kept by PETROPERU (65,700 BD), represented a cost of
US$7.50 per barrel.
5.06     PETROPERU's petroleum production has been steadily decreasing from
the 46,000 BD level in 1979 to 43,800 BD in 1980, and 42,000 BD in 1981.
(PETROPERU's budgeted production for 1981 was 59,100 BD -- the level assumed
in the appraisal report for Loan 1806-PE.) Failure to meet these production
targets can be attributed largely to: (i) an overestimate, on the part of
PETROPERU's management and key staff, of the company's technical and financial
capacity required to meet production targets, (ii) delays in drilling and in-
stallation of pumps in La Selva oilfields, and (iii) a low operating effi-
ciency due to the lack of high-level supervisers in the field, and equipment
necessary for production maintenance. This has resulted in the need for
PETROPERU to purchase additional oil from the contractors at prices near
international levels, consequently increasing PETROPERU's operating costs
drastically. With recent progress under Loan 1806-PE, these weaknesses are
being corrected gradually and better production results are being achieved
(paragraph 5.08 and Annex 7).
5.07     As mentioned earlier,to attract new investments by foreign oil com-
panies the Government introduced, in 1981, an investment tax credit which
reduces the contractor's income tax liabilities (paragraph 2.11). Since the
petroleum law approved in 1980 provides that the contractors must pay their
income taxes in kind to PETROPERU, the investment tax credit has reduced the
quantities of oil provided to PETROPERU from 28,400 BD in 1980 to about 20,700
BD in 1981. This new arrangement has resulted in increased investment in ex-
ploration and development by foreign companies which will result in additional
oil production in the long run. In the short run, however, this has also con-
tributed to the need for additional purchases of oil by PETROPERU from con-
tractors at international prices.
5.08     The foregoing analysis indicates that three conditions are essential
to improving PETROPERU's profitability in 1982: (i) a proper pricing policy
-- raising domestic prices periodically in real terms in 1982 to achieve
international levels by the end of the year -- which would permit PETROPERU
not only to recover its costs, but also to generate, internally, sufficient
funds to self-finance a reasonable portion of its investment program (para-
graph 5.15); (ii) implementation of a rational investment program; and (iii)
improvement in operating efficiency, which would permit PETROPERU to reach an
average production of 56,900 BD in 1982. Although PETROPERU's budgeted pro-
duction for 1982 totaled 49,000 BD, output by the end of May 1982, had already
reached 52,000 BD, and with the start of production in August 1982 from its
new jungle field at Nueva Esperanza (6,000 BD) and installation of five hy-
draulic pumps financed under Loan 1806-PE, it is likely that the revised tar-
get of 56,900 BD for 1982, as a whole, will be attained. The need for price
increases is particularly important because the Government Budget for 1982
could not absorb alternative fiscal measures to improve PETROPERU's financial
position, such as reducing the tax burden on PETROPERU -- particularly taxes
paid on behalf of contractors -- or additional equity infusions to PETROPERU.

PETROPERU's Investments
5.09     Following high investments corresponding mostly to the construction
of the Trans-Andean pipeline in the years 1972-77 (US$800 million),
PETROPERU's capital outlays averaged only US$60 million per annum over the
years 1978-80. In 1981, the company's investments increased twofold, to about
the equivalent of US$137 million, 17% of which was made for exploration, 55%
for development, 19% for refineries, and 9% for pipelines and other distribu-
tion facilities. The low level of investment in the late 1970s is the conse-
quence not only of the limited amount of internal cash generated by PETROPERU,
but also its inadequate planning and implementing capacity caused partly by
the departure of a large number of qualified technical staff and by the com-
pany's cumbersome procurement procedures. The investment program prepared by
PETROPERU's planning staff for the years 1981-85 called for investments equi-
valent to US$220 million in 1982 and US$600 million, per annum, on average,
for 1983-85 (in 1981 dollars), I1  but does not adequately take into account
the financial and implementing capacity of the company. This program includes
about US$400 million for secondary recovery, US$420 million for new refinery
capacity, and US$500 million for a fertilizer and ammonia plant and for a
lubricants and paraffin plant.
5.10     As discussed above, given PETROPERU's weak financial situation and
its limited implementing capacity, it is highly unlikely that such a large
investment program will take place in the next five years. Therefore, this
report assumes a much less ambitious investment program than that of
PETROPERU, by taking into account Government policy concerning PETROPERU's
limited role in exploration and development activities (paragraph 1.30), and
making the reasonable assumption that some of the large investments proposed
by PETROPERU will be postponed until the second half of the 1980s. The in-
vestment program used in this report could, however, be modified in light of
the investment planning study to be undertaken shortly (paragraph 3.08), the
results of feasibility studies currently under way, and improvements in
PETROPERU's financial situation and implementing capacity. In any case,
agreement was obtained during loan negotiations that PETROPERU would review
with the Bank, annually, its five-year capital investment program and related
financial sources, no later than September 30 each year, and take measures
necessary to revise such programs so as to reflect the agreements reached.
5.11     The projection assumes that PETROPERU will limit its exploration
effort to the drilling of about three exploration wells per annum in the
jungle and perform some seismic work. Development would include principally:
(i)   the Laguna-Zapotal production enhancement project which would
be partly financed by the Bank under this proposed loan
(US$200 million);
1/ Excluding exploration and development investments in new areas, for which
PETROPERU's investment contribution has not yet been determined.



- 47 -
(ii)   continuation of rehabilitation program of the ATA wells; and
(iii)   investments required to continue efficient production in the
existing fields.
In addition, it is assumed that PETROPERU would start to undertake the follow-
ing development projects in the mid-1980s:
(i)   the Brea y Parinas Secondary Recovery Project (US$400 million)
for which studies are currently being undertaken with partial
Bank financing;
(ii)   another production enhancement project in the Talara region
(US$200 million), whose studies are to be financed under this
proposed loan; and
(iii)   investments I' in the new fields likely to be discovered in
the Selva.
5.12     The exploration and development investments proposed above would per-
mit PETROPERU to increase production from about 56,900 BD in 1982 to about
72,000 BD in 1986, and about 80,000 BD in 1990. This level of investment will
depend, in large measure, on continued action by the Government to increase
domestic oil prices needed, among other things, to provide PETROPERU with
funds for capital outlays. Realization of the investment and related signi-
ficant production increases, moreover, will also require a marked improvement
in PETROPERU's project implementation capacity, which could be made possible
through further use of project management service companies, as in the case of
the proposed arrangements agreed upon for the Laguna-Zapotal production en-
hancement operation.
5.13     Although PETROPERU's refining capacity is sufficient to satisfy
domestic needs, current assumptions on domestic demand growth (5% per year)
indicate that refinery capacity for middle distillates will be insufficient by
the mid-1980s. The investment program assumed below therefore includes about
US$300 million (in 1981 dollars) for construction of a new fluid catalytic
cracker at La Pampilla, and balancing equipment at the Talara and La Pampilla
refineries. PETROPERU is currently undertaking feasibility studies for these
investments, the timing and size of which are therefore only tentative.
5.14     The capital expenditures corresponding to the investment program out-
lined above are summarized below:
1/ Exploration and development investments for new fields are estimated at an
average cost of US$15 per barrel.

5.15     It is assumed that PETROPERU will finance about 45% of this invest-
ment program through long-term borrowings on commercial terms, export credits,
and the existing and proposed IBRD loans. Remaining investments would be
financed from internal cash generation and from the equity injections provided
automatically by the Government under Peruvian law. The financing plan for
PETROPERU's investment program during project implementation can be summarized
as follows:

It is projected that PETROPERU would completely repay its current level of
short-term borrowings in this period, and, as its financial position improves,
no major problems are foreseen for PETROPERU to borrow about US$650 million
from export credit agencies and commercial banks in addition to the funds
provided by the Bank under Loan 1806-PE, the recently approved refinery

engineering loan, and this proposed loan. These borrowings would be incurred,
for the most part, in the latter part of the investment period.
Financial Prospects
5.16     Financial projections have been prepared on the basis of the hypo-
theses discussed in the foregoing paragraphs concerning PETROPERU's investment
program and financing sources as well as on estimates of Peru's total petro-
leum production and demand. Export prices for crude and petroleum products
are assumed to average US$31 per barrel in 1982, and to remain constant in
real terms thereafter. Ex-refinery prices have been assumed to increase in
the same proportion as domestic prices,which are projected to reach interna-
tional levels by the end of 1982, to increase by 10% in real terms in 1983,
and to remain constant in real terms thereafter.
5.17     On these assumptions I, Annex 8 shows PETROPERU's projected income
statements, cash flows, as well as balance sheets with some of the key finan-
cial indicators summarized as follows:

- 51 -
5.18     The foregoing projections indicate that, although PETROPERU just
broke even in 1981, the ex-refinery price increases and higher production
planned for 1982 would allow PETROPERU to become profitable again and permit
generation of sufficient funds to undertake the proposed investment program
for that year. The projections also show that, on the basis of the assump-
tions summarized in paragraph 5.16 above, the Government will not need to
provide additional equity contributions in 1982 in excess of the estimated
US$80 million equivalent which will be granted automatically in accordance
with Decree-Law 22775.   Accordingly, PETROPERU's overall financial position
would greatly improve in 1982, as compared to 1981.  The debt service coverage
ratio would reach 2.4 -- substantially above the target stipulated in the Loan
1806-PE (1.9) -- indicating a rapid return to solvency. The quick ratio would
increase from 0.5 by year-end 1981, to 0.7 by year-end 1982, on the assumption
that PETROPERU would convert about US$60 million of short-term into long-term
debt. This ratio would still be somewhat below the targeted value of 0.9 in
Loan 1806-PE, but would reflect a significant improvement in the company's
liquidity position. Finally, the long-term debt/equity ratio would be
maintained at a level (68/32) for 1982, which is satisfactory as compared with
the target of 70/30 in Loan 1806-PE. These results are based on the
assumption that PETROPERU will not pay any dividends of the type stipulated by
Decree-Law 23337 of December 15, 1981, requiring state-owned companies to
remit 80% of their net profits to a fund managed by COFIDE, after taking into
account the solvency and liquidity situation of the companies. In view of
the need to strengthen PETROPERU's financial position, assurances were ob-
tained during loan negotiations that the Government would reinvest in
PETROPERU dividends declared by the company to the extent that such funds are
needed to carry out the company's five-year investment program.
5.19     The improving financial trend observed in 1982 would continue in 1983
and the following years as PETROPERU will benefit from higher ex-refinery
prices authorized by the Government and increases in its oil production as a
result of its investment program. The long-term financial ratios targeted in
Loan 1806-PE (debt service coverage ratio of 2 to 1, quick ratio of 1 to 1,
and long-term debt/equity ratio of 60/40) -- indicators of satisfactory debt-
servicing capacity, liquidity position and capital structure -- are projected
to be met in 1983 and the ensuing years.
5.20     This sound financial position would depend principally on realization
of the production levels assumed above for PETROPERU and its contractors, and
upon the country remaining a net exporter of crude through the 1980s. Sensi-
tivity analyses on the short-term projections show that if PETROPERU achieves
only 90% of projected production in 1982, its debt-service coverage ratio
would decline to 2.1, and the quick ratio to 0.6. Sensitivity analyses on the
long-term projections, based on much lower discovery rates in new fields than
historically observed, show a rapid deterioration of PETROPERU's financial
position unless ex-refinery prices for petroleum products are rapidly in-
creased towards international levels since PETROPERU, under these conditions,
would need to import crude by 1987. This scenario, however, is highly unlike-
ly as long as the Government maintains its current incentive policy for pri-
vate investments, which are successfully generating exploration efforts that
are bound to increase the country's proved reserves as in the past.

Summary Assessment and Financial Covenants
5.21     PETROPERU's financial position has deteriorated in 1981, in terms of
profitability and liquidity. If this situation persists, PETROPERU will not
be able to continue even the limited role it now plays in the exploration and
production activities. Nor will it be able to maintain its prominent role in
refinery and commercialization activities. Further, for Peru to remain a net
exporter of petroleum, it will be important for PETROPERU to implement a mini-
mum investment program for exploration and development and to increase its
productivity, complementing the exploration and development activities under-
taken by private companies.
5.22     In October 1981, the Government and PETROPERU discussed with the Bank
a financial recovery plan that would permit the company to maintain its
current role in the petroleum sector and put it on sound financial footing
once more. In particular, specific measures were tentatively agreed upon with
the Government and PETROPERU to ensure progressive compliance with the tar-
geted financial ratios of Loan 1806-PE for 1982 and the following years. This
financiaLl recovery plan is geared to a rapid return to profitability and the
safeguard of a minimum debt-servicing capability. In addition, it will permit
the undertaking of an investment program of the size proposed in paragraph
5.14, above, without causing a deterioration of PETROPERU's capital struc-
ture. The Government then expressed its intention:
(i) to implement an increase in the weighted average price of petroleum
products in the last quarter of 1981, of 50 soles per gallon.
(ii) to implement periodic increases in the average price of petroleum
products which would raise that price by at least 25% in real terms
in 1982.
5.23     The Government showed its commitment to the recovery plan by imple-
menting a price increase in early December 1981. Moreover, as indicated in
paragraph 2.19, the Government, thus far in 1982, has approved a series of
price increases which have raised the average price of petroleum products by
60% in sol terms, or 19% in US dollar terms, above the January 1, 1982 price
level. The average price of petroleum products is now about US$30.70 per
barrel, and the Government has confirmed its intention to reach international
levels by the end of the year (US$34 per barrel). The Government has also in-
dicated that it will approve any further price increases which might be
required in the following years for PETROPERU to achieve the financial targets
summarized below.
5.24     The financial covenants of Loan 1806-PE would be retained as
follows: debt service coverage above 1.9 by 1982 and 2.0 thereafter; a
minimum quick ratio of 0.7 and 0.9 by year-end 1982 and 1983, respectively,
(0.2 and 0.1, respectively, below the targets set in Loan 1806-PE), and 1.0
thereafter; and a long-term debt/equity ratio not greater than 70/30 by 1982,
and 60/40 thereafter.

VI. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
6.01     The Laguna-Zapotal production enhancement project will yield an eco-
nomic rate of return of 103 percent. This high rate of return results from
the fact that the investments are incremental and that the project would start
generating revenues in 1983; the project takes advantage of an established
production history of wells already drilled in the area, a good definition of
the remaining undeveloped reserves, and the existing oil pipeline for trans-
port of additional crude.
6.02     Despite the favorable  rate of return, PETROPERU was unable to under-
take the proposed project earlier, and on its own, because of the company's
financial constraints and lack of adequate staff required to prepare and im-
plement the operation. The launching of the project at this time was made
possible, in large part, as a result of the Bank's recommendation for the use
of a project management service company to help with project preparation, im-
plementation, and operation. The working arrangements under which the PMSC
would operate, and the related training opportunities for PETROPERU personnel,
are expected to provide PETROPERU with the capacity to prepare and oversee
additional high-return projects of a similar nature in the coastal area as
part of its overall program for petroleum production enhancement.
6.03     The project will increase production by about 40 million barrels over
the life of the project. This level of output has been evaluated from an es-
timate of a natural decline in production, without the project, of 8.8 percent
per year, based on historical data, and an estimated initial average output of
90 BD per new well drilled. Incremental production will reach 2,500 BD in
1983, 7,100 BD in 1984, and 12,600 BD in 1985, when production will start
declining. Investment costs, including physical contingencies but excluding
customs duties and taxes, have been estimated at US$184 million in mid-1982
prices. Incremental operating costs have been estimated at a fixed cost of
US$68,000 per well per annum plus a variable cost of US$2.45/bbl in mid-1982
prices. The incremental crude oil has been assumed to be exported at a price
of US$31 per barrel (mid-1982). On the basis of these assumptions, the pro-
ject would yield an economic rate of return of 103% to Peru. Details on the
incremental costs and benefits streams are given in Annex 9.
6.04     The incremental financial rate of return to PETROPERU of the Laguna
and Zapotal project is 35%, a substantial return but considerably lower than
the economic rate of return to Peru. This is due to the high tax burden for
PETROPERU, which includes a 55% income tax, import duties, a tax on exports,
and an 8% royalty. Details on the incremental financial costs and benefit
streams are given in Annex 9.
6.05     A sensitivity analysis on the economic and financial rates of return
of the project is summarized below. It indicates that the project would still
have a high economic yield to Peru under a variety of adverse scenarios con-
cerning production and/or prices, and investment costs, while the financial
rate of return to PETROPERU will be substantially above its average cost of
capital.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     The following agreements were reached during loan negotiations:
a)   PETROPERU would retain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of
1.9 in 1982, and 2.0 in 1983 and thereafter (paragraph 5.24);
b)   PETROPERU would achieve a minimum quick ratio of 0.7 by year-end
1982, and 0.9 by year-end 1983, and maintain a ratio of 1.0 in
1984 and thereafter (paragraph 5.24);
c)   PETROPERU would not incur any long-term debt if, after incurring
such debt, PETROPERU's long-term debt/equity ratio would be
greater than 70/30 in 1982, and 60/40 in 1983 and thereafter
(paragraph 5.24);
d)   PETROPERU would review with the Bank annually its five-year
capital investment program and related financing sources by a
date not later than September 30 each year (paragraph 5.10);
e)   the Government would reinvest in PETROPERU dividends declared by
the company to the extent that such funds are necessary to
finance the company's investment program (paragraph 5.18);
f)   PETROPERU would continue to have its accounts audited by inde-
pendent auditors and submit to the Bank each year, and no later
than five months after the end of its fiscal period, an external
audited report of the company's financial statements and project
accounts (paragraph 3.13);
g)   PETROPERU would continue to take all action necessary to ensure
that its professional salaries are competitive with those of
private oil companies in Peru, and to inform the Bank at least
every 12 months, of any vacancies in its exploration and produc-
tion departments and the actions it intends to take to fill such
vacancies (paragraph 3.11);



- 55 -
h)   PETROPERU would prepare and send to the Bank quarterly reports
on the progress of each of the project sub-components (paragraph
4.40);
i)   PETROPERU would submit to the Bank (i) annually, for comment,
updated versions of the feasibility study for the project, and
(ii) from time to time, as completed, the results of the well-
spacing studies, as well as the feasibility studies for similar
projects in areas adjacent to Laguna-Zapotal, for an exchange of
views concerning recommendations for a phased program of devel-
opment (paragraph 4.19).
7.02     The following would be conditions of loan effectiveness:
a)   PETROPERU will have executed a contract with the PMSC satisfac-
tory to the Bank (paragraph 4.21);
b)   that PETROPERU will have appointed consultants to help
PETROPERU's project unit in supervising the project management
service company and in carrying out studies provided for in the
project (paragraph 4.21);
c)   that PETROPERU will have selected staff for training with the
project management service company and the project unit
(paragraph 4.21).
7.03     The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$81.2 million, including US$1.2 million for the Bank's front-end
fee, to PETROPERU with the guarantee of the Government. The loan would be for
a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years.

Glossary Of Technical Terms
1. Anticline. Rock formation upfolded into an arch; a common geologic struc-
ture favorable for accumulation of oil and gas.
2. Associated gas. Gas produced along with oil. In the reservoir the gas
provides the drive mechanism needed to force oil to the surface through a
well. On reaching the surface, gas is removed and transported separately.
3. Basement (rock). Hard (igneous) rocks occurring below sedimentary forma-
tions. Generally do not contain petroleum.
4. Basin. A geologic region containing a thick accumulation of sedimentary
rocks generally considered a favorable area for petroleum exploration.
5. Darcy (Millidarcy). Unit of measure of a fluid's ability to flow through
a rock.
6. Dry Hole. An unsuccessful well. A well drilled to a certain depth with-
out finding commercial quantities of oil or gas.
7. Extension drilling. Drilling in semi-proven areas adjacent or near a pro-
ducing oil field for the purpose of extending the productivity limits of a
field.
8. Flowlines. Piping in a production system which gathers oil from indivi-
dual wells.
9. Fracturation. Artifically opening up a formation to increase permeability
and flow of oil to the bottom of a well.
10. Infill Drilling. Wells drilled within an area already delimited by pro-
ducing wells.
11. Intercalation. The existence of one or more layers between other layers,
e.g., the presence of sheets of lava between sedimentary strata.
12. Permeability. Property of a rock that reflects a fluid's ability to flow
thrcugh it. A tight rock, for example, would have zero millidarcy, while
a rcock with high permeability would have, say, 1,000 millidarcies.
13. Production Enhancement. Additional production from partially depleted
oilwells achieved by either additional wells and/or artificial means, such
as pumping or injection of gas or liquid products.

14. Pumping. Lifting oil from a reservoir to the surface by artifical
means. (downhole pumps - sucker rod pumps)
15. Reservoir. A porous, permeable well-defined sedimentary rock formation in
which recoverable oil and/or gas is confined (trapped) by impermeable
barriers.
16. Secondary recovery.  Production from depleted oil wells achieved by injec-
tion of water, gas or other agents.
17. Sedimentary rock. Rock strata formed by deposition of sediments from
streams, lakes, the sea (or deposited from air) such as limestone, sand-
stone and shales, or varying combinations of the three.
18. Stimulation. Injection in the formation of an acid solution to increase
permeability.
19. Stratigraphic trap.  A reservoir capable of retaining oil or gas due to
the impermeability of strata laterally as well as vertically rather than
by structural conditions such as faulting and folding.
20. Unconformity. A surface erosion or nondeposition in the geologic past
which separates the younger beds from much older beds.
21. Well completion. Outfitting of wells with necessary materials, such as
casing, tubing, wellheads and downhole equipment required to enable petro-
leum production.
22. Well logging. The lowering of various types of measuring instruments into
a well and gathering and recording data on porosity, permeability, types
of fluids, fluid content, and lithography.
23. Well recompletion. A term applied to any operation performed on a well
subsequent to completion in order to enable further production of petro-
leum from the main reservoir or a different reservoir.
24. Workover services. Operations carried out in a nonproducing or damaged
well to put it back in production.

Annex 4
PERU: PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT
TERMS FOR NEW OIL CONTRACTS
Decree Laws 22774 and 22231, promulgated in December 1979 and 1980,
respectively, modified the terms of the original "Peruvian Model Contract."
The revised Model Contract is basically a production-sharing arrangement in
which oil production at the well-head is divided between PETROPERU and the
contractor.   The duration of the contracts can vary, with a maximum of 30
years.  Exploration contracts are divided into two phases of two years each,
which can be extended for two years.  All of the investment must be provided
by the contractor, including the concomitant risk, without counterpart con-
tribution by PETROPERU. The precise oil split between PETROPERU and the con-
tractor in each case is determined depending on the geological characteris-
tics, exploration costs, and presumed development costs.   PETROPERU is re-
quired to pay the contractor's principal Peruvian tax obligations (import and
export taxes and royalties) out of its share of the oil, while the contractor
pays its own income (55%) and profit remittance (30%) taxes.
Succ essful investments are creditable against income tax up to 40% of
net income 1'.  The income and remittance taxes are creditable against US in-
come taxes.
In addition, Decree Law 22774 allows other forms of contracts whereby
PETROPERU may participate in investments and operations jointly with the con-
tractor.  Decree Law 22231 provides that PETROPERU may enter into operations
and service contracts with other companies for secondary and tertiary recovery
projects.

the Laguna-Zapotal Fields
Reserves
Three productive reservoirs exist over most of the area covered by
the Project, namely the Amotape, the Mogollon and the Echinocyamus.  Eighty-
five percent of the total production is contributed by wells completed in the
Mogollon reservoir which is encountered at an average depth of 7,800 ft and is
about 1800 ft thick. The Echinocyamus and the Amotape reservoirs are encoun-
tered at about 4,200 and 8,400 ft depth, respectively, and are each 400 ft
thick.  Total reserves are estimated at about 125 million barrels.  It is es-
timated that about 30 million barrels have been produced to date; 12.5 million
barrels remain to be produced from existing producing wells while the addi-
tional reserves to be developed within the framework of this project would
amount to about 40 million barrels. Based on the available petrophysical and
fluid data, it is estimated that another 42.5 million barrels in reserves re-
main to be developed.

PERU
PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT
Review Of Status Of Petroleum Production Rehabilitation Project
Loan 1806-PE
The project consists of four main components described and reviewed
as of June 1, 1982 as follows:
PART I: Rehabilitation of Production
(a) Restoring of declining primary production from the following oil
fields in the Peruvian Amazon Jungle: Corrientes, Pavayacu, Capirona
and Yanayacu, comprising: (i) acquisition and utilization of pumping
equipment (approximately 35 pumps), a workover rig and a pulling
unit, all for the aforesaid purpose; and (ii) execution of reservoir
simulation studies for each of the above-mentioned oil fields.
PETROPERU purchased and installed 26 pumps in the fields of
Corrientes, Pavayacu, and Capirona. The nine remaining pumps have
been acquired and are being installed in the field of Yanayacu.
Generators for pumping equipment have also been purchased. PETROPERU
has awarded the bid on the pulling unit and is inviting new bids for
the workover rig. Two reservoir simulation studies (Corrientes and
Pavayacu) have been completed by a foreign consultant while the two
remaining studies are being carried out by PETROPERU.
(b) Reactivation of primary production from 300 temporarily abandoned
wells in the Talara area by means of a combination of pumping sys-
tems (mechanical-both permanent and moveable, mechanical with central
electrical system, and swabbing), including acquisition and installa-
tion of pumping equipment and other accessory equipment and facili-
ties therefor.
PETROPERU has ordered materials and pumping equipment for 84 wells
and is inviting bids on the remaining 216 wells. Meanwhile,
PETROPERU is carrying out a program of clearing of access roads to
the wells and measurement of fluid levels and pressure of wells.
PART II: Development of New Production Potential
(a) Reactivation of the Borrower's exploration activities comprising: (i)
semi-detailed seismic surveying, in a length of about 800 line-km in
each of the Borrower's blocks 8 and 31 (see IBRD Map No.16174)



- 72 -
Annex 7
Page 2 of 3
located in the northeastern and central Peruvian jungle, respective-
ly; (ii) detailed seismic surveying, in an aggregate length of about
500 line-km, in either or both of the blocks referred to in (i)
above; and (iii) processing of the information and data obtained in
the carrying out of (i) and (ii) above, and preparation of comprehen-
sive reports on the basis of such information. Two companies have
started the 1,600 km seismic surveys in September 1981 in blocks 8
and 31. Completion date is scheduled for December 1982.
(b) Updating of an existing feasibility study for a future secondary
recovery project in La Brea-Parinas area.
The final report on this study, which is being carried out by a
foreign consultant, will be presented to PETROPERU by mid-June 1982.
Part III: Improvement of the Financial and Technical Capabilities of the
Borrower
(a) Studies on the Borrower's financial administration, accounting and
management information practices and procedures. A foreign consult-
ing firm completed the study in January 1982. The results and recom-
mendations were discussed by PETROPERU with a Bank mission in
February 1982. PETROPERU's Board has approved a phased program of
action submitted by the consultants and the company will soon present
to the Bank, for partial financing from Loan 1806-PE, a proposal for
implementation of the first phase.
(b) An inventory of the Borrower's fixed assets and a reconciliation of
the Borrower's books in respect of such assets. A Peruvian firm was
contrnreed in August 1981 and completed the evaluation in June 1982.
PETROPERU has taken steps to implement the consultant's recommenda-
tions.
(c) Training programs for the Borrower's staff on maintenance and repair
work of new facilities acquired under the project, reservoir engi-
neering practices and production control procedures.
Training of PETROPERU's staff is being carried out by manufacturers
of equipment (pumping, workover rig, pulling unit) at their head-
quarters and in the field and by consultants within the framework of
the reservoir simulation studies and secondary recovery feasibility
study.
PART IV: Overall Development of the Guarantor's Petroleum Sector
(a) A study of the future exploration and development investment require-
ments of PETROPERU. Reformulated terms of reference for this study
have been submitted to the Bank by PETROPERU and the MEM.



- 73 -
Annex 7
Page 3 of 3
These terms of reference focus on the development of medium and long-
term investment plans for PETROPERU and institutional improvements in
the planning area.
(b) A study concerning pricing of hydrocarbons. PETROPERU has selected a
consulting firm (A. D. Little) to carry out this study, which began
in July 1982.
(c) A study to reassess the economic and technical feasibility of the
Ramal Norte (northern branch) Peruvian pipeline. PETROPERU, with the
help of Occidental Petroleum, has increased the capacity of the Ramal
Norte by about 8,000 BD. Consequently this study is not necessary at
this time.
Financial Commitments And Disbursements Under The Project
Of the $32.5 million allocated to Loan 1806-PE, about $18 million
have already been committed and more than $8 million disbursed as of June,
1982. Financial Commitments have been made for the remaining equipment and
materials to be purchased under the project.

Annex 8

PERU
PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT
PETROPERU
Notes And Assumptions On Financial Projections
1.       Domestic Inflation and Exchange Rate.  Domestic inflation is pro-
jected to amount to 65% in 1982, 50% in 1983, 35% in 1984, 30% in 1985 and 25%
in 1986. Exchange rates are assumed to be continuously adjusted to compensate
for the excess of domestic over international inflation.
2.       Crude and Petroleum Products Prices.  Export prices are projected at
US$31,bbl in 1982 for crude and US$32/bbl for petroleum products, and to stay
constant, in real terms, thereafter. The crude purchase price to PETROPERU
from contractors has been projected to average US$30/bbl in 1982, and to in-
crease in line with the OPEC crude prices on which the purchase price is con-
tractually indexed. For Belco crude, a US$2/bbl premium has been added. The
price paid by PETROPERU for Oxy/Bridas service contract oil has been projected
to average US$19/bbl in 1982 and to increase in line with OPEC crude price on
which it is contractually indexed. Ex-refinery prices are assumed to increase
in the same proportion (53%) as retail prices, which are projected to reach
international levels (US$34 per barrel) by year-end 1982, to increase 10% in
real terms in 1983, and to maintain that level, in real terms, thereafter.
3.       Crude and Products Supply and Demand
a) Crude supply - PETROPERU's crude supply consists of five major compo-
nents: (i) PETROPERU's own production; (ii) production under the
Oxy/Bridas service contract, (iii) 50% share of contractors' production;
(iv) purchases from contractors, and (v) purchases from Treasury. The
production-sharing contracts provide that each contractor contribute pro-
portionately from its production to the domestic market. The 50% share
attributed to the contractors is thus divided into three components: (i)
sales to PETROPERU at international prices, (ii) exports and (iii) pay-
ments in kind to the Treasury corresponding to the contractors' income
taxes. Projections of income statements of the contractors have therefore
been prepared to evaluate their payments in kind. PETROPERU's purchases
from the Treasury corresponding to these income taxes are valued at a
price fixed by the Government which averaged S/3,750 per bbl in 1981.
These purchases are charged as an expense in PETROPERU's income statements
and considered as Government equity contributions to finance part of
PETROPERU's investment program, as stipulated in DL-22775.



- 75 -
Annex 8
Page 2 of 4
b)  Crude and Products Demand -  Refinery charges are projected as indi-
cated by PETROPERU. Crude inventories are kept at 20 days' reserve level
(in addition to crude in the pipeline). The balance of crude is ex-
ported. Domestic petroleum product demand has been assumed to increase at
5 percent per annum from the 1982 level forecasted by PETROPERU. Petro-
leum product inventories are assumed to stay constant in volume (current
inventories total about 30 days' supply). PETROPERU's internal consump-
tion is projected as indicated by PETROPERU. Imports of petroleum pro-
ducts (aviation fuel mostly) are forecasted as indicated by PETROPERU.
The balance of petroleum products is exported.
4.       Taxes - PETROPERU's tax obligations include the corporate income tax
(55%) and taxes paid for its own operations and on behalf of the contrac-
tors. The latter are expensed and therefore tax deductible. They consist of:
(i) an 8% royalty on domestic sales and exports;
(ii) a 12.5% special tax "canon" on jungle production, valued at a price
fixed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, on the basis of the difference
between the weighted average of domestic ex-refinery and export prices and
unit production and transportation costs for jungle crude.
(iii) export duties, averaging 18.5% in 1981, but scaled down to 13.9% in
1982, 6.1% in 1983, and 3.5% thereafter, in compliance with Legislative
Decrees Nos. 33 and 150 and D.L. 14920.
(iv) import duties, estimated at 20% of the value of contractors' imports
of materials and equipment. PETROPERU's import duties for materials and
equipment are already included in its own capital expenditures and operat-
ing expenses.
(v) miscellaneous taxes levied on PETROPERU, on equity, assets, salaries,
gasoline sales in the jungle, etc., estimated at 1% of net assets.
The projections do not take into account the investment tax credit (which
would apply to up to 90% of net income) on successful investments (i.e. oil
discoveries) for Peruvian oil companies but which is not applicable to
PETROPERU.
5.       Debt service - Debt service on existing long-term debt has been con-
verted into soles at the average exchange rate forecasted in the year of pay-
ment, from schedules prepared by PETROPERU in US dollar equivalents. Debt
service on new loans, contracted to cover 20% of the investment expenditures
outside the Laguna-Zapotal and refinery projects, has been projected utilizing
an average term of 9 years' maturity with 2 years' grace and 14% interest.
The Laguna-Zapotal project has been assumed to be financed by a blend of
PETROPERU's equity, IBRD loan, commercial loans, and export credits, as indi-
cated in the appraisal report, paragraph 4.29. The refinery has been



- 76 -
Annex 8
Page 3 of 4
assumed to be financed at 70% on export credit terms. Interest during con-
struction has been assumed to be capitalized for the refinery project. In-
terest on long-term debt has been assumed to remain constant at 12% for IBRD
and export credits, and 16% for commercial bank loans. Interest on short-term
loans has been estimated at 16% per annum in US dollar terms. The Government
of Peru is responsible for servicing the medium-term debt corresponding to the
Chase Manhattan loan incurred to cover crude imports in 1975-78 and to the
refinancing of the JAPECO principal payment. These debts have therefore been
shown separately in the financial statements and excluded in the computation
of the debt ratio.
6.       Asset Revaluation - PETROPERU's revaluation practices apply to those
of its non-fully depreciated assets associated with outstanding debt denomi-
nated in foreign currencies. The yearly revaluation amount of each specific
item is, therefore, related to the increase of its outstanding debt as a re-
sult of exchange rate variations.
7.       Depreciation - Depreciation on tangible assets has been calculated on
a straight line basis, with an average of 10-year depreciation period. In
conformity with PETROPERU's practice, dry wells and intangibles are fully de-
preciated in the year of occurrence.
8.       Other Revenues  - These include revenues from sales of fertilizer and
other industrial products, assumed to stay constant in volume, and pipeline
fees computed on the basis of the formula in the contract between PETROPERU
and Occidental.
9.       Labor and Social Benefits - As estimated by PETROPERU in the 1982
budget, and increasing thereafter in line with domestic inflation rate (no
growth in personnel after 1982).
10.      Materials and Supplies - As estimated by PETROPERU in the 1982 budget
and increasing annually by 2% in real sol terms thereafter.
11.      Purchased Services - Mostly transportation costs, as estimated by
PETROPERU in its 1982 budget and increasing in line with the domestic infla-
tion rate.
12.      Extraordinary Gains -  As forecasted by PETROPERU for 1982 and in-
creasing with domestic inflation rate. These gains relate mainly to foreign
exchange holdings.
13.      Accounts Receivable - Commercial accounts receivable are projected to
amount to one month's operating revenue. Other accounts receivable are
assumed to stay constant in nominal terms, in addition to the short-term



- 77 -
Annex 8
Page 4 of 4
receivables from the Government corresponding to the crude oil debt and JAPECO
principal payments.
14.      Inventories -  Crude and product inventories are projected as indi-
cated in note 3-b above. Materials and supplies inventories are projected to
amount to 80% of PETROPERU's expenses for these items.
15       Prepaid Expenses - Projected to grow from the 1982 budget value with
the domestic inflation rate.
16.      Other Fixed Assets - Assumed to stay constant at the 1981 estimated
value of S/46.0 billion.
17.      Accounts Payable - Projected to amount to about 2 months' of operat-
ing expenses and investment expenditures.
18.      Pension Fund Provision - Projected to increase each year by an amount
equal to 10% of salaries and benefit expenditures in the year.
19.      Equity Injection - Automatic equity contribution, as explained in
note 3-a above. In addition, S/2 billion is paid annually by Occidental and
Belco in lieu of payments of past income taxes by PETROPERU on behalf of the
companies in 1978 and 1979, as agreed during negotiations of their production-
sharing contracts.
20.      Financial Ratios -
a)   Debt-service Coverage Ratio - Operating income plus depreciation and
amortization less income taxes over long-term debt service require-
ments. The principal payments for the crude oil debt and JAPECO are
excluded (see note 5 above). Loan 1806-PE provides that equity in-
jections up to US$45 million in 1981 and US$40 million in 1982 are to
be deducted from debt service requirements for these years.
b)   Quick ratio - Current assets less inventories over current liabili-
ties less the current portion of the long-term debt.
c)   Long-term Debt/Equity Ratio - Long-term debt (including the current
portion, but excluding the crude oil debt and JAPECO) over total
equity.
