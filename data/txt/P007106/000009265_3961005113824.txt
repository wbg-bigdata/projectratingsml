MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INSERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPM
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A THIRD SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$30 million to help finance the Third Social
Development Project: Social Investment Fund. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maurity of 20 years, including five years of grace. Additional donor support is
expected in the amount of US$56.2 million (US$35.5 million committed and/or being processed;
US$20.7 million to be identified).
2.    Background. The development challenges facing Ecuador today stem from the economic
crises of the 1980s, when external shocks from falling oil prices and the ensuing debt crisis called ito
question the prevailing strategy of rapid expansion in the size and scope of the State. The need for
economic stabilization and structural reforms, combined with a growing concern over how best to
address chronic and pervasive poverty conditions, compelled the Administration that took office in
1992 to put forth a new agenda. The Govermnent's strategy seeks an increasing emphasis on sound
economic management and poverty alleviation, strucural changes in the role of the State, and a greater
reliance on private sector-led growth. The initial stabilization package included an increase in the
domestic price of petroleum derivatives by 115 percent and electricity tariffs by 120 percent,
reductions in public expenditres and employment, the elimination of 14 public agencies, and a
devaluation in the value of the sucre by over 30 percent.
3.    To complement the stabilization measures, the Government embarked on a far-reaching reform
agenda to modernize the State, including changes in the legal framework, fiurher reductions in
subsidies for public services, modernization and downsizing of the public sector, privatizations and
decentralization. While reforming the public sector is a long-term process, the need for addressing
basic needs and poverty alleviation is immediate and made all the more pressing by the short-term
social costs of several of the economic stabilization and adjustment measures. Results of the
stabilization policies have thus far been encouraging, including a reducton in the public sector deficit,
increased foreign exchange reserves, and a decline in inflation to its lowest level in five years.
However, most Ecuadorians continue to live in poverty, though estimates of poverty levels vary widely
depending on the measure used. One recent estimate (1990) describes 85 percent of the runal
population and 48 percent of the urban population as poor, and income distribution remains highly
skewed. Given Ecuador's fragile record of stabilization and reform efforts, particularly in the face
of growing social unrest, the challenge to the Government will be to continue these structural reforms
without a weakening of resolve. At the same time the Government must strive to ensure that the
benefits of growth are equitably distributed and that the general conditions of poverty, exacerbated
during the decline of the 1980s, are redressed.
4.    The Government accords high priority to addressing social sector issues, such as low quality
of basic education, poor coverage of basic health and nutrition services, and limited access and low
qualit of basic social infrastuctue (see the 1990 Bank Report 8935-EC: "Ecuador: A Social Sector
Strategies for the Nineties"). Only about one-third of the population is reached by public health
programs; while about one-half is not covered by either public or private health services. About one-



-2 -
fourth of the population lacks access to potable water and about one-third lacks household sanitation.
While primary school coverage is relatively high, quality is low and no more than half the children
from poor areas are estimated to achieve a full primay education. Moreover, existing social programs
often do not reach the poor.
S.   In general, public sector management and implementation capacity is weak, and has been
further debilitated by drastic reducions in social expenditures over the last ten years; by 1990 real
government social expenditure per capita was about 60 percent its 1980 level. The major public
institutions in the social sectors face common institutional constraints to meeting poverty alleviaton
objectives. These constraints include: (a) overly centralized, complex and antiquated organizational
stuces and operating procedures, (b) difficulties in recniting and maintining adequate technical
staff given the prevailing low salaries, (c) limited capacity to plan programs and make resource
allocation decisions, (d) inability to execute budgets due to weak administrative capacity and
burdensome rules and procedures, and (e) inadequate attention to locally-generated initiatives and,
relatedly, beneficiary participaton. The Government is addressing many of these issues both in the
public sector as a whole as well as within specific sector ministries through externally-finced
institutonal development efforts. Nevertheless, institutional capacity will continue to pose serious
constaints on poverty alleviation in the short-term.
6.    At the same time, non-govemnmental organizadons (NGOs) have become increasingly important
in the delivery of basic services and poverty alleviation efforts. Defined as developmental
intermediary organzatons that work with and channel resources to the poor, estimates of the number
of NGOs presendy operating in Ecuador are on the order of 500 to 600, representing an important
source of institutional capacity for extending the Government's ability to reach vulnerable groups.
7.   As part of its adjustment strategy, in March 1993 the Government created the Emergency
Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversi6n Social de Emergencia-FISE) as an autonomous agency
under the Office of the President, managed by a Board of Directors comprised of the Minister of
Finance and Public Credit, the Minister of Social Welfare (as the designated head of the Frente
Social), the General Secretary of the National Development Council (CONADE), two representatives
of NGOs, one representative from the private sector, and the Coordinator of FISE. FISE is designed
as a temporary, demand-driven mechamsm to attract and target additional resources to benefit low-
income groups. Patterned after the successful experience of social funds in other countries in the
region, FISE would finance small-scale investments camed out through NGOs, grassroots
orgizations, local authorities and decenalized public agencies. FISE established a target program
of US$120 million through the end of 1997, whereupon the agency would close.
8.    Project Objectives. The Bank would support the start-up and operations of FISE, to assist the
Govermnent in its efforts at poverty alleviation and compansation for vulnerable groups presently
urached by traditional mechanisms. The project would support the Government in: (a) establishing
an efficient, complementary demand-driven mechanism for delivering basic services and infamstructure
to the poor, utilizing NGOs, community organizations and local decentralized agencies; (b) channeling
additional resources to social assistance, basic infrastructue and small-scale productive activities; (c)
demonsting tansarent and efficient approaches to project selection, management and
administraton; (d) strengthening the institonal capacity of NGOs and grassroots organizations; and
(e) i aing beneficiary participation in poverty alleviation efforts.



- 3 -
9.    Project Description.  The project would:  (a) support sub-projects (US$108.8 million
representing FISE's maxinum program target) approved by FISE in the categories of social
infrastructure, socio-economic infrastructure, social services, productive community investments and
institutional development of local, grassroots organizations; and (b) provide institutional support for
FISE (US$9.2 million), including personrel and other operating expenses, vehicles and equipment,
and technical assistance (TA) and training.
10. The proposed Bank loan would finanse a portion of FISE's portfolio. Social infrastructure sub-
projects (55 percent of total sub-project amount) include construction and rehabilitation of civil works
and the provision of equipment for social infrastructure defined as health centers and dispensaries, pre-
schools, primary schools, day care centers, orphanages and shelters, latrines and community sanitary
facilities. Socio-economic infrastructure sub-projects (33 percent of total sub-project amount) includes
construction and rehabilitation of civil works in water supply and sewerage, feeder roads, small-scale
irrigation and drainage, street rehabilitation and improvements and erosion control. Sub-projects in
social services (8 percent) would finance equipment and materials, training and key inputs for
programs in primary and community health, primary education, non-formal training programs and
nutrition. Sub-projects in productive community investments with social reflows (3 percent) would
fiance- pilot activities carried out by community groups, NGOs and cooperatives which require an
element of repayment by beneficiaries, including the acquisition of infrastructure, equipment and
materials to support smatl-scale investments in agriculture and agricultural processing, handicrafts,
artesanal fishing and small-scale manufacturing. As an innovative approach for increasing incentives
for repayment and fostering local decision-making over resource use, the beneficiary community would
specify a social project to be financed out of the repayments. Institutional development sub-projects
(1 percent) would finance technical assistance and training for the establishment and consolidation of
community operations and maintenance committees to ensure the sustainability of FISE sub-projects.
II. The institutional support component would finance a share of: (a) FISE personnel and
operating expenses, with remuneration levels and recruitment procedures sufficient to ensure high
caliber staff. Due to the temporary nature of PISE and the non-civil service status of its staff, FISE
higher-level professional and technical personnel are considered consultants to the Government and
treated as such for purposes of the Project. FISE personnel and operating expenses are fully
incremental and declining financing by the Bank is not applicable. FISE's overhead expenses (defined
as total personnel and operating costs) are estimated at about 6 percent; (b) vehicles and equipment;
and (c) TA and training. TA and training actvities would improve the efficiency of internal systems,
refine poverty targeting mechanisms, improve the criteria and methodologies applied to the appraisal
and supervision of sub-projects, update the standardized regional unit cost and procurement systems,
enrich the skill base and work group cohesion of FISE staff and their exposure to the experiences of
similar funds in the region, and allow FISE to contract external auditing services. FISE would also
contract to independent agencies the surveys and physical audits of sub-project quality, beneficiary
assessments, and studies of impact evaluation.
12. The proposed loan of US$30 million would finance 25 percent of FISE's target program of
US$120 million over the projected four-year implementation period. The Government of Ecuador
would provide US$16.5 million, or 14 percent of total project costs, including US$4.5 million in local
currency funds from balance-of-payments support from USAID allocated to finance the start-up period.
Sub-project beneficiaries and sponsoring agencies would provide, globally, an estimated 20 percent



- 4 -
of the value of sub-projects, largely in the form of donated labor and local materials. Identified co-
financng includes US$800,000 from the Govermnent of Spain (committed), US$100,000 from
UNICEF and US$100,000 from UNDP for technical assistance and equipment (committed), and a
US$30 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (under preparation). Additional
support from various donors would be required in the amount of US$20.7 million, or 17 percent of
total project costs, to finance fully the US$120 million program. Any eventual shortfall in fimd-raising
would reduce the ultimate number of sub-projects to be financed but would not endanger FISE's
functioning nor the benefits accrued from Bank-funded FISE sub-projects. The Government is seeking
retroactive fmnancing of. US$3 million to cover: (a) equipment (vehicles and computers) purchased a&
of May 25, 1993 (date of pre-appraisal); and (b) eligible sub-projects approved by PISE's Approval
Committee after October 7, 1993 (date of appraisal).
13.   The breakdown of project costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Schedule B describes
procurement and disbursement arrangements. A timetable of key project processing events and the
staus of the Bank Group operations in Ecuador are provided in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map of Ecuador is also attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 12436-EC, dated January 26, 1994, is
being distributed separately.
14.   Project ImplemeFtation. FISE would be responsible for project implementation, including
the appraisal and grant financing of sub-projects executed by private and public agencies (NGOs,
grassroots organizations, regional and local authorities, and decentalized public agencies).
Mechanisms for poverty targeting, criteria for sub-project eligibility, supervision arrangements, and
contracting and procurement procedures are detailed in FISE's Operational Manual. In addition,
technical brochures are currently being developed by FISE for each type of sub-project which provide
technical and economic specifications, including norms for the size and scale of various types of
infrastructure, target ranges for cost per beneficiary and cost per unit, and cost recovery and tariff
levels where appropriate. Administrative and financial aspects of FISE operations are defined in
FISE's Administrative Manual. In addition, to ensure consistency with sector policies, priorities and
nonns, and to avoid duplication of effort, FISE will coordinate its actions with the relevant
government agencies at the central and local levels, as specified in coordinating agreements signed
between FISE and the respective sector institutions.
15.   Under the proposed operation, the Bank would review, on an ex-ante basis, sub-projects above
US$100,000, with random ex-post review proposed for sub-projects below US$100,000. Reporting
requirements include: (a) submission of standard monthly information reports based on data from
FISE's management information system; (b) semi-annual procurement reviews; (c) submission each
year of FISE's annual report, ratified by its Board of Directors, which would contain key progress
indicators of FISE together with reporting on technical assistance and training efforts, the results of
monitoring and impact evaluation studies, and the implementation of recommendations from the semi-
annual procurement reviews and external audits; and (d) submission of a final report and evaluation
of the outcome of the proposed project no later than six months after the closing date. In addition,
a series of institutional performaince indicators has been developed for FISE which set monitorable
targets of capacity, efficiency, quality and impact. FISE would conduct an annual programming
exercise, including revisions to the performance indicators, adjustments to the distribution of sub-
projects by type and location, and revised cash flow projections. A Mid-Term Review would be
conducted jointly by the Bank, the Government and other donors during the first months of 1996 to



. 5 -
evaluate the operations of FISE, the results of which would inform the Government's strategy
regarding instilutional arrangements for the financing of social progran-s. While scheduled to close
at the end of 1997, given the experience of other social funds in the region, the final outcome of FISE
would be determined based on overall strategy and institutional considerations of the Govermnent, in
consultation with FISE's external donors. Intensive supervision will be required in light of the
demand-driven nature of FISE, the large number of sub-projects to be reviewed, the newness of the
institudon, and the importance of transparency. A Bank supervision plan has been prepared.
Moreover, an International Review Board would be established comprised of the various donor
agencies to ensure coordination and transparency of ISE operations.
16.   Project Sustainabilit. Sustainabiity of sub-projects financed by FISE is ensured through:
(a) appraisal criteria which require presentation of a specific plan and guarantees for operations and
maintenance, (b) an institutional evaluation of the capacity of sponsoring agencies to sustain effectively
sub-project benefits, (c) a social evaluation to assess the degree of participation by the beneficiary
community in the design, execution and sustainability of sub-projects, (d) where appropriate, cost
recovery mechanisms are required, and (e) support for the establishment and training of community
operations and maintnce committes. Given its temporary mandate, the sustainability of FISE as
an institation is not at issue.
17.   Lesons from Previous Bank Involvement. The design of the proposed project takes into
account both the Bank's experience with other social sector and poverty alleviation projects in
Ecuador, and the lessons learned from the design and implementation of similar social fund projects
within and outside LAC. Specifically, lessons of Bank experience in Ecuador have resulted in project
design which incorporates: (a) substantial attention to counterpart financing arrangements, (b)
assurances of sufficient management and admninistrative capacity, (c) provision of adequate technical
aistance and training, and (d) the fostering of beneficiary participation.
18. The benefits of experience from other social funds have been integrated into project design
through intensive TA during project preparation, includiag site visits by FISE staff to other social
funds in the region. These lessons underline the importance of an autonomous stucue  which is
integrated with the Government's broader poverty alleviation strategy and overal economic reform
program. To ensure proper use of funds and prevent political interference, there must be fill
transparency and accountability, recruitment policies that ensure high caliber staff, well-defined sub-
project appraisal criteria, agile coordinating mechanisms with key sector ministries, an objective and
monitorable mechanism for poverty targeting, strong supervision mechanisms (both during sub-project
execution and of the FISE itself), and external evaluations of quality and impact. To this end,
performance indicators for the management of FISE are included in the project.
19. Rationale for Bank Ilvolvement. The proposed project supports the Bank's country
assistance strategy for Ecuador designed to assist in the implementation of the Government's
stabilization and strucural reform efforts Id forms part of the Bank's core lending program in the
area of targeted poverty interventions. The Bank's social sector strategy for Ecuador (Report No.
8936-EC) emphasizes (a) giving priority to social sector programs for poverty alleviation; (b)
establishing efficiency and equity in public social expenditures; (c) strengtening public sector
decision-making and management; and (d) enhancing the effectiveness of social progams. The
implementation of this strategy is contained in a package of three complementary social development



- 6 -
projects: the First Sc.ial Development Project: Education and Training (effective June 1992), the
Second Social Development Project: Health and Nutrition (effective May 1993) and the proposed Third
Social Development Project: Social Investment Fund. In addition to its financial support to the
proposed project, the Bank's role is catalytic in bringing international experience to bear on the design
and operation of the FISE and in leveraging additional funds through coordination with other external
donors.
20.   Agreed Actions. For negotiations, the GOE furnished to the Bank: (a) revised versions of
its Operational and Administrative Manual; (b) a standard multi-party contract, satisfactory to the
Bank, for the financing of sub-projects; (c) a plan for impact evaluations, including timing, focus,
methodologies, terms of reference and implementation arrangements; (d) a package of basic
procurement documents, including sample bidding documents and a description of procurement
procedures for LCB; and (e) draft terms of reference for the external audits. At negotiations,
assurances were obtained that:  (a) any changes to the approved Operational Manual and
Administrative Manual that could affect the carrying out of the project could not be made without prior
Bank approval; (b) FISE management level positions would be staffed satisfactorily to the Bank; (c)
sub-project Bank review arrangements would be caried out as specified, including standard sub-project
information sheets; (d) selected institutional performance indicator; would be used, with specific
targets of FISE performance established for 1994; (e) the Government must define, during the first
quarter of 1997, its strategy for the closing of FISE; (f) the Governent would provide the necessary
counterpart funds, including specified annual amounts; (g) sample bidding documents and LCB
procedures for civil works and goods acceptable to the Bank would be used for procurement; (h)
idependent review and updating procedures for the uiit price data base would be carried out every
three months and that FISE would promptly change such prices, in form and substance satisfactory
to the Bank, if so recommended by such a review; (i) the Government would carry out specified
disbursement arrangements, including the establishment of a Special Account in the amount of US$2.0
million; (j) eligible expenditures and amounts for retroactive fmancing were confirmed; (k) semi-
annual audits would be conducted by an independent pnvate auditor acceptable to the Bank and would
follow terms of reference in accordance with appropriate auditing principals, as approved by the Bank,
and would be submitted to the Bank within four months after the close of each semester; (l) FISE
would undertake specified reporting requirements; and (m) project implementation will include annual
programming reviews and a Mid-Term Review to be conducted in early 1996. As conditions of loan
effectiveness, the GOE would ensure  wat: (a) FISE's Operational Mamal and Administrative
Manual, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been approved by its Board of Directors; (b) FISE's
technical brochures to guide sub-project appraisal, would have been presented satisfactory to the Bank;
and (c) an initial Management Information System, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been
implemented.
21. Environmental Aspects. The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental
classification. Overall, the project is expected to have a positive environmental impact, with direct
cavirornental benefits accruing from erosion control efforts, small urban drainage works, and rural
feeder road improvements to control degradation of the surrounding land. Sub-projects with potential
environmental impacts, including water supply and sanitation, latrines and micro-irrigation, would
focus principally on labor-intensive rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure. For new systems, all
sub-project proposals would include appropriate environmental safeguards. To control for all potential
environmental impacts, FISE has received technical assistance from the IDB during the preparadon



- 7 -
phase to incorporate environmental criteria into the sub-project appraisal criteria and technical
brochures. This ex-ante screening mechanism will be mcnitored during Bank supervision of FISE,
including in its review of individual sub-projects. An evaluation of the mechanism is included in the
terms of reference of the Mid-Term Review.
22.   Project Benefits. The proposed project would generate substantial benefits for the poor
through the more than 2,700 sub-projects expected to be financed by F1SE in the provision of basic
social and physical infrastructure, social services and training. These sub-projects would deliver
Immediate benefits in terms of generation of employment and income and improvements in the access
and quality of basic services and infrastructure, as well as longer-term benefits in terms of
improvements in the living conditions and productive capacity of the poor. The proposed project
would strengthen FISE in its ability to target, appraise and monitor effectively efforts oriented to
poverty alleviation, and would assist the Govermnent in mobilizing and effectively targeting additional
resources for urgendy needed social investments essential to poverty alleviation. In addition, the
proposed project would have an important insitutional effect in: (a) strengthening the capabilities of
NGOs, grassroots orgamnzations and local authorites to prepare and implement projects, (b) in
demonstrating the relevance of beneficiary participation in poverty alleviation efforts, and (c) in
providing an efficient and effective model of public sector implementation capacity.
23.   Risks.  Risks facing the proposed project relate to: (a) political interfertnce and
bureaucratization which would compromise FISE's autonomy, credibility and effectiveness, (b)
potental shortfalls in counterpart fmancing, which has proved to be an endemic problem in Ecuador,
(c) despite thorough sub-project appraisal criteria, potential problems with sub-project quality in the
field, and (d) lack of coherence and coordination with other activities. To address the risk in (a),
FISE has been established as an autonomous agency under the Presidency, with adequate institutional
checks and balances and transparent and efficient operating procedures. To address (b) the Bank will
monitor closely the meeting of counterpart commitments in the social sectors in general, and
assurances will be obtained at negotiations to cover the remaining counterpart financing requirement
of the proposed project. The proposed project contains several design features to address (c),
including on-site supervisors to be contracted as part of sub-project costs, independent sub-project
quality reviews, impact evaluations which include direct feedback from sub-project beneficiaries, and
intensive oversight from donor agencies through the fornation of an ad-hoc International Review
Committee. And finally, to address (d), FISE has incorporated sector norms and technical
specifications, where available, into its appraisal criteria, and has entered into signed coordinating
