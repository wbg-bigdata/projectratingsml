Section I - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
H.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
descnbe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
SAC In supports a privatization process which includes inmprovements to the law on privatization,
improvernents in the underlying process, and privatization of key strategic assets - Moldtelecorn, two
electricity distribution companies and the remaining state-owned wineries. The SAC III team is working
with the Govermnent to make sure the privatization process remains in conformity with Moldova's
environmental protection legislation. This includes provision in the Law on the Privatization Program for
1998-2000, which has since been extended with those provisions through 2002. It also includes a specific
regulation, "On express-audit of enterprises which are subject of privatization and are harmful for the
environmnent" (1998). This regulation is related to the Aarhus Convention and public disclosure
requirements. (See II.D.4 below for more information.)
I.D. lb. Descnbe any potential cumulative imnpacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to rmltiple project component. None identified.
lI.D. Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated fature activities in the project area.
Beyond the SAC I1I program, privatization of energy generation companies may be considered. The
environmnental protection legislation should continue to be applied uniformly to any enterprise moving
through the privatization process, including the energy generation companies.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
With respect to privatization, the Government has satisfactory environmental protection legislation and
regulation in place which requires express environmental audits of enterprises subject to privatization if
they are deemed as potentially harmful for the environment.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders include any entity potentially affected by privatized enterprises which are harmful to the
environment. The enterprises themselves are also stakeholders. Investors like to know if and to what
extent they are taking responsibility for envirornmental liabilities at the time of privatization. This tends to
increase the demand for and relative price of privatized state assets. The enviromnental protection
legislation and regulation in Moldova is published in Monitor Oficial, the national legal gazette. A special
regulation related to the Aarhus convention (1999) was adopted and published in January 2000. According
to this regulation, all new activities which can be harmful for the environment (there is a list of such
activities in the regulation) should have an environmental inmpact assessment study and the public should be
informed about their environmental safety, as well as to have the opportunity to take part in the decision
making process affecting environmental standards. The same stipulations are found in the regulation on
express audit for enterprises to be privatized.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
