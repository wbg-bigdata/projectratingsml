MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT (LOAN 1852-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Mae Moh Lignite
Project in Thailand, for which Loan 1852-TH for US$72.0 million was approved
on June 17, 1980. The loan was closed on December 31, 1987. three years
behind schedule. It was almost fully disbursed, the last disbursement was on
February 11, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Asia Technical Energy Division and
Industry and Energy Operations Division of the Asia Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The borrower (EGAT) submitted the PCR
(Part II) in two stages--the first one in August, 1985, after the physical
completion and the second one in September, 1988, after complete disbursement
of the loan amount.
The report is based inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the
Bank and the borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT (LOAN 1852-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The project formed part of a national energy development strategy to
reduce the country's high dependence on imported fuel, by developing
indigenous energy resources. The expansion of lignite production was to meet
the increased coal need of the Mae Moh power station expansion from 225 MW to
375 MW. In addition, the project was to carry out studies (i) to prepare a
master plan for the exploitation of Mae Moh lignite reserves; (ii) to
determine the principles for a lignite price structure; (iii) to arrange
training for the new mining technology and for developing accounting systems
and procedures for cost information flow; and (iv) to analytically examine and
assess all environmental and ecological impacts and to prepare recommendations
for minimizing the adverse affects of lignite mining and power generation
(Para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
The procurement of major equipment was completed on schedule and put
into operation by 1982183 and the physical construction was completed in 1985.
The procurement of auxiliary equipment and spare parts was unavoidably delayed
up to 1987. The borrower also transferred the procurement of some equipment
from Mae Moh II to Mae Moh I to utilize the surplus fund available in this
loan. The loan closing date was therefore, extended in stages from December,
1984 to December, 1987 (Para. 5.1).
Detailed exploration increased the mineable reserves of lignite from
130 mt with a stripping ratio of 2sl BCM to 614 mt with a stripping ratio of
Sl BCM. The increased reserves could increase the power generation capacity
from 375 MW to 1,725 MW (Para. 5.2).
Prices of major equipment were lower than the appraisal estimates,
the provisions for price escalation and physical contingencies were not
required. This surplus fund amounting to US$14.9 million was utilized for the
procurement of additional equipment (Para. 5.4).
During early stages, frequent breakdown led to low equipment
availability--a problem which directly affected overburden and lignite
production. Some difficulties arose due to insufficient operating skill and
inexperienced maintenance. This was rectified by recruiting additional
personnel with theoretical knowledge and imparting hands on training to them.
This led to a higher level of staffing but it provided a core of trained
personnel to serve the next stage of mine expansion (Para. 5.5).

Results
The project achieved largely its objectives. Lignite production,
although short of appraisal estimates in the first year (1984) of operation,
has been consistently higher than the original forecast. The project was also
able to build up a core of trained personnel at all levels to take care of
future expansion needs (Paras. 6.1 and 6.3).
The results of lignite pricing study indicated that the lignite has a
cost advantage over other fuels. The lignite prices are so fixed as to cover
the cost of production plus a margin which is adequate to cover the debt
service, fixed asset replacements and the exploration need (Para. 6.2).
Computerized MIS and data processing helped in faster analysis of
exploration data and in better inventory control. It was also successfully
employed in construction scheduling and monitoring, optimization in equipment
deployment with reduced cost and finally, in overall cost control (Para. 6.4)
EGAT resettled 373 families affected by mining expansion program.
Villagers were not only paid full compensation for their loss of property and
alloted new farm lots but a new model village with housing and amenities like
school, water and electric supply, approach road, worship temple, etc. were
constructed for them at a site only 10 km from their former place (Para. 6.5).
Environmental studies show that sulphur oxide emission is generally
low and well within the Bank guidelines. The water quality in all three
neighboring reservoirs is considered acceptable for water supply by the EGAT's
environmental department. The land affected by mining is being reclaimed,
revegetated and reafforestated (Para. 6.6).
The project has a profound effect on the local economy by generating
direct employment for about 2,000 persons. Through the resettlement program
the quality of rural life has been improved (Para. 6.7).
The economic rate of return is 15.4Z, better than 13.82 estimated at
appraisal due to increased power generation. The financial rate of return is
14.42 compared with 14.62 estimated at appraisal (Paras. 6.9 and 6.10).
Sustainabilitv
Despite higher stripping ratio lignite production has increased from
1.53 mt in 1984 to 5.75 mt in 1987. It is expected to be 8.7 mt in 1991.
During each year, production has been restricted to the actual off-take by the
power plants though the quantity of lignite exposed at the quarry bed
continues to remain in excess of one year's production target. The completed
project, as well as the proposed further expansions, are economically viable
at the projected prices. Revenues of the mine over the next ten years would
cover mine operating costs and other expenses and would generate sufficient
cash to meet debt repayment obligations and on-going capital requirements
(Para. 7).

Findinas and Lessons Learned
The cost estimates prepared as per Bank guidelines for price
escalations and contingency provisions were too high (Para. 5.4). The Bank
engineers did not anticipate the requirement of additional earth-moving
equipment which occurred when the overburden ratio changed (Para. 8.1).
The appraisal report visualized one-shift maintenance followed by
two-shift operation but it was not locally suitable for the success of the
project. Therefore, three-shift operation was introduced to remedy the
situation which resulted in more man-power but higher production and
productivity (Paras. 5.5, 5.6 and 7.1). The current mining operation must
form a part of a long-term mining plan for optimum utilization of resources
(Para. 8.3)

2. Proiect Background
2.1      At the time of formulation of this project in 1979-80, Thailand was
faced with rapidly increasing expenditures on oil import. Total energy
consumption had increased from 7.4 million ton oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1970
to over 14.4 mtoe in 1978. Over 602 of the domestic energy production
depended on imported oil. The average annual rate of growth in energy
consumption during the period was 9.02, compared to 6.72 growth in the GNP.
In 1978, the petroleum products accounted for almost 70.5Z of total energy;
hydro and lignite (low grade coal) for about 4.62 and 1.92 respectively; and
charcoal, firewood, paddy husk, bagasse, etc. for the rest 232. The price of
oil products which rose almost five-fold in six years (1973-78) became a heavy
burden on the economy. In 1978, the country's oil import bill was about
US$1.1 billion. It rose to US$2 billion in 1980 absorbing over 302 of total
export earnings and contributing to a current account deficit of more than
US$2 billion.
2.2      Despite this heavy reliance on imported oil, the country had
potential for developing domestic energy resources. Priority was given in
national plans to the rapid development of domestic resources to reduce the
import dependence. The main local energy resources that could be brought on
stream during the 1980's were the recently discovered natural gas field in the
Gulf of Thailand, a sizeable undeveloped hydro potential, and lignite
deposits.
2.3      The proven recoverable gas reserves of different quality were then
estimated at about 82 billion cubic meters with another 133 billion cubic
meters in probably recoverable category. Much of the gas was earmarked for
power generation. The hydro potential was estimated at about 9,300 megawatt
(MW) of which 910 MW were then in operation and 2,200 MW were under



construction or programmed for development before 1990. Following extensive
exploration, proven reserves of lignite were found economic for oil
substitution. It was also consistent with the government policy for reducing
the dependence on imported oil for power generation.
3. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.1      The project formed part of a national energy development strategy to
reduce the country's high dependence on imported oil, by developing indigenous
energy resources such as natural gas, lignite and hydropower The expansion of
lignite production at Mae Moh was required to meet the incremental coal demand
of the Mae Moh power generating station from 225 MW to 375 MW, including the
latest 150 MW Power Unit No. 4 which was then planned to be commissioned in
1984. Arising out of the above were studies (i) to prepare a master plan for
mining Mae Moh reserves and other related development; (ii) to determine the
long-term forecast price for lignite to be used in making annual adjustments
to the lignite price; (iii) to arrange training for personnel in mining and
accounting departments for gaining technical expertise in the new mining
technology, and for accounting systems and procedures for cost information
flow; and (iv) to analytically examine and assess all impacts on the
environmental and ecological resources as well as to make recommendations to
minimize the effects of lignite mining and power generation.
3.2      The Mae Moh lignite mining and power station complex, both owned by
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is in Lampang province,
about 650 Km north of Bangkok. The area has a low population density and is
primarily agricultural with some commercial teakwood cultivation.
3.3      The project consisted of an open pit lignite mine to increase
production from 1 million tons (mt) 1979 to 2.8 mt per year from 1984. The
project scope included engineering, procurement and erection of mining and
related equipment including a 1,200 ton per hour lignite handling system, and
technical assistance and training. It also included expansion of the
maintenance workshop and power supply system for new activities.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1      The mining project design was reviewed by Rheinbraun Consulting Gmb8
and endorsed by Dr. Otto Gold Consulting Engineers, both from the FRG. The
choice of mining method and equipment size and capacity was the result of an
optimization study conducted by Dr. Otto Gold Consulting Engineers.
4.2      EGAT set up a separate implementing agency for mine construction with
appropriate delegation of authority. It defined roles and responsibilities of
the agency and strictly scheduled and monitored procurement, erection and
commissioning activities. Whenever EGAT did not have the requisite expertise
within the organization, it sought expert consultant advice from outside.



4.3      Though it was known to EGAT and the Bank that the proven lignite
reserves in Mae Moh were sufficient to sustain a much higher level of lignite
production and additional generating capacity, the project scope was limited
to provide additional coal for one 150 MV set only. This was done so that
EGAT could gradually gain experience in highly capitsl intensive mechanized
open pit mining methods. However, as the implementation of the project
progressed, certain mining design and equipment parameters had to be changed
to accommodate future expansion prospects. Zt formed the basis for the next
project, Mae Moh Lignite Project II (Loan 2407-TH) for increasing the lignite
production from 2.8 mt (1984) to 5.0 mt (1987) to sustain three more 150 MW
generating sets. The decision was very prudent, it permitted time to develop
local expertise which provided confidence for the Implementation of the next
phase.
5. Project Implementation
5.1      The physical construction of the project was completed in 1985 except
the procurement of auxiliary equipment and spare parts, delivery of which was
unavoidably delayed up to 1987 when a ship carrying the material sank in the
high sea in 1985. In addition, the borrower also sought extension for
transferring procurement of some items of equipment valued at US$2.7 million
from Mae Moh II to Mae Moh I to utilize the surplus fund available. The
original loan closing date was therefore, extended in stages from 1984 to 1987
(Part III, Table 2). At the time of final closing of the account on February
11, 1988, all but US$32,000 remained undisbursed from the original loan amount
of US$72 million (Part III, Table 3). The procurement of major equipment as
appraised was completed on schedule, and they were put into operation by
1982/83. Lignite transport system, though commissioned with slight delay did
not materially affect the power station, as the Power Unit No. 4 itself was
delayed by about 9 months due to other reasons.
5.2      When the project was formulated, it was based on a mineable reserve
of 130 mt with a stripping ratio of 2.1 bank cubic meter (BCM) of overburden
to 1 ton of coal. In order to prepare a master plan for Mae Moh basin an
exploration program with 4,325 boreholes was completed at an expenditure of
US$12.8 million. It established a geological reserve of 1,500 mt of which 614
at were considered mineable. Exploitation of the additional reserve would
involve increasing the stripping ratio from 2.1 to 5.1. Considering that the
additional lignite reserves could increase power generation capacity from 375
MW to 1,725 MW, it was decided in 1981, as a part of a master plan to increase
the stripping ratio accordingly. Anticipating this possibility, the appraisal
report had recommended larger size excavators and trucks than required for the
immediate purpose. However, during implementation, it became necessary to
procure additional excavating and auxiliary equipment.
5.3      The increased stripping ratio temporarily reduced the lignite
production but it did not affect the power generation. Moreover, the average
heating value of the lignite was 102 higher (2,800-3,000 K.Cal/Kg) than
originally estimated (2,700 K.Cal/Kg).



- 4 -
5.4      Prices  of major equipment were lower than the appraisal estimates,
the provisions for price escalation and physical contingency were not
required. This surplus fund amounting to US$14.9 million (out of $60 million)
was utilized for the procurement of additional equipment. A comparison between
original estimates at the appraisal and the actual expenditure at the time of
loan closing is placed in Part III, Table 6.
5.5      During early stages, frequent equipment breakdown led to low
equipment availability problem which directly affected overburden removal
program and lignite production. Some difficulties arose due to insufficient
operating skill and inexperienced maintenance personnel. This was rectified
by recruiting additional staff with theoretical background and imparting
hands-on practical training to them. It was also observed early in the
project that one-shift1 maintenance followed by two-shift operation. as
envisaged in the appraisal report, was not locally suitable for the success of
the project. Therefore, three-shift operation was introduced to remedy the
situation which resulted in larger number of operators, technicians and
supervisors. This was also in support of a conscious decision by the
management to have a core of trained personnel to serve the next stage of mine
expansion (para 4.3).
5.6      Another cause for higher staffing was the government employment
regulation restricting the employer's right to terminate employment of surplus
workers. It was not possible to build up an efficient workforce based on
incentive methods of payment only. The present staffing compared to the
appraisal estimate and requirement for the 5 mt production is given in Part
III, Table 7A. Overall employment of 2,129 is almost double the appraisal
estimate of 1,001, mainly in the categories of operators, technicians and
administration personnel.
5.7      With respect to consulting services, all contracts were fulfilled in
time by 1984, as originally planned. The establishment of the mine accounting
system as well as the lignite pricing study were completed by October, 1983
(appraisal estimate December, 1981). By the end of 1983, most training
programs funded by IBRD were completed. Some additional training programs
deemed appropriate were undertaken after 1983. These related tc mining and
lignite handling system, and finance and management.
5.8      Three environmental studies were completed in phases between 1982 and
1984. From 1982 onward, the emphasis was on compliance and effectiveness of
monitoring systems.
6. Proiect Results
5.1      The project achieved largely its cbjectives.  Lignite production,
although short of appraisal estimates in the first year of mine operation
(1984), has been consistently higher than the original forecasts. The volume
of overburden remove-d every year was far in excess of the appraisal report due
to higher stripping ratio (Para 5.2 and Part III, Table 5), although it needed
additional expenditure for excavators, trucks and other auxiliary equipment.
The power plant was fully satisfied with the quantity and quality of lignite
supplied 'Para 5.3). The project was also able to build up a core of trained



- 5 -
operators, technicians, and supervisory and management staff to take care of
future expansion projects.
6.2      The results of lignite pricing study (Para 5.7) indicated that
lignite has a cost advantage over other fuels such as natural gas, imported
coal and heavy oil in power generation. The least cost substitute at the time
of exhaustion of lignite reserves would be natural gas. Of the remaining
fuels, imported coal was found to be the most cost effective substitute of
lignite. The lignite prices were so fixed as to be consistent with two
principal objectives oft (i) the price should reflect the economic cost of
imported coal; and (ii) the price should provide for the financial viability
of EGAT's mining operations. Lignite prices are now based on the
recommendation of Lignite Pricing Study Report. The price covers the cost of
production plus a margin which is, at least, adequate to cover the debt
service, fixed asset replacements, and exploration requirement.
6.3      Suitable training programs have been carried out at a cost of US$2.2
million for persons at different levels to improve their skills and
proficiency in the job. It covered all aspects like exploration, mine
planning and design, equipment operation and maintenance, construction
scheduling and monitoring, and accounts and finance. Some part of training
was carried out at site and others abroad. About 33Z of the employees were
trained for periods varying from one week to few months. The management feels
that the training process benefited the project by improving the skill of
mining operation, financial management and overall administration.
6.4      Computerized management information system and data processing helped
in faster analysis of exploration drilling information and better inventory
control. It was also successfully employed in construction scheduling and
monitoring, optimization in equipment deployment with reduced cost and finally
in overall cost control and better financial performance of the mine.
6.5      EGAT resettled 373 families (appraisal 293) in two villages which
were affected by mining expansion program. Villagers were not only paid full
compensation for their property and allotted farm lots but a new village with
housing and welfare facilities like school, water and electric supply,
approach road, worship temple, etc. were constructed fcr them at a new site
only 10 km from their former place. Resettlement of 820 other families are
being implemented in phases between 1985-90. The estimated expenditure is
about US$8 million equivalent in local cost.
6.6      Environmental studies showed that sulphur oxide concentration were
generally low, 20 to dO uglm3 depending on location and season, which is well
within the Bank guiaelines on the subject. The problem of mine dust emission
is contained at the sources by water spraying. It was decided that stack
height for new power generating units 4-7 should be about 150m. The water
quality in all three neighboring water supply reservoirs is considered
acceptable for water supply. The land affected by mining operations is being
reclaimed and revegetated. A three year pilot study was carried out to



- 6 -
observe the soil conditions at the waste disposal area. The results of soil
analysis do not yet show any significant change in chemical contents which
could improve soil quality. However, experiments are in progress to restore
the land for agriculture and afforestation purposes. The pilot test areas
covering about 3,870 acres have been planted with 70,000 trees. The effects
of deposition of pollutants on plant leaves are also being regularly
monitored. So far there is no ill effect. One of the mined out areas
covering 60,000 cu.m. has been converted into a water supply reservoir.
6.7      The project has a profound effect on local economy, it has introduced
mechanized open-pit technology in a predominantly rural agricultural community
and generated direct employment for about 2,000 persons. Through the
resettlement program the project has helped to build up model villages with
public utilities and social and welfare amenities that helped to improve the
quality of rural life. The project has built up a core of trained and
experienced operators, mechanics, supervisory and management staff who help
Mae Moh administration to expand their mining activities to meet the
additional lignite demand for the expansion of power station.
6.8      The total project cost was US$127.2 million, 2S less than US$130.3
million estimated at appraisal. The major cost reductions from forecast
amounts were in (1) land resettlement, structure, civil works and explosion
which category was US$10.8 million, as compared with the estimate of US$12.8
million, for a cost overrun of 162, and (2) prestripping of overburden
expenditures, which amounted to US$14.8 million as compared with the estimate
of US$16.7 million, for a saving of 112. These savings occurred in part
because prices of earth moving equipment were significantly lower than
original estimates, despite procurement of additional equipment to deal with
higher stripping ratio of 5.1 as compared with the estimated 2.1.
Additionally, dollar denominated savings (about US$5.9 m) occurred in local
expenditure categories because of the 14Z appreciation of US Dollar against
Thai Baht during the project period.
6.9      The economic rate of return for the project was 15.42 as compared
with 13.8? estimated at appraisal. The enhanced rate of return resulted
largely from increased power generation over appraisal estimates.
6.10     The financial rate of return for the project was 14.4Z as compared
with 14.62 estimated at appraisal. The financial rate of return does not
reflect the increase shown in the economic rate of return because taxes are
included in the FIRR and not in the EIRR. Taxes increased from 6.5Z on base
costs at appraisal to 7.32 on base costs during the project implementation
period.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.1      Though the actual production of 1.53 mt in 1984 was less than the
original target, it increased from 3.6 mt in 1985, to 5.8 mt in 1987, (Part
III, Table 5). It is expected to be 8.7 mt in 1991. During each year lignite



- 7 -
production had to be restricted to the actual off-take by the power plants
though the quantity of lignite exposed at the quarry bed continue to remain in
excess of one year's production target.
7.2      The completed project, as well as the proposed further expansions,
are economically viable at projected lignite transfer prices. Revenues of
EGAT's mining department over the next ten years would cover mine operating
costs and other expenses (depreciation of equipment, amortization of
overburden removal, administrative expenses, exploration expenses, interest
charges, contribution to the reclamation fund, resettlement expenses, and
royalty payments) and would generate sufficient cash to meet debt repayment
obligations and on-going capital requirements.
7.3      The transfer prices, determined on the recommendations of the lignite
Pricing Study Report, reflect the long run marginal cost of lignite; they are
equal to the sum of EGAT's mining costs and a depletion premium that accounts
for the increasing economic scarcity value of lignite and the associated cost
to the economy of the early use of an exhaustible resource. The depletion
premium is derived from the opportunity cost of lignite (based on imported
coal as a substitute), future mining costs and the magnitude of reserves.
7.4      The financial status of the EGAT Mining Directorate in fiscal year
1987 show a return on average net revalued assets in operation of 8.92 and a
debt service coverage of 2.2 times. With projected transfer prices and levels
of production forecast over the next ten years, EGAT's mining operations are
expected to continue to achieve acceptable financial returns.
8. Bank Performance
8.1      The Bank performed well all through the project cycle including the
appraisal process. However, while reviewing the equipment list the Bank
engineers did not anticipate the requirement of additional equipment which
occurred when the overburden ratio changed. This was later rectified in
consultation with mine site engineers and project consultants. Bank
supervision particularly in early years does not appear to have been adequate
with an interval of 10-16 months between missions (Part III, Table 9B). It
affected the procurement of auxiliary equipment, necessitating three
extensions of loan closing date (Part III, Table 2). The cost estimates for
earth moving equipment were placed much higher than the actual market price
(para 5.4). The saving on this account could easily finance all additional
equipment, engineering and training services.
8.2      The Bank urged the project to operate on three production shift basis
for intensive utilization of equipment in order to remove the target volume of
overburden and to achieve the production target (para. 5.5). The mine was
declared a separate profit center. It helped to improve both production and
productivity. It also helped to make the mine a economically viable unit
under a sound management system.



- 8a-
8.3      As the implementation progressed it became evident that the current
mining operation must form a part of long-term mining plan for systematic
exploitation of lignite reserves in the Mae Moh basin as well as for
reclamation of the exploited area. These objectives could be achieved by an
active collaboration between the Bank and the project supported by a number of
competent consultants.
9. Borrower's Performance and Proiect Relationshin
9.1      The success of the project is mainly due to the full commitment of
EGAT and its mine management at all stages from project preparation to
implementation. The management always acted with all sincerity and diligence
on the advice rendered by the Bank and the consultants. After going through
extensive management training at home and abroad mine managers gained
sufficient confidence to undertake future expansion projects on their own.
The borrower is now successfully implementing the Bank financed Mae Koh II
expansion project (para 4.3). Further expansion program is in hand.
9.2      The Bank maintained a close relationship with the government entities
associated with the development of lignite in the country. The Bank had a
special relation with the EGAT who are the sole owner of the mining venture.
The close collaboration between the Bank and EGAT officials contributed to the
success of the project.
10. Project Documentation and Data
10.1     Legal Documents were well drawn up and there was never any room tor
ambiguity. The staff appraisal report provided a useful framework for the
Bank and the borrower during project implementation. The project management
maintained all data in computerized HIS which could be easily accessed. All
the data in this report have been furnished by the project without any
assistance from the Bank.

MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT (LOAN 1852-TH)
PROJECT COMPLET=ON REPORT
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
EGAT submitted the project completion report in two stages - the
first one in August, 1985 after the physical completion and the second one in
September 1988, after complete disbursement of the loan amount. Part I of the
PCR is partly based on EGAT's two reports. Copies of EGAT's reports are
available in project files. A summary is placed below:
The Mae Moh Mine Expansion Project has capability to increase the
supply of lignite according to power plant demand upto the planned capacity of
2.8 million ton per year.
The implementation of the project has proceeded smoothly. Main
equipments such as shovels and trucks were put into operation earlier than the
schedule. Regarding the lignite handling equipment, its operation was put in
time despite the delay in transportation from the manufacturing factories to
the mine site.
The original allocation of funds was twice revised and approved by
the Bank resulting in a number of additional contracts which were not
initially envisaged. This was caused by the unforeseen circumstances.
Other activities connected with the project such as, resettlement and
land reclamation have been carried out progressively. The environmental
impact of the Mae Moh Mine expansion have been monitored regularly in
accordance with the Government's policy and World Bank standard.
Concerning improvement of the mine management, two new accounting
divisions were established namely, Mine Accounting Division and Mine
Controller's Division. These two division handle cost control, planning and
budgeting and accounting for the mine operations. In addition, the new mine
management system has been set up, implemented and satisfactorily achieved.
Usage of lignite for electricity generation has resulted in reduction
of fuel oil consumption which is reflected in the reduction of production cost
of energy generated and saving on foreign exchange as well.
Besides, EGAT has developed training programs for their staff. The
in-house training for the mine technical staff have been arranged not only by
EGAT, but also by many equipment suppliers by dispatching their experts to
administer the technical training at the work site. In the mean time, on-the-
job training programs for mine technical and operations staff as well as for
the mine management have been conducted by selected consulting firms rendering
broad knowledge to the staff which could strengthen their work experiences in
order to improve and develop the existing operational system.
In all, the implementation of the project has been carried out
successfully. The potential of mining capability has reached a level where
the overall increased lignite tonnage can be produced.
