I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) have requested a Bank loan of US$72
million to finance lignite mining equipment associated with the expansion
of the Mae Mob power plant, which is located in Northern Thailand about
650 km north of Bangkok. The project forms part of a national development
strategy to reduce the country's high dependence on oil imports, particularly
in the electricity sector, where petroleum accounts for about 70% of the fuel
used for power generation. The project will involve the expansion of the Mae
Moh lignite mine from 1 million tpy of capacity in 1979 to 2.8 million tpy by
1984. The expansion is required to meet some of the incremental demand of the
Mae Moh generating facilities up to and including a proposed fourth unit
(Power Plant Unit 4) of 150 MW scheduled to be commissioned by January 1984,
bringing the total Mae Moh power plant capacity to 375 MW. A separate-but-
related project for construction of the Power Plant Unit 4 is being undertaken
and is to be financed principally by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The
power project was approved by the ADB Board in November 1979.
1.02      The Bank has made nine loans, the most recent in April 1979, to EGAT
and its predecessor totalling US$362 million to help finance power generation
and transmission facilities. 1/ A tenth power loan (Khao Laem Hydroelectric
Project) to EGAT was approved by the Board in November 1979, but is still
awaiting signature. The first six projects of EGAT have been completed and
are all operating satisfactorily and the seventh (Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric
Project) was virtually completed at the end of February 1980. The eighth
power project (Pattani Hydroelectric Project) is still in early stages of
implementation.
1.03      Total financing for the mine expansion and Unit 4 power projects,
including interest during construction, is expected to be about US$383 million,
including US$206 million in foreign exchange. Aside from the Bank loan of
US$72 million for the mine, debt financing will be provided by the ADB,
the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), the Government of Switzerland and the
OPEC Special Fund (OSF); new equity and internally generated funds of about
US$146 million will come from the Royal Thai Government and EGAT. Total
financing requirements for the mine project alone is estimated to be about
US$130 million, of which US$72 million is foreign exchange.
1.04      The mine project was appraised in April/May 1979 by a mission com-
prising Mr. P.C. Kotschwar (Chief), Ms. M.O. Smith, and Mr. J.E. Carbonnelle.
A brief follow-up mission to coordinate mine and power projects was made in
September 1979.

II. ENERGY RESOURCES AND POWER GENERATION
A. Energy Consumption and Resources
2.01      Total energy consumption in Thailand has more than doubled between
FY 1970-78, from about 7.4 million tons of oil equivalent (77.2 trillion kcal)
to 14.4 million tons (150.2 trillion kcal). The average annual rate of growth
in energy consumption during the period was 9.0%, compared to 6.7% growth in
GNP. In 1978, about one quarter of energy consumption was for producing
electricity. During the period, electricity demand grew at an average rate
of 13.9% p.a. compared to commercial energy demand growth (in sectors such as
manufacturing, transportation, service) of about 7.9%. In 1978, energy demand
was met largely through petroleum products (71%) followed by charcoal and
fuelwood (16%), paddy husk and bagasse (7%), hydro (4%) and lignite (2%).
Virtually all of the petroleum products consumed in Thailand are being imported
at, in 1978, a cost of US$1,150 million or 29% of that year's export earnings
and coming from the Middle East (88%) and the Far East (12%). The other
sources of energy are essentially indigenous with limited imports of bulk
power from Laos.
2.02      In spite of Thailand's present heavy reliance on imported oil,
substantial opportunities exist for developing more of the country's domestic
energy resources. Priority has been accorded in national development plans,
therefore, to the rapid development of domestic resources to lessen the import
dependence. The principal local energy resources which are expected to be
brought on stream during the 1980's are the recently discovered natural gas
fields located in the Gulf of Thailand, a sizeable undeveloped hydro potential,
and lignite deposits. Thailand is also endowed with large oil-shale reserves
although their exploitation is not yet considered economical. After the oil
price hike of 1973/74, however, the Department of Mineral Resources launched
an oil-shale exploration program for the Mae Sot basin in the Tak province
close to the Burmese border. The Government is now considering financing
the feasibility of the project including much needed pilot plant testing.
1.   Natural Gas
2.03      The Gulf of Thailand is presently being intensively explored for
oil and gas.  Discoveries so far include two promising offshsre natural
gas fields with presently proven res rves of 2.9 trillion ft  and additional
probable reserves of i.7 trillion ft  with heat content of a 3relatively
high 1,048 BTU per ft in one field and a low 830 BTU per ft in the
other. Exploration has been carried out by two consortiums each headed
by a US company (Union Oil and Texas Pacific) which are now also expected
to develop the production of gas to be sold to the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT). The Bank has made an engineering loan for the first phase
of development of the Thai offshore fields, entailing the construction of a
pipeline to carry the natural gas to the planned Bang Pakong power station
about 60 km southeast of Bangkok, and also to the Bangkok area by 1982. In



- 3 -
February 1980, the Bank made a loan to PTT for the pipeline project (Loan
1773-TH). The loan includes financing of a gas utilization study which will
examine the possibility of using some of the gas resources in the industrial
sector, particrlarly for petrochemicals and ammonia production.
2.   Oil
2.04      The only known reserves of crude oil resources in Thailand are
located in the Fang Province in the Northern Region with proven reserves of
about 1 million barrels. Production at present is about 100,000 barrels per
year, or less than 0.15% of total petroleum consumption in the country. Little
onshore exploration for oil was carried out during the 70's but there has
recently been a resurgence of interest on the part of Esso and Shell which
both participate in the local refinery industry and have acquired new explo-
ration blocks in Northeast and Central Thailand respectively. Offshore
exploration for oil in the Gulf of Thailand and the Adaman Sea has proven
so far unsuccessful, but exploration is continuing and prospects are still
considered promising.
3.   Hydro
2.05      The hydro potential (excluding that of two international rivers,
the Mekong and the Salween) is estimated at about 9,300 MW of which 910 MW
are now in operation; 2,200 MW in nine projects are under construction or
programmed for implementation before 1990; 870 MW in fifteen projects are in
the prefeasibility or feasibility study stage and about 1,900 MW in twelve
projects have been selected by EGAT for conceptual studies. The remainder,
of about 3,420 MW in some ninety three sites have only been potentially
assessed by the National Energy Administration (NEA). Interest has been
expressed in developing the considerable (19,000 MW) hydroelectric potential
of the Mekong River which Thailand shares with Laos and Kampuchea, and of
the Salween River (about 5,000 MW) which Thailand shares with Burma, but
political and resettlement problems make such development unlikely in the
near term. The Bank has recently made two loans for the hydro development
and has received Board approval for a third, awaiting signature (para. 1.02).
4.   Lignite
2.06      The proposed project would establish a role for the Bank in the
development of the third major domestic energy resource, namely the lignite
deposits which are suitable for fueling mine-mouth power plants. The lignite
resources and their exploration are the subject of Chapter III.
5.   Development Strategy
2.07      The development potential of domestic energy resources justifies
Bank financial assistance and advisory support for the design and imple-
mentation of a strategy aimed at substituting domestic energy supplies for
oil imports. If properly developed and implemented, this strategy will
entail a lowering of the energy cost in Thailand, a relaxation of the pre-
sently severe balance of payment squeeze and a more secure energy supply

situation. The Bank is presently reviewing the energy sector at large
in Thailand, including the energy resource potential, future energy supply
and demand, energy pricing and energy sector organization. This and other
work is being undertaken in preparation for the Bank's involvement as a
"special interest" party to the preparation, supervision and review of
an energy master plan study to be financed by UNDP and executed by ADB in
1980-81. The master plan will define a program to meet Thailand's energy
requirements up to the year 2000.
B.   Institutional Framework of the Energy Sector
2.08      The present energy sector institutions comprise a large number
of government agencies, committees and advisory bodies with various and
somewhat disparate functions. The Government plays a dominant role in
the power sector whereas the petroleum and gas sector has a substantial
participation from foreign and local private investors. The major state
enterprise of the petroleum and gas sector is the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT), created in December 1978 to engage in and promote petroleum
and related businesses. In August 1979, PTT took over the Natural Gas
Organization of Thailand, and has agreed in principle with the Bank to
establish a gas division with a high level of financial and operational
autonomy for purposes, inter alia, of implementing the Natural Gas Pipeline
Project (para. 2.03). It is expected that the Energy Department of the
Ministry of Defense and its oil refineries and the Oil Fuel Organization
will be merged with PTT by the end of 1980 as specified in the legislation
creating PTT. The Authority (PTT) is under the jurisdiction of the Ministers
of Defense and Industry until December 1980, when it will be solely under
the Ministry of Industry.
2.09      The National Energy Administration (NEA) which comes under the
Office of the Prime Minister, has responsibility for energy policy and
planning, including the energy master plan study for Thailand (para. 2.07).
NEA also administers a relatively small program for the exploration and
exploitation of lignite and has temporarily provided drilling equipment to
expedite EGAT's drilling program at Mae Moh.
2.10      The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the
Ministry of Finance and the Budget Bureau play important planning, budgeting
and auditing roles for all major state related entities and, in particular,
for the power sector enterprises.
C.   The Power Sector
1.   Role of the Sector in the Economy
2.11      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1.4% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 21.3% and 1.6% of GDP respectively. The growth of the
power sector has kept pace with Thailand's economic development. Between
FY75 and FY78, when GDP grew at an average rate of about 6.4% in real terms,



total electricity consumption increased at an average rate of about 13.8%.
The elasticity coefficient of 2.1 is comparable to countries at a similar
stage of development.
2.   Sector Organization
a.   General
2.12      The power sector consists of about eight government agencies,
three state utilities and the ministries to which they report, and five
private franchises which are so small as to be insignificant. The state-
owned utilities are EGAT, the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and
the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). EGAT, which is described in
Chapter IV, generates 95% of all electric energy in Thailand. The balance
is generated by NEA, PEA, by self-generating industries, and by a few private
franchises which for the most part purchase their power needs in bulk from
PEA and EGAT. The composition of the sector is described more fully in the
Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project Staff Appraisal Report dated October 25, 1979.
A summary of the power market, load forecast and EGAT development program is
shown below.
3.   The Power Market
2.13      At the end of FY 78 total generating capacity installed by the
various entities was as follows:

2.15      Total power consumption was 11,349 GWh in FY78 (total system losses
including station, services, transmission and distribution losses were about
16%) or 251 kWh per capita:  62% was used by industrial consumers; 21% by
residential consumers; 15% by commercial consumers, and 2% by street lighting
and others.
2.16      EGAT's market covers all of Thailand and comprises the Greater
Metropolitan area of Bangkok served by MEA, the provincial areas served
by PEA, and industries and other large scale or specialized consumers,
including Electricite du Laos (EDL). 1/ EGAT's sales in FY78 were as
follows:

2.17      The power market has had a long history of steady growth, the
average annual increase in peak and energy demands being, as noted, 14% and
15% respectively over the period FY70-78. Early stimulants were rapidly
rising investments, favorable world rice markets, and an expanding economy.
As a result of the oil crisis and world economic recession, the low point was
reached in FY74 when peak and energy requirements increased by only 4.7%
and 5.6% respectively. However, system growth has been recovering rapidly
since FY75. Peak and power growth are shown below:

4.   Load Forecast
2.18      EGAT's load forecast is based on the consolidation of forecasts
made by MEA, PEA and the direct consumers after taking into account the
effects of load diversity, system losses and station services. The load
forecasts for MEA and PEA were derived by a study of historical growth
trends of different categories of consumers.
2.19      The latest load forecast was made in December 1978 by a Government
Load Forecast Working Group, consisting of representatives from NESDB, NEA
and the three utilities. It took into consideration actual FY78 loads, new
industries planned and the accelerated rural electrification program. A
check by a macro forecast based on a regression relationship between per
capita consumption of electrical energy and per capita GDP, provided nearly
the same results as the micro forecast using a GDP growth rate of 7% from
FY77-81 and thereafter gradually declining to 6% by FY86.
2.20      The load forecast from FY79-90 is shown below:

1985      27,025         8.8            64.8         4,762       9.3
1986      29,782        10.2            64.7         5,260      10.5
1987      32,230         8.2            64.7         5,692       8.2
1988      34,843         8.1            64.7         6,148       8.0
1989      37,620         8.0            64.7         6,634       7.9
1990      40,533         7.7            64.7         7,149       7.8
2.21      EGAT's power and peak generation would increase from 14,188 GWh
and 2,405 MW in FY79 to 40,533 GWh and 7,149 MW in FY90. The average annual
increase for EGAT's power and peak generation would be 14.0% and 14.2% respec-
tively for FY79-82; 9.5%, and 10.2% for FY83-86; and 8.0% for FY87-90. The
Bank has agreed with EGAT that the December 1978 load forecast will be used
at this stage as the basis for formulating the power development program and
the consequent financial projections. However, an in-depth review of the
load forecast has been included in the long-term study for future generation
and transmission projects under the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project (Loan
1690-TH).
5.   EGAT Development Program
2.22      EGAT's power development program is based on the principle of the
least-cost sequence of development, following an extensive study of alter-
native generation and transmission projects, using computer programs available
in-house.   This program is currently firm up to FY86 only; beyond that year
further studies and optimization are necessary.
2.23      EGAT's FY79-86 power development program comprises the following
components:
(a) on-going projects under construction;
(b) new projects to be implemented and completed before FY86; and
(c) future projects to be initiated during FY82-86.
2.24      The generation program, FY79-86, including on-going works (a) total-
ling 710 MW, and new projects (b) of 3,010 MW capacity is as follows:

2.25      EGAT's expansion program also involves the construction of trans-
mission lines and substations necessary for distribution and the extension of
the network to cope with the increasing load requirements and improve system
reliability and efficiency.
2.26      The cost of the program including interest during construction is
estimated at about B116.8 billion (US$5.7 billion) through the period FY79-86,
of which B61.3 billion (US$3.0 billion) will be foreign costs and B55.5 billion
(US$2.7 billion) local costs. Of the total, approximately 75% is for genera-
tion and 25% for transmission and substations.

III. LIGNITE RESOURCES
A.   Lignite Comparison to Other Coals
3.01      Coal is a solid, brittle, combustible, carbonaceous mineral formed
by partial to complete decomposition of vegetation. It varies widely in grade
and calorific value, depending upon content of moisture, sulphur, ash, volatile
matter, and fixed carbon. Coal quality improves with greater amounts of fixed
carbon and lesser amounts of ash, moisture, sulphur and volatile matter.
3.02      Lignite is the lowest quality coal, brownish-black and woody in
appearance, with a heating value of about 3,880 kcal/kg. It has high moisture,
volatile matter and ash content, and tends to decompose and ignite sponta-
neously when exposed to air. Other coals in ascending order of quality are
sub-bituminous coal with almost twice the heating value (6,670 kcal/kg),
bituminous coal (7,510-8,840 kcal/kg) and anthracite (8,420 kcal/kg).
3.03      Coal is exploited by a variety of underground and surface mining
techniques. While the higher cost of underground mining is generally pro-
hibitive for lignite, open pit mining is used for all grades of coal deposits
which are shallow or thick enough to be economically attractive.
3.04      While most other coals have a variety of uses in, for example,
electricity generation, iron and steel production, cement, pulp and paper mill
and other industries, residential/commercial uses, transportation (railroads)
and gas manufacture, lignite is used almost exclusively for large-scale power
generation at mine-mouth sites. This is because lignite is uneconomic to
transport due to its high moisture and ash content, and unsafe to store due to
its tendency to decompose and self-ignite in open air. Accordingly, lignite
is not traded, although there is an increasing trade in other coals, parti-
cularly in steam coal, in view of the energy shortages and rapid increases in
oil prices over the past several years.
3.05      Domestic mine-mouth coal prices in 1978 varied from less than US$10
per ton in LDCs, such as in India and Brazil, to US$25-60 per ton in OECD
countries, according to mining conditions, labor productivity, wage rates and
other factors. Because of its characteristics, however, lignite is as noted
usually consumed by a power plant at the mine site, and is normally priced on
an internal pricing basis rather than on a reported open market price basis.
3.06      A recent (October 1979) Bank publication, "Coal Development Potential
and Prospects in the Developing Countries," provides a comprehensive worldwide
view of the present structure of the coal industry, its development and
constraints in the developing countries and measures to accelerate its pro-

3.08      Most of the major lignite producers are in Eastern Europe, where a
far higher proportion of total coal production is in that form of coal than
elsewhere. The only major lignite producer outside COMECON is the F.R.
Germany, which produces 59% of its coal as lignite according to UN statistics.
As a result, much of the technology of low-rank coal exploitation has been
developed either in Eastern Europe or in the F. R. Germany. The technology,
because of the prevalent geologic conditions in these regions, makes use of
large-scale bucket wheel excavators that are applicable to German lignites but
may not necessarily be applicable to harder deposits found elsewhere.
3.09      Production of lignite - like that of most other forms of coal - was
in a secular decline in most major lignite-producing regions prior to the oil
crisis of 1973/74. Since then, however, lignite production has become a more
economic proposition and production has increased significantly.

3.11      World resources of coal are not known with any degree of confidence
since there has been limited economic incentive historically to explore for or
prove up low quality coal reserves. The above table, therefore, must be
regarded as only indicative, but it does show that the bulk of lignite re-
sources are to be found in North America and Asia, although economically
recoverable reserves in Europe are also important.
C.   Thai Lignite
1.  Use of Lignite
3.12      As in other lignite producing countries, this fuel's unstable
weathering characteristics have restricted its use in Thailand nearly exclu-
sively to the fueling of power generating plants. A highly limited number of
other local uses have nevertheless contributed to sustain a low and somewhat
erratic production pattern at the four main operating Thai mines for distri-
bution in areas neighboring the mine sites.
3.13      The principal other local use is for tobacco curing, with some
additional demand at Mae Moh in the past from a small fertilizer-producing
plant which was closed down in 1978 (para. 3.16).

3.15      In 1978 about 65% of the lignite produced in Thailand was used for
power generation at Krabi, Mae Moh and North Bangkok, the remainder by indus-
tries (nearly exclusively for tobacco curing). The Department of Mineral
Resource (DMR) reports that during the same year 1,184 persons were employed
in the lignite mines and that the total value of the lignite production at the
mine was about US$2.5 million at US$4.2 per ton. Lignite production comprises
0.5% of the output value of the Thai mining industry which is dominated by tin
and tungsten and accounts for about 1.6% of GDP.
3.16      The Mae Moh and Krabi mines are operated by EGAT, the Li mine by NEA
and the other mines by private companies or entrepreneurs. Prior to its
expansion in 1978, the Mae Moh mine provided lignite to a small 12.5 MW
thermal plant, to a fertilizer plant (using lignite to produce gas as feed



- 15 -
stock) and to a few local industries for tobacco curing. The thermal plant
has since been decommissioned and the fertilizer plant, which was never
economically viable, has been closed down probably permanently by an explosion
in 1978. The mine was expanded to provide fuel for a 75 MW power plant
commissioned in mid 1978, and a second 75 MW power plant commissioned in early
1979. The mine expansions at Mae Moh that are part of EGAT's preliminary
development plan through 1990 (Annex 2-2) would provide for the following
increases in mine production:

This growth in lignite production at Mae Moh would depend, among other things,
on the projected long term opportunity cost of substitute fuels.  If deter-
mined to be economically efficient, the total volume of lignite supply would
support the expansion in Mae Moh power generation capacity to 1,500 MW. The
related planned investments in power generation at Mae MDh are as follows:

3.17      By comparison, operations at Krabi mine are modest, and are not
anticipated to undergo the rapid expansion of Mae Mobh due to small reserves
of lignite and difficult geological conditions. The mine is a small open pit
truck and shovel operation which provides lignite to fuel three 20 MW power
units at Krabi. Small expansions have been undertaken through the development
of two new mining operations in 1978 in the vicinity of Krabi near Klong Wai
Lek and Klong Bang Mark. The lignite from these new mines will be available
for use of the Krabi power plant by 1980.  The last power unit at Krabi was
commissioned in 1977 and no further power expansion is presently under consi-
deration. The deposit is nevertheless being further investigated by EGAT to
delineate more reserves.

3.   Lignite Reserves and Exploration
3.18      The presently known reserves of lignite in Thailand are as follows:

Total            175            200               395            770
3.19      About 57 occurrences of lignite have been identified in the northern
and the southern regions of Thailand, among which 13 have been investigated to
some extent by NEA and 6 by EGAT. Prospects for proving up considerable
additional reserves in the country are generally considered good and while
EGAT's exploratory drilling equipment (and some provided temporarily by DMR)
is presently concentrated at Mae Moh to complete the delineation of that
basin, the Company has also extended its exploration activities to known
lignite occurrences in other areas of the country and found encouraging
lignite indications at Mae Ramat ir Tak province. Under the proposed
reorganization EGAT will strengthen its lignite geology division (para. 4.16),
giving it responsibility for compiling geological data on lignite deposits,
recommending suitable targets for exploration, supervising prospection
activities, such as surface geological mapping and geological and geophysical
investigations, and undertaking drilling, surveying and evaluating activities.
3.20      EGAT is presently allocating about US$2.3 million per annum for
exploration. To facilitate the continued financing of exploration, but on a
wider territorial basis the Mining Department intends to prepare nation-wide
exploration plans annually to be reviewed by the Bank under the proposed
project. This arrangement has been confirmed with EGAT.
3.21      Recently proven and probable lignite reserves at Mae Moh are capable
of supporting the development of a total generating capacity of about 1,500 MW
during the 1980s which, together with the presently installed 60 MW capacity
at Krabi would provide approximately 22% of EGAT's total energy generation in
1990 (para. 2.18). During the 1980s it is expected that additional econo-
mically recoverable reserves will be proven up either at Mae Moh or in other
prospective basins, enabling EGAT to expand its lignite-fired generation



- 17 -
capacity further during the 1990s and thus maintain the share of lignite
among its primary energy sources. A single deposit comparable in size to
Mae Moh, for example, would provide an additional 50 million tons per year of
lignite for 10 years of new power generation which is the order of magnitude
that is estimated would be needed. This in turn would help EGAT avoid having
to resort extensively to oil-fired plants for its incremental capacity during
the 1990s after having implemented a major oil substitution program in the
previous decade.
4.   Domestic Pricing Policy
3.22      Like other lignites, Thai lignite possesses the characteristics
of bulk, and potential disaggregation and spontaneous combustion in air that
make it distinct from other coals and thus essentially non-tradeable. Most
of Thailand's lignite production does not enter commercia markets (paras.
3.12-3.13), and as a result the lignite has no well defined market value.
EGAT, which accounted for 75% of lignite production in 1978, has made a
practice of transferring lignite to its power plants at the cost of produc-
tion. This practice sufficed when lignite was a relatively insignificant
source of fuel for the EGAT system and lignite investments were minimal.
However, in view of national policy to develop local energy sources and
EGAT's stepped up investments in lignite (paras. 2.14, 2.27, 3.16), a new
system for managing lignite operations and developments is warranted which
entails assigning a price to the lignite produced at the mine and transferred
to the power plants.
3.23      The lignite price is a useful accounting mechanism for achieving
efficient management of mining operations, as discussed in paragraph 4.22,
and for ensuring that the mining operations have annual allocations of cash
adequate to meet specific on-going and operational expenses. More importantly,
it is a means of introducing economic considerations into the production and
use of lignite as one of Thailand's depletable natural resources.
3.24     Present reserve estimates of domestic energy resources, particularly
natural gas and lignite, in Thailand indicate that these resources are capable
of supporting planned new power generating capacity through the end of the
1980's at which time, the country may have to resort more heavily to imported
fuel (oil and coal). If electricity tariffs have been permitted throughout
the 1980's to reflect in their structure the marginal cost pricing of domestic
fuel supplies rather than the higher cost of internationally traded fuels,
there could be considerable disruption in electricity tariffs in the late 1980's.
To prevent the possibility of such disruption the lignite price should be
established taking into account such economic parameters as the size of lignite
reserves, the prevailing and long term economic prices of substitute fuels and
possible developments in alternative uses for lignite.
3.25     The long term forecast price for lignite has a critical role in
preparation of master mining plans. Any (open pit) mining plan will be based
on the concept of a maximum economically acceptable stripping ratio, i.e.,
the depth to which it is still economical to mine lignite given the necessity
to remove overburden. The maximum acceptable stripping ratio for a mine will
be selected in such manner as to achieve equalization of marginal lignite pro-
duction costs and the projected long term price of a substitute fuel, taking



- 18 -
into account cost differentials between construction and operation of a power
plant fired with lignite and that fired with a substitute fuel.
3.26      In view of both the importance of economic parameters to lignite
pricing, and the uncertainties regarding Thailand's potential energy resource
reserves, the appropriate fuel comparator for lignite and long term energy
pricing trends, it has been agreed that EGAT will, no later than December 31,
1981 complete, with the assistance of consultants, a study to determine the
long term forecast price for lignite to be used: (i) in making annual adjust-
ments to the lignite price at Mae Moh and Krabi mines, as described below; and
(ii) in preparing the master mining plans for the Mae Moh basin and any other
mining developments. The terms of reference for the study will be agreed with
the Bank and the study will be furnished to the Bank for its comments.
3.27      It has been agreed with EGAT that, upon completion of the study but
not later than 1982, the price to be used at the mines will be based on the
recommendations of the study, as well as, inter alia on the size of lignite
reserves, prevailing prices of substitute fuels and possible developments
in the uses of lignite. Commencing in 1982 EGAT will consult with the Bank
not later than April 1 of each year on suitable adjustments to be carried
out during the next fiscal year in the price of lignite. In the interim,
the lignite price will be established, as a minimum, on the principle that it
will cover the cost of production plus a margin which is, at least, adequate
to cover debt service, fixed assets replacements and exploration requirements
for each mining operation. This price will be established in consultation
with the Bank not later than December 31, 1980 and become effective on
April 1, 1981.
3.28      The price of lignite, as in the case of other fuel sources to
EGAT, will be included in EGAT's fuel adjustment clause and reflected in
the electricity tariffs. It is estimated that if the lignite price is based
on the opportunity cost of imported steam coal from Australia (the closest
source of substitute coal for Thailand), the impact of the economic premium
or adjustment to be made to the lignite price, when full production for the
proposed project is attained in 1984, will affect corporate revenues by about
1%, as shown in Annex 3.
IV. EGAT AND ITS MINING DEPARTMENT
A.   EGAT
1.   Background
4.01      As noted previously (para. 1.02), EGAT and its predecessor have
received nine loans from the Bank starting in 1957 1/ to finance power plants
and transmission facilities and to strengthen some institutional aspects of
the power utility. This loan would be the first to finance the expansion of
mining production for an EGAT mine-mouth power plant and to provide technical
and managerial assistance to EGAT's Mining Department.
1/   A tenth IBRD loan to EGAT of US$80 million for the Khao Laem Hydro-
electric Project has been approved by the Board in November 1979.



- 19 -
2.   Ownership
4.02      EGAT was established by law in May 1968 as a wholly-owned Government
corporation under the aegis of the Office of the Prime Minister. It operates
semi-autonomou.ly under supervision of a 10-member Board of Directors and
day-to-day direction from a General Manager appointed by the Board with the
consent of the Council of Ministers.. The General Manager is an ex-officio
member of the Board, and the only member not appointed directly by the Council
of Ministers.
4.03      While legislative provisions require, inter alia, that EGAT present
annual capital and operating budgets to the Council of Ministers for approval
and information respectively, and that tariff changes be approved by the
Council of Ministers, EGAT operates in other respects with considerable
autonomy to develop and maintain electricity generation at minimal cost for
public consumption.
3.   Organization and Management
4.04      EGAT is functionally organized with deputy managers for adminis-
tration, procurement and supply, technical and engineering affairs, thermal
power, and power plant operations. An organization chart is shown in Annex
4-1. EGAT's Mining Department is discussed in more detail in Section B below.
The institution is well managed and competently staffed and operated. At end
FY78, EGAT had a total of 15,930 employees, of which 1,882 were graduates of
universities, 1,794 had diplomas and higher professional education, and 2,795
had higher vocational training.
4.05      Training is handled by the authority's training and development
division which arranges courses and seminars for all levels of staff. Recent
increases in the number of projects under construction and the increased size
of generating units in thermal power stations have caused temporary shortages
in some categories of staff but the problems are being actively addressed.
4.   Present Facilities
4.06      EGAT had 2,811 MW (or 85% of total Thai generating capacity) in
service at the end FY78, made up of:
EGAT - Installed Power Generating Capacity
Type of Plant                  MW             %
Hydro                         909            32

4.07      EGAT's grid is modern and efficient.  Power is transmitted at three
voltage levels; 230 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV with a total length of 9,174 circuit-
kilometers at end-1978. Ninety nine substations were in operation with an
installed capacity of 4,364 MVA. Additional details on EGAT's present power
plant facilities and development plans are given in Chapter II.

4.09      While EGAT's revenues from sale of energy have increased more than
2.8 times over the last six years, its operating expenses have increased
by more than 3.4 times primarily due to the rapid increase in cost of imported
fuel oil from 1974 onwards. Despite the increase in operating ratio, EGAT
has contributed on average about 29% of its annual construction expenditures
during the period. EGAT's debt control covenant under previous IBRD loans,
provides that EGAT should secure the Bank's approval on borrowings if its
debt.equity ratio exceeds 60:40 and if its medium term debt (maturing within
five years) exceeds 15% of total debt. While its debt:equity ratio has ranged
from 58:42 in 1974 to 65:35 in 1979 as shown above, on a revalued net fixed
assets basis, as agreed with EGAT, the debt/equity ratio has been below 60:40
throughout the period, and the medium term debt within the covenanted range.
The debt covenants are to be continued under the proposed loan. The current



- 21 -
ratio has decreased from a high of 2.0 in 1976 to 1.4 in 1979. However, EGAT
has access to short-term lines of credit from local banks that it can use to
ease its liquidity position. EGAT has reduced its working capital requirements
as recommended in a 1976 IBRD report on the power sector in Thailand (Report
No. 1794-TH), by reducing its receivables from an excessively high 5.2 months
billing at end 1976 to 4.1 at end 1979. The bulk of these receivables are
electricity receivables from MEA and PEA (paras. 2.13 - 2.15). Further
reduction in receivables through improved control and possible modification in
contract provisions with MEA and PEA is being considered in the tariff study
mentioned in para. 4.13 below.
4.10      While EGAT's financial position has been generally strong, the
electricity tariff policies it has pursued have caused, under the changing
conditions of the mid to late 1970's, a deterioration in the corporation's
capability to finance its soundly based investment program (para. 2.27). By
legislative provision EGAT is required to finance a substantial portion of its
investments from internally generated funds, which was specified initially in
an earnings covenant with the Bank to be 30% annual self-generation of three
years' average construction expenditures (comprising the test, previous and
following years). Due to lumping construction expenditures into one or
several years, difficulties in definitions of construction expenditure and
cash generation, and particularly inflation, EGAT's earnings covenant with the
Bank was reduced to 15% self-generation in 1978 and ultimately changed follow-
ing Government agreement to a rate of return, for the entire power generation
sector (Loan No. 1527-TH of March 9, 1978). During negotiations in 1979 for
Loan 1690-TH it was agreed that EGAT and the sector would earn rates of return
on average revalued net fixed assets in operation of 7% for FY80 and FY81 and
8% thereafter. Provision for continuation of these covenants at modified
rates were included in the Khao Laem Hydroelectric loan and guarantee agree-
ments (approved by the Board in November 1979, but not yet signed).
4.11      Changing economic conditions resulting from the fuel crisis and
economic slowdown of 1973/74 coinciding with political changes, and rapidly
rising inflation have made the country ill-prepared for the tariff increases
that have become necessary since that time. In order to help EGAT meet its
financial requirements, the Government, in 1977, changed the price mix of
petroleum products to pass greater proportions of oil price increases to
gasoline consumers than to fuel oil consumers. This policy continued until
the 115% rise in petroleum prices during 1979 when it became no longer feas-
ible. An attempt was made to increase tariffs by 56% on November 1, 1979
but parliamentary and public opposition forced the Government to reconsider
the increase. An increase of 38% at the retail level to bring the average
retail price to B 1.12 (USd5.5) per kWh was imposed from February 1, 1980 to
partially cover fuel costs.
4.12      Government is aware of the need to eliminate all oil subsidies to
the sector as soon as possible, and to enable the investment program to
continue unhindered by financial constraint. A plan of action was agreed
during negotiations with the Government and EGAT to remove subsidies and
restore the sector's financial viability. The plan provides for budgetary
oil subsidies to be removed by January 1, 1981 (requiring an estimated 64%



- 22 -
tariff increase at the EGAT level) with an additional increase by April 1,
1981 of about 19%, to yield rates of return at a minimum of 2% and 8% for FY81
and thereafter, respectively for EGAT and the sector as a whole. These rates
of return are 'ncorporated in the earnings covenant for the proposed loan, and
will apply alsu to the Bang Pakong Thermal Power and Khao Laem Hydroelectric
Project Agreements. The plan further provides that changes in all fuel prices
be reflected promptly in the tariff schedules of all utilities in the
electricity sector.
4.13      The tariff structure of EGAT and the power sector is under review in
a tariff study financed under Loan 1485-TH of September 1977 and to be com-
pleted shortly. Following the findings and proposals of the 1976 Power Sector
Review, EGAT and the Government agreed to undertake the study which considers
such actions as simplifying the tariff structure, ensuring that tariffs
reflect cost structures and determining appropriate tariff levels to ensure
the financial viability of EGAT and the power sector without Government
subsidy. A detailed discussion of tariff issues is contained in Reports No.
2271-TH (Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project of March, 1979) and 1447-TH (Pattani
Hydroelectric Project of June, 1977).
6.   Accounting and Auditing
4.14      Accounting is based on the US Federal Power Commission's system
which is operated and administered by well-qualified and competent staff on
EGAT's computer. Some change in accounting procedures, however, is anticipated
to reflect the growing importance of EGAT's mining operations (paras. 3.22,
4.22, 4.23). In 1978, EGAT sent its financial and accounting management to
mine-mouth power plants abroad to become acquainted with the various "captive"
mine accounting structures.
4.15      EGAT is audited annually by the National Audit Council, the Govern-
ment organization for auditing all state enterprises. The international
accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand, is retained by EGAT as financial consul-
tants to cooperate with the Audit Council and issue a separate report on the
annual accounts. The auditing procedures are acceptable to the Bank and the
performance of the consultants has been satisfactory.
B.   The Mining Department
1.   Background
4.16      The Mining Department has its origin in the Lignite Authority (LA),
a public generation and transmission authority, which in 1968 merged with two
other such authorities, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA) and the North
East Electricity Authority (NEEA), to establish EGAT.
2.   Organization and Management
4.17      The Mining Department is being re-organized and expanded to support
EGAT's plans to develop lignite production for its power plants. A new
organization chart that increases the number of divisions from 4 to 7 is
expected to be approved by EGAT's Board during FY 1980. The chart is shown
in Annex 4-3. The three new divisions are: (i) the mining engineering division



- 23 -
which is responsible for short and long-term planning, the annual capital and
operating budget, statistical collection and production cost analyses, feas-
ibility studies of new mines and mine expansions, and technical designs and
procedures; (ii) the mine equipment division which is responsible for mecha-
nical engineering, repair and maintenance for mine equipment, and for infor-
mation and planning of new equipment requirements; and (iii) the Mae Moh mine
maintenance division which is responsible for on-site maintenance and repair.
The existing coal geology and mine operation control divisions would be
strengthened to intensify lignite exploration and production control of
expanded mine activities respectively. The Mae Moh and Krabi mines and Mae
Moh mines maintenance divisions report to the Superintendent of the Mining
Department, but are located at the respective mining sites. Additional
organizational changes required by Mining Department profit center functions
proposed in the project are discussed in para. 4.23. A detailed organizational
breakdown of the Mae Moh mine and maintenance divisions is shown on the
following page.
4.18      The existing technical and managerial personnel of the Department
are well qualified and experienced. The Department staffing totals 1,079,
excluding semi-skilled and unskilled workers at the mines. Of the total, 921
are heavy equipment operators, technicians and skilled labor mostly at the
mine sites, with the balance comprising engineers, geologists and supporting
staff.
4.19      The Comptroller's Department receives the Mining Department plans
for construction projects in December of each year and for operations in
January/February. These plans are reviewed by the Budget Division by May/June
and submitted as part of the EGAT annual budget to the Board of Directors, the
Ministry of Finance and ultimately to the Cabinet for approval by the begin-
ning of the fiscal year in October. Monthly reports to the Budget Division
on expenses made by the Mining Department to the Budget Division are compared
with the approved budget to ensure efficiency and to keep EGAT management
informed about any substantial cost variance.
4.20      The Mining Department maintains detailed and complete records of
all its operations. At the mine sites, inventory control is well organized
and maintained, and monthly reports are made detailing volumes of overburden
removed and lignite produced. Expenditures are fully recorded.
4.21      The Mining Department itself, however, has not so far devoted suffi-
cient attention to reviewing and analyzing the production cost of lignite per
ton for the Mae Moh and Krabi mines, and therefore lacks continuous assessment
of the efficiency of its operations, except on an end-of-the-year basis as
supplied by the Comptroller. This weakens the Department's capability to
modify mining operations to improve on production and/or to reduce production
costs. While the Comptroller's Department determines and analyzes the
respective mines' lignite production costs, there is not an adequate flow of
information between the Comptroller and Mining Departments for the analysis
to be useful to day-to-day operations. There is need for improvement in
communication and for support to the Mining Department to develop some of the
informational requirements within the Department itself.

4.22      Giving to the Mining Department full responsibility for lignite
production costs and for the financial performance of mining operations will
provide that Department with greater incentive to control production costs
and provide for optimum effectiveness of mining operations. This transfer of
responsibility entails treating Mae Moh and Krabi mines and any other major
mining operation that develops at EGAT, as mine accounting centers with the
performance of each center measured in terms of the expenses it incurs and
the charges it makes for the lignite transferred to the power plants. The
establishment of a price for the lignite produced and consumed by the power
units has been agreed with EGAT, and was discussed in para. 3.27. As the
scope and size of mine operations expand under current plans, the financial
performance of the Department in terms of operating efficiency and cash
generation will become increasingly important.
4.23      EGAT fully understands the usefulness of a mine accounting center
approach to management of the growing Department, and has agreed to establish
by not later than April 1, 1981, a mine management system, satisfactory to
the Bank, which places financial management responsibility including such
functions as cost control planning and budgeting and accounting relating to
mining activities within the Mining Department but under the supervision and
control of the Controller's Department. To implement the new mine accounting
system, the following measures will be undertaken:
(i) Mine Accounting Division. This new division under the
Controller's Department, but assigned and located within the
Mining Department, will be responsible for liaison with the
Comptroller's Department in reviewing the costs of the
lignite produced at each mine, in establishing and reviewing
annually the level of the transfer price, and in evaluating
the financial status of the mine accounting centers on a
monthly basis. It will also prepare the financial statements
of the mining accounting centers. The division would include
1 cost control officer, 2 mine accountants, and I planning
and budget officer who would be trained under the project
(para. 5.49). It will report both to the Superintendent,
Mining Department and to the Controller.
(ii) Mine Comptroller's Division. This division will be form-
ulated from two existing organizational units to perform
comptroller functions for the Mining Department, to
integrate Mining Department and Corporate accounting systems
and to work closely with the Mine Accounting Division in
cost control and budgeting.
(iii) Comptroller Department Positions. Two new positions will
be established within the Budget Division and Accounting
Procedures and Methods Division respectively to work
specifically on Mining Department activities.
(iv) Computer Terminals. EGAT will install computer terminals on
a rental basis at Mae Moh and Krabi to facilitate cost control
and to provide data processing for technical operations.



- 26 -
(v) Training. Short-term training totalling about 18 man-months
for the 4 members of the Mine Accounting Division and 2
members of the Comptroller's Department will be provided
undr- the proposed loan (para. 5.49). It was agreed that
EGAT will prepare and furnish to the Bank a training program
for its staff in mine accounting and systems and procedures
for cost information flows, so that training could begin by
no later than October 1, 1980. Training would be at
mining companies with satisfactory accounting procedures and
at university seminars in mine accounting.
4.24      The mine accounting centers and related systems and procedures will
be implemented when lignite pricing arrangements discussed in para. 3.27
become effective on April 1, 1981. EGAT's mine accounting center financial
accounts will be reviewed in the course of its annual corporate audit by
consultants.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope
5.01      The expansion project for the Mae Moh open pit lignite mine includes
the engineering, procurement and erection of mining and related equipment,
technical assistance, training and civil works required to bring total mine
production from 1 million tons of the run-of-mine lignite in 1979 to 2.8
million tons per year required in 1984.
5.02      The expansion is required to meet the incremental demand of the  hae
Moh power generating facilities up to and including Unit 4 scheduled to be com-
missioned by January 1984. The Mae Moh Power Unit 4 Project has been appraised
for principal financing by ADB. The close coordination of mine and power
projects, due to their complete interdependence for successful operation at
Mae Moh is discussed in Chapter VI.
5.03      The mining equipment comprises four 15 yd3 electric rope shovels,
thirty four 85 t rear end dump trucks, one coal crushing, conveying, stacking
and reclaiming system, and ancillary equipment. The project also includes
maintenance shop and office expansions, as well as expansion of the mine power
supply system, technical assistance and training.
5.04      The selected mining equipment, which will be procured over a period
of four years, is together with the existing equipment, sufficient to meet
the lignite requirements of Power Units 1-4. Its size and particularly the
capacity of the conveying and crushing system, however, have been chosen
taking into account the scheduled construction of a fifth power unit to be
commissioned 6 months after Unit 4 (para. 3.16), thus comprising in some com-
ponents a slight overcapacity for the fourth power unit, but a more economic
investment for Units 4 and 5 together. Procurement for incremental mining
equipment for Unit 5 will have to be initiated in 1983 and is not included in
the project scope.



- 27 -
B. Prolect Location
5.05      The Mae Moh power and mine complex is located in Northeastern
Thailand in Lampang Province, approximately 650 km north of Bangkok, 120 km
southeast of Chiang Mai and 12 km east of the town of Lampang (Map IBRD No.
14430). The site is an extensive basin with an elevation of approximately
300 m above sea level, although the surrounding limestone and sandstone
escarpments rise to an elevation of up to 900 m. The main land use in the
area is commercial teakwood cultivation and there is some limited subsistence
agriculture. Population density in the basin is low and the climate is
tropical with an average annual rainfall of 1,000 to 1,500 mm.
5.06      The area is adequately served by paved roads and by a rail spur line
which connects the site with the national rail system approximately 5 km to
the South of Mae Moh. There are certain weight and size limitations on both
the highways and the railroad which limit the size of certain power plant
equipment (e.g. generators) that can be transported to the site. All mining
equipment, however, can be broken down into components of adequate weight and
size to be transported to the site.
C. Project Description
1. The Lignite Deposit
a. Geology
5.07      The Mae Moh lignite deposit is a typical tertiary basin, where
vegetable matter was deposited under limnic conditions 1/ to form peat bogs
with concurrent subsidence of the underlying rock strata. This vegetable
matter was later covered with sedimentary formations, mainly shale and sand-
stone. Under the exclusion of the atmosphere and the pressure of the overlying
strata the peat decreased in water content and increased in carbon content,
thus being transformed into lignite. There are many of these tertiary struc-
tures throughout the country, several of which show indications of lignite
formation (para. 3.19).
5.08      The extension of the lignite bearing basin, lying roughly north-
south is about 6 km by 4 km (Map IBRD 14430). There are at least two sig-
nificant lignite seams, each up to 25 m thick, forming a syncline 2/ with the
axis also lying roughly north-south. The seams are currently being mined on
the eastern flank of the syncline, where their shallowest part is covered with
about 10 m of overburden. 3/ The deepest part of the seams is to the west.
In the central part of the basin near the axis the seams become progressively
1/   Formed inland in a fresh water environment.

shallower and thicker, until they outcrop 1/ at the western flank of the
syncline. Several fault systems 2/ traverse the syncline and have caused
displacement of the seams.
b. Exploration
5.09      Although the lignite seams at Mae Moh have been known locally since
1925 and were sporadically mined for domestic consumption, systematic explora-
tion did not start until the mid-1950's, when exploratory drilling of known
outcrops was carried out in some detail.
5.10      After the formation of EGAT In 1968, exploration efforts were
stepped up and reserves were proven to be sufficient for two 75 MW power
plants. Rheinbraun Consulting GmbH (F.R. Germany) which, at that time was a
member of Mae Moh Consultants (MMC, Switzerland), confirmed that reserves were
sufficient to support a total of 225 MW or three 75 MW units at Mae Moh. At
that time no attempt was made to determine whether the lignite deposit was
indeed merely the eastern flank of a syncline. Although the seams were known
to be dipping to the west and toward the proposed power plant site, the
lignite reserves thus blocked were considered to be uneconomic at that time.
5.11      From 1972 onwards, exploration drilling continued and a better
definition of the previously indicated reserves was established. As a result
of the oil price increases in 1973/74, lignite became an attractive economic
alternative source of energy for the EGAT power system. Sufficient reserves
to support a total of 525 MW of installed power generating capacity were
outlined. MMC and Rheinbraun were again engaged to prepare a feasibility
study for the addition of two 150 MW units (Power Units 4 and 5) which was
presented in October 1977 and June 1978. Rheinbraun again endorsed the
reserve calculations and MMC's recommendation to build these units at the same
site. In the meantime, however, Australian geophysicists, providing technical
assistance to EGAT under the Colombo plan, had carried out a gravimetric
survey over the basin which indicated that the seams indeed formed a syncline.
A limited drilling program over the outcrops in the east confirmed this
indication.
5.12      By mid-1978, Dr. Otto Gold Consulting Engineers (F.R. Germany), a
mining consulting firm then retained by ADB, expressed serious concern over
the location of the existing power generating plants. In late 1978 a new
intensive drilling campaign was started which not only confirmed that the
plant site and the adjacent water reservoir were located over lignite and that
the seams were a synclinal continuous deposit, but also substantially increased

the lignite reserves. A decision to relocate Power Units 4 and 5 has since
been taken (para. 5.26). Drilling is still continuing under a 4-year program
to delineate the reserves in the whole basin.
5.13      The exploration work is proceeding in a professional and satisfac-
tory manner under the overall supervision of Gold Consulting. New drill holes
are being sunk over already drilled-off areas in order to come up with better
quality data which will permit the revision of the existing isocaloric maps.

5.15      The reserves were calculated from EGAT's detailed cross sections,
which served as basis for the preparation of the seam contour maps. The mine
borders were established by using a slope varying between 1:1.7 to 1:2.0
which was entered into the cross sections and which was taken into considera-
tion in the calculation of the stripping ratios. Proven reserves were defined
as lignite masses drilled off at a drill spacing of 100 m, probable reserves
on a drill spacing of 200-400 m immediately adjacent to the proven reserves,
and possible reserves were estimated based on geological interpretation and
widely spaced scout drills.
5.16      The reserve calculations were reviewed by both Bank staff and a Bank
consultant. The methodology was found to be reliable within a reasonable
range of accuracy.

5.17      A 1978 report by Rheinbraun assigned 2,600 kcal/kg as the "lower
calorific" value, based on analyses of the coal then produced from the mine.
Further drilling and daily sampling of the mine production has been carried
out since by EGAT, indicating relatively wide variations of the run-of-mine
lignite, as shown below:

EGAT and its consultants for the Power Unit 4 Project (MMC) are aware
of these ranges in quality and have taken them into consideration with
the boiler specifications.
2. The Mine
a. Present Mine Operations
5.18      The original mining equipment, used to supply lignite to the small
12.5 MW thermal and fertilizer plants before their shut-down as well as to
small local industries and the first 75 MW power plant (para 3.16), consisted
of a wide range of used items made available by Government agencies. The
equipment is no longer in use. When the decision was made to build Power
Units 2 and 3 of 75 MW units each at Mae Moh, it was realized that the scale
of mining would have to increase and that new equipment would have to be sized
accordingly. Rheinbraun analysis as mining consultant was:
(i)  that bucket wheel excavators should not be applied
both because of the relative hardness of the coal
and overburden and because their use would entail
almost total dependence on a single piece of equipment;
(ii)  that draglines should not be considered because of the
sharply dipping nature of the coal and the presence
of geological faults; and
(iii)  that the appropriate mining method would be by 3-4 m
mechanical and hydraulic excavators supplemented by
35 short ton (st) trucks.
In addition, Rheinbraun recommended a crusher/conveyor system for coal
handling, with a similar system to be installed later for spoil disposal.



- 31 -
5.19      These recommendations were generally endorsed by Gold Consulting,
which had been retained in 1972 by the ADB. Both consultants agreed that
mining should commence on the eastern edge of the basin down to a depth of
120 m where the lignite was known to be trending northwest and dipping west-
ward with total seam thickness of over 40 m and stripping ratios of about
2:1.
5.20      Beginning in 1974, the new mining equipment was delivered.  The
remaining equipment, excluding the obsolete and fully depreciated equipment
purchased prio5 to 1974, consists mainly o5 16 rear dump trucks, 5 mechanical
shovels (3.5 m ), 3 hydraulic shovels (3 m ), 2 wheel front-end loaders, 5
dozers and 1 grader, conveyor and crusher.
5.21      The equipment is well maintained and its condition is good.  The
operators are well trained and qualified. The hydraulic shovels are used
exclusively in soft sub-soil conditions since they are not suitable for work
in the harder lignite and shale formations at Mae Moh. Furthermore, the
supply of spare parts for the hydraulic shovels poses a problem and mainten-
ance costs are high, although EGAT personnel have been trained on service and
repair work on these machines.
5.22      At present, coal is mined on two faces in both seams by the mechani-
cal shovels. Some advance stripping is done by the remaining shovels. Most
overburden removal, however, is carried out by a contractor using relatively
small equipment.
5.23      Blasting is carried out presently only on a limited scale.
Loosening-up blasting, however, may become necessary as the scale of opera-
tions is significantly increased.
5.24      Mine layout and production planning is satisfactory; pit haulage
roads and drainage systems are well designed and maintained. Ancillary
facilities, like warehouses, machine and repair shops are well organized and
supervised.
b. Power Plant Location
5.25      The information obtained from drilling done for the foundations for
Power Unit 3, the intensive drilling campaign carried out from November 1978
to March 1979 and the recalculation of reserves (paras 3.18, 5.14) clearly
indicate that the existing two 75 MW Units 1 and 2 and the third 75 MW Unit
now under construction, are located on top of the lignite deposit, with
lignite outcropping 1 km to the east and 3 km to the west. Beneath the plant
site there exist two seams of lignite with a combined average thickness of
approximately 36 m at a depth varying between 150 and 250 m.
5.26      The lignite reserves now blocked by the power plant safety pillar
are estimated at 54 million tons. The existing Huai Luang cooling water
reservoir effectively blocks an additional 66 million tons. In order to make



- 32 -
the reserves under the reservoir available for mining in the relatively short
term and those underneath Power Units 1-3 available after their useful lives
of 25 to 30 years EGAT has decided to relocate all future power stations,
including Unit 4.
5.27      From several alternative sites, EGAT has chosen one located approxi-
mately 1.5 km east of the mine (Map IBRD 14430). On the recommendation of the
Bank, 12 boreholes were sunk to bedrock at this site, with a total depth of
1,966 m. Six of the holes indicated no lignite, and the remainder only
insignificant seamlets. It can therefore be said with certainty that no
mineable lignite reserves exist under the new site.
5.28      The location of the present Huai Luang reservoir, besides blocking
considerable lignite reserves, would have to be extended by a series of dams
and weirs if it were to provide cooling water for the generation of up to the
525 MW capacity. It could not provide sufficient water for the possible 1,500
MW now envisaged. An alternative site at Mae Chang (Map IBRD 14430) following
investigation and test drilling on the site, has been evaluated technically
and financially by EGAT and its consultants and the selected site is considered
sound by both ADB and the Bank. The reservoir is included for financing in
the ADB power project (para. 6.07).
c. Mining Plan and Production Schedule
5.29      The current mining plan was prepared initially by Rheinbraun and
finalized by EGAT technical staff. It is based on proven reserves of 130
million tons at a stripping ratio of 2:1 in the eastern part of the basin,
a final mining depth of 120 m below the surface and an ultimate installed
generating capacity of 525 MW. The plan is updated by EGAT staff on a
monthly basis and rescheduled annually for one-year intervals over a five
year period and for five-year intervals thereafter. This mining plan is
adequate for all power generating units, including Unit 5.
5.30      The recent increase in known lignite reserves (para. 5.14) requires
that a new master mining plan covering the whole Mae Moh basin be prepared for
future expansions past Unit 5. This plan will have to establish the sequence
of mining, optimize stripping ratios, determine optimal pit depth and drainage
systems, as well as outside and in-pit waste dump configurations.
5.31      With the continuation of the exploration program it is expected that
sufficient geological data will be available to permit this plan to be pre-
pared in its initial form by September 1981, to be updated as further drilling
results come in and the study on economic lignite pricing (para. 3.26) has
been concluded. The plan is highly significant to the selection of techni-
cally and economically optimum exploitation and land reclamation methods and
to the determination of the ultimate generating capacity at Mae Moh. The
current mining plan will remain valid in the meantime and will be incorporated
into this mining plan for the whole basin. The Bank has reviewed and found
satisfactory the consultant contracts governing this work (para. 6.03). The
target of September 30, 1981 has been confirmed for completion of the initial
master mining plan. EGAT has agreed to update the initial master mining plan
by not later than March 31, 1982, taking into account the recommendations of
the lignite pricing study referred to in para. 3.26.



- 33 -
5.32      EGAT, with the assistance of the Asian Institute of Technology
(AIT, Thailand) and Australian Rock Engineering Consultants has carried out
geotechnical work for the determination of the slope and stability for the
pit. Additional test work is still underway under the overall direction of
Rheinbraun, whose final assessment will be made available to the Bank no later
than December 31, 1981.
5.33      In assessing the lignite requirements of Power Units 1-5, it has
been assumed, based on actual experience that approximately 80 t per hour will
be required for each 75 MW unit in operation, that lignite will have an average
calorific value of around 2,600 kcal/kg, and that approximately 216,000 t per
year will be required primarily to supply the North Bangkok power plant (which
is dual oil and lignite fired) to make up for oil shortages as in the past
(para. 3.14). Based on the present schedule, the amount of lignite required
is summarized below:
Mae Moh: Projected Lignite Production Schedule
(Million Metric Tons of Lignite)
Total
CY                 1979   1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1979-85
Units 1-4          1.00   1.25   1.51   1.77   1.77   2.80   2.80    12.90
Units 1-5 ta       1.00   1.25   1.51   1.77   1.77   3.32   3.84    14.46
/a   The proposed project, while financing mining requirements for Units 1-4,
takes into account in sizing mining equipment the incremental build-up in
mining operations due to Unit 5 in 1984 (para. 5.35).
5.34      This schedule takes into account the change from the present average
stripping ratio of 2:1 bm 3t (i.e. 2:1) on which the current mining plan
is based, to a future higher stripping ratio on which the new master mining
plan will be based (para. 5.30). Although the average ratio of the presently
proven and probable reserves is only 3.4:1 and that of the whole basin is
estimated at 5.50:1 (para. 5.14), the mining plan will possibly foresee the
exploitation of most of the basin. EGAT therefore wishes to accelerate its
overburden stripping schedule starting in 1980: (i) in order to smooth the
transition to the expected higher stripping ratio for the basin; and (ii) in
order not to jeopardize the exploitation of deep lying lignite towards the end
of the life of the mine, especially in view of a possible ultimate generating
capacity at Mae Moh of about 1,500 MW. This is a highly conservative approach
which can be endorsed.



- 34 -
d.   Selection of Mining Equipment
5.35      Selection of the mining equipment to be financed under the proposed
Bank loan has been based on the lignite tonnage requirements, expected lignite
losses of about 7% p.a. and the overburden stripping requirements for 375 MW
(Units 1 to 4) of installed generating capacity (para. 5.33). The equipment
to be financed was sized, however, to phase into larger ultimate lignite and
stripping requirements in anticipation of the rapid follow-on development of
Unit 5 and, possibly, Units 6, 7 and 8 (para. 3.16). Final equipment selection
for the project has been based on the following parameters:
(i) Three shift operation of the mine (Annex 5-1), which
EGAT at the present time is introducing, and the use
of the existing equipment mainly for lignite production
until the end of its useful life, when it will be
replaced by larger units;
(ii) Projected equipment availability and capacity figures
which take into account both EGAT's current performance
and climatic conditions at Mae Moh (Annex 5-2);
(iii) Phasing out of the contractor for overburden removal
over time (Annex 5-3);
(iv) Overburden trucking to dump outside the mine site
until at least 1986;
(v) The availability of an in-situ uncovered lignite
inventory which, depending on the stripping ratio,
should be at least 6-12 months of operation, to
safeguard continuous power plant operation;
(vi) Acceleration of the stripping schedule starting in
1980, in order to facilitate the transition to a
considerably higher stripping ratio;
(vii) Relocation of Power Units 4 and 5.
5.36      Based on optimization studies carried out by EGAT and their consult-
ants, rhich took into consideration the future expansion plans beyond Unit 4,
a 10 m shovel was considered the most appropriate excavating unit for the Mae
Moh mine requirements.  This is3a non-standard size, the selected unit being
the closest standard size 15 yd or 11.5 m shovel. This selection can be
regarded as technically sound and endorsed. Four of these units are required
before 1984 (Annex 5-3).
5.37      The type of shovels EGAT has decided to procure are electrically-
driven, rope-activated machines which are extensively proven in comparable
mining operations elsewhere, rather than the hydraulic type. Based on EGAT's
unsatisfactory experience with maintenance of its three existing hydraulic



- 35 -
shovels and after a detailed review of hard rock mining conditions (para.
5.21), Bank staff and a consultant retained by the Bank endorse this choice
and recommend that, at this time, EGAT not consider large size hydraulic
shovels with which experience is too limited especially in developing
countries.
5.38      As for the trucks, EGAT prefers 75 - 85 t diesel-mechanical units,
since it has no experience with the diesel-electric drives that larger units
in the 100-120 t range would entail.
5.39      It is expected that all the lignite and most of the overburden can
be dug directly by the shovels without blasting. Only some light blasting
will have to be carried out, and two mobile blast hole drills have been in-
cluded in the equipment list.
5.40      The capacity of the existing coal crushing and conveying system is
more than adequate to supply Power Units 1-3. However, due to the relocation
of Unit 4, a second crushing and conveying system is needed from the mine to
the new site. This conveyor should, for economy of scale, be designed to a
capacity sufficient to supply both Units 4 and 5. The equipment list includes
this conveying system, as well as a stacker and reclaimer for a lignite
stockyard at the new site. The stockyard, which will be designed to have
blending capabilities to even out fluctuations in coal quality, will have more
than adequate 16 day storage capacity. This compares with only 3 day storage
capacity when Unit 3 comes on stream at the present site, the bare minimum to
maintain plant operations in case of conveyor system breakdowns or emergencies
in the mine.
5.41      Other equipment includes bulldozers, 2 loaders, 1 grader, 1 50 t
crane, service trucks and power supply equipment for the electric shovels,
as well as equipment necessary to expand the maintenance facilities. The
equipment list is shown in detail in Annex 5-4.
D.   Ecological Aspects
5.42      EGAT has studied extensively the likely environmental impact of
the Mae Moh expansion. Among the factors giving rise to concern are sulphur
dioxide pollution, population resettlement, land reclamation and water use.
5.43      Sulphur dioxide (SO) emissions are likely to potentially pose
the most serious environmenta threat at Mae Moh since the sulphur content
of the lignite is on average a relatively high 2%. At Bank request, EGAT
has investigated and made preliminary estimates of the maximum ground level
concentration of SO2 that would be produced from Power Units 1-5. The
estimates are within the IBRD guidelines and are considered satisfactory for
purposes of the proposed mine and power projects. Anticipating expansions
beyond 525 MW generating capacity, however, EGAT has decided at Bank mission
instigation to undertake a full scale air pollution study which ADB has
included in the power project for financing. The Unit 4 stack design para-
meters being prepared by MMC would be reviewed and approved by ADB for pollu-
tant dispersion capability within the context of the initial phase of this
study. While ADB has indicated strong interest in having major responsibility



- 36 -
for the study, due to the importance of such a study to future lignite plan-
ning at Mae Moh, EGAT will submit the study to the Bank for review when
completed but in no case later than December 31, 1981. ADB has also proposed
to finance pollution monitoring equipment to enable continuous examination of
power plant emissions and to collect relevant meteorological data.
5.44      Resettlement:  The proposed mining area is adjacent to the villages
of Ban Na Khaem and Ban Tha Patun which, together, have a population of
approximately 293 families. As the mine advances, these villages will have
to be resettled and EGAT, based on its former experience with resettlement on
other projects, has presented detailed plans for this resettlement program,
which include provisions to minimize social impacts, as well as educational
and health services. Resettlement costs estimated at US$2 million have been
included in the capital costs of the proposed project, based on a relocation
compensation of about US$2,600 per family and resettlement costs estimated at
US$4,000 per family for provision of two hectares of land (of which 10% is
serviced land for housing and the remainder is for cultivation), public roads
and other infrastructure. Resettlement costs for families dislocated by the
proposed Mae Chang cooling water reservoir have been included in the capital
costs of the power plant (para. 6.08). The resettlement plans, while satis-
factory in scope, remain somewhat open as far as choice of a resettlement site
is concerned. EGAT is in process of finalizing arrangements with the Forestry
Department. Confirmation of EGAT having acquired the site proposed in the
settlement plan or having acquired any other site, satisfactory to the
Bank, is a condition for effectiveness of the loan.
5.45      Land Reclamation:  In the initial years of any open pit mine a
certain amount of overburden must be dumped outside the pit, until the final
mining plan has been established, and sufficient coal has been mined to be
able to backfill the mined-out areas with the wastes generated durilg opera-
tions. From 1974 - 1978 EGAT has dumped approximately 15 million m it an
outside dump which eventually will contain between 70 to 80 million m before
in-pit dumping can start in 1986-87. Top-soil is being removed separately to
serve as a basis for revegetation of this dump in the future. Land reclamation
methods after in-pit dumping begins depend on the master mining plan and the
stripping methods to be used (para. 5.31), where the use of waste conveyors
and stackers usually gives better results than a dragline. The master mining
plan to be completed by September 1981 (paras. 5.31, 6.03) will include land
reclamation planning, determining work as to revegetation of top soil, erosion
and dust control, water drainage, and slope stablization. It is understood
with EGAT that land reclamation work will begin immediately after completion
of the master mining plan and technical assistance to this effect will be
provided by Rheinbraun under the consulting contracts mentioned in para. 6.03.
5.46      Water Quality and Use:  Since the Huai Luang water reservoir is
to be drained and to be replaced by the Mae Chang reservoir and since both
reservoirs belong to the same watershed, no major incremental impact on
agricultural and irrigation activities is foreseen. The power plants up



- 37 -
to Unit 4 will require approximately 10 million m3 of cooling water per year.
So far no acid run-off water has been observed from the coal stockpile and the
pit drainage, for which the water quality is being monitored satisfactorily on
a monthly basis. EGAT has agreed to prepare contingency plans in case mine
drainage water quality deteriorates to unacceptable levels. 1/
E.   Employment and Training
5.47      Based on EGAT's and Gold Consulting's estimates, the mine, when
producing 2.8 million tons of lignite per year (sufficient for Units 1-4),
will require the following personnel:
Total Personnel Requirements at Mae Moh Mine upon Project Completion
Category                                          No.
Supervisors and Administrative                    161
Operators                                         288
Maintenance                                       144
Semi- and unskilled                               408
1,!001
Currently there are 736 employees. The relatively small personnel increase
is due to the fact that mining equipment of larger unit capacity will be
introduced and that EGAT, because of a series of socio-economic and political
reasons, is overstaffed at the present time. It is, however, EGAT's intention
to reduce overstaffing in the future in order to increase personnel produc-
tivity.
5.48      EGAT is fully aware that the envisaged expansion will require
extensive training of its personnel. At present a modern training center is
under construction at Mae Moh, where EGAT's own training organization will
prepare operators and maintenance personnel, first for the conversion to a
3 shift operation, and then for the requirements of the new equipment. In
addition, selected operators, mechanics and supervisors will undergo training
courses at the factories of shovel and truck manufacturers abroad which will
be followed-up with on-the-job training programs by EGAT and suppliers'
personnel at Mae Moh after arrival of the equipment. Engineers and technical
personnel will receive on-the-job training abroad in similar mining operations
for periods varying from 6 months to 1 year. Similar training programs have
been carried out by EGAT in the past with good results. The proposed tech-
nical training requirements are summarized below. This training program with
an estimated foreign exchange cost of about US$400,000 is included in the
proposed project.
1/   "Unacceptable levels" meaning discharge water of a ph of less than 6
and more than 9, and/or containing more than 100 mg of suspended solids
per liter.

Mae Moh Lignite Project: Technical Training Requirements
Skills                                      Man-Months
Operators                                      800
Maintenance Personnel                          400
Technicians                                     60
5.49      The above described training program appears adequate.  However,
EGAT's plans for extending its lignite mine production requires that
greater attention be given to mining costs and accounts for cost control
and internal financial purposes (paras. 4.21-4.23). Therefore, the
project includes a training program tentatively established with EGAT
(para. 4.23) for 18 man-months of part-time training for 6 persons in cost
and inventory control, mine accounting and planning and budgeting. The
total cost of this training program is estimated at US$60,000.
F.   Mine Infrastructure
5.50      Infrastructure requirements are minimal, since the project will
make use of existing transport and other facilities. The mine is self-
sufficient in water supply and receives power from the power plants. The
expansion of the mine power supply system to support the mine expansion has
been included as part of the project. Expansion of the existing maintenance
and warehouse facilities that will be required has also been included.
Additional workers will be housed under EGAT's established policy of providing
serviced land at EGAT expense for housing construction by the worker.
VI. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. ProJect Management
6.01     Overall project management, coordination, and procurement will be
carried out and supervised by the EGAT Mining Department which is currently
expanding its technical and support staff to meet project requirements. EGAT
has had previous experience with implementation and procurement under Bank
guidelines in the power sector, but realizes that a mine expansion of this
size requires the development of new financial and management capabilities
within the Mining Department (paras. 4.21-4.23) and the strengthening of its
technical capabilities through training (paras. 5.47-5.49) and external
technical assistance.
6.02     EGAT has selected two consulting firms with which it has had previous
experience, and plans to assign engineering tasks as follows:



- 39 -
(a) For general technical consulting services, assistance in
interpretation of geological data and lignite reserves, mine
planning, preparation of the mine master plan (para. 5.31),
selection of appropriate mining methods and assistance
in the procurement process mainly through preparation of
equipment specifications, EGAT will make use of Dr. Otto
Gold Consulting Engineers (Gold Consulting, FR Germany), a
firm which for 25 years has specialized internationally
in coal and lignite mining in both underground and open
pit operations.
(b) For the design and detailed engineering of the coal crusher
and the conveying, stacking and reclaiming system, for
supervisory assistance in quality inspection and erection
of equipment, for update and review of EGAT's master mine
plan and inclusion of a detailed land reclamation program,
and for assistance in implementation of the reclamation
program, EGAT intends to use the services of Rheinbraun
Consulting GmbH (Rheinbraun) which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Rheinische Braunkohlenwerke AG., the largest
German lignite producer, which produced over 100 million
tons in 1978.
6.03      The Bank has no objection to this choice of consultants.  The
contract proposals and substantially negotiated contract drafts have been
reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. Signature of these contracts
will be a condition for effectiveness of the loan.
B.   Prolect Implementation Schedule
6.04      Project preparation is well advanced and project-related activities,
like the continuation of the drilling program and preparatory work for the
master mine plan, ecological studies, preparation of equipment specifications
and preparations for procurement under World Bank guidelines are well underway.
Retroactive financing of up to US$3 million under the proposed Bank loan is
required for downpayments covering (i) a portion of the consultant contracts
so that preparation of the mining plan and related planning activities can
advance; and (ii) procurement of the mining shovels, for which letters of
intent were signed, and other related mining equipment, which will be ordered
within the first quarter of 1980 in order to be operational by the end of the
last quarter of 1980 (para 7.14). A delay in the procurement of the shovels
would result in an inability to maintain the schedule for pre-stripping
required by Power Unit 4. The shovels are the critical items during Imple-
mentation, due to the need to start overburden stripping well in advance 
related lignite requirements.  The key dates on the implementation sche4ul,
therefore, are:



- 40 -
Critical Delivery Dates for Project's Mining Equipment
Date
Mining Shovels No. 1 & 2                  Dec. 1980
Mining Shovel No. 3                        Jul. 1981
Mining Shovel No. 4                       Jul. 1982
The implementation schedule as shown in Annex 6-1 appears realistic and,
barring any major unforeseen difficulties, it is anticipated that the mine
can produce 2.8 million tons of lignite starting in early 1984, when Unit 4
comes on stream.
C. Coordination with Mae Moh Power Unit 4 Project
6.05     There has been close coordination between the IBRD and ADB in pre-
paration of the respective mine and power projects which are being financed
independently of one another but which are integral parts of the expansion
in EGAT electricity generating capacity at Mae Moh. The financing plan for
both projects is shown in Chapter VII. The scope and implementation of the
power project is described below. Because of the important interlinkages in
financing, scope and implementation between projects, the effectiveness of the
ADB loan is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para 7.11).
6.06     The Mae Moh Power Project provides for the addition of a 150 MW
lignite fired generation unit (Unit 4) at Mae Moh, together with transmission
facilities between Mae Moh and the main grid at Phitsanulok. Unit 4 would be
the first of a two-unit module and the power project like the mine project
would include much of the necessary common equipment for both units.
6.07      The power project consists of a conventional 150 MW lignite fired
thermal power generating station which includes some lignite handling and
pulverizing equipment, a new water reservoir with associated canal (para.
5.28), a 195 km long 230 kV transmission line with substations, miscellaneous
ancillary equipment and engineering services.
6.08     The power project also includes about US$180,000 in financing for
air pollution studies and pollution monitoring equipment as discussed in
para. 5.43 and about US$1.1 million in local currency for resettlement costs
(para. 5.44).
6.09     EGAT has retained MMC to provide engineering services for implemen-
tation of the power station and reservoir. MMC were appointed in 1972 by
EGAT for the implementation of the first two units at Mae Moh, and subse-
quently in May 1979, a further contract was concluded with these consultants
to provide engineering services for both Units 3 and 4. EGAT and ADB have
found the services already provided by Mae Moh consultants satisfactory, and
their retention is deemed appropriate.



- 41 -
6.10             The power project was approved by the ADB Board in November 1979 and
is expected to maintain the implementation schedule shown in Annex 6-2, which
is suitable to the mining expansion schedule under the proposed IBRD project.
6.11             The scope and implementation plans of the power project have been
reviewed within the Bank and considered a satisfactory counterpart to the
proposed mining project.  Close coordination of the projects through imple-
mentation will be maintained.
VII. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Costs
7.01            As shown below, the total financing required for the Mae Moh lignite
and power projects is US$383.3 million, of which US$206.0 million is in
foreign exchange. The financing requirement for the Mae Moh Lignite Project
alone is US$130.3 million, including US$72.0 million in foreign exchange.
The interdependence of the two projects requires that the total financing of
the mine and power projects be considered together.

through 8-5.



- 42 -
7.02      With the exception of resettlement costs, capital costs of the
mining project have been derived from the feasibility report on mining of
lignite for Power Plant Units 1-4 prepared by Gold Consulting, revised during
the IBRD appraisal mission together with the consultants and EGAT in April/May
1979. Base costs for equipment, which constitute the bulk of the foreign
exchange costs of the mining project were updated during the follow-up mission
in September 1979 and also reflect the bids obtained for the electric shovels.
Other foreign costs are freight, technical assistance for erection on site,
engineering and training.
7.03      Interest during construction totalling US$12.0 million for the mine
project is also proposed to be included in the foreign exchange costs to be
covered by the Bank loan. EGAT financial forecasts (Annex 8-6) indicate
that under the plan of action to be carried out by EGAT and the Government
to strengthen the financial capacity of the sector (para. 4.12), EGAT will
need to mobilize all possible additional resources in order to meet its
operations and investment program requirements, including financial charges
over the next several years. EGAT has requested the inclusion of interest
during construction in all loans during the period to assist in alleviating
the projected cash shortfalls. This is reasonable in light of the agreed
measures to be carried out by EGAT and the Government and the period of
adjustment that will be required to restore financial viability to the elec-
tricity sector (para. 4.12).
7.04     The largest local cost component of the mining project is for pre-
stripping costs for Power Unit 4 which have been valued at US$17.4 million or
21.3% of the base cost estimate. The second largest local component consists
of taxes and duties on mining equipment which vary widely from about 10% for
bulldozers to 53% for trucks and 282% for light vehicles. These taxes and
duties, shown as part of local mine equipment costs and contingencies, have
been estimated at US$14.2 million on base cost mining equipment and US$5.7
million on contingency items, or US$19.9 million in total. Taxes and duties
will be remitted to EGAT as equity from the Government, as shown in the
financing plan furt er below (para. 7.07). Other local costs include civil
works, land (2.8 km ) adjacent to the mining area where the acquisition has
already been authorized by the authorities involved, reclamation and resettle-
ment. Resettlement costs, based on EGAT estimates in a detailed resettlement
plan, have been derived from EGAT's past experience with resettlement proj-
ects, and are considered sound (para. 5.44).
7.05     The small amount of working capital is for the increase in lignite
inventory and consumables that will be required before full capacity produc-
tion is reached in 1984.
7.06     The cost estimates for the power project have been supplied by MMC,
who were retained by EGAT to do the feasibility study for Unit 4, and reviewed
by ADB during their appraisal mission (August 1979). ADB's assumptions on
physical contingencies (10% of base cost estimate) and price escalation were
retained for the power project in the above table (para. 7.01, footnote f/)
although the assumed price escalations in foreign exchange and local costs are
somewhat lower than those applied in the mining project. The price escalations
assumed in the mine project have been revised upward since the project was
appraised in April 1979 to take account of the surge of inflation that has
occurred in Thailand in the last half of 1979 and that is continuing into 1980.

B.   Financing Plan
7.07      The financing plan for the Mae Moh lignite and Power Unit 4 projects
is as follows:
Financing Plan for Mae Moh Mine and Power Projects
(US$ Million)
Equity                                   Mine      Power     Total       %

Total Financing                     130.3     253.0      383.3    100.0
/a  ADB's appraisal assumes average terms of financing that are less
favorable than the lender specific terms assumed in the financial
projections in Annexes 8-2 through 8-4. Based on these more favorable
terms a commercial bank loan of US$14.0 million would be sufficient to
complete the financing requirements of the power project.
7.08      Government contributions to the financing plan for mine and power
projects comprise remittances in import duties and taxes as equity payments.
The Government has made a practice of remitting these funds as equity con-
tributions to EGAT investments.
7.09      Due to high priority accorded by the Government to developing
indigenous energy resources (see Chapter IX) for inter alia power generation,
EGAT has received Cabinet approval for a relatively high budgetary allocation
of internally generated funds of US$32.7 million for the mine expansion and
US$76.0 million for the Unit 4 Power Project, or 25.1% and 30.0% of the total
financing required, respectively. This would result in an average self-
financing of 28.4% for the combined mine and power projects which together
with the 9.8% of government contributions would bring the total equity and
internally generated funding to a satisfactory 38.2%. In the event of a
temporary cash shortfall due to normal cash balance fluctuations, EGAT has
established overdraft privileges, bearing a 10.5% interest rate, with a
commercial bank locally.



- 44 -
7.10      The commercial bank loans needed to complete the financing plan
are limited to estimates of US$5.7 million for the mine expansion and US$29.5
million for the power unit, or 4.4% and 11.7%, respectively. EGAT has con-
firmed that it will use a portion of a Deutsche Bank loan of DM 100 million
(US$55.6 million equivalent) received in July 1979, to meet the commercial
bank financing requirements of the mine project and, in all likelihood, of the
power project. EGAT prefers to finance these local currency requirements with
foreign exchange borrowings and bear the foreign exchange risk, rather than
to borrow locally due to the higher cost of local funds at this time. The
Deutsche Bank loan is for a period of 10 years including 6 years grace with an
interest rate of 5/8% over German prime rate for the first two years and 3/4%
over German prime for the remaining eight years. EGAT's credit establishment
with foreign and local commercial banks is quite good. EGAT borrowing experi-
ence in the last year or so has been with commercial banks in both Germany and
Japan, as well as in Thailand. The terms on lending are assumed to be 13%
p.a. interest, 10 years maturity including 6 years grace.
7.11      The financing of the projects is virtually completed.  The Bank loan
is proposed for a period of 20 years including 5 years grace at the standard
interest rate. The guarantee fee that is normally charged by IBRD for its
industrial projects will be waived in this exceptional case where lignite is
used almost exclusively for power generation and would not enter commercial
markets (para. 3.16). EGAT has agreed that no lignite from the production
resulting from the proposed mine expansion be used in other applications than
power generation. The ADB loan approved in December, 1979, carries terms of
20 years repayment including 5 years grace and 7.6% interest p.a. The SFD are
offering terms of 20 years repayment including 5 years grace and 3% interest
p.a.  The Swiss Government offer on financing averages 11 years repayment
including 5 years grace and 6% interest p.a. OSF lending terms will be 20
years repayment including 5 years grace, no interest but a service charge of
3/4 of 1% p.a. While the power and mining projects entail parallel financing,
the effectiveness of the ADB loan will be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed IBRD loan (para. 6.05). The effectiveness of the ADB loan, in turn,
depends upon signature of the SFD and OSF loans.
7.12      Regarding overrun financing, the Government has agreed to ensure
that any funds will be made available promptly to EGAT that may be required to
complete the proposed project. For purposes of this covenant, Project Comple-
tion is defined as: (i) completion of the physical construction of all of the
facilities included in the project; (ii) operation of the mine, either during
a consecutive period of 6 months at 1.4 million tons production, or for a
period of 12 consecutive months at the production level required to provide
Power Units 1-4 with sufficient lignite to sustain operations with such a
uniformity as not to cause a power plant shutdown due to lack of coal. The
ADB has a similar overrun covenant for the power project.



- 45 -
C. Procurement
7.13      Procurement of the local civil works, equipment, material and ser-
vices will be handled by the EGAT Procurement Department through competitive
bidding. When required, technical assistance will be given by the consultants
during the preparation of bidding documents for major fabrication or civil
works contracts. Also, in continuation of EGAT's past practice in their mines
and power plants, equipment installation will be carried out by EGAT's own
staff, previously trained in these specific tasks, under the supervision of
the consultants and the suppliers. Based on EGAT's past experience, this
arrangement is satisfactory.
7.14      EGAT has considerable experience in the procurement process under
Bank guidelines; this will facilitate procurement under the proposed project.
It has been agreed that all prospective vendors for major packages suitable
for international competitive bidding (shovels, trucks and lignite handling
system) will be prequalified and EGAT has already initiated this process.
EGAT has advanced the whole procurement cycle through to the bidding stage in
parallel with the processing of the Bank loan, in order to be able to place
orders for critical equipment items in accordance with the implementation
schedule (Annex 6-1). Retroactive financing of up to US$3 million is
recommended (para 6.04).
7.15      A detailed list of Bank financed equipment packages is given in
Annex 7-1 and summarized below:

lb Based on an analysis of those contracts for which local suppliers
might be able to bid in international competition, it is estimated
that a maximum of US$2.1 million, or 3.8% of total, might go to local
manufacturers.
/c Excluding interest during construction.



- 46 -
About 97% of the total equipment required by the project will be procured by
International Competitive Bidding. The remaining 3% are estimated to consist
of packages valued at under US$250,000 each and will be procured by interna-
tional competitive shopping up to an aggregate amount of US$1.5 million.
These packages will be procured after inviting quotations of which not less
than three shall be from suppliers outside of Thailand. Local suppliers will
enjoy a 15% preference margin.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
7.16     On the basis of discussions with EGAT and their consultants it is
proposed that the Bank loan of US$72 million be allocated as shown below:

7.17      As indicated, Gold Consulting and Rheinbraun, have been selected as
consultants for the project. It is proposed that the Bank finance the foreign
exchange costs of those consultants, both in Germany and Thailand. Presenta-
tion of the signed consultants' contracts is a condition of effectiveness.
Consultant costs of US$100,000 per man year for long and short term mine
planning, land reclamation, detailed and basic engineering as well as techni-
cal assistance for procurement, have been included in the cost estimates. It
is also proposed to finance out of the Bank loan the foreign exchange component
of EGAT's training program comprising technical training by equipment manufac-
turers locally and abroad, overseas mining, and mine accounting training
(paras. 4.22, 5.47 - 5.49). Training costs included in the capital cost
estimates comprise local training for operators and technicians at US$10,000
per man-year (excluding trainee salaries), and overseas training for engineers,



- 47 -
technicians and mine accountants at US$20,000-40,000 per man-year. A US$300,000
allowance has been made for the cost of the lignite pricing study mentioned in
para. 3.26. Virtually all expenditures will be in foreign currencies.
7.18     The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 1984.
(Annex 7-2). Any funds remaining undisbursed at that time will be cancelled.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Mine Operating Costs
8.01     The operating costs of mining lignite for Power Units 1-4 were
estimated in the feasibility report prepared by Gold Consulting for EGAT.
The costs were refined during the appraisal mission, and updated to August
1979 US dollars. The costs consist sf (i) operating costs for waste removal
in a stripping ratio of about 2:1 bm per ton, (ii) operating costs for
mining the lignite once it is uncovered, and (iii) a royalty or Government tax
on mined lignite fixed at US$0.06 per ton of lignite. The annual stripping
ratio of about 2:1 is determined by the current mining plan for Units 4 and 5,
and is valid for the mine expansion through Unit 5. Pre-stripping that will
be undertaken in anticipation of expansion requirements for Units 6, 7 and 8
(paras. 5.14, 5.34) will be capitalized as pre-operating expenditures for
these future developments, and will be amortiz5d when production from these
units begins. The mine operating costs per bm are assumed to decrease in the
financial projections from 1979 to 1984 in real terms with increase in labor
productivity as greater utilization is made of the relatively high staffing
at the mine, and with improvements in equipment efficiency, as larger size
shovels and trucks are introduced (para. 5.36). Once full production is
reached in 1384, i.e. the mine supplies all four power units, the operating
costs per bm are assumed to remain stable in real terms.
8.02     The operating costs of waste removal and lignite mining by EGAT at
full production are estimated as follows (Annex 8-1):

- 48 -
Together with the royalty charge of US$0.06 per ton or 0.078 per bm3 of
lignite the total 2perating cost of mining uncovered lignite is estimated
at US$1.561 per bm .
8.03      Mine operating costs are shown over a 10 year financial projection
period in Annex 8-2, p. 4. On an annual basis, these costs consist of the
operating costs for mining uncovered lignite as described above, and the
proportion of waste removal operating costs that is associated with the annual
volume of lignite mined. The remainder of annual waste removal operating
costs incurred but not considered an expense, is capitalized until production
from the associated uncovered lignite commences. The accounting method of
expensing waste removal in proportion to lignite produced is widely applied in
the mining industry and followed by EGAT's Comptroller's Department. At full
production in 1984 the total cost of lignite is estimated at US$8.7 per ton
in 1979 terms as shown below and the price at which lignite is transferred is
about US$16 per ton (Annex 8-3, p. 1).

/b   Including depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of pre-stripping
expenditures for mine expansion associated with Power Unit 4 and of
interest during construction.
Production costs would increase to US$10.2 per ton in 1979 real terms includ-
ing an allowance for specific on-going expenses of the mining operations as
discussed in para. 3.27. An adjustment to this production cost (para. 3.27)
based on the opportunity cost of an imported fuel substitute, assumed in this
case to be Australian steam coal, at recent quotes of about US$32 per ton FOB,
would raise in 1979 real terms the total cost of the lignite delivered to the
power plant to about US$16 per ton (see Annex 3 for details).
B. Financial Prolections of Mae Moh Mine
8.04      Pro-forma financial projections have been made for the Mae Moh Mine
(Annex 8-3) and for the Mae Moh Mine and Power Units 1-4 (Annex 8-4) under
the assumption that the Mining Department is a mine accounting center as
recommended in para. 4.22. The assumptions underlying these projections are
discussed below and further detailed in Annexes 8-5 and 8-3.



- 49 -
8.05      The projectionl are made in current US dollars terms through 1985
and constant terms thereafter. They assume an annual domestic inflation
rate of 16% in 1979, 142 in 1980, 13% in 1981, 12% in 1982 and 1983, 10% in
1984 and 9% in 1985. The projections are on a calendar year rather than Thai
fiscal year (October 1-September 30) basis since the work plans of the Mining
Department follow the calendar year.
8.06      Revenues.  The revenues shown in the Mae Moh income statement
assume that a lignite price has been established under the assumptions noted
in paras. 3.27 and 8.03. Australian steam coal prices, on which the lignite
price is based commenclag in 1982, are assumed to increase by 1% p.a. from
1979 in real terms. The revenues received are mainly from the transfer of
lignite to the power units at Mae Moh at the lignite price, and to a lesser
extent from lignite shipments to the North Bangkok power station (para. 5.33).
8.07     OPeratins Expenses.  The operating expenses of the Mae Moh Mine
consist of the annual mine operating costs discussed in para. 8.03, plus
depreciation on mining fixed assets, and amortization of interest during
construction and financial charges for all debt related to the mine. Capital
expenditure, depreciation and financial charge schedules, assuming financial
terms for the proposed project in paras. 7.10 and 7.11 and Annex 8-5, are
shown in Annex 8-2.
8.08     The financial projections of the Mae Moh mine are summarized below:

8.09     The financial projections for the mine indicate that the Mae Moh
Mine development up to and including the proposed project is a sound financial
operation. Sufficient revenues are obtained to cover the mine's cash and



- 50 -
non-cash operating expenses, and interest charges. In terms of cash genera-
tion, the mining operations are projected to cover all recurrent fixed
asset replacements and all other annual cash requirements including debt
service and an annual exploration program of US$2.0 million (para. 3.20) in
1979 terms and to provide for build-up in accumulated cash surplus, important
to future planned mine expansions. Debt service coverage is particularly high
during the grace period of the proposed project, but reaches a low of only 4.7
in 1985 when principal repayments are first incurred.
8.10      The substantial annual cash surpluses, ranging from US$12-50 million
in the years 1982-88, derive from the use of a lignite price based on substitute
steam coal. For the electricity tariffs to reflect the lignite price (para.
4.12), these cash surpluses would need to be excluded-from EGAT's earnings
basis and the net revalued mining assets from EGAT's net revalued fixed
assets. These adjustments will be made by EGAT in calculating the corporate
rate of return for purposes of its earnings covenant.
8.11     The debt:equity ratio of the mine remains fairly stable during project
implementation and below the covenanted maximum ratio for EGAT of 60:40 (para.
4.11) indicating that the proposed project has no adverse impact on EGAT's
corporate financial structure.
8.12     The financial projections indicate that the profit and cash break-
even points for the Mae Moh Mine are both below 50% when the full level of
production is reached and debt repayment begins in 1985. These low break-even
points are caused by the comfortable profit margin and cash surplus that the
agreed lignite pricing scheme would give to the Mining Department.
C. Consolidated Projections of Mae Moh Mine and Power Units 1-4
8.13     Pro-forma income statements for the Mae Moh Power Units 1-4 appear
in Annex 8-4 as well as consolidated financial statements reflecting the
effects of the combined mine and power expansion. Selected financial indi-
cators from the consolidated statements are shown below.

- 51 -
8.14      The revenues shown in the pro-forma income statements for the Mae Moh
Power Units 1-4 are from tariffs on electricity generated by these units which
are expected to come on stream under the schedule shown in para. 3.16. Since
EGAT charges different levels of tariffs to PEA and MEA, the weighted average
of these two tariffs represents EGAT's average electricity selling price. The
projection of this price established by EGAT for its corporate financial fore-
casts (Annex 8-6) was used to calculate the pro-forma revenues of the Mae MDh
Power Units 1-4.
8.15      On a consolidated basis, the financial performance of the mine
and Power Units 1-4 is strong, reflecting the relatively inexpensive cost of
lignite. This result is also partly dependent on the load factor which is
assumed to be high (74.2X of nominal capacity) as EGAT plans to use the Mae
Moh power units as base load plants.
8.16      The mine and power complex are projected to generate more than
sufficient cash not only to meet cash requirements following the two projects'
disbursement period, including debt service, but also to provide for a large
amount of accumulated surplus cash.
D. Financial Rate of Return
8.17     The financial rate of return of the Mae Moh development has been
calculated on an incremental basis for the mine expansion needed to supply
both Power Units 4 and 5 and the construction of both Power Units 4 and 5
which EGAT has planned as one development package. Capital expenditures
under the proposed project include equipment that has been sized to meet the
requirements of both Power Units 4 and 5 (para. 5.35), a new reservoir of
sufficient capacity to support the same two power units plus an additional
900 MW power generation capacity thereafter (Units 6, 7, 8, para.3.16) and
a resettlement program required by the new reservoir location and the mine
expansions for Power Units 4 and 5 (para. 5.44). Consequently independent
analysis of the two successive power and mine expansions would be weighted
unfairly against the Unit 4 power and mine expansion in favor of Unit 5 power
and mine expansion. The package approach to the development of Units 4 and 5
power and mine expansion provides a more appropriate basis for analyzing the
financial return of the proposed investment.
8.18     The calculation of the financial rate of return has been derived
from the pro-forma financial statements for mine and power units described
above, and is based on the cost/benefit streams shown together with those for
the economic analysis in Annex 9-1. The calculation has included capital and
operating cost estimates of EGAT for the Power Unit 5 and associated mine
expansion, also shown in Annex 9-1. The results are shown below:



- 52 -
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return for Mae Moh Mine and
Power Units 4 and 5
Base Case (Power Units 4 & 5 and Associated Mine Expansion)                 14.6
Capital Cost Increase 10%                                                   13.3
Operating Cost Increase 10%                                                 14.2
Tariff Increase 10%                                                         16.2
Tariff Decrease 10%                                                         12.8
The financial return of 14.6% is satisfactory and comparable to similar type
coal fired power investments. The capital and operating costs of the Mae
Moh development are straightforward estimates, thus minimizing the possibility
of any reduction in return. If the Unit 4 mine and power expansion is con-
sidered alone, without dispensation for the heavier than normal capital
expenditures implicit in the proposed project's package design, the financial
return is 10.8%. There is little risk associated with the Mae Moh development
(paras. 8.21 to 8.23), which enhances its attractiveness as a financial
investment.
E. Corporate Financial Projections
8.19     The corporate financial projections are shown in Annex 8-6 with
underlying assumptions contained in Annex 8-5. A discussion of the future
financial performance of EGAT is contained in Annex 8-7.  Corporate projec-
tions have been based on the need for EGAT and the sector as a whole to
achieve a minimum rate of return on revalued fixed assets of 2% in FY81 and
8% in FY82 and thereafter (para. 4.12), and assume a 64% increase in tariff
at the EGAT level by January 1, 1981 and a 19% increase by April 1, 1981.
The higher than required returns shown in the EGAT projections are due to an
assumed redistribution of cash generated within the sector among PEA, MEA and
EGAT to compensate for differences in capital expenditure requirements, an
undertaking agreed with the Government under Loan 1527-TH (see Annex 8-5 for
details). The covenanted rates of return for the power sector and for EGAT
have been agreed as part of a plan to remove all subsidies to the sector and
with a view to mobilizing resources for the sector's investment program.
F. Financial Covenants
8.20       EGAT has confirmed that the following covenants concerning corporate
financial performance apply to the proposed loan: (i) that EGAT furnish to
the Bank financial statements and acounts audited by consultants satisfactory
to the Bank within six months of the end of each financial year; (ii) that the
long term debt to equity ratio should not exceed 60:40 and medium term debt
should not exceed 15% of total debt for the duration of the loan; and (iii)
that unless otherwise agreed, EGAT achieve a rate of return on average current
net fixed assets of not less than 2% for FY81 and 8% thereafter (para. 4.12).
To this end, EGAT agreed to carry out measures substantially in accordance
with a plan of action outlined to the Bank to remove oil subsidies to the
electricity sector by January 1, 1981 and to avoid large scale tariff increases
by effecting increases more frequently with the first adjustment by April 1,
1981. EGAT agreed to review, not later than April 30 each year, the adequacy



- 53 -
of its tariffs to produce the required rates of return for the current and
next following fiscal years and furnish a copy of the review to the Bank. It
was further agreed that EGAT will maintain in its tariff schedule a provision
for fuel adjustment to compensate for changes in the price of all fuels.
8.21      With respect to its mining activities, EGAT has agreed (i) to treat
the mining operations of the Mining Department as mine accounting centers,
and for this purpose to establish by no later than April 1, 1981 a lignite
price to be discussed and agreed with the Bank no later than December 31,
1980 (paras. 3.27, 4.23); (ii) to complete a lignite pricing study with
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, by no later than December 31,
1981 (para. 3.26); and (iii) to consult with the Bank, commencing in 1982,
but no later than April 1 of each year on the adjustments to be carried out
during the next fiscal year in the lignite price to be used for the mine
accounting centers and master mining plans (para. 3.27). Suitably audited
annual financial accounts and statements of the mine accounting centers will
be furnished to the Bank as part of EGAT's corporate audit covenant (para.
4.24). As a condition of waiver of the guarantee fee applied to IBRD
industrial projects, EGAT confirmed that it will use the lignite from the
proposed mine expansion for power generation exclusively (para. 7.11). The
effectiveness of the ADB loan for the Unit 4 power plant will be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed IBRD loan (para. 7.11).
8.22      As noted previously, the Government has agreed to take all such
measures as necessary to produce for the electricity sector as a whole rates
of return of not less than 2% in FY 1981, and 8% thereafter, and to this end
to undertake a plan of action as outlined with the Bank (para. 4.12). It
further agreed to take any action necessary to make adjustments to the sector's
electricity tariffs to reflect changes in the price of all fuels and in the
price of purchased electric power (para 8.10). It was agreed that modifica-
tions would be made to agreements for the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project
(1690-TH) and the Khao Laem Hydrolectric Project (not yet signed) to reflect
tariff covenants agreed with the Government and EGAT under the proposed
project. The Government has confirmed that it will provide to EGAT additional
funds on suitable terms if the funds available to EGAT are inadequate to meet
the costs of completing the mine project (para. 7.12).
G.   Major Risks
8.23     There is relatively little risk associated with the proposed project.
The demand for lignite as a fuel for electricity generation is virtually
assured in light of the projected rising demand for electricity over the
medium and long term, and the lesser cost of domestic lignite for electricity
generation than imported oil and coal (Chapter IX). While analysis indicates
that natural gas is the least costly source 1/ of fuel for EGAT power genera-
tion, the long gestation period related to its development and its alternative
industrial uses makes gas fired power development complementary to rather than
1/ See Khao Laem Staff Appraisal Report, No. 2568-TH, Annex 19, June 20, 1979.

a substitution for the proposed project (Chapter II). The Government's medium
and long term plans for power development, based on the principle of least
cost sequence of development, make use of natural gas and lignite for base-
load operation and hydro primarily for peaking plants, since the major hydro
plants are associated with multi-purpose reservoirs that entail a trade-off
in water use between irrigation and power. While the investment program is
undergoing further refinement in optimization under a long-term study as
agreed with IBRD (Loan No. 1690-TH), the program through FY86 of which the
proposed project is a part, is considered sound (para. 2.28).
8.24     The intensified drilling program in 1978-79 has reduced the geo-
logical risk of the proposed project to a minimum (para. 5.16). Proven
lignite reserves alone are more than sufficient to support at least 525 MW
generation capacity for 30 years (Power Units 1-5).
8.25     The technical risks of the project relate to the larger capacity
trucks and mining shovels that will be used at Mae Moh compared to what is
in use now, and to the larger scale operation that the equipment implies for
development of Power Units 4 and 5. The technical capability of the Mining
Department, however, is exceptionally good. The operation of larger size
equipment is not expected to present a problem, particularly with the training
in operations and maintenance to be provided both by EGAT and by the equipment
suppliers. The Mining Department also has extensive experience in lignite
mining necessary to support the planned expansions of the Mae Moh Mine. The
mine plan for development of the Mae Moh basin to be completed under the
proposed project by early 1981 is expected to provide a technically sound
basis for development. There is little risk that EGAT would not undertake
(during the time as now expected) the Mae Moh Unit 5 expansion, for which
mining equipment under the proposed project has been sized, particularly
since the Cabinet has designated Unit 4 and 5 expansions as having priority
in development plans.
8.26     The only major potential risk of the project are sulphur dioxide
emissions from the associated power plant development. As discussed earlier
(para. 5.43) EGAT is taking measures to cover this risk by requesting an air
pollution study and pollution monitoring equipment to be financed by ADB. The
Bank intends to review the study upon its completion. EGAT has also asked
that the Unit 4 stack design be reviewed and approved by ADB in light of the
findings of the first phase of the air pollution study. This risk is therefore
considered to be adequately covered by these measures.
8.27     There is some risk of security in the Lampang area of Northeastern
Thailand where the Mae Moh mines are located, associated with Thailand's
border difficulties. However, these disturbances have not so far affected
Mae Moh operations, and are not expected to do so in the future.

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
9.01      The Government has given priority to reducing its heavy depen('enc.
on oil imports by developing domestic energy resources (para. 2.02). Since
electricity generation accounts for the largest proportion of imported ilel
oil (54% in 1977), EGAT's long term investments for future power plants ire
critiLal to implementation of this national policy. EGAT's plans to meet
load growth to 1990 include a mix of lignite, hydro and natural gas fired
plants which would reduce the use of petroleum for its power generation from
74% in 1978 to 9% by 1990 (para. 2.14). The proposed project is part of a
medium term investment program (para. 2.27) and long term strategy to expand
the use of lignite as a source of power generation from 6% in 1978 to an
estimated 22% in 1990. As part of national plans to reduce dependence on
importtl oil, an increasingly scarce and expensive fuel, the project is
reirdti by the Government to have major importance.
9.C'      Natural gas will only be available for power generation in 1982
whe. it will be used to fire some of the units of the Bang Pakong power
pla: t. Since EGAT's investment program for natural gas is based on a demand
fore-asi that outstrips proven reserves and depends on futurp proving up of
reserves (totalling about 4.7 trillon cu ft) during the 1980 s, the propos i
project cannot be viewed as a substitution for a natural gas fired plant. The
extent to which natural gas will be used in the late 1980 s for additional
powe- generation will depend upon both its future reserve status and analysis
of i-s alternative industrial economic uses (para. 2.03). The alternative
uses f lignite, by contrast, are limited mainly to power generation by the
coal'- basic characteristics (Chapter III). EGAT is planning to develop
during the 1980s an additional 2,200 MW of hydroelectric projects (para.
2.05). These developments would be complementary to EGAT's planned lignite
developments.
A. Economic Rate of Return
9.03      The economic costs and benefits of the proposed project have been
analyzed in two different ways. First, the project has been analyzed simi-
larly to the financial analysis of the mine expansion and associated power
Units 4 and 5 with appropriate adjustments to cost and benefit streams (para.
8.16). Second, the project has been compared with a bituminous coal-fired
power plant to evaluate the economic benefit of substitution (Annex 9-1).
9.04      In the first economic rate of return analysis, three adjustments
have been made to the financial cost and benefit streams: (i) incremental
revenues attributable to the project from 1984 onwards and based on an average
power tariff of USJ5.03/kWh in 1979 real terms are used as a minimum estimate
of the project benefits. This tariff level takes into account the removal of
all oil subsidies to the electricity sector by January 1, 1981, as agreed
during negotiations, entailing a 64% increase in the tariff rate at the EGAT
level and a further extraordinary 19% increase by April 1, 1981 to achieve the
required minimum return for FY1981 (para. 4.12); (ii) all import duties and



- 56 -
taxes, including the royalty on lignite production, have been excluded; and
(iii) the foreign exchange costs have been shadow priced 20% above the official
foreign exchange rate to reflect the scarcity of foreign exhange in Thailand.
The economic rate of return, under the above assumptions is 13.8%. If there
is no shadow-pricing of foreign exchange, the return increases to a relatively
high 15.9% as shown in the following sensitivity tests.
Sensitivity Tests on Economic Rate of Return
for Mae Moh Mine and Power Units 4 and 5
Base case                                 13.8
Capital cost increase - 10%              12.6
Capital cost decrease - 10%              15.2
Operating cost increase - 10%             13.4
Tariff increase - 10%                     15.4
Tariff decrease - 10%                    12.1
Base case without shadow pricing          15.9
9.05      The second analysis evaluates the rationale of generating power
at Mae Moh from domestic lignite resources versus the alternative of gene-
rating power at a plant, located close to shore in the Bangkok area, fueled
with imported bituminous coal. The analysis assumes that bituminous coal
supplies would be available to EGAT on a long term basis from Australia, which
is likely. The analysis shows at what level of steam coal prices, the more
capital intensive lignite fired power plant becomes an attractive economic
alternative to a coal fired plant, and the sensitivity resulting from possible
further increases in coal prices.
9.06      For purposes of comparison, a model was developed of a 300 MW coal
fired plant, using the capital and operating cost estimates for the IBRD-
financed 500 MW Bang Pakong power unit (Report No. 2271-TH of March 13, 1979)
and pro-rated to correspond to the same generating capacity as Mae Moh Units 4
and 5 (300 MW). While the Bang Pakong plant is an oil fired unit, the capital
cost of the coal fired unit was assumed to be 35% above that of the pro-rated
300 MW oil fired plant based on a Bank review of capital cost comparisons of
coal fired to oil fired plants made by US engineerings firms. 1/ This differ-
ential was assumed to apply only to the power units, and not to the transmis-
sion facilities, the cost of which would be unaffected by fuel changes. The
difference in plant costs is due mainly to the larger boiler capacity necessary
for coal firing compared to oil firing and the need for coal crushing and
handling, and stack emission systems.
9.07      By comparison, the capital costs of the lignite fired power units
at Mae Moh are 25% above those assumed for the coal fired unit, principally
due to the more elaborate stack emission control systems and other investments
1/   Staff Working Paper No. 350 "Energy Options and Policy Issues in
Developing Countries," August 1979.



- 57 -
required by the relatively low calorific content and general burning charac-
teristics of lignite (para. 3.02). For purposes of analysis all capital and
operating cost differentials were taken into account including the cost of
ocean and inland freight of coal imports and the higher consumption of fuel
by the lignite fired plant due to the higher heat rate (energy consumed per
kWh) for plants fired with inferior fuels.
9.08      The results of the analysis can be considered conservative, because
the Mae Moh mine and power development includes higher transmission costs
due to the longer distance between generating facility and major consumption
center in eastern Thailand than in the alternative (modeled from the Bang
Pakong power project with transmission from Bang Pakong to Bangkok).
9.09      In the analysis the benefits of the lignite fired plant were
considered to be the savings of the alternative construction and operation
of a coal fired plant. Taxes and import duties were eliminated, and the
foreign components of the capital and operating costs of the power plants were
shadow priced 20% as in the earlier economic rate of return analysis. The
prices of steam coal were varied for sensitivity analysis from US$32.00
per ton to US$42.00 per ton.
9.10      At recently quoted international contract prices, which are
presently ranging from US$32-36 per ton FOB in 1979 terms, the internal
economic rate of return of the lignite based project ranges from 14-16%,
indicating a distinct economic advantage to investment in a lignite rather
than coal fired plant. The results are as follows:

B. Foreign Exchange and Other Benefits
9.11      The net foreign exchange savings have been calculated as in the
second economic rate of return analysis above under the assumption that the
combined mine and power investment in both Units 4 and 5 would substitute for
a 300 MW coal fired plant. The net foreign exchange savings over the 30 year
life of the two power plant units to be supplied by lignite are expected to
average US$14.7 million annually in 1979 terms taking into account the impact
of debt service (Annex 9-2). This is of particular importance in Thailand
where scarcity in foreign exchange is a constraining factor.



- 58 -
9.12      The proposed project would provide for technological transfer through
technical assistance and training at the mine site, and would strengthen the
institutional aspects of the power utility through proposed managerial changes
(para. 4.23) and related training. In spite of its capital intensive nature
and the present overstaffing at Mae Moh (para 5.47) the project would provide
some increase in economic activity in the remote Northeastern Region of
Thailand through the direct employment of 265 persons at Mae Moh and indirect
employment in the surrounding area of persons engaged in providing supporting
services and facilities. The project would further benefit the area by the
resettlement program (para. 5.44) under which program squatters would be re-
settled in a village with a school, health center, water supply, electricity
and other amenities which would represent improvements in their living
conditions.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major agreements and assurances have been obtained:

and all due regard will be given to the need to protect
water quality (para. 5.46);
(xv)  that no lignite from the mine expansion financed with
the Bank loan will be used in other applications than
power generation (paras. 7.11, 8.21); and



- 60 -
(b) From the Royal Thai Government:
(i)  that the Government will ensure for the power sector,
rates of return of not less than 2% for FY 1981
and 8% for FY 1982 and thereafter, and will to this
end take or cause to be taken measures in accordance
with a plan of action to adjust electricity tariffs
and to eliminate fuel oil subsidies (paras. 4.12,
8.22); and
(ii) that it will ensure that the necessary funds to complete
the project will be provided (paras. 7.12 and 8.22).
10.02     The following are conditions of loan effectiveness:
(i) The acquisition of the resettlement site (para. 5.44);
(ii) The effectiveness of the ADB loan for Mae Moh Power
Unit 4 Project (paras. 6.05, 7.11); and
(iii) The signature of the consulting contracts (para. 7.16).
10.03     Given the preceeding agreements and assurances, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$72 million to EGAT for a period of 20 years
including 5 years grace, with the guarantee of the Royal Thai Government.
Retroactive financing of up to US$3 million is recommended.

ANNEX 3
Page 1 of 4
THAILAND: MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
LIGNITE PRICING
Objectives
1.        The purpose of this annex is to calculate a price for lignite that
would put it at par with that of bituminous steam coal that Thailand would
have the option to import and burn in a coal fired plant. Under the project,
this price would be included in the fuel adjustment clause in EGAT's tariff
schedule. The price for lignite can not be established on the sole basis of
the calorific content of the Mae Moh lignite because the intrinsic qualities
of this fuel render its utilization in firing power plants more expensive by
calling for additional handling, crushing and ash disposal equipment and
larger boiler sizes than would be required with higher quality coals. The
higher initial investment for electricity generation from lignite rather than
from alternative superior coals needs to be taken into account. Moreover the
heat rate (energy consumed per Kwh generated) is higher for power plants fired
with inferior fuels like lignite implying a higher primary energy consumption
for these plants for a same amount of generated energy.
Alternative Bituminous Coal Fired Plant
2.        If EGAT were to build a power plant fueled with imported bituminous
coal it would almost certainly locate it close to shore in the Bangkok area.
A large size unit of an approximate 500 MW capacity would be chosen as units
of that size are cheaper on a per MW basis and would be compatible with the
total generating capacity of the Thai system. The equipment transportation
problems to site associated with the construction of a lignite fired plant at
Mae Moh would not be relevant in this case.
3.        Engineering preparation has not so far been carried out for the
construction of such a coal fired plant with the result that no immediate
cost estimate is available for this type of plant. However, numerous cost
data exist for plants constructed or proposed in other countries. A review of
capital cost comparisons of coal fired plants to oil fired plants established
by US engineering firms was performed by the Bank Energy Department for the
Staff Working Paper "Energy Options and Policy Issues in Developing Countries"
(No. 350) and concluded that coal fired plants are between 25 and 67% more
expensive than oil fired plants for an identical 500 MW capacity due prin-
cipally to the doubling of the boiler cost. Additional estimates obtained
from other sources generally yield a differential of 30-40%. It was con-
sidered reasonable to assume here that the coal fired plant would be 35%
more expensive than the Bang Pakong oil fired plant. This differential
applies only to the power unit, not to the transmission facilities which are
unaffected by choice of fuel.
4.        The following are the capital costs of the three alternative
plants, the 500 MW units being pro-rated to the 300 MW level.

Fuel Comparison
5.        Coal to be burned in the alternative coal fired plant is assumed to
be imported from Australia, the closest supply source.  Recent contract quotes
establish prices at approximately US$32-36 per ton for a low sulphur coal with
a calorific value of 11,900 BTU/lb. Recent ocean freight quotes for coal from
Australia to Japan, a distance comparable to that from Australia to Thailand
are in the range of US$12-14 per ton. An additional inland freight and
handling charge of US$6 per ton for delivery of coal imports to the power

Establishment of a Lignite Price
6.        The problem is to identify a price for lignite PL that represents
the maximum price the power utility could be willing to pay for the lignite
given the difference in capital and operating costs between a lignite
fired plant and a coal fired plant, the heat rate differential, the cost of
imported coal P  and the opportunity cost of capital r.  Let the following
vectors represent the annual benefits and cost streams of the two possible
investments as well as the yearly fuel consumptions, over the lifetime of the
power plants.
Lignite Fired           Coal Fired
Plant                  Plant
Capital Costs                    KL                     KC
Operating Costs excl.            0L                     0C
Fuel Costs
Fuel Consumption                 QL                     QC
(quantities)
The price for lignite P  should be such that the net present values (NPV) of
the two alternative investments are equal i.e.,
NPV(K    0 L    L   QL)   NPV (KC + 0C + P  x QC)
L       QL )   PC NPV (QC  +  NPV (KC +   C - K  - OC)
or        NPV (QC)   pV+)NPV (K    0  - L            L
pL       L        pC    C           C     CL    L)
NPV (Q L)                   NPV (QL)
The last equation shows that the lignite price is a linear function of the
coal price.
Estimates of Lignite Price
7.        The following equation was estimated using an 8% discount rate
for the calculation of the net present values.  PL represents the price
of lignite per ton and PC the FOB Australia coal price per ton.
PL =  0.330 PC + 3.32
When prices are expressed on a BTU basis this relationship becomes
P  = 0.807 P  + 0.310

8.        The table below gives some illustrative values of the lignite price
in 1979 terms based on the opportunity cost of imported coal for different
coal prices FOB Australia. Contract quotes for shipment of Australian coal
to Japan have ranged widely from US$30-36 per ton FOB. Taking a conservative
US$30 price per ton for Australian coal in 1979 real terms and adding 20% to
reflect foreign exchange scarcity for Thailand, the fourth line of the table
below gives a lignite price of US$15.2 per ton. The table also shows the
dollar adjustment to be made to a US$10.2 minimum charge per ton for lignite
based on production costs plus a margin to cover debt service, fixed asset
replacements and exploration requirements that each value of lignite price
would imply, and the impact such adjustment would have on corporate revenues
when full production for the proposed project is reached in 1984.

monsoon season.
b)   Available operating Hours for Equipment
From available data it is estimated that operating hours for equipment
are distributed over the working day as follows:
Shift             Operating Hours
1st Shift             5.5
2nd Shift             5.5
3rd Shift             5.0
Total:               16.0
Annually available equipment hours are therefore as follows:
Lignite          Overburden
Hours available                      4,000             3,200

THAILAND
MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS IN FINANCIAL FORECASTS
A. Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts of EGAT
Revenues
1.        For the forecasting period FY80-88, revenues were first projected at
the levels required to yield minimum annual rates of return for EGAT of 2% for
FY81 and 8% thereafter on the average revalued net fixed assets in operation
at the beginning and end of each year. Next the annual rates of return of the
electricity sector were calculated assuming in addition that MEA and PEA would
earn annual rates of return of 8% on average revalued net fixed assets in
operation for all fiscal years after 1982. This led to rates of return for
the sector of 0.5% in FY80, 3.6% in FY81, 11.6% in FY82 about 8.1% for each
fiscal year thereafter and allowed the calculation of future tariffs at the
consumer level. Keeping these tariffs constant the available excess cash in
HEA and PEA was then shifted to EGAT by raising EGAT's bulk tariff year by
year as appropriate with the result that the rates of return for EGAT were
raised from 2% in FY80 and 8% thereafter to 4.9% in FY81, 14.5% in FY82
and about 9.5% thereafter.
2.        On a year by year basis the assumptions are as follows:
(a) Fiscal Year 1980
EGAT revenues assume that no further fuel adjustment is made
for FY80 and that the current average tariff level will apply
through September 30, 1980 (B 0.8401-USJ4.1/Kwh). This
average tariff level is after the 38% increase on February 1,
1980.
(b) Fiscal Year 1981
Revenues were first based on the following assumptions for fuel
adjustments and tariff increases which are passed through MEA
and PEA:

produce ROR of 2Z
for EGAT for FY81
EGAT revenues and MEA/PEA bulk power purchases were then adjusted
to transfer surplus funds from MEA/PEA to EGAT to reduce overall
sector borrowing and therefore debt service as explained in
para. 1 of this Annex.
(c) Fiscal Year 1982
The average tariff levels required for FY82 for the sector to earn
the covenanted 8% rate of return for that year, are lower than
those needed to earn the covenanted 2% for FY81. The reduction
is due to real cost savings accruing from diversifying from oil as
fuel, to gas and an improved hydro thermal mix in FY82. FY81 tariff
levels including the cost adjustments are assumed to apply for FY82;
EGAT revenues and MEA/PEA bulk power costs have again been adjusted
to transfer surplus funds to EGAT.
(d) Fiscal Year 1983 and After
Revenues are those required to produce an 8% rate of return
subject to the fact that for FY83, EGAT and MEA average tariff
levels required for an 8% rate of return were slightly lower than
the FY81-82 average tariff levels. These levels were assumed to
apply for FY83. For FY83-88, adjustments have again been made
to transfer surplus funds from MEA/PEA to EGAT.
Assumptions
Fuel Costs
3.        Oil.  Fuel oil and diesel prices to EGAT have been assumed to apply
at the dates of the fuel oil adjustments detailed above to eliminate oil
subsidies by January 1, 1981. Price levels assumed include increases in the



- 97 -
ANNEX 8-5
Page 3 of 4
OPEC average price of $8/bbl above existing levels to bring the price to
US$32/bbl crude equivalent for FY81; thereafter costs have been increased at
3% p.a. in real terms. The assumed price levels are in accordance with Bank
predictions.
Lignite. Lignite prices have been assumed at cost through FY83 and
at a price of US$15.2/ton (1979 price level) escalated at 1% p.a. in real
terms thereafter, in accordance with the latest Bank estimates of substitute
Australian steam coal cost.
Gas. Gas prices have been assumed at 90% of the fuel oil equivalent
each year.
Operating Costs
4.        Operating costs have been estimated based on FY79 unit costs and
escalated at 12.25%, 11%, 10%, 9.5% and 8.5% for FY80, FY81, FY82, FY83-85 and
FY86-88, respectively.  These rates are the latest Bank estimates assuming
50/50 foreign and local expenditure.
Capital Investment
5.        Construction costs are those estimated to provide the additional
plant and equipment required to meet the demand forecast escalated in accordance
with the latest Bank inflation estimates.
Equity
6.        Equity to be received is that agreed to be provided PEA and EGAT for
ongoing projects for contributions for the irrigation share of hydro-electric
projects and import duty; for future projects (Post FY79) it has been assumed
that about B 2,000 million (US$98 million) will be received from Government as
equity to cover cash shortages (in EGAT) through FY83; thereafter the only
other equity receivable will be to cover the irrigation share of multi-purpose
projects.
Borrowings
7.        Borrowings for the sector have been assumed at B 128 billion
(US$6.2 billion) for foreign borrowings, and B 49 billion (US$2.4 billion) for
local borrowings. Foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates
varying from 2% to 15%, and for terms varying from 30 years including 10 years
grace to 10 years including 3 years grace. Local borrowings have been assumed
at annual interest rates varying from 10% to 15% and terms varying from 10
years including 5 years grace to 20 years including 5 years grace on the
assumption that the longer term debts will be rolled over.

EGAT FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION
Financing Requirements and Proposed Financing Plan
1.        Economic expansion and the additional generation and transmission
capacity required to support Thailand's rural electrification program will
cause EGAT to expand its asset base four times over the ten years ending
FY88. Expenditures to meet the required construction program are estimated
to total B 195.3 billion (US$9.6 billion) at current prices including interest
during construction. EGAT would borrow about three quarters of this amount
and one quarter would be self-financed or would come 'from Government equity
(3% in total), on the assumption that the rates of return on revalued net
fixed assets for EGAT will be 1.2% in FY80, 4.9% in FY81, 14.5% in FY82 and
about 9.5% thereafter. The financing plan based on these assumptions is as
follows:

2.        Until last year, EGAT's earnings covenant with the Bank was based
on annual self-generation of three years average construction expenditures,
comprising the test, previous and following years; for FY78 15% self-
generation was required and EGAT generated 19%. Repeated attempts in the
past to change the covenant to a rate of return (ROR) basis finally met with

ANNEX 8-7
Page 2 of 3
success in 1978 when Government agreed to a sector ROR during negotiations for
the first Accelerated Rural Electrification loan (1527-TB). EGAT was brought
into line with the sector position when it was agreed during negotiations of
the proposed loan that EGAT and the sector would earn RORs on average revalued
net fixed assets in operation of not less than 2% for FY81 and 8% thereafter.
The revaluation of net fixed assets is based on a projection of the fixed
capital formation deflator for public investment which assumes increases at
12.25%, 11%, 10%, 9.5% and 8.5% for FY 80, FY81, FY82, FY83-85 and FY86-88,
respectively.
Tariff Levels
3.        Tariff increase assumptions are detailed in Annex 8-5.  The yearly
schedule during the forecasting period would be as follows:
EGAT                                Sector

Future Operating Results
4.        EGAT's energy sales are estimated to increase from 11,516 GWh in
FY78 to 32,572 GWh in FY88, an average annual growth rate of 11%. Revenues
are forecast to increase from B 6.5 billion (US$0.32 billion) in FY78 to
B 72.5 billion (US$3.6 billion) in FY88, an average annual growth rate of
27%; operating expenses are expected to grow from B 5.5 billion (US$0.3
billion) for FY78 to B 56.5 billion (US$2.8 billion) in FY88 an average
annual growth rate of 26%.
5.        A downward trend in the operating ratio from 84% in FY78 to 78% in
FY88 indicates a reasonably improved financial situation over the forecast
period and that an increasing proportion of revenues is made available to help
finance construction expenditures.

Cash Position
6.        The corporate financial projections show that the projected tariff
rates and the proposed financing plan would permit EGAT to finance its capital
expenditures over FY80-88 without incurring cash shortfalls in any year.
Debt Control
7.        The capital structure will be satisfactory throughout the forecast
period: the debt/equity ratio is estimated to remain below 58/42. EGAT's
current debt control test provides for Bank review of borrowing when the
debt/equity ratio exceeds 60/40 or when medium term debt aggregates to 15% of
total debt.
Current Position
8.        The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.4 (FY77 and 78)
and 2.0 (FY76) and is reduced at a minimum of 0.8 until FY83 and 1.0 from
FY84 through FY88 due to cash balances being lower than desirable in the
early years of the forecasting period. However, EGAT has access to short-term
borrowing in an emergency and has additional long-term borrowing capacity; the
position is therefore acceptable. Consumers receivables at end FY78 were
about 2.4 months billing which is high for a bulk power supplier. However,
EGAT's contracts with MEA and PEA provide for extended payment over 60 days
after the bill is received. The supply contract cannot be amended without the
agreement of MEA and PEA. The problem will be addressed during the ongoing
tariff study with a view to having the contracts amended so that bills are
outstanding for a reduced period.

THAILAND: MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
A.   Assumptions Underlying the Financial and Economic Analyses
1.        The financial and economic analyses focussed at (i) assessing the
incremental financial and economic rates of return of the combined mine and
power investment for Unit 4 alone and for Units 4 and 5 together with the
benefits from the incremental power generation assumed to be equal to the
incremental revenues for EGAT from the sale of power generated at Mae Moh,
(ii) comparing the combined mine and power investment corresponding to the
construction of the two 150 MW lignite fired Units 4 and 5 at Mae Moh to
three-fifths of the investment required to build a 500 MW coal fired unit in
the Bangkok region, close to the port facilities for handling coal carriers.
2.        The first approach attempts to measure the incremental financial and
economic rate of return of the project by valuing the power generated from the
power units at the tariff rates assumed in the financial projections. For the
economic rate of return, import duties, taxes and royalties were excluded from
the capital and operating costs and the foreign capital and operating costs
were shadow priced at 20% above the B 20.25 = US$1.00 exchange rate to reflect
the present scarcity of foreign exchange for Thailand. This analysis evidences
the substantial economies of scale which would be captured with the construc-
tion of Power Unit 5.
3.        The second approach is essentially a least cost comparison of the
combined mine and power investment required for Units 4 and 5 at Mae Moh to
an alternative investment in a coal fired plant located in the Bangkok area.
The capital and operating costs data corresponding to this alternative were
derived from the figures established for the Staff Appraisal Report of the
Bang Pakong Project, a 500 MW oil fired unit, and brought to the August 1979
price level. Engineering preparation has not so far been carried out for the
construction of a coal fired plant with the result that no cost estimate is
available for this type of plant. However, numerous cost comparisons exist
for plants using alternative fuels constructed or proposed in other countries.
A review of capital cost comparison of coal fired plants to oil fired plants
established by US engineering firms was performed by the Bank Energy Department
for the Staff Working Paper "Energy Options and Policy Issues in Developing
Countries" (No. 350) and concluded that coal fired plants are between 25 and
67% more expensive than oil fired plants for an identical 500 MW capacity due
principally to the doubling of the boiler cost. Additional estimates obtained
from other sources yield a differential of 30-40%. It was considered reasonable
to assume for the purpose of this analysis that a coal fired plant would be
35% more expensive than the Bang Pakong oil fired plant. This differential
applies only to the power unit, not to the transmission facilities. Finally
since the combined generation capacity of Units 4 and 5 at Mae Moh is 300 MW
only the capital costs of the coal fired alternative were prorated to a
partial 300 MW capacity.

ANNEX 9-1
Page 2 of 7
4.        The fuel consumption of the coal fired alternative was asstmed
at 0.807 lb of bituminous steam coal per kWh based on a heat rate of 9,600
BTU/kWh, a calorific value of coal of 11,900 BTU/lb. With the same load
factor of 74.2% of nominal generation capacity assumed for the alternative as
for the Mae Moh units, the expansion of the mine production would substitute
for a consumption of 714,500 tons of coal per year. Coal to be burned in the
alternative coal fired plant is assumed to be imported from Australia, the
closest supply source. Recent contract quotes establish prices at approxi-
mately US$32-36 per ton for a low sulphur coal with a calorific value such as
that assumed. Recent ocean freight quotes for coal from Australia to Japan,
a distance comparable to that from Australia to Thailand are in the range of
US$12-14 per ton. An additional inland freight and handling charge of US$6
per ton for delivery of coal imports to the power plant seems reasonable.
The economic rate of return was tested against prices for coal FOB Australia
ranging from US$32 to US$42 per ton.
5.        The import duties and taxes were eliminated from the capital costs
of lignite and coal fired power units as well as from the costs of the mining
equipment and the royalty on lignite production from the mine operating costs.
The foreign components of the capital costs and the annual savings in coal
imports were shadow priced at 20% above the B 20.25 = US$1.00 exchange rate.

of US$51 per ton. Once shadow priced for foreign exchange savings this price becomes US$61.2 per ton.
