SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:      The Republic of Togo
Amount:        SDR3.1 million (US$3.5 million equivalent)
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description:   The proposed project aims to further the technical assistance
effort begun under the First Project by providing assistance
in key ministries. The project would provide for:
a)   a Senior Economic Adviser for three years, to replace the
present incumbent financed under the First Project, and
an investment programmer for two years in the Ministry
of Plan;
b)   creation of a planning unit and an applied research coor-
dination unit in the Ministry of Rural Development with
the assistance of a planning expert for 24 months, a
research coordinator for 18 months, and additional con-
sultants for a total of 18 months;
c)   experts to introduce program-contracts and analytical
accounting in the Ministry of Industry and State Enter-
prises for a total of 22 months, as well as an expert for
a total of 14 months to define performance criteria and to
guide analytical studies;
d)   additional consultants' funds (US$1.1 million equivalent)
for various studies connected with the implementation of
economic adjustment and financial stabilization measures;
and
e)   fellowships and salary supplements for counterpart and
support staff; training of counterparts; office equipment
and supplies; and vehicles.
Benefits
and Risks:      Benefits would accrue to Togo over many years as the advice
and training provided under the second project extend and
expand the technical assistance provided by the first project,
and lead to an increased Government capacity to conceive and
implement sound, comprehensive, and consistent macro-economic
policies, and to pursue adjustment policies in crucial areas
such as rural development, state enterprises, and public
investment programming. The main risks of the project derive
from the difficulties in finding expatriate personnel who are
both highly qualified and sufficiently adaptable to gain and

retain the confidence of the Government, without which the
effectiveness of the resident experts would be greatly reduced.
The Government's awareness of the need for technical assistance
and the need for economic adjustment and financial stabiliza-
tion measures is reflected in its support for the first project
and in its firm commitment to the program supported by the
proposed second project.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 3.1 million (US$3.5
million equivalent on standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Technical
Assistance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Togo: Country Economic Memorandum"
(3416-TO) was circulated to the Executive Directors in January 1982. Its
assessment of the country's economic prospects, updated by recent Bank mis-
sions, is reflected in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains basic
economic data and selected social indicators.
Introduction
3.        Togo is a small country (56,000 km2) with a population of about
2.5 million and a per capita GNP of US$363 (1980). Phosphate mining has been
the principal source of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for nearly 40
percent of export revenues in 1979/80, and receipts from phosphates represent
about 30 percent of Government revenues. Political stability has prevailed
since 1967, when a military Government came to power. General Eyadema remains
President, but the Government has gradually become entirely civilian. Togo's
external policy, in the spirit of the Lome I and II Conventions, favors
regional and international cooperation.
Economic Performance
4.        Slow growth and increasing financial disequilibria are the main
features of the Togolese economy since the late 1970s.  The slow growth
represents a deceleration from historical growth-trends, and is the result
of poor performance by many state enterprises and a persistent stagnation or
decline in the production of export crops. The 1974/75 boom in world phos-
phate prices contributed to a substantial increase in export earnings and
Government revenues, and prompted the Government to adopt an ambitious Devel-
opment Plan for 1976-80.
5.        Growth in real GDP averaged less than 3 percent-per annum during
the 1975-80 period, and was negative in 1981. Gross domestic expenditures
outpaced production, with the result that the resource gap widened signifi-
cantly through 1978. Due to the rapid increase in public investment, gross
domestic investment rose sharply to exceed 50 percent of GDP in 1978, but
declined to an estimated 18 percent in 1981, as growing fiscal constraints
necessitated a cutback.



- 2 -
6.        The primary sector accounts for about 30 percent of GDP, but employs
80 percent of the labor force. Growth has been limited by inadequate invest-
ment, insufficient price incentives, and occasional droughts. Despite slow
growth and reliance primarily on traditional production techniques, Togo is
still largely self-sufficient in food crops, except during serious droughts.
Nevertheless, food crop yields are low, and there is considerable scope for
growth. The use of fertilizer, insecticides, and improved seeds is negligi-
ble, and extension services are generally ineffective. Both producer and
consumer prices of food crops fluctuate dramatically annually, in response to
climatic conditions, and seasonally because of limited storage facilities.
Coffee, cocoa, and cotton are the major cash crops. Cotton is grown in
rotation with food crops. Producer prices are still not overly remunerative
and the declining yields of aging trees have led to decreases in coffee and
cocoa production. Replanting programs should, however, soon begin to have an
effect on output. The producer price for cotton is comparatively low, but
production is encouraged by the subsidization of fertilizers, although the
subsidy was reduced by half for the 1981/82 growing season.
7.        The secondary sector accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, with
most industrial development conducted by state enterprises. The recent growth
in this sector is attributable to phosphate rock production, which has, how-
ever, experienced dramatic swings as a result of the 1974 price increase, a
price decrease in 1975/1976, another increase in 1980, and the shifts in
demand which accompanied these price changes. Massive investments in indus-
trial projects following the 1974/75 boom in phosphate prices have failed to
contribute to an increase in GDP, because of the low or occasionally negative
value added realized by several of the new industrial units. Construction
went through boom and bust as output doubled between 1975 and 1978, because of
greatly stepped up investment, and subsequently declined to the 1975 volume.
From a peak of 10,000 in 1978, employment in construction was cut to 4,000 in
1980. The capital-intensive nature of recent investments led to an increase
in demand for energy, most of which has been met through imports of petroleum
products and electricity.
8.        The tertiary sector accounts for about 50 percent of GDP.  Togo has
traditionally served as a regional trading center with an open-door policy.
Private investors have tended to favor commerce, real estate and financial
services over industrial ventures. During the 1975-80 period, financial
services expanded rapidly, whereas activity in private commerce and transport
grew more in line with the rest of the economy. A rapid increase in public
services led to a growth in government enployment from 22,500 in 1975 to
37,500 in 1978; however, financial problems necessitated restraint from 1979
on.
Public Finance
9.        In 1975, current revenues of the Government nearly doubled to CFAF
33 billion as revenue from phosphates tripled from CFAF 4 to 12 billion. In
1976, the first year of the third Five-Year Plan, the Government embarked, upon



- 3 -
its expansionary program just when the phosphate market weakened. However,
while phosphate prices fell, demand and output rose, and -- supplemented by
higher import duty receipts -- current revenue continued to rise. Although
current expenditure also increased rapidly, mainly due to a rising wage bill,
a sizeable surplus was left to finance both investment and debt service until
1978 when debt service obligations increased sharply.
10.       Public investment (in current prices) of the Administration, state
enterprises and agencies increased from CFAF 30 billion in 1975 to CFAF 88
billion in 1978, and continued at the still high but reduced rate of about CFAF
67 billion in 1980, as disbursements were made on projects being implemented.
In part because of the heavy reliance on foreign financing, which was often
project-tied, the investments undertaken differed greatly from those foreseen
in the 1976-80, Development Plan. Compared to previous plans, the Plan had
placed more emphasis on rural development. However, during implementation
major shortfalls were experienced for this category, while more expenditures
than planned were devoted to infrastructure, tourism and industry.
11.       Many state enterprises were unable to pay the debt service on
their foreign borrowings, and the Treasury had to shoulder the responsibility.
Arrears began to accumulate as payments lagged. In 1979, Togo agreed with the
IMF on a financial program, and rescheduled its debt through the Paris Club
for 1979/80. Even after debt rescheduling, 15 percent of current revenues had
to be allocated to debt service in 1980. Without debt rescheduling, the ratio
would have been over 50 percent in 1981. Therefore, a second round of debt
rescheduling (for 1981/82) and a second standby arrangement with the IMF were
sought and obtained in early 1981, leading to a ratio of debt service to
current revenues of about 35 percent in 1981.
12.       A decline in Government revenues in 1981, caused in part by a drop
in the volume of phosphate exports, led to an accumulation of Treasury payment
arrears as a sizeable portion of the rescheduled debt service obligations was
not met. The financial program with the IMF was abandoned. A new program has
yet to be negotiated, and the debt rescheduling for 1982 through the Paris
Club is in the meantime left in abeyance. The Government is currently trying
to meet the pre-conditions laid down by the IMF, especially regarding debt
payments and arrears.
13.       The Government has taken several steps to ease these severe fis-
cal constraints.  On the one hand, tax and customs reforms have been adopted to
increase Government revenue, and the rates charged by some public utilities
have been raised. On the other hand, the growth in Government expenditures
has been limited by constraints on civil service hiring and salary increases,
and a reduction in extrabudgetary expenditures. In addition, public invest-
ments were reduced to about CFAF 35 billion in 1981 and are not expected to
exceed CFAF 32 billion in 1982. Most of the 1982 investments will be allocated
to the continuation and completion of on-going projects. The large majority
of these investments (66 percent) and all new investments are being financed
by grants and concessionary loans.



-4-
Structural Adjustment
14.       In parallel with efforts to reach an agreement with the IMF on a
Financial Stabilization Program and its own budgetary and tax reforms, the
Government is intensively pursuing a dialogue with the Bank aiming toward
the definition of a Structural Adjustment Program. The main elements of
the Program would include: a) rehabilitation of state enterprises, including
privatization where feasible, and closure or liquidation of unprofitable
enterprises, b) promotion and diversification of exports through stronger
incentives in the rural sector and greater value added in mining, and c)
improved macro-economic management, including the adoption of a realistic,
high-quality investment program.
Prospects
15.       In the 1982-85 period, the outlook is for average annual real GDP
growth of about 3.4 percent, i.e., an increase in GDP per capita of about
one percent per annum. Growth is expected to become more evenly spread among
the sectors, but still remain highest in the secondary sector due to expand-
ing mining operations. The modest improvement in projected growth will not
relieve unemployment which will be aggravated by the number of new entrants
into the labor market. The pursuit of less expansionary policies is expected
to lead to higher domestic savings. The current account deficit in the
balance of payments will nevertheless remain sizeable, because of large
interest payments of foreign debt.
16.       In agriculture there is a potential for increasing the output of
both food and export crops, and growth is projected to be about 3 percent
annually between 1982 and 1985, assuming favorable weather conditions. An
increase in food crop production could be achieved through wider use of mod-
ern production techniques. Steady growth of coffee and cocoa production is
expected to begin in 1981/82, as IDA-sponsored replanting schemes begin to
have an impact. Cotton production is expected to increase at about 16 per-
cent per year during 1982-1985 with continued IDA support.
17.       The outlook for growth in the secondary sector between 1982 and 1985
is mixed. As a whole, the sector is projected to expand at an average annual
rate of 4 percent. Assuming transfers of funds from the phosphate mining
company to the Treasury will not be excessive, thus enabling the company to
increase its capacity, output in mining could increase considerably. This
assumes, furthermore, that the Bank-supported CIMAO clinker plant is able
to overcome its current technical problems and approach full capacity uti-
lization. In industry, the Government intends to adopt remedial policies to
overcome the difficulties of state enterprises, which will require a broad
range of adjustment measures. Growth in construction will be modest because
of financial constraints, while expansion in energy will be encouraged by
policies aimed at reducing the reliance on imported energy by increasing
domestic production of hydroelectricity; this, however, will have no impact on
production before 1985.



-5-
18.       The outlook for the tertiary sector points to an annual growth rate
of 3 percent between 1982 and 1985. Because of the severe financial con-
straints facing the Government, output of public services will be practically
stagnant. Recruitment to the civil service will have to be reduced to a bare
minimum. Growth in transport and commerce is, on the contrary, expected to
continue on the assumptions that Togo will be able to better organize its
transit trade to benefit from existing infrastructure, and that - as in the
past - Government intervention will be minimal.
19.       Notwithstanding the possible continuation of ongoing debt re-
scheduling efforts, judicious policies will be required during the next
four years if rising debt service obligations are to be met while a minimum
development effort is maintained. Except for enclave-type operations, there is
no scope for additional borrowing on financial markets, and new investments
will be feasible only to the extent that grants and concessionary loans are
available. Government finances will continue to be extremely tight, requiring
austerity in current expenditure and highly selective investments as well as a
high percentage of project costs, including local costs, financed from foreign
concessionary sources. Toward the end of the period, rising revenues from
phosphates and a moderate acceleration in economic growth will slowly begin to
ease the financial constraint, although large debt service payments will put
pressure on the balance of payments, requiring further recourse to balance of
payments assistance. With the restoration of a sounder financial situation,
Togo's longer-term development prospects remain promising, as there is con-
siderable scope to better exploit the resource base of the economy.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
20.       Bank Group lending to Togo totals twelve credits amounting to
US$96.3 million, and two loans totaling US$53.0 million, for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo, and one of
US$49.5 million to CIMAO jointly and severally guaranteed by Togo, Ivory
Coast, and Ghana). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations as of March 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects. In addition to the CIMAO project, Bank Group lending has included
roads, agriculture. (cocoa, coffee, cotton, and food crops), education,
technical assistance to the Ministry of Plan, a regional DFC operation, and
*       feasibility studies for a phosphate fertilizer project and a regional hydro-
electric power project.
21.       Four of the credits were in the road sector, with efforts directed
to building up an efficient maintenance service, upgrading the country's main
and more heavily trafficked roads, and starting a comprehensive transport
planning and coordination system. A separate project for feeder road develop-
ment provides for improvement works and maintenance operations.



- 6 -
22.       The objectives of the four agricultural projects partly financed by
IDA credits are to stimulate food crop production and to increase farm incomes
through development of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, and cotton. In
December 1981, a large-scale cotto7n and food crop project was appraised, and
is scheduled for Board presentation during the first half of FY83. This
project is designed to help overcome the slow growth of output and incomes in
the rural sector, by putting greater emphasis on improved cultivation tech-
niques and increased food production.
23.       An important obiective of Bank Group lending to Togo Is also to
strengthen institutions in the main economic sectors, to tap the large mining
potential to increase foreign exchange earning capabilities, to develop local
energy sources, and to support the training and education system. The First
Technical Assistance Project in the Ministry of Plan, aimed at helping the
Government formulate sound investment and public finance policies, is pro-
gressing well. The proposed Second Project would permit continued technical
assistance in support of the implementation of an envisaged structural adjust--
ment program. An Engineering and Technical Assistance Credit will help to
determine the technical and economic viability of developing a phosphate
fertilizer project in Togo.  A similar Engineering Credit, approved in FY82,
will help to assess the viability of the Nangbeto hydroelectric scheme (a
regional project being planned jointly with Benin). An ongoing Education
project finances the construction of teacher training facilities, expansion
of existing facilities and fellowships.
24.       Togo's performance with respect to project implementation and dis-
bursement is generally satisfactory. The Government is by now quite familiar
with tne Ban]k's procurement and disbursement procedures. Delays are sometimes
encountered, however, because of the cumbersome administrative regulations
used in Togo to award public contracts. The Government is sensitive to this
problem and is working with the Bank to find appropriate means to simplify the
procedures.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
25.       In the past, technical assistance to Togo has usually been limited
to technical ministries and public agencies, and to directly operational
positions in managerial and technical fields. Recently, however, the Govern-
ment has shown increasing interest in extending the use of technical assist-
ance to the provision of policy advice, so far mainly with respect to economic
planning. This change in attitude can be explained in part by events during
and after the phosphate boom, which had far-reaching repercussions, and which
suddenly presented Government policy makers with a much more difficult task.
In the more difficult economic and financial situaticn which prevailed after
1978, the shortcomings of Government economic planning in general, and project
preparation and analysis in particular. became apparent, not least to the
Government itself. These circumstances have made the Government more favorably



- 7 -
disposed to policy-oriented technical assistance furnished by expatriates,
provided, however, that such assistance also includes substantial provision
for training of local counterpart personnel in order to produce lasting
effects in Togo, and to warrant the high cost involved.
26.       The difficulties encountered in implementing the ambitious 1976-80
Development Plan pointed to the priority areas in which a need for more com-
prehensive technical assistance had emerged: on the macro level, investment
planning and monitoring; and on the micro level, project selection and imple-
mentation. Deficiencies in these areas had resulted in the implementation of
a Development Plan that differed significantly from original forecasts. Not
only were the projects selected different from those planned, but they were
often chosen without sufficient analysis of their economic and financial
soundness.  Cost overruns and delays in execution were frequent.  Partly as
a consequence of inadequate preparation, the financial obligations of many
projects were so great that these operations were unable to generate suffi-
cient revenues to service their debt. The Ministry of Plan has not been able
to exercise adequate influence on investment decisions and their implementa-
tion, and despite having a sizeable staff (most of which is poorly trained),
the Ministry is not equipped to define and implement policies appropriate to
the present situation, and to devise a selective and productive investment
program to cover the next few years of financial stringency. If the develop-
ment effort in Togo is not to be hindered by the burden of heavy debt service
obligations, it is particularly important that the Ministry of Plan should
develop and sustain its capability to carry out these activities effectively,
and to play a critical role in the process of improving the quality of the
investment program.
27.       An improving dialogue with the Bank and the growing need for techni-
cal assistance in the Ministry of Plan prompted the Government to request
technical assistance in late 1978. In 1979 the Executive Directors approved a
First Technical Assistance Credit for Togo with the following basic features:
a) a senior economic adviser for three years, whose main tasks were to assist
in investment programming, debt management, and to help bring about improved
coordination between the budget and the plan; b) a senior project adviser for
three years, whose main tasks were to assist in project preparation and
selection, and to find ways to improve the performance of recently completed
projects, notably state enterprises; c) short-term consultants for 130 man-
months to undertake project-related and more general studies; d) training of
junior economists; and e) support services.
28.       Under the First Technical Assistance Project, a senior economic
adviser has served in the Ministry of Plan since late 1979, and this has
facilitated the deepening and broadening policy dialogue with the Government.
Nevertheless, because of the shortage of skilled staff in the Ministry and
their general unfamiliarity with macro-economic concepts, the senior economic



-8-
adviser has become primarily a project adviser, especially in view of the
delays experienced in recruiting the senior project adviser (see para. 29).
In this role, the senior economic adviser has on several occasions exercised
significant influence in improving the quality of project selection. He has
also been used directly by the Minister for a series of ad hoc assignments.
As a result, the time allocated to the training of junior economists has so
far been limited, both because of pressure on the senior economic adviser from
other assignments, and because of the perceived limited growth potential of
several of the candidates proposed. At the request of the Government, the
assignment of the present senior economic adviser has been extended for a
fourth year, until August 1983.
29.       The position of senior project adviser remained vacant for a long
time, owing to the considerable difficulties in finding a person with the
requisite broad range of skills who was willing to assume a three-year assign-
ment in Lome. A good candidate, interested in the position, and available
from September 1982, has recently been identified by the Bank, and will
shortly be recommended to the Government. Appointment of a senior project
adviser should enable the present senior economic adviser and his replacement
under the proposed project to focus on economic policy issues, rather than
project matters.
30.       The First Technical Assistance Project has been a useful vehicle
for providing a wide range of consultants' services to meet specific needs
promptly. Consultants have been financed to prepare the Phosphate Engineering
and Technical Assistance Project and the Second Rural Development Project.
Consultants have also examined the prospects of selected state enterprises,
and provided short-term policy assistance to the badly understaffed Ministry
of Industry and State Enterprises. Prospects for development of small- and
medium-scale private industry were recently studied by consultants. In
addition, consultants will shortly assist in making operational a price analy-
sis and monitoring unit for cash crops. The unit is scheduled to elaborate by
end-1982 a medium-term price policy for cash crops. Finally, consultants are
being financed to assist in preparing a consolidated analysis of public sector
finances, both for recording and programming purposes, which is necessary for
the conclusion of a new stand-by arrangement with the IMF.
31.       As a result of the increased provision of expertise to the Ministry
of Plan and the expanding use of consultants, especially in connection with
the preparation of a structural adjustment program, commitments under the
ongoing project have risen significantly, and now total US$1.7 million out of
US$2.4 million available to the project (IDA US$2.2 million, Government US$0.2
million). Including identified near-term requirements, total commitments
would be US$2.3 million, or practically the total amount provided for under
the First Project.
32.       The need for further technical assistance in a variety of fields
persists. The services of consultants and of the senior economic adviser in
helping the Government cope with its difficult financial and economic situa-
tion are essential. The Ministry of Plan will continue to need a senior



-9-
economic adviser following the departure of the incumbent in August 1983.
Specialized consultants and an investment programmer are important elements
in the elaboration of a selective investment plan. The Ministry of Industry
and State Enterprises cannot devise and implement a recovery program for
state enterprises without technical assistance. The Ministry of Rural Devel-
opment needs assistance in planning, project preparation and monitoring, and
coordination of applied research, to rekindle growth in agriculture and to tap
the considerable potential of the sector. Finally, the Ministries of Plan and
Finance need assistance in establishing a system of monthly macro-economic
indicators, to improve monitoring, to make forecasts on the basis of reliable
and recent data, and to be able to take corrective policy action when need be,
and much more quickly than is presently the case. Other important factors to
consider are the need to prepare a structural adjustment program, and the
technical and managerial difficulties encountered by Government in imple-
menting a financial stabilization program with the IMF.
33.       In addition, through its dialogue with the Bank and the IMF, the
Government has become convinced of the need for corrective economic and
financial policies. The Government is now committed to the implementation
of such policies in order to adjust the structure of the economy to the
evolving international environment, and to re-establish financial stability.
The intention of the Government is to make the economy less vulnerable to
external shocks by-promoting and diversifying production and exports. This
commitment cannot be translated into successful implementation of adjustment
and stabilization policies without sufficient expertise in key technical and
managerial areas. Bank-financed technical assistance would concentrate on
areas in which little other foreign expertise is made available or sought.
Close cooperation will be maintained with other possible sources of technical
assistance, which is provided mainly for technical positions in Government
ministries and agencies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The proposed Second Technical Assistance Project was appraised in
March 1982. A summary is provided at the beginning of the report. Annex
III contains supplementary project data and Annex IV an implementation sched-
ule. There is no separate Staff Appraisal Report. Negotiations were held in
Lome, from May 11 to May 13, 1982 with representatives from the Ministries of
Plan, Finance, and Industry and State Enterprises.
Project Description
35.       The proposed Project is planned to meet the technical assistance
needs that have emerged since the First Project began in 1979, especially
with respect to structural adjustment and sector work, and to expand and
continue the technical assistance effort begun under the First Project.
Technical assistance would be provided to various key ministries for periods
ranging from a few weeks to up to three years to strengthen the Government's
capacity to develop and implement coherent macro-economic policies, and to



- 10 -
study crucial sector issues. To ensure that the work of the expatriate
advisers has a lasting and tangible impact, and in view of the importance
attached to training by the Togolese Government (para. 25), the terms of
reference of consultants selected will contain explicit provisions for
separate advisory and training functions. Systematic training of counter-
parts will be a substantial component of the work programs of expatriate
advisers, and their selection will be based both on their expertise as
advisers and on their suitability to perform such training. Within three
months of their arrival, the experts will submit to the Government and IDA
training programs for each counterpart. Progress in training of counterparts
will be reviewed by the Association and Government every six months. The
overall objective of training would be the gradual replacement of experts by
counterparts.
36.       In the Ministry of Plan, the present Senior Economic Adviser,
financed under the First Technical Assistance Project, is scheduled to leave
by August 1983, and the proposed project envisages a three-year replacement.
The appointment of a Senior Project Adviser for three years, also financed
under the First Project, to work on project selection and preparation of a
forthcoming Investment Plan, will enable the Senior Economic Adviser to
concentrate on policy issues. In view of the importance of careful investment
programming under present and prospective conditions of financial stringency,
an investment programmer will be recruited for two years to work on a com-
prehensive system of investment recording/programming, to assist in debt
management, and to follow up on the implementation of a system of monthly
macro-economic indicators. The expanded team in the Ministry of Plan will
necessitate additional local junior economists and secretarial support, for
whom salary supplements equivalent to about 25 percent of base salary are
foreseen. While the Government will pay for base salaries, the salary supple-
ments would be paid by the Association. Given the financial difficulties of
the Government, it would be hard to find competent and motivated staff without
offering a salary supplement. The project would in addition provide for local
travel and subsistence costs for experts, consultants, and counterparts. The
resident experts would report directly to the Minister of Plan.
37.       The assistance foreseen to the Ministry of Rural Development would
be directed to: i) a new planning unit, and ii) a new research coordination
unit for applied agricultural research. These units would be established by
March 31, 1983 (Section 3.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
planning unit would be responsible for: a) formulating a long-term strategy
of rural development, b) studying problems and prospects for the sector as a
whole, c) preparing projects, and d) monitoring and evaluation. The project
would provide for an expert in agricultural planning over 24 months, consul-
tants for a total of 12 months, supplies and vehicles, salary supplements and
fellowships for counterparts. Before implementation, the fellowship program
would be reviewed by the Association. The research coordination unit would be
responsible for: a) improving the coordination between research programs
scattered throughout Togo; and b) intensifying contacts with international
organizations doing research on technical problems similar to those prevailing
in Togo. The project would provide for a research coordinator for 18 months,
consultants for a total of 6 months, supplies, and salary supplements for
counterparts. The resident experts would report to the Director of Rural
Development.



- 11 -
38.       The assistance foreseen to the Ministry of Industry and State
Enterprises would consist of the provision of short- and medium-term expa-
triate expertise to enable the Ministry to elaborate and implement an appro-
priate Government policy with respect to state enterprises, characterized by
clear objectives, priorities and performance criteria. The project would
provide for: a) a consultant for 3 months to introduce analytical accounting,
b) a resident expert for 14 months to assist in defining performance criteria
and in guiding analytical studies of enterprises not already examined, and
c) a resident expert for 19 months to assist in preparing, introducing, and
implementing program-contracts, initially for a small manageable sample of
representative state enterprises, and subsequently for all state enterprises
whose operations and objectives make program-contracts a useful instrument
for guidance and control. Each expert, and the consultant, would work closely
with a team of local counterparts drawn from the staff of the Ministry, and,
where relevant, from other ministries and key state enterprises. The resident
experts would report directly to the Minister of Industry and State Enterprises.
39.       In order to enable the Government to meet a wide variety of tech-
nical assistance needs (some of which cannot be foreseen far in advance), the
proposed project provides for a significant short-term consultants' budget
(US$1.1 million equivalent). This budget would be used for, inter alia,
preparation and review of a future investment plan, economic studies of
private sector incentives in industry, elaboration of a system of monthly
macro-economic indicators, and various analyses related to the implementation
of national policies for economic adjustment and financial stabilization.
Overall, the consultants would carry out high-priority studies defined by
the Minister of Plan, which would be selected in accordance with criteria
agreed upon between the Government and the Association; these criteria
concern, primarily, relevance, benefits to be derived, and promotion of
production and exports in key sectors (Section 3.03 of draft Development
Credit Agreement).
40.       Togolese counterparts, with qualifications acceptable to the Associa-
tion, would be employed to work closely with the resident experts (Section
3.02(c)) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Salary supplements
and the cost of office equipment and supplies are included in the project, as
are transport costs for survey work in the Ministry of Rural Development.
Responsibility for execution of each part of the project rests with the
Ministry concerned. However, overall responsibility for project execution
remains with the Ministry of Plan.
Project Cost and Financing
a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
41.       The cost, net of taxes, of the proposed Second Technical Assistance
Project is estimated at US$3.8 million, including a foreign exchange component
of about 67 percent. The proposed IDA contribution of SDR3.1 million (US$3.5
million equivalent) would cover the entire foreign cost element and 76 percent
of local costs. IDA financing of this proportion of local costs is justified
by the Government's difficult financial situation. The Government would con-
tribute $0.3 million equivalent in the form of base salaries of counterparts,
rental of office space, and costs of communications. Contingencies of about
15 percent have been included based on expected annual inflation rates of 8



12 -
percent in 1982, 8 percent in 1983 and 7.5 percent in 1984. The cost of
consultants is estimated at US$12,000 per man-month, including salaries,
housing and other allowances, travel and cost of recruitment.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       The selection, qualifications, experience and terms of employment
for all resident experts and consultants would be subject to approval by the
Association (Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
entire cost of the resident experts would be financed out of the proceeds of
the Credit. Separate accounts would be maintained by the Government for all
project activities, and would be audited each year by auditors acceptable to
the Association. All disbursements from the Credit account would be fully
documented except for salary supplements, which would be disbursed against
certified statements of expenditure. The total amount of disbursements
against statements of expenditure is expected to be about US$33,000. Copies
of supporting documentation would be held by the Borrower and made available
for review by IDA supervision missions. Statements of expenditure would be
audited by independent auditors. Equipment and office supplies (totalling
US$60,000) would be procured according to local procedures, satisfactory to
the Association.
43.       Proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed against:
i)   100 percent of the total cost of the resident experts, short-
term consultants, and fellowships, SDR 2,600,000 (US$2,937,000
equivalent); and
ii)   100 percent of the total cost of office equipment and supplies,
salary supplements to counterparts and secretaries, and vehicles,
SDR 93,000 (US$105,000 equivalent).
SDR407,000 would remain unallocated (US$460,000 equivalent).
Benefits and Risks
44.       The benefits that would accrue to Togo under the proposed Second
Technical Assistance Project would be an increased capacity to conceive and
implement sound, comprehensive, and consistent macro-economic policies, and to
pursue adjustment policies in crucial areas such as rural development, state
enterprises, and public investment programming. In addition, the project would
allow for a continuation and an expansion of the technical assistance effort
begun by the first project.  The main risks of the project derive from the                a
difficulties in finding expatriate personnel who are both highly qualified and
sufficiently adaptable to gain and retain the confidence of the Government,
without which the effectiveness of the resident experts would be greatly
reduced. The Government's awareness of the need for technical assistance and
the need for economic adjustment and financial stabilization measures is
reflected in its support for the first project, and in its firm commitment to
the technical assistance effort.

E.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 638    Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5 million;
Credit of June 16, 1976; Effectiveness Date: October 26,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The closing date of this credit has been postponed from December 31,
1981 to December 31, 1982. Applied research regarding food crops and coconuts,
seed multiplication, monitoring and consultants to study the potential of the
region will continue to be financed until the end of 1982, in an amount of
$240,000. Following a request from the Government, the remaining part of the
credit ($1.7 million) was cancelled in March 1982.
Credit No. 693    Third Highway Project; US$10.0 million; Credit of April 1, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982.
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision of
technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance, and
pre-investment studies for a follow-up project. Implementation of the project
has been satisfactory and is now practically complete. The implementation of
the technical assistance component has been slower than expected. Road mainte-
nance, however, has recently begun to suffer from insufficient Government
funding.
Credit No. 741    Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14.0 million;
Credit of October 5, 1977; Effectiveness Date: March 17, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The goals of the project are to increase the production of cotton from
7,000 tons to 29,000 tons and of food crops grown in rotation with cotton from
40,000 tons to 50,000 tons; and to strengthen SOTOCO, the agency in charge of
the project. Progress has been satisfactory. Over 445000 farmers are now
involved with the project. Cotton production averaged 21,000 tons in the third
and fourth years of the project and the area planted to improved food crops has
reached 23,000 ha.  The feeder roads development program and seed multiplication
components of the project are progressing well, and both the extension service
and the general and financial management have improved considerably. A follow-
up project is under preparation.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the progress
of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems and
actions being taken to remedy them. They should be read with the under-
standing that they do not present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 810    Feeder Roads Project; US$5.8 million; Credit of June 28, 1978;
Effectiveness Date: March 2, 1979; Closing Date. June 30, 1983.
The project consists of a four-year program for the improvement and
maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, technical assistance to establish
a Feeder Roads Unit in charge of the program, and consultant services to study a
follow-up feeder roads program. The equipment provided to the Feeder Roads Unit
is now fully operational. By the end of November 1981, 440 km of feeder roads
had been improved. However, since November 1981 the program has been slowing
down due to the lack of government counterpart funds. Operations for which
the Ministry of Public Works is responsible have been stopped due to a lack of
credit to buy spare parts and fuel.
.
Credit No. 930    Technical Assistance Project; US$2.2 million; Credit of June 22,
1979; Effectiveness Date: October 23, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The project provides for two advisers in the Ministry of Planning for
a three-year period each and for short-term consultants to carry out specific
project-related and macroeconomic studies. The first adviser is to counsel on
general economic and public finance questions, while the second adviser is to
assist in selecting major new investments and in finding ways of improving
existing large projects. The assignment of the first adviser has been extended
for a fourth year until August 1983. A three-year replacement is scheduled to
be financed under the proposed credit. The second adviser will begin his
assignment in September 1982.
Credit No. 945    Second Cocoa and Coffee Development Project; US$14.0 million;
Credit of July 23, 1979; Effectiveness Date: July 11, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project is a continuation of the First Coffee/Cocoa Project. It
provides for the planting and maintenance of a further 7,500 ha of coffee and
4,000 ha of cocoa and services, applied research, associated food crop devel-
opment, and construction of 300 km of feeder roads. Coffee planting is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. The cocoa program has fallen far behind appraisal
targets and there appears to be a general problem of lack of farmers' interest.
These problems will be examined shortly by a specialist in cocoa cultivation.
Another problem facing the project is the continued poor rate of medium-term
credit recovery from participating farmers. New means for facilitating credit
recovery at the marketing stage are being examined.
Credit No. 969    Project Preparation Credit to Banque Ouest Africaine de Develop-
pement; US$3.0 million; Credit of January 25, 1980; Effective-
ness Date: April 29, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The objective of the project is to finance feasibility and detailed
engineering studies by external consultants of regional development projects,
which a priori have a high probability of success. The project is proceeding
satisfactorily.

Credit No. 1018    First Education Project; US$11.0 million; Credit of
September 15, 1980; Effectiveness Date: January 27, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Construction of training facilities is progressing satisfactorily.
Three of the four project institutions are expected to become operational dur-
ing the last quarter of 1982, and the fourth by May 1983. Project management
continues to perform well, but should focus on the timely implementation of
the educational programs, the institutional budget, and the technical assis-
tance. Despite an initial lag in disbursements, the project is expected to
be completed on schedule.
Credit No. 1139   Fourth Highway Project; US$20.0 million; Credit of October 28,
1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
This project provides for a three-year training program for road
maintenance personnel; procurement of road maintenance equipment and spare
parts; pavement of 157 km of road; pre-investment studies for 57 km of road;
and technical assistance to improve transport planning and coordination, as
well as railway operations. This credit has not yet been declared effective.
Credit No. 1169   Phosphate Fertilizer Engineering Project; US$5.7 million;
Credit of October 28, 1981; Effectiveness Date: May 21, 1982;
Closing Date: August 31, 1983.
The purpose of this project is to determine the technical and
economic viability of developing a phosphate fertilizer project to manufacture
for export phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers from the Dagbati deposits
and from recovered slimes.
Credit No. 1190   Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project; US$2.0
million; Credit of January 21, 1982; Closing Date: December
31, 1983
This project, a joint undertaking involving Togo and Benin, would
aim at helping the two Governments complete preparations for the Nangbeto
hydro-electric project, assist in improving planning in the power sectors of
both countries, provide assistance in institution-building, and strengthen
accounting procedures. The Credit has not yet been declared effective.
