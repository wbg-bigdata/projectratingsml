MAHARASHTRA RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL
AND SANITATION PROJECT 11
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS STUDY
EXCUTIVE SUMMARY
Preamble
Maharashltra is the first state in the country to adopt the holistic reforms approach to
cover entire State in the Reform Process and approached the World Bank for
assistance for 26 districts of Maharashtra, excluding the districts covered under GOI
and KfW project based on similar reforms practices. With the objective of
strengthening the democratic process of decentralization planning, and participatory
decision making and development at grass root level, GOM proposes to promote
demand responsive approach with active involvement and participation of PRI and
beneficiaiy communities through all stages of the project implementation and its
sustained operation and maintenance will be the key features of the proposed
project
Project Setting
The project will assist Government of Maharashtra in improving the quality of life in
rural areas by raising the service standards of environment and sanitation. The
project will be a major step towards scaling up reformns statewide. These objectives
will be achieved through a) adopting a Demand responsive approach and use of
participatory process for delivery of sustainable service to project communities
b) Phased implementation of appropriate policy and institutional reforms for
changing the role of government from provider to facilitator c) Establishing
financial viability and sustainability of rural water supply and sanitation services;
and d) Promoting integrated resource management; improving environment and
hygiene behavioral changes.
Project Area
GOM has taken the policy decision to implement the Sector Reform Program
state,wide. The Bank investment support will be for the entire State except the
districts already covered under KfW and GOIs sector reform program) It is
estimated that project would cover about 3750 Gram Panchayats in the first phase
which will be one in a series of such phases and the number of which will depend
upon the commitment of Government to reforms and the demand generated. It will
be a continuous partnership between the World Bank and the State government in
their joint efforts to ensure sustainiable community owned development.
Project Components
Components of the Maharaslhtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project 11 are:
1. Community Development
The successful outcome of the proposed project depends on a participatory planning
process, effective community organization and development of skills of Village
Water Supply and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) and the GP. This includes



i Capacity building of users group/Women group/VWSC/GP/CBOs in social
technical and management aspects of planning, implementation and operation of
RWSS infrastructure in a sustainable manner
i. Women empowerment fumd that would enhance participation of women in the
project leading to their social and economic empowerment. Two major areas to be
looked into are
a. Development of skills of women especially poor women in technical and
managerial / leadership qualities.
b. Empowennent find to help women to improve livelihoods and link them to
networks of women and federations Enterprise training skills will be
imparted to enhance their household income.
2. Water Supply
This includes
o  Rehabilitation/ rejuvenation of the sources/ up-gradation of infrastructure for
existing water supply schemes by improving their technical sustainability.
o  Undertake ground -water recharge measures for strengthening/augmentation of
ground water sources and rainwater harvesting
o Suitable options for quality affected sources i e. fluoride, salinity, nitrate and
Iron.
o  New drinking water supply schemes in scarcity affected areas; tanker fed
villages and wvhere availability of water per capita is less than 10 LPCD i.e.
villages not covered.
o School water supply
3. Sanitation
This component compfises:
o  Creating awareness and IEC for construction of household latrines and
community.
o School sanitation,
o Women sanitation complexes,
o Garbage and compost pits
o Drainage and road improvement in the village
4. RWS Sector Strengthening Program Component
The project will be implemented over a period of six years (2003-2009). All the
physical activities are planned to start and complete during first five years and the
last year will focus on consolidation issues.
Govemment of Maharashtra has envisaged a long-term partnership between the
State and the World Bank, which would be implemented in a phased manner
synchronizing with reformns In the first phase an investment of approximately
Rs 1000 crores (nearly 200 million US Dollar) is estimated of which 10% would be
contributed by the beneficiaries. In addition, 100 % O&M cost has to be contributed
by the beneficiaries. Activities taken up under the pilot project from May 2002
onward till signing of the Project would be eligible for retroactive finance.

Baseline Environmental Status
Location
Maharashtra State with a geographical area of 307713 sq km  compnses of 35
distncts and 353 talukas (taluka and block are co-terminus in the State) Out of
these 2 distncts (MuLmbai and Mumbai Sub-Urban) are completely urban where as
remaining 33 distncts are rural / semi-urban There are 336 cities and towns out of
whichi 40 have population more than 100,000. There are 40785 villages and 45528
hamlets (also termed as Wadi, Vastl or Pada). Population of the State is 96.7
milion (2001) of which 41 million is urban and 55 7 million rural.
Land Use
Maharashtra is mainly an agriculture State with 82% of rural population relying on
agnculture, though in the recent past there is migration of 2% population from rural
to urban areas. Out of total area of 30.77 million ha 22.5 million ha (73%) is
cultivable and 5.3 million ha (17.6%) is under forest Average annual agriculture
productivity of the cultivable land is Rs. 16000 per ha.
Rainfall
State experiences extremes of rainfall ranging from 3000 mm in the Konkan region
to less than 500 mm in central parts of State. About one third area of the State falls
in a rain shadow zone Konkan region receives more than 3000-mm rainfall in the
Ghat areas and 2500 mm in the plains.
Rainfall decreases rapidly towards eastern slopes and plateau areas where it is less
than 500 mm It again gains towards further east in Marathwada and Vidharbha
region and is up to 1250 mm. Thus, the central part of the State always reels under
drought Variability of rainfall over the State is generally high ranging from 20 to 35
%, except in coastal areas where it is less than 20%. Low rainfall and its high
variability causes drought There are 89 talukas in the State that is chronically
drought affected of which 65 are included in the project area.
Soils
Soils in Maharashtra are mainly Vertisols (Black Cotton soils) in almost all districts
except in Konkan and in parts of Chandrapur where it is mainly Alfisol and partly
Vertisol type Texture and Thickness of soil directly controls rainfall infiltration and
moisture holding capacity which are relevant to water availability and agriculture.
Soils in the State are fuirther classified into Coarse shallow, Medium Black, Deep
Black, Latentic and Coastal Alluvial.
Groundwater
Realizing the importance of groLndwater for agriculture and drinking water,
Government of Maharashtra established a separate Directorate of Groundwater
Surveys and Development Agency in 1972, as a nodal agency for groundwater
planning and development GSDA has been estimating groundwater potential in the
iii



State from time to time. GSDA has divided the State into 1505 group watersheds for
groundwater assessment and development planning. Norms for groundwater
estimation are discussed and finalized at National level by the Central Groundwater
Board, Ministr) of Water Resources, Government of India and are refined
penodically as more research and field data flows in.
Groundwater Estimation Committee constituted by GOI in 1997 recomnmended new
methodology for groundwater estimation GSDA further subdivided the 1505 group
watersheds into 2415 sub units based on irrigated and non-irrigated areas as per
GEC (1997) and estimated the potential. The gross replenishable groundwater
recharge is 28751.30 MCM.
Groundwater Extraction
Groundwater extraction structures are through open dug wells bore wells and dug-
cum bore wells. As per the minor irrigation census carried out by the State, there are
20,00,000 irrigation wells of which 12,00,000 are installed with mechanical
pumping device. Average extracton from an open well varies between 8000 m3 and
12000 m3 per year. Total extraction of groLndwater is estimated at 7768.91 MCM
including 7095.87 MCM for irrigaton and 673.04 MCM for drinking which is 36 %
percentage of the utilizable recharge Table 1.

Impact of Sugarcane Irrigation
About 1 8.8% of the total irmgated area is under sugarcane. As per prevailing
irrigation practices for sugarcane irrigation, supplementary water requirements are
195 cm against actual consumptive use of 160 cms. There are 77 operating sugar
factories in the project area each with a crushing capacity of 1250 to 5000 tons per
day. In addition 41 new factones are umder erection and proposals for 142 new
factories are pending for licensing. Area under sugarcane in 26 project districts is
349600 ha Concentration of sugarcane and its excessive irrigation in Kolhapur,
Sangli, Satara, Nashik, Latur, Beed, Osmanabad and Solapur has caused over
extraction of ground water, which is manifested in progressively decline of water
table and deterioration of groundwater quality affecting drinking water supplies.
Status of Rural Water Supply
Present position of water supply
As on April 2002, 64.3 % of the villages and 72 3 % of the hamlets are successfully
provided with clean and potable quality of water,at the rate of 40 LPCD perennially
through a public drinking water source/system based on groundwater. The position
of the coverage is shown at Table 4.

Ground water Quality
Quality of groundwater in the State is generally good and potable. However, there
are hot spots where concentration of Fluoride, NO3, Iron, and salinity is high.
Fluoride
Chemical analysis of water samples from wells and bore wells by GSDA, CGWB
and PHD shows that in project area, ground water in parts of 52 talukas in 17
districts has higher concentration of fluoride than permissible limits and most of the
affected areas are in Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Satara, Beed, and Solapur districts.
Concentration of fluoride is more in deeper aquifers tapped by bore wells than at
shallow depths.
Nitrate
High concentration of Nitrate in groundwater is reported mainly in Sangli, Solapur,
Satara, Nagpur, Yavatmal, Bhandara, Beed, Osmanabad, Thane and Parbhani
districts where large areas are irrigated under paddy, sugarcane banana, cotton,
orange and grape. Excess chemical fertilizer application is the major source of
Nitrate contamination. High concentration of nitrate in groundwater at shallow
depths is due to contamination from untreated sewage, composting close to the water
supply source.
Salinity
Salinity in groundwater is observed in 3 different areas of Maharashtra
i   Tapi-Purna river alluvium,
ii.  Water logged areas in the canal command
iii.  Coastal areas
Groundwater in the areas covering southern parts of Puma alluvium in Amravati
(Daryapur, parts of Achalpur and Anjangaon talukas) Akola (parts of Akot, Akola,
Murtizapur and Telhara taluka), Buldhana (Nandura, Khamgaon and Mehkar
talukas) have high salinity, making it, unfit for drinking purpose For these villages,
drinking water is supplied from surface water sources.
Arsenic
Chemical analysis of water sample from different drinking water sources tested
during April - May 2001 at the chemical laboratory of Indian Bureau of Mines,
Nagpur showed presence of Arsenic in water samples from 12 villages in Hingana
and Ramtek talukas of Nagpur districts and 11 villages from Gadchiroli, Kurkheda
and Wadasa talukas of Gadchiroli districts. Concentration of Arsenic was found to
be high in few cases. Alarmed by this, water samples from same sources were
analyzed at the laboratory of Public Health Dept. during July 2002 which showed
only traces of Arsenic much below permissible limit It was necessary to revalidate
the water quality analysis for Arsenic at an independent qualified laboratory. This



has since been done by the Radiant laboratory to whom the work was assigned. The
water quality test results for 13 samples from Nagpur district shows that the Arsenic
concentration in drinking water sources is much below the permissible limits.
Iron
High concentration of iron is present in groundwater in Ratnagiri, Chandrapur,
Sindhudurg, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Solapur, Nagpur, and Kolhapur districts due to
high iron mineral in the geological formations.
Bacteriological Contamination
Sampling of drinking water sources by PHD across the State shows that large
number of sources is contaminated and cause health hazards. Reports from PHD also
show that on an average 1.2 million (1.2%) are affected every year and about 350
people die of bacteriological contamination of drinking water. However, the trend
analysis of attacks and deaths due to water borne diseases between 1997 and 2002
indicate progressive decline This is due to availability of clean drinking water and
health services provided by GOM under various programs.
Sanitation and Hygiene
Presently out of 1 10 lakh rural families about 24.6 lakhs have been provided latrines
by GOM under different programs. Thus the current coverage is about 22.5%. But t
only about 11.5% of the families in the rural areas are using their own latrines and
others continue to practice open defecation. This project therefore, aims at achieving
zero open defecation in rural Maharashtra. Out of 53171 primary schools 27% haye
sanitary facilities.
Use of Contaminated Drinking Water
Where ground water is contaminated or polluted, GOM's first priority is to find new
sources with good quality water to meet the demand. Second priority is to provide
limited quantity of good water for drinking and use poor quality water for other
purposes like batling, washing etc Where it is difficult to identify and create a fresh
water source, preference would be for rainwater harvesting and roof top rain water
harvesting.
Policy, Legal And Administrative Framework
Constitution of India enjoins the States to take measures to protect and improve the
environment and to safeguard the natural resources including fauna and flora.
Article 51 (g) of the constitution makes it ftmdamental duty of the individual citizen
to protect and improve the environment.
National Water Policy
Recognizing that water is a primary precious natural resource and a basic human
need, the policy provides for following guidelines in planning and operation of water
ix



resource project, wlhich are of relevance to the Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project
o Water is a scarce and precious national resource to be planned, developed and
conserved as such and on an integrated and environmentally sound basis,
keeping in view the needs of the State
o Water resources development project should be as far as possible planned and
developed as a multipurpose project. Provision of drinking water should be a
primary consideration.
o In the planning implementation and operation of the project the preservation of
quality of environment and the ecological balance should be primary
consideration
o In the planning and operation of the system, water allocation should be broadly
as following priority
o Drinking water
o Irrigation
o Hydro power
o Navigation
o Industrial and other use.
Thus drinking water has first priority in any water resources development project
and efforts would be to achieve this.
Legal Framework
Ministry of Environment and Forest is the nodal agency at National level, which
monitors the environmental impact of different projects. The provisions in the
following Acts ensure protection of environment
Forest (Conservation) Act (1930)
Wild Life Protection Act (1 972)
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974
Air (Prevention and Control) Act 1981
Environment (Protection) Act 1986
The Public Liability Insurance Act 1991
State Level Provisions
Government of Maharashtra has passed followmg Acts dealing with protection of
Environment and natural resources.
o Maharashtra Act XVI of 1970 viz. Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution
Act 1969
o  Maharashtra Act XLVIII of 1976 viz. Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage
Board Act 1976 (as amended twice).
o  73rd Amendment to the constitution decentralization of powers to the Rural
Local Bodies.
Other important statutes and Acts related to water supply and sanitation sector in
Maharashtra are:

Administrative Framework
Framework for Drinking Water Supply
Government of Maharashtra has been implementing drinking water supply schemes
under various programs like Accelerated Rural Water supply Program, Minimum
Needs Program, Rajiv Gandhi Dnnking Water Mission. During ninth five-year plan
period, approach to drinking water programs was modified to include
• Control on over extraction of Ground water
* More funds for repairs and rehabilitation
* Increase in people's participation
* Reserve 20% fumds for states promoting Sector Reforms
Feedback from the monitoring of the current programs shows that the traditional
supply-driven approach to water supply is not cost-effective, is not capable of giving
sustainable solution, and that a demand-driven approach to sanitation is necessary if
visible, sustained and meaningful success is to be achieved. The challenge is to
provide a program design that would mainstream such an approach in a sustainable
way.
GOM Initiatives from Year 2000
Learning from the expenence of the implementation of massive toilet program and
the new demand driven policy of Government of India, the state government
currently has adopted a new policy and new program, in the year 2000 named as
'Sant Gadge Baba Clean (SGBC) Village Sanitation Campaign all over the state'.
The SGBC has since gained momentum and has grown in strength and has now
become a leading example for other development programs.
xi



Sant Gadge Baba Campaign (SGBC)
The Sant Gadge Baba Campaign is not a program or scheme but is a campaign to
educate and motivate rural communities. Villages participate in the competition and
implement various specified works that lead to an environmentally clean village.
The village through their own resources and labour undertakes all the works. The
villages are then evaluated by independent committees on the specified criteria and
other aspects like equity, innovations etc. The total award money offered by the
GOM at all levels is about 6.6 crores every year.
The major lessons emerging from the initial stages of this campaign are:
o Communities (led by the Gram Panchyats) can do better when 'truly enabled'
o Sanitation drives need 'community focus'
o Incentives for self-action rather than direct subside, prompt people to act.
Gadge Baba Campaign is an innovative program with a paradigm shift for
implementation of village level development program evolving new principle of
"People gnitiate Government Participates"
Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC)
Recognizing the urgent need to increase the effectiveness of sanitation facilities, the
Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) under the Restructured Centrally Sponsored Rural
Sanitation Program was launched in by the Central Government in 1999. The
campaign has now been integrated with the sector reform program in water supply.
Maharashtra has 13 TSC districts. This program correctly recognizes the importance
of a demand-driven approach with a greater emphasis on household involvement
than on the element of subsidy. The program not only provides funds for awareness
building (IEC) activities but also a sustainable and replicable approach for effective
utilization of these funds remains elusive. The TSC is in the early stages of
implementation and no major activities have been undertaken under this program.
The SGBC and the TSC are the current environmental sanitation related programs in
the State.
Key Principles for Achieving Total Sanitation
The proposed strategy is based on the following key principles:
o A paradigm shift in the approach to sanitation promotion, from construction of
latrines to a focus on behavioral change leading to the elimination of open
defecation.
o A shift in focus from targeting individuals and households to targeting the
community.
o  Related to this, the shift from individual construction subsidies to community
rewards.
o Greater emphasis on personal hygiene and environmental sanitation as essential
prerequisites for achieving Total Sanitation.
o A shift in the responsibility for implementation and scale up from the
Central/State Government to lower tiers of Government.
The GOM has developed this new strategy during the last quarter of year 2002 and
decided to field test the same in selected districts (Ahmednagar and Nanded, both
having TSC grants). Based on the lessons emerging from the field test, the strategy
would be refined and made applicable to all the districts in the sate

GOM's Approach under the Proposed Project
It is expected that this new strategy would replace the current TSC format and would
run in parallel to the Sant Gadge Baba Campaign. Both the new strategy and SGBC
compliment each other well and the new strategy is almost a concentrated sub-set of
the SGBC. As explained in thc objectives, the open defecation by human beings is
the single largest component that influences the rural living environment across the
state Other issues like solid waste, liquid waste etc affect the environrment only in
the larger and denser settlements and are not a universal problem like the open
human defecation. The new strategy would encourage and facilitate all rural
communities to focus on elimination of 100% open defecation and adoption of
hygiene practices in a given settlement through their own efforts, in a way they want
to An underlying assumption is that those comrmunities that would solve their open
defecation aspects would also be motivated to solve the other environmental
sanitation aspects through their own collective action.
Public Consultations
Public consultations were held in 4 villages from each of the 5 districts. A minimum
of 11 and maximum of 80 people attended each consultation In addition one more
consultation meeting was held in Nagpur district to obtain people's response and
suggestions to GOM's proposed project. The participants included villagers from all
sections, men and women, poor and rich, farmers and land less, self employed and
unemployed and old as well as young. Villagers from satellite hamlets and Vasties
were invited and attended the Consultation meetings. All villagers put forth their
views and expressed their opinion on all aspects like drinking water supply,
sanitation, health, hygiene, environment, school sanitation and peoples' contribution
towards capital and O&M cost. During the consultation meetings various issues
related to quantity and quality of drinking water, as well as sanitation, and hygiene
were discussed. Following inferences have been drawn based on the People's views.
*  Acute scarcity of water in summer months
* In water scarce season consumption water decreases by] 5 to 20 percent due to
short supply
* About 2 to 5 hours are spent on fetching drinking water
• Space constrains and lack of water supply are the major factors contributing to
low
* house hold latnne coverage
* Indiscriminate dumping of solid waste due to absence of compost pits
* Reoccurrence of Diarrhea , Cholera and Gastro.cases
*  Improper drainage system for discharging waste water
*  House hold who do not have latrne facility use open defecation and very few
use public toilets.
Notwithstanding these constraints the consultation meets revealed that there is
willingness amongst the villagers to participate in the program for improving the
water supply, sanitation and environmnental conditions, if their consensus opinions
are considered and implemented. It also revealed that contribution towards capital
and O&M cost and availability of land would not be a bottleneck if people are
involved in the project design and implementation

Hot Spots and lIssues
From the review of the baseline environmental data for the project district and the
issues that emerge during public consultations reveal that there are difficult situation
where special action plans are necessary to manage specific problems that have
spatial and temporal applications Thcse hot spots relate to groundwater quantity,
quality, sanitation, hygiene and environment.
Water Quantity issues
Over exploited and Critical Areas
Review of groundwater assessment by GSDA and CGWB indicate that as of March
2001, groundwater is over exploited in 109 watcrshed units in 15 out of 26 districts
covered in the project. Groundwater availability for water supply schemes in over
exploited/critical watershed units is at risk unless recharge measures are taken.
Declining Water Levels
Water table monitoring data for 10 years indicate that in 67 talukas water table are
progressively declining at times at an alarming rate of 0.57 m per year.
Over extraction of ground water and declining water levels have affected availability
and sustainability of grotmdwater for drinking water supply schemes.
Trend Analysis
Projections for water availability and water level behavior for the next 1 0 years
based on the available data show that if the present situation continues
i. An additional 107 watershed units, which are presently in safe category, would
cross over to critical or over exploited category where availability of
groundwater for drinking water supply schemes may not be adequate or not
available.
ii. Water table would progressively decline at a much faster rate than at present in
additional 168 watershed units that might affects the existing hand pumps and
bore wells.
Water Quality Issues
Fluoride
In parts of 56 taluks in 18 districts concentration of fluoride in groundwater in more
than permissible limit ranging between 1.5 ppm and over 15 ppm mainly because of
geological formations. Use of groundwater with high concentration of fluoride has
already caused health hazards like fluorosis, mottled teeth etc.
Nitrate
In parts of about 61 talukas in 18 districts included in the project, groundwater is
contaminated with high concentration of nitrate.  In these areas irrigation intensity
xiv



and fertilizer application are high whicli could be the possible reason for nitrate
contamination
Iron
In 10 districts covered mainly by laterite and crystalline fomiations groundwater is
contaminated with highl concentration of iron above I ppm except in case of Wardha
where it is due to local conditions
Salinity
Groundwater is saline with high TDS of more than 2000 ppm in parts of 60 talukas
in 19 districts  High salinity is because of  (a) Natural reasons as in Puma river
basin (b) Coastal area of Thane/Ratnagirl/Sindlidurg. (c) Induced salinity because of
excessive irnigation.
Districtwise Position
Above observations with regard to water quantity and water quality indicate that
some districts water quality problem is more pronounced while m some districts
water quality issues are more important . District wise position of water quality and
water quantity issues is given in Table 5 below

Source Data from GSDA, CGWB, WSSD, NEERI, PHD
It is evident that the major Hot Spot districts from both groundwater quantity and
quality considerations are Nagpur, Jalgaon, Beed, Sangli,Satara, Solapur,
NashikThane, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Yavatmal and Chandrapur.
Hygiene and Environmental Sanitation
Only 22.4% households have access to latnnes. Only 69% schools in rural areas
have urinals and 5% schools have toilets. In most of the villages disposal of sullage,
waste water, cattle dung is improper causing sanitation problem. Thus considering
current situation entire project area could be considered as hot spot.
Analysis of Alternatives
Government of Maharashtra is implementing various rural water supply programs
such as Minirnum Needs Program, ARWSP, PMGY. In addition rural water supply
schemes are also implemented under KfW, DFID Projects. Most of these programs
are supply driven except under KFW.
Out of 86313 villages and hamlets, 59140 villages and hamlets are fully covered
with adequate source of drinking water supply at 40 LPCD. 18753 villages and
hamlets are partially covered where source created is not adequate and needs
strengthening. Remaining 8420 villages and hamlets are not covered and do not have
safe drinking water source. This project is trying to address drinking water supply
needs of 3750 villages/hamlets.
In such of those villages where the quality of drinking water supply is not potable
due to high concentration of fluoride, salinity and nitrate, GOM. has planned to
provide fresh drinking water supply from alternate sources, or promote dual use of
fresh and poor quality water.
Besides above mentioned programs, GOM. is also implementing rural water supply
scheme under Swajal dhara program recently launched by GOI. Above altematives
indicate that all the available alternatives are not sufficient to meet the needs of the
rural commmnities in the 26 districts. Secondly, these sources of funding are directed
at select villages and do not encourage any institutional building for effectively
implementing reform agenda of the state. The second RWSS project addresses these
issues and contemplates support for capacity building. It is implied that the project if
implemented will lead to maximurm health benefits to rural population. The major
anticipated environmental issues as a result of project interventions are addressed
and mitigatory measures are also integrated m the proposed project design. The
xv,



project is expected to bring about a holistic improvement in the quality of life
leading to "prospenty"
Besides the decentralized democratic process imbibed in the project objectives
would enable the stake holders inparticipatory decision making process and women
participation in VWSC would empower women in rural areas.. The RWSS II Project
also aims to address resource sustainability issues which would be attempted
thirough integrated water resource management by Aquifer Management Groups.
Another important aspect envisaged in the RWSS II Project is that it integrates and
emphasizes on personal hygiene and environmental sanitation, besides drinking
water and sanitation This would be achieved through intense IEC program, which
would bring behavior changes. Thus the proposed project is different from other
ongoing project implemented currenitly and it would bring positive results in sector
reforms.
The Second RWSS Project encompasses all these issues and would bring positive
results.
Impact Identification and Analysis
The potential environmental impacts consequent to the project interventions durng
different phases have been identified and categorized into positive and negative and
are presented in a matrix form. The analysis indicates overall impact of the project
is positive resulting in improving health and environment of the people in project
area. There are no negative impacts of the project
Strategies and Technology Options
Considering the nature, type and seventy of the problems in hot spot areas, a set of
strategies are evolved to addressed various quantity quality hygiene and
environmental sanitation issues. A multi prong strategy action plan is required to
tackle problems and suggest a range of technology options for location specific
situation in the project area.
Strategies for Water Quantity issues
* Rejuvenation and rehabilitation of existing sources
* Augment groundwater recharge through conventional measures like percolation
tanks, weirs, check dams, bandhara etc
* Improve yield of drinking water wells by unconventional measures like
hydrofracturing, bore hole blasting, fracture cement sealing etc
* Rainwater harvesting and roof top rain water harnessing
* Create supplementary source
*  Promote aquifer management groups and educate communities in total water
resources management
* Regular monitoring of ground water
Strategies for Water Quality Issues
* Provide drinking water from alternate sources
* Preference to shallow open wells where quality of ground water is comparatively
good than from deep bore wells

o  continuous chlorination of water supply to maintain a minimum  residual
concentration at each stand post and individual connection.
o  Mixing contaminated water with fresh water to lower the concentration of
fluoride, nitrate, iron and salinity
o  Provide household or community treatment system
o  Continuous water quality monitoring mechanism
o  continuous IEC programs
Water Quality Monitoring Strategy
The water quality monitoring in rural areas is carried out through a strategy
involving following four factors.
I) Water Quality Control:  By the agency responsible for providing water.
(Water Supply & Sanitation Department)
2) Water quality:        By the agency responsible for mitigating the effect
Surveillance         of surveillance bad water quality
(Public Health Department)
3) Water Quality Survey:  Periodically by all the agencies involved
4) Management Information  By the coordinating authority
Systemn
Monitoring of Pure Water Supply and Epidemic Control
i At district level, The Chief Executive Officer and District Water supply Officer
are responsible for such health and water quality survey.
Ii .The Divisional Commissioner should monitor at the Divisional level, water
quality surveys and shall send a consolidated report to the state govemnment eveTy
month.
In case of any epidemic, Secretary (Health), Secretary (Water supply and sanitation
dept.), Director General (health) shall review the situation and report to the Chief
Secretary regarding implementation of appropriate measures for the control of
epidemic.
Management Information System
It is very important that the factual information of the water quality monitoring work
at every level is made available in the prescribed formats to the appropriate authority
for taking mitigating and remedial measures. This facilitates taking important
decisions on future planning of work, works to be taken up urgently, removing of
deficiencies experienced, monitoring and co-ordination of work of different
departments, making financial provisions etc. The organizational flow chart for the
water quality testing, surveillance and for information management is prepared and
given in the report

Household Sanitation
The strategy is to stop open defecation include
*  Community based incentive for constructon of toilets
o Effective IEC through Sant Gadgebaba campaign
e Propagate safe and low cost technology options for poor stake holders
* Inclusion of more districts in Total Sanitation Campaign program
Environmental Sanitation
This includes
I. provide sullage and storm drains with proper disposals
2 insist on individual/household compost pits for household wastage disposal in
using the compost for backyard garden
3. identify suitable sites away from  drinking water source for disposal of
community waste village garbage and cattle dung
4. construct internal roads and pavements
5. effective IEC campaign for peoples participation and attitudinal change for good
sanitation and hygiene
Technology Options
1.Treatment for Fluoride
The options include Defluoridaion techniques like
* Nalgonda Model ---Complexion Method
* Ion Exchange Method
* Domestic Defluoridation
* Fill and draw defluondation plant technology for rural water supply
* Fill and draw defluoridation plant for small community
e Alternate source
* Dilution with low nitrate water
* Supply of limited fresh water for drinking
2.Treatment for Nitrate
This include following technology options
a. Ion exchange method
b. Bio-chemical denitrification
c Altemate source
d. Dilution with low nitrate water
e. Supply of limited fresh water
f. Reverse osmosis including safe disposal of rejected sludge from the plant
Treatment for Iron
Removal of iron is simple and can be achueved by aeration of water and settling of
the iron oxide sludge. Two technology options are
i. Package developed by NERRI for 1000 liters per hour capacity pump
ii Plants for large community
xiK



Treatment for bacteriological contamination is possible through chemical and non-
chemical methods, which are given in the Annexures to the report.
Ground'water Recharge
Large areas in the project districts, where ground water levels are progressively
declining or where availability of the resource itself is dwindling require ground
water recharge. This could be achieved through various conventional and non-
conventional measures. Selection of one or a combination of a set of more than one
technology depends on the local situation. A matrix for ground water recharge for
different districts is prepared and given in the report.
Technology Options for Hoousehold Sanitation
Primaiy consideration for technology options is users preference and choice of what
people want and what they are willing to pay for. A range of technology options
recommended to be to the commnunity for selection should be such that it is low cost,
easy to construct, easy to clean and maintain, and suitable to climate and soil. The
report recommends various technology options for household sanitation that include
trenching methods and pit latrines. Details of these are given in the report
Technical Options for Environment
In the report technology options are recommended for Sullage drains, soak pits
leach pits,  open drains, household and community garbage, disposal of
biodegradable wastes through Verniculture and control of indoor pollution by
promoting changes in design of Kitchen and house. Region wise appropriate
sanitation technology options are also recommended for human excreta
management, animal dung management, garbage management and sludge
management.
Environmental Management Plan
Critical analysis of the baseline environmental data, feed back from the public
consultations, information gathered through MIS for the current schemes as well as
the issues emerged during discussions with various functionaries and organizations
participating in the rural water supply program has brought out key environmental
issues that need to be addressed along with mitigated measures while designing and
implementing the project. The important environmental issues are classified into
four different categories.
1. Water Quantity issues relate to Over extraction of ground water and progressive
decline of water levels
2. Water sources management for holistic approach for integrated resources
management to protect drinking water sources by the aquifer management
groups.
3. Water quality issues pertaining to high salinity, higher concentration fluoride,
nitrate and iron.
4. Environmental sanitation and hygiene issues to achieve zero open defecation,
improve the sanitary condition through network of sullage drains.
Highlights of environmental Management Plan are given in Table 5.

It may be noted that the project of its own does not envisage any negative impact on
the environment due to the proposed interventions. However, the project would be
regularly monitored for any such negative impact that might occur due to improper
implementation of any of the interventions and same would be immediately mitigate
the negative impact, if any, through appropnate measures.
Environmental Monitoring and Performance lindicator
A mechanism to monitor the peiformance of various interventions envisaged under
the project is evolved and institutions responsible for monitoring at different levels
are suggested in the report.
Institutional Arrangements
The project envisages to build on the existng PRI based institutional model that
enables demand driven community action. A three tire institutional arrangement at
village level, district level and state level is suggested under the project. The
proposed model encourages a complete bottom up process and also provides full
scope for the communities to play a vital role and ultimately own the project. This
will also compliments the national agenda of strengthening the grass root level PRI
organizations.
A potential drawback to this approach will be the lack of required capacity at the
district and the GP level for implementing an enabling approach. However, this will
be addressed by way of.

*  Implementing the project in phases. Only a Few districts and OPs would be
taken in the first phase so that adequate attention to building their capacity could
be paid.
*  The project cycle at the village level envisages sufficient time for capacity
building of the GPNWSC members.
*  The project also builds in appropriate finds for capacity development agenda.
*  The current approaches for capacity building in the SRP districts would be used
here also.
The Environmental Analysis shows that the proposed Second Maharashtra Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project itself will not cause any adverse environmental
impacts. The project will bring positive health and environmental benefits to the
project stakeholders, through supply of safe and adequate dnnking water and
creation of necessary environmental sanitation facilities in the project villages. The
recommended environmental mitigation measures appropriately integrated in the
project design would have a net positive effect on the environment. The facilities
created in the project village will be operated and maintained by the beneficiaries
and the GPs through necessary capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the
services.

1. INTRODUJCl'WION
Maharashtra is one of the progressive states in India, having a geographical area of
3.07 lakh sq.km. Which is 9.4% of the Indian geographical area. Maharashtra state
was formed on Ist May 1960. Despite the high levels of urbanization, Maharashtra
had a large rual population of over 55.7 million according to 2001 census. This is
spread over 86313 villages and wadis (habitations) in 33 Districts (excluding 2
urban districts of Mwunbai i.e. Mumbai City and Mumbai Subub). During past four
decades, Government of Maharashtra has taken up, large number of measures to
improve the water supply and sanitation scenario in rural areas, and still the water
supply and sanitation related problems are on increase. State Government since its
fornation has spent nearly Rs.39, 000 million on various programs to provide water
supply to rural areas till the "White Paper" on drinking water was published
during1995.
Maharashtra Government was the first state to publish WHITE PAPER to assess the
status of water and sanitation scenario. After the publication of the White Paper,
Master Plan was prepared in 1997, detailing the extent of problem, future policy to
provide safe water supply by 2000 and construction of 2 million toilets in rural area.
Cost estimate was to the tune of Rs. 122690 milHion to cover 53462 villages/wadis.
Of this total estimated cost of Rs. 122690 million, amount spent is Rs. 47000
million. The cumulative amount spent on water supply and sanitation program in the
State is Rs. 86000 million. Meanwhile externally assisted projects were
implemented
1.1 First Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Maharashtra Rural Water Supply Scheme covered 560 villages in 10 districts at the
cost of Rs.5042.5 millions. This integrated project was covering water supply,
environmental sanitation, health education and community participation aspects. The
project was implemented between 1991 and 1999. Population of 783000 was
benefited.
1.2 DFlID Project
DFID assisted project covering 3 districts and 180 villages costing Rs.743 million
was completed in the year 2000.
The above two projects, though integrated, were supply driven in nature and were
not creating the ownership aspect amongst the community, which made them
unsustainable. Lesson learnt under these projects were to involve the community in
planning, implementation, O&M. and make them participate. Top down approach
needs to be reversed.
1.3 GOM- KfW Project
Government of Maharashtra is now following the policy of Government of India and
Sector Reforms were introduced based on new Demand Driven, community
participatory policy with 100 % responsibility of 0 & M at beneficiary level. The
project is being implemented in 4 districts of Maharashtra under sector reforms
program. In addition, the KfW funded Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is



also being implemented in 3 districts namely Ahrnednagar, Aurangabad and Pune
and has a provision for sustainable rural drinking water supply, environmental
sanitation, health and hygiene promotion, watershed interventions and human
resource development. The project period is between 2001 and 2007.
1.4 Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Government of Maharashtra is the first to adopt the holistic approach to cover entire
State in the Refonn Process and approached the' World Bank for assistance for the
remaming 26 districts of Maharashtra (excluding GOI and KfW districts.) With the
objective of strengthening the democratic process of decentralization planning and
development at grass root level. GOM proposes to promote demand responsive
approach, active involvement and participation of PRI and beneficiary communities
through all stages of the project implementation and its sustained operation and
maintenance will be the key features of the proposed project.
The project is in the preparation stage and aimed at improving the quality of rural
water supply and environmental sanitation service delivery through community
action to achieve sustainability of investment,and generate health and income
benefits.
The key components of the project include:
* Financing of lEC activities for water supply and sanitation
*  No direct financing will be provided for individual toilet construction, but
incentives will be given to villages for achieving "Zero Open Defecation"
* 80% financing for women's community toilets with 20% contribution
coming from the commumity
* Soak pits for non-excretal waste will be financed
* Women's development initiatives will be undertaken with the aim to
promote women's empowerment
* Integrated groundwater development by undertaking three mini watershed
projects (increased to six watersheds) covering approximately 10,000
hectares each.
* Village Development Fund will be set up under the project for support to
villages exhibiting a high level of motivation and preparedness in
implementing sector reforms as per revised project objectives. This will be
given to 150 selected Gram Panchayats, each receiving Rs 5 lakhs for
holistic development
*  Financial support to 3 Zilla Parishads for holistic development and capacity
building.
*  90% financial support for building, rejuvenation, source strengthening of
water supply schemes including rainwater harvesting and roof top rainwater
harnessing, will be provided under the project with community contributing
10 % in the form of cash or partial voluntary labor and 100 % 0 and M by
the Commtnity
Besides the project would also address other related issues such as sullage/storn
drains along the roads, sanitation and hygiene promotion, awareness campaign,
handling of drinking water, sanitary disposal of sullage, solid and liquid waste;
school water supply and sanitation and environmental sanitation. The project



would also address other issues with respect water quantity issues such as
decline of water tables, watershed development, over extraction of ground water
etc water quality issues such as high concentration of fluoride, nitrate, salinity,
and arsenic in ground water along with required mitigation measures. The
proposed project will cover nearly 3750 Gram Panchayat with the estimated cost
of USD200 million (Rs.1000 crores) and is phased over a period of 6 years
(2003-2009).

2. THE PROJECT SETTING
Second Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is designed on the
premise of sector reforrns and community's participation. The project would be
implemented in 26 districts. This is the first project after the 73rd Amendment to the
constitution empowering the local bodies Therefore, the success and learning from
the project would be path setting for future planning.
2.1.  Project Objectives
Overall development objectives of the project are:
i.    increase rural community's access to improved and sustainable drinking
water and sanitation services;
ii.   institutionalize decentralization of rural water supply delivery through
three tiers PRI.
The project will assist Government of Maharashtra in improving the quality of life in
rural areas by raising the service standards of environment and sanitation. The
project will be a major step towards scaling up reforms statewide.
Sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural population, empowerment and
inclusion of community in general and rural poor and women in particular, through
strengthening the democratic decentralization process is going to result in
sustainable development and poverty reduction.
These objectives will be achieved through:
* Adopting a demand responsive approach and use of participatory process
for delivery of sustainable service to project communities;
*  Phased implementation of appropriate policy and institutional reforms for
changing role of the Government from provider to facilitator;
*  Establishing financial viability and sustainability of nral water supply and
sanitation services; and
*  Promoting integrated resource management, improving environrnent and
hygiene behavioral changes.
2.2.  Project Components

Government of Maharashtra are:
2.3.1  Village level arrangements.
* GOM has decided to institutionalize the decentralization by strengthening the
PRIs to deliver services at the village levels
* GP will be the focal point for project implementation and will be responsible
for planning, procurement, construction, and 0 & M of the water supply and
sanitation schemes.
2.3.2 District level arrangements:
ZP will be responsible for the final sign off on scheme proposals (Administrative
approval and appraisal process), providing technical sanction for the schemes and
for providing technical assistance and capacity support.



2.3.3. State level arrangements:
Project Planning and Monitoring Unit (PPMU) will support and momtor the
progress.
The project will strengthen the State level agency (Proposed) Policy and
Implementation suppoit Unit (PISU) to help implementation of the reform program
effectively.
2.4.  Project Area
GOM has taken the policy decision to implement the Sector Reform Program
statewide, the Bank investment support will be to entire State (in 25 district
excluding KfW and GOI's sector reform program) It is estimated that project would
cover about 3750 Gram Panchayats.
2.5   Project Period
The project will be implemented over a period of SIX years (2003-2009). All the
physical activities are planned to start during first five years and the last year will
focus on sustainability issues.
2.6.  Project Cost
Government of Maharashtra has envisaged a long-term partnership between the
State and the World Bank, which would be implemented in a phased manner
synchronizing with reforms. In the first phase an investment of Rs.1000 crore
(nearly 200 million US Dollar) is estimated of which 10% would be contributed by
the beneficiaries. In addition, the GOM has passed an order to streamline
administration and management of O&M    to be contributed 100%  by the
beneficiaries. Activities to be taken up under the pilot project from May 2002
onward till signing of the Project would be eligible for retroactive finance.
2.6.1 Fund Flow
State Level
Govemment of Maharashtra will transfer the finds (as per the budgeted allocations)
in installments into the PL Account maintained by the Project Director PPMI9U. The
PL account would be operated on day-to-day basis to meet the state level project
expenditure and transfers for district level operations.
ZIP Level
Fund from the state level PL account will be transferred to a dedicated separate bank
account in the scheduled bank maintained at the district level. The DPMU (District
Project Management Unit) will meet the expenditures of the facilitation and
supervision teams and transfer of funds to the GP/VWSC dedicated bank account as
per agreed terms and conditions, documented in the agreed installments.
GP/VWSC Level
GP/VWSC will open separate bank account for managing the project funds. The
bank account will be operated by the office bearer of the GPNVWSC, as applicable.

3.4.  Land Use
Maharashtra is mainly an agriculture State with 82% of rural population relying on
agnculture Out of total area of 30 77 million ha 22 25 million ha (73%) is cultivable
and 5 3 million ha (1 7%) is under forest Average annual agriculture productivity of
the cultivable land is Rs 16000 per ha Land utilizationi pattern in tle State is given

3.5.  Rainfall
State experiences extremes of rainfall ranging from 3000 mm in the Konkan region
to less than 500 mm in central parts of the State. One-third area of the State falls in a
rain shadow zone. Konkan region receives more than 3000-mm rainfall in the Ghat
areas and 2500 mm in plains.
Rainfall decreases rapidly towards eastern slopes and plateau areas where it is less
than 500 mm. It again gains towards further east in Marathwada and Vidarbha
region and is upto 1250 mm. Thus, the central part of the State always reels under
drought.
Intensity of rainfall plays a vital role in the water resources in the State. Intensity of
rainfall is high in coastal area as also in parts of eastern Maharashtra. As a result
much of the rainfall is lost to the sea. Variability of rainfall over the State is
generally high ranging from 20 to 35 %, except in coastal areas where it is less than
20%.
Low rainfall and its high variability causes drought. There are 89 talukas in the State
that are chronically drought affected of which 64 are in the project area. Chronic
drought prone talukas of different districts in the project area are given in Tablle3. 5

3.6.  Soils
Soils in Maharashtra are mainly Vertisols (Black Cotton soils) in almost all districts
except in Konkan and m parts of Chandrapur where it is mainly Alfisol and partly
Vertisol type Texture and thickness of soil directly control rainfall mfiltration and
moisture holding capacity which are relevant to water availability and agriculture.
Soils in the State are further classified into Coarse shallow, Medium Black, Deep
Black, Latentic and Coastal Alluvial. Soil classification of the State is given in the
Table 3.6.

3.7.  Water Resources
State is bestowed with numerous rivers and streams flowing westward and eastward
These are grouped into 5 major river basins namely Goadvari, Krishna, Tapi,
Narmada, and Konkan sub basins in coastal areas. Three major nvers i.e. Godavari,
Knshna and Bhima, originate in the State. All nvers in the State except in Konkan
region are inter State rivers and their water availability and water use are governed



by the Inter State River Tribune Awards. In Konkan region surface water utilization
is according to the recommendations of the Dr. M. S. Swaminathan Committee on
Water Resources Planning in Konkan region (1981) National Commission on
Irrigation has estimated surface water availability as also per capita availability in
the 5 major river basins of Maharashtra (Table 3.7)

Unlike lower nparian states like Karnataka, Andlhra Pradesh, haniessing of water in
the State is constrained by hlilly and uniduLlating topographlic conditions As a result,
most of the districts in the State often experience floods during monsoon and
drinking water scarcity durinig summer
Average availability of dninking water per annL1um for the total population of the
State is 1 596 m3. As per intemational standards this should be 1700 in3, for
considering it to be satisfactory. Availability of drinkinig water is scarce to acutely
scarce in most parts of the State. excepting the areas occupied by westerly flowing
rivers and Nanrada basin
3.7.1. Irrigation Potential -
Ultimate irngation potential m the State is estimated at 5.56 million hectare of which
3.647 million hectare is already created of which only 78 % is being utilized due to
inefficient irrigation system which has caused water logging and land degradation
over 17000 hectares mainly in imgated areas of Knshna and Godavan basins
Water logging besides, loss of agncultural productivity has affected drinkLng water
quLality due to salinty. In water logged areas malaria epidemic is common.
3.7.2 Tank irrigation:
Minor irrigation tanks and village ponds are major source of irrigation. There are
26050 tanks constructed and controlled by different agencies. Ex-Malguajan tanks
in Vidharbha region continue to urrigate small areas. Most of these tanks are also
used for drinking water supply. About 45% of these tanks have become abandoned
or semi-abandoned due to neglected 0 & M, which has reduced availability of water
for agriculture and drinking.

3.7.3 Groundwater Resources
Geological formations in the State range in age from Archaean to recent alluvium
About 82% of the area is covered by Deccan Basalt lava flows (249934 sq. kim)
followed by metamorphic rocks (32284 sq. km), alluvial deposits (14526 sq kin)
mainly in Ptumna and Tapi nver basins, and senm-consolidated sedimentary
formations (11018 sq. km.) like sandstones, lime stones and coal, etc. Groundwater

in hard rock occurs mainly under water table and semi-confined conditions.
Confined aquifers in hard rocks are isolated and have limited areal extent as these
are controlled by fractures, joints /fissures and faults. In semi-consolidated and
sedimentary fonnations, grotndwater occurs both umder semi confined and
tnconfined conditions. In alluvial formations groundwater occurs both under
unconfined and semi- confined conditions
The decadal average depth to water level dunng post monsoon season is generally in
the range of 3-6 m below ground level but in certain areas it is 9-12 m or more. In
alluvial areas of Tapi nver basin the groundwater table is 9-40 m below ground level
whcreas in Purma nver basin it is 9-22 m below ground level. The post monsoon
water level trend over the past 10 years indicates that water levels are declining in
about 68 talukas in the State while in the remaining parts it is stabilized-or nrsing

Realizing the importance of groundwater for agriculture and drinking water,
Goven1ment of Maharashtra established a separate Directorate of Grotndwater
Surveys and Development Agency in 1972, as a nodal agency for groundwater
plamiing and development GSDA has been estimating groundwater potential in the
State from time to time. GSDA has divided the State into 1 505 group watersheds for
groundwater assessment and development planning  Non-ns for groundwater
estimation are discussed and finalized at National level,by the Central Ground Water
Board, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India and are refined
periodically as more research and field data flow in.
Rainfall contnbutes 20 to 30% of total grotmdwater recharge. Supplementary
recharge from other sources like recycled irrigation, seepage from surface water
storages and canals, etc. contributes slgnifiCantly
Ministry of water Resources constituted a Groundwater Estimation Comnmittee
during 1997 to review, revise and recommend new methodology for groundwater
estimation, which was deliberated and accepted by all the state groundwater
orgamzations. GSDA has revised the estimation of groundwater potential m the
State as per GEC (1997) norms. GSDA further subdivided the 1505 group
watersheds into 2415 sub units based on irrigated and non-irrigated areas as per
GEC (1997) and estimated the potential. The total replemshable groundwater
recharge as per recent groundwater estimation in the project area is 28751 30 MCM
3.7.4 Groundwater Extraction
Despite innovations in the groundwater extraction structures like bore wells and
dug-cum bore wells, open irrigation wells continue to prevail. As per Minor
lmgation census carried out by the State there are 20,00,000 irrigation wells of
which 12,00,000 are installed with mechanical pumping device Average extraction
from open well varies between 8000 m3 to 12000 m' per year. Subsidized powers
tariff and cross subsidy for diesel and easy access to credit encouraged construction
of large irrigation wells in the State particularly after the green revolution.
Total extraction of groundwater is estimated at 7768.91 MCM, including 7095.87
MCM for irrigation and 673.04 MCM for drinking, which is 36 % of the utilizable
recharge Table 3.10. (Also see Pie charts)

3.7.5 impact of Sugarcane Irrigation
About 18.8 % of the total inigated area in the State is under sugarcane. As per
prevailing irrigation practices for sugarcane irrigation supplementary water
requirements are 195 cm against actual consumptive use of 160 cm. - There are 77
operating sugar factories in the project area each with a crushing capacity of 1250 to
5000 tons per day. In addition 41 new factories are under erection and proposals for
142 new factories are pending for licensing. Area under sug-cane in 26 project
districts is 349600 ha. Excessive irrigation for large area under sugarcane has caused
over extraction of groumdwater even in command areas where groundwater is used
conjunctively with surface water.
Concentration of sugarcane and its over irrigation in Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara,
Nashik, Latur, Beed, Osmanabad and Solapur is manifested in over extraction of
groundwater (109 number of over exploited and critical watershed umnts)
progressively declining water table in these areas and also deterioration of
groundwater quality affecting drinking water supplies.

3.7.6 Silting of Reservoirs
Almost all reservoirs are getting silted at much faster rate than estimated during
designing, due to soil erosion and change in catchment's charactenstics. This has
reduced their live storage and has affected- water supply both to irrgation and
2O



drinking water supply schemes based on these. Studies on a few reservoir storages in
the State camed out by Central Board of Irmgation and Power has revealed that the
loss of storage capacity is at the rate of 0.1 % to 0.77 % per year

3.7.7. Water Resources in Tribal Areas
The tribal areas in the State of Maharashtra are concentrated in parts of
Ahmednagar, Thane, Amaravati, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Dhule, Nandurbar,
Nanded, Nashik, Pune, Yavatmal, Raigad, Parbhani and Wardha districts. Tribal
population in the State is 73,18,281 (1991), which is 9.27 % of the population in the
State. The tribal population generally lives m inhospitable terrain characterized by
mountainous and sub-mountainous region and practice shifting cultivation.
Groundwater though prolific, provides most of the water needs besides, springs.
Groundwater resource potential in tribal areas is given in Table 3.15.

3.7.7 Demand for Drinking Water
Present demand for drinking water in the State is estimated at 2767.52 MCM of
which 1705 46 MCM IS for urban and 1062.06 MCM for rural population. The
projected demand for dnrnking water at year 2030 is estimated at 6183 57 MCM,
which includes 4240.47 MCM for urban area and 1943.10 MCM for rural areas.
These projections show that by 2030 the demand for urban supply would increase by
-148 % and for rural water supply by 82% compared to present. This difference
would increase further due to faster industrialization and urbanization.
Although total natural availability of surface water in the State is estimated at
125896 MCM, the Second Maharashtra Irngation Commission has considered the
actual availability of surface water at 107683 MCM. Between 1992 and 2002 total
availability of water (both surface and groundwater) has increased from 139227
MCM to 154137.16 MCM due to changes in ground water availability from 31544.
MCM in 1992 to 46454 MCM as per revised ground water assessment (provisional)
by GSDA and Central Ground Water Board.

3.7.9. Utilization of Water Resources by Different Sectors
Unlike urban areas dnnking water in rural areas is confronted with severe
competition with imgation water supplies. Estimates by Maharashtra Water and
Irrigation Commission (1999) shows that by 2030, out of total water resources
estimated at 154137 MCM including surface and ground water, about 89662 MCM
(58 %) would be utilized by irrigation and 10435.57 MCM (7 %) by drinking and
industry. However, except in KonkaD region, in other parts of the State, irrigation
needs would exceed the available water resources. Therefore, providing drinking
water by controlling irrigation demands becomes formidable in future water
planning. Out of total wL.f,,r resources estimated at 154137.16 MCM, utilization by
different sectors by 2030 would be as under:
It is evident that by year 2030 only 67.3% of the available water resources would be
utilized and by proper planning and judicious use by different sectors, availabilty
of water for drinking purposes would not be a constraint.

3.8 Groundwater for Drinking Purpose
In nmral areas ground water is the main source of drinking water supply. Demand for
drinking water supply in rural areas is estimated at 1062 MCM at present and 1943
MCM at year 2030. Revised ground water estimates by GSDA shows that presently
855.20 (673 MCM for project area) of ground water is used for drinking water
which is 80.5% of total requirement and balance 19.5% is from surface water. The
requirement ground water for drinking water at year 2030 is estimated at 1706-80
23



MCM (1373.36 MCM for project area), but because of non-availability or limited
availability of groundwater in over exploited and cntical areas, only 1560 98 MCM
(1263 08 MCM for the project area) would be available for actual use Thus
groundwater available for fuiture utilization can meet only 80 3% of the demand and
balance requirement needs to be provided from surface water sources.
As regards surface water, though it is expected that the entire projected demand of
4240 MCM for urban water supply schemes could be fulfilled from surface water
sources, the Second Maharashtra Water And Irrigation Comnuission has observed
that the probdble supply would be about 3292 MCM. The shortfall of 848 MCM for
urban water supply may have to be met either from groundwater, if and where
available, or from rainwater harvesting or by recycling 2713 MCNW f sewage-waste
water that would be generated by then.
3.8.2 Bore wells for Rural Water Supply
In the project area, by March 2002, GSDA has drilled 2,00,842 bore wells and 2,480
tube wells for dnnking water. Out of these 1,58,389 Bore Wells and 2,418 Tube
Wells are successful and are mstalled with Hand Pump or a Power Pump. Distnct
wise progress is given in Table 3.17.

Hydro-geologists of GSDA having a long experience in hydrogeology of hard rocks
select sites for water supply sources Presently success rate is 80 %. This may appear
reasonable though below desirable.
3.8.2. Present Coverage
Adequacy of source is determined at 40 LPCD norm (reduced to 20 LPCD in
summer in some cases). One bore well generally services 200 population. But in
many cases the population coverage is more than 200 per bore well. Where the
population is more than 2000, piped water supply or multi village water supply
schemes are implemented. Bore wells are also drilled to supplement existing
inadequate supply schemes.
Program of bore well and tubes well for dnnking water is implemented by GSDA,
ZP and piped water supply scheme with bore well/ tube well as a source by
Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran. Based on the source, its adequacy and population
covered water supply schemes are categorized as Hand Pumps, Power Pumps, Mini
water supply schemes, individual piped water supply schemes. Regional-Rural water
supply schemes and open dug well schemes (mostly by ZP). There are 176692 Hand
Pumps, 14797 Mini Water Supply Schemes, and 16683 Individual Piped Water
Supply Schemes. 47922 Open Dug wells, 337 Regional Rural Water Supply
Schemes zid 1950 Water Supply Schemes executed by MJP. Progress of drinking
water schemes of State is given in Table 3.18.

3.9 Water Quality Issues
Quality of groundwater for water supply is continuously monitored by GSDA,
CGWB and PHD     Besides, durnig 2001 GOM has taken up bolck wise random
sampling for chemical analysis of drmking water souirces as per directives Issued by
GOI This water quality analysis is only a one-time,analysis In those districts wher-e
water quality is severly affected due to chemical contamination, 100% sampling of
drikinig X ater sources is being carimed out by assigning the task to NEERI NEERI
has already conducted 1005 sampoling in Yewatmal districts and similar sampling is
being carried ouit in Bhandara and Nagpur distncts
Out of total 200842 drinkmg water sou,rces 25314 sources were tested for Flotuide,
iron, Salanity and Nitrate Number of souirces affected by water quality problems are
given in Table 3.19

Results of water quality analysis by vanous agencies are compiled, collated and
discussed below  Areas affected by contamination of grotmdwater by various
elements like Fluoride, Nitrate, Iron and Salinity are also discussed below (Please
see pie charts)
3.9.1. Fluoride
Chemical quality of groundwater in the State is generally good and potable
However, in parts of areas covered by sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and in
coastal areas ground water has high concentration of fluoride. Chemical analysis of
water samples from open wells and bore wells by GSDA, CGWB and PHD indicate
that the concentration of Fluoride increases with depth and is less in shallow
aquifers. Table 3.20.

and NEERI



3.9.2. Nitrate
High concentration of Nitrate in groundwater is reported in distncts where large
areas are irngated under Paddy sugarcane, cotton, orange, banana and grapes
Excess use of chemical fertilizer is the major source of Nitrate contamination.
High concentration of nitrate is more in shallow aquifers than in deep bore wells
Chemical analysis of drinking water samples by GSDA, CGWB and PHD shows
high concentration of Nitrate in ground water m Sangli, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Beed,
Nashik, Nagpur, Osmanabad, Solapur, Parbhani, LatLr, Wardha, Chandrapur,
Bhandara and Akola distncts where area under sugarcane, paddy, orange, banana is
more.
3.9.3. Salinity
Ground water in southern parts of Puma alluvium m Akola, Buldhana has high
salinity rendering the groundwater unfit for drinking. Salinity in Purna river
alluvium in Amravati, Akola and Buldhana districts is location specific and there are
no similar examples elsewhere in the country
Salinity due to seawater ingression is common in coastal belt of Thane, Ratnagiri
and Sindhudurg districts. The effect of salinity due to seawater mgression is
observed up to 2 Km. inland from the west coast. In this belt fresh ground water
floats above the saline water and could be used for drinking purposes from open
wells of up to 5 meter depth provided rigorous control on groundwater withdrawal
for irrigation is exercised to avoid disruption of fresh water - sea water interface.

3.9.4. Arsenic
Chemical analysis of water samples from different drinking water sources tested
during April - May 2001 at the chemical laboratory of Indian Bureau of Mines,
(IBM) Nagpur '.howed presence of Arsenic in water samples from 12 villages in
Hingana and Ramtek talukas of Nagpur district and 11 villages from Gadchiroli,
Kurkheda and Wadasa talukas of Gadchiroli district. Concentration of Arsenic was
found to be high than permissible limits in a few cases.
Alarmed by this, water samples from same sources were analyzed at the laboratory
of Public Health Dept. during July 2002 which shovwd only traces of Arsenic much
below permissible limit (Table 3.22.A).

In view of the wide difference bet-ween the two test results it was considered
necessary to revalidate the water quality analysis for Arsenic independini;ny at a
third qualified laborato-y GOM  assigned this task to Radiant Laboratory Nagpur.
Tile Laboratory has since submitted the results of chemical analysis of water
samples from 13 sources from Nagpur district, tested for Arsenic contamination. Thie
analysis was done adopting Silver Diethyl Dithicarbonate method, using
spectrophotometer at 535 mrn with 1 cm light cells, using Gwtzet Arsenic generator
The results are given mn Table 3.22.B The third test results confinii that Arsenic
concentration  in groundwater sources in Nagpur distrct  is much below the
permissible limits. Results for water samples from Gadclhiroh district are awaited.

3.9.5. Iron
Chemical analysis of water samples from groundwater sources for drinking water in
Ratnagri, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts shows presence
of iron  This is due to geological formations like Laterites in Konkan region and
Hematite Quartzite in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts, whicih have higil iron
minlerals that leach in grouLidwater. Distributioll of Iron in groundwater in different
distncts in project area is given in Table 3.23

3.9.6. Microbiological contamination
The microbiological analysis was started a decade ago. The sampies are analyzed for
colifonn and 1,. coli The analysis of data is shownA in Fig. 1. An examination of
histograplhs reveal that both shallow and deep aquifers show contamination, but
shallow aquifer is more contaminated as compared to deep aquifer

It is interesting to note that the level of contamination is maximum duiring monsoon
and subsequently diminishes during post monsoon period. Further the reasons of
contamination of groundwater are badly damaged platform, dumping of animal
waste in the vicinity of source, mixing of contaminated surface water without being
thoroughly filtered through soil mantle, leakages from septic tanks, compost pits and
cattle sheds located m close proximity to the drinking water sources and open field
defecation.
3.9.7. Industrial Pollution
Industrial growth in the State is high causing contamination of ground water.
Chemical analysis of water sanples collected by vanous organizations show that
ground water is highly polluted near and around industrial areas. Examples at
I-lingna, Kalmeshwar talukas in Nagpur, Tbane-Belapur belt in Thane district, Lote
Parshuram, Chiplun and Ratnagiri in Ratnagiri distnct, Ballarshah, Chandrapur in
Chandrapur district where ground water has high TDS, COD, BOD, Ca, Cl, S04 and
traces of other elements. There are about 1 7 sugar factories in the Stateconcentrated
mostly in Nashlik, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Jalgaon distrcts. These sugar
factories have ancillary units of distillery, acetone, paper etc. These factories and
industrial uMits let off their effluent in tanks constructed for treatment before
disposal in near by areas or in the streams  However, in many cases in Sangli,



Kolhapur, Nasik districts lack of foolproof disposal of spent wasil and other effluent
from sugar factones, distillenes and paper mills has contaminated grounidwater
Chemical analysis of water samples for industrial effluent and groundwater is given
in Table 3 24A  Data on water quality status downstream of indistries is given in

3.9.8. Bacteriological Contamination of Water Sources':
In addition to chemical analysis PHD, GASDA and NEERI cany out bacteriological
analysis of water samples from drinking water sources. However, thls analysis does
not represent State level situation. Bactenological contammation shows rapid
variation and there is no consistency in data for consecutive years The analysis also
shows that shallow aquifers are more contaminated than deep aquifers and that
bacteriological contamination is maximum during monsoon and rapidly decreases
soon after. Sampling of drinking water sources by Public Health laboratories across
the state shows bacteriological contamination. In the curtent year from January to
August (2002), seven districts in the state showed bacteriological contamination in
over 32 % of the samples analyzed. Table 3.25.

Chemical and bacteriological contamination ofground water has severe and serious
health hazards as would be seen from the n-unber of cases reported from niral areas
between 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 by the Public Health Department on Gastro,
Diarrhoea, infective Hepatitis, Typhoid, and Cholera. Table 3.26.

The above table indicates that an average of 1 2 million people (1 2%) are affected
every year and about 350 people die due to bactenological contaminationi of
drinkinig water Distrctwise details are appended.
The following are the GOM's estimate of villages and persons affected by diarrhoeal
diseases and the impact on lost lives and lost productive human-days dunng the
period 1998-2001
-  Affected Villages  - 1657
-  Affected Persons   - 34 Lakhs
-  Deaths             - 2753 Persons
-  Loss of hulmlani days - 168 Lakhs
3.9.9 Use of Contaminated Sources
All such villages where the quality of water is poor and dnnking water from hand
pump and borewell is unsuitable for dnnkmg eitlher due to hlgh concentration of
Fluonde nitrate or bactenological contamination these are classified as difficult
villages notwithstanding the availability of water from the source created
Government first prnonty is to find new sources with good quality water to meet the
demand. Second priority is to provide limited quantity of good water for drinking
purposes and use contaminated water for bathing, washing, cleaning, etc Where it is
difficult to identify and create a fresh water soturce preference would be for
rainwater harvesting through ponds, tanks as also rooftop rainwater harvestmg
GOM has already drawn plans on these lines in Yavatmal and other districts with
financial outlay of Rupees 9 Crores. This Prograrmne is however "Supply driven"
instead of demand driven" and people participation is opti.nal.
3.10 Trend Analysis For Disease Attack
Data collected by Public H4ealth Department regardipg attacks and deaths due to
water borne diseases like Typhoid, Gastro, Diarrhoea and Jaundice show that
between 1997 and 2001 there is progressive decline m number of attacks and deaths
due to these diseases except Typhoid. The reduction in the nunber of cases attacked
by water borne diseases could be attributed to Government's successful endeavor in
providing safe and clean dnnking water. As regards Typhoid although there is
increase in the number of attacks, the niunber of deaths due to Typhoid has declined
during past five years. This is because of good health service provided in rural areas
(see Graphs on Health).
3.1 I.Special Studies in Yavatmal District
At the request of the Water Supply and Sanitation Department   (WSSD),
Government of Maharashtra (GOM), special studies were conducted dunng
January2003, for Water Quality problems and mitigation measures in Yavatmal
district in Maharashtra and to review the existing water quality situation and
mitigation strategy adopted by Zila Parishad to address water quality problems and
make recommendations for improvements



3.11.1 Drinking Water Sources There are nearly 9,500 public drinking water
sources, which can be broadly categonzed as under
Hand pumps on bore wells  3,813
Dugwells                 4,739
Reponal water supply       275
Piped water supply         673
3.11.2. Water Quality Problems in Vavatmal
GOM and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) sponsored a water quality
assessment of community sources jointly in 2001. The Natonal Environmental
Engineering Research Institute (NEER1), canied out the assessment However,
The chemical water quality problems encountered in the district are: fluonde, nitrate,
iron and total dissolved solids (TDS)  Arsenic was not detected in any water
sample ( Annexure X)
a. Fluoride
The analysis of NEER] report indicates the following trend in fluornde concentration
in Yavatmal district.
Only 1922 (20.5%) sources are witlin the desirable limit of fluonde (< 1 rng/L)
6590 sources (70%) are between 1-1.5 mg/L fluonde concentrations
877 (9.3%) sources have fluoride concentration > 1.5 mg/L
Out of 877 sources 406 sources have fluoride concentration > 2 but < 5 mg/L
Out of 877 sources 1 7 sources have fluoride concentration > 5 mg/L
The following table gives details of incidence high fluoride in drinking water, dental
fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis in Yavatmnal district.

Source Review of Water Quality in Yavatmal, WSSD, GONM 2003
It may be noted thiat 79% of dental fluorosis cases and over 90% of skeletal cases
have been reported from Ghatanji and Pandharkawada taluks Overall the average
incidence of dental fluorosis in the distnct is less than 0 5 per water source (fluoride
concentration > 1 5 mg/L). This could be because people do not use fluonde
contaminated water for dnnking and brief inter-action with Pnmary Health Center
(PHC), Swale confinns this
b.Nitrate
As per NEERI report one thousand seven hundred and nine (20% sources) water
soturces have mtrate concentration m excess of the permissible limit of 100 mg/L
c.Total Dissolved Solids
As per NEERI report ninety-five (1% of sources) water sources have TDS
concentration in excess of the maximrum permissible limit of 2000 mg/L This is not
seen as a major water quahty problem.
d. Bacteriological Pollution
This parameter was not covered under in the NEERI report. However, the heath
departrnent reports suggest that Bactenological quality of water is the major water
quality problem in Yavatmal district. The following health related data confirms
this.
Gastro Attacks             1430 Nos
Clholera Attacks            28 Nos
Dirrhoea Attacks         30,508 Nos.
Hepatitis Attack            109 Nos
Typhoid Attacks             120 Nos.
3.12. Sanitation And Hygiene
The sanitation policy for the rural areas of the state of Maharashtra was initially
confined to the construction of physical infrastructure i.e. toilets and drainage The
implementation was target oriented, prescriptive and supply driven. The role of the
State government was to provide the subsidy and support the creation of physical
infrastructure Till 1997 only 6 lakh families, 6.25 % of total of 96 lakh rural
families, had toilet facilities. Of these about 81000 toilets have been constructed
using subsidies provided under the government programs.
38



To address the poor coverage, the state government had set up a target of providing
toilets to 20 lakh rural families in a penod of 3 years between 1 997-2000. The
construction cost was fixed at Rs 4000 per toilet (for a prescnbed design) for which
an amount of Rs 3500 was provided as subsidy from vanous State and Central
govemment programs. As a result of this effort, by the year 2000, about 16 61 lakh
toilets were constnicted with huge subsidy expenditure of approximately Rs. 4.56
billion. Subsequently, surveys indicated that at best, only 57 % of the toilets
constructed under this program were being used for the purpose for which they were
built. The rest were using it for other purposes, highlighting the importance of
education and awareness creation as cntical ingredients-for a successful sanitation
program
Currently out of the 110 lakh population of rural families about 24.65 lakh have
been provided latrines by GOM under various schemes. Thus the current coverage is
about 22.5 %. However, considering the large non-use of latrines (about 43%) the
families using their own latrines could be only 11.5 % This is corroborated with the
primary survey data from 30 villages m5 districts where it was observed that about
85% of the communities in these vllDages defecate in open areas. This aspect of open
defecation is now sought to be addressed in the proposed project as per the new
strategy adopted by GOM in 2002 Table 3.28.
Out of the 53 171 primary schools only about 5% are covered with latrines and
about 69% have only urinal facilities. About 27% of the secondary schools have
sanitation facilities

Achievements on the education and awareness front is even lower. The
concept of total environmental sanitation and the need to sensitize and
educate communities for better health, personal hygiene, clean
environment and overall quality of life has not been effectively
ingrained in the population. Although the importance of this is now well
understood by policy makers and implementilng agencies, this aspect has
not been well integrated into the policy framework. It is also understood
that mainstreaming this aspect of the efforts is far more difficult than
implementing a subsidy program and building infrastructure. This
reflects on the status of contamination of water sources and the
subsequent health impacts on the rural communities.
3.12.1. Lessons Learnt
The major lesson from this is that the traditional supply-driven approach is not cost-
effective and that a demand-driven approach to sanitationi is necessary if visible and
meaningful success is to be achieved. The challenge is to provide a program design
that would mamstream such an approach m a sustainable way.
3.12. 2. GOM Initiatives from Year 2000
Learning from the experience of the imnplementation of massive toilet program and
the new demand driven policy of Government of India, the state governrment
currently has adopted a new policy and new program, in the year 2000 captioned as
'Sant Gadge Baba Clean (SGBC) Village Sanitation Campaign all over the state'
The SGBC has since gained momentum and has grown in strength and has now
become a leading example for other development programs.
Besides the SGBC, the GOM has also been umplementing the 'The Total Sanitation
Campaign' (TSC) supported by the Govermnent of India (GOI) in 13 districts since
the year 2001
3.12.3. Sant Gagde Baba Campaign (SGBC):
The Sant Gadge Baba Campaign is not a program or scheme but a campaign to
educate and motivate rural communities Interested villages register to participate in
the competition and implement various specified works that lead to an
environmentally clean village All the works are undertaken by the village through
their own resources and labor. The villages are then evaluated by independent
committees on the specified critena and other aspects like equity, innovations etc.
The villages that score highest marks are awarded 'pnzes' at different levels - block,
distnct, region and State Three villages are selected for awards at each level. The
rest of the villages do not get any prize money or subsidy from the Government.
Annexure I



Following are the salient features of SGBC
I is a competition for 'clean village' award where villages participate voluntarily
The Gram Panchayats take the lead in mobilizing communities and deciding the
actions to be undertaken. There is no pre-designed extemal input and which is
provided only as per demand.
o  Communities undertake work on their own with their own resources/ labor- no
subsidy from the State
o  The competing villages are evaluated by a 'Neutral Committee' at 4 levels
block, district, region and state The evaluation committee is from the -other
block, district and region so as to ensure impartiality in the process.
o Award money -given as a token of appreciation of the comLunimty's Loilective
action towards building a positive physical and social environment in the
villages. This has to be used for village development activities
o No award for other participating villages, if they do not fall in the first three
ranks
This program has gained momentum and has been welcomed by all the sections in
the state. What started as a rural campaign in the year 2000 has now been extended
to the urban areas also since the year 2002.
About 20CO villages participated in the 2 cycles during last two years and the
participating vlllages have implemented vanous works worth Rs.200-300 crores
each year. These works include constriction of about I lakh latrines, besides
drainage, soak pits, garbage bins, compost pits, solar lights etc. The total award
money offered by the GOM at all levels is about Rs. 6.6 crores every year
The major lessons emerging from the initial stages of this campaign are:
o  Communities (led by the Gram Panchayats) can do better when 'truly
enabled'
o  Sanitation drives need 'community focus'

3.12.4. Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC)
Recognizing the urgent need to increase the effectiveness of sanitation facilities, the
Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) under the Restructured Centrally Sponsored Rural
Sanitation Program was launched by the GOl in 1999. The campaign has now been
integrated with the sector reform program in water supply. Maharashtra has 13 TSC
districts. This program correctly recognizes the importance of a demand-driven
approach with a greater emphasis on household involvement than on the element of
subsidy. The subsidy to the BPL famnilies for the construction of toilet has been
reduced to a maximum of Rs.500 per BPL household out of which Rs.375 is
provided by Govemment of India and Rs.125 by the State Governnent. However,
the program is confined to reaching out only to the BPL families and does not target
the entire community. The program also provides funds for awareness building
(IEC) activities but a sustainable and replicable approach for effective utilization of
these ftnds remains elusive. Annexure II



Ralegan Siddhi: A Story of Rural Transformation through People's
Participation
"If every village puts in practic'e five principles of Nashahandi (no alcohol),
Nashandi (Family planning), Kuranhand, (ban on open grazing) and Kuradhandi
(ban on tree felling) and Shramdan (voltntary labor for community) nation will
progress very fast" said Mr. Anna Hazare, a man of vision and -.nspiration to
hundreds of villages and fanners in the State after untinng efforts of 25 years to
change the socio- economic and environmental conditions of Ralegan Siddhi, a
village on border of Pune and Ahmednagar disticts
Twenty-five years before the village wore a gloomy situation when
agnculture was rain-fed and women and rual folks bad to trav'el miles to fetch two
buckets of drinking water and collect firewood for cooking on way. Entire Eco
systems that support soil and water destroyed. Shortage of water led to poor hygiene
and water contamination caused wide spread jaundice, gasto ententis, and otber
water borne diseases. Unhygienic disposal of garhige and smtlage caused malana
epidemic Dependence on government to fulfill their needs, destroyed their
responsibility towards their own welfare and will to *vork for tbeir betterment.
Today Ralegan Siddhi is a changed village and bears a picture of prosperity
and no longer caught in the aftermath of development process that encourages
destruction of local resources. It has risen above its problems. Its inspiration and
enlightenment have pierced the shrouds of malaise that hung over the village.
Lush green fields full crops outlined with trees. Water seen gushing into fields and
small water storages dot lands everywhere. Key to change was through watershed
development and conservation practices and self-regulation in water use. Water is
common property resource and used equitably by the users' cooperatives. Water is
used scientifically. Irrigation passbooks are distributed to members and water
supplied in turns. Recovery of water charges is by willful payment.
Drinking water is available through bore wells. Community has imposed restriction
on irrigation bore wells. Hand pumps and water supply taps are provided to
households and stand posts installed. No woman walks more than 100 meters to
fetch drinking water. Community and household toilets are constructed improved
sanitation and hygiene conditions. Illnesses are under control. Entire community
cleans and sweeps village streets and toilets regularly More than 400,000 trees are
planted to protect environment. Villagers are proud to narrate their success stories to
neighbors who visit them to learn and emulate. The message is spreading
countrywide and Mr Anna Hazare has turned into a legend.

The TSC is in the early stages of implementation and no major activities have been
undertaken under this program. The SGBC and the TSC     are the current
environmental sanitation related programs in the State Table 3.29.

3.12.5. Emerging Challenges in Environmental Sanitaton
Despite huge investments and efforts by GOM in the past the current environmental
sanitation situation in the State is not encouraging. The SGBC launched two years
ago is showing signs of being fiuitful, but is yet m its initial years and needs to be
carefully monitored and strengthened, as needed. One of the biggest development
challenges in the present millennium is the provision of hygienic sanitation facilities
for all. The past and the current policies and programs have thrown open the critical
issues that need to be addressed in order to provide safe sanitation to all in a realistic
time frame.
The challenge is to find appropriate approaches to addressing the issues enlisted
below:



*  How to trigger the mindset change that will lead to a change in deeply rooted
traditional sanitation practices (ex Open defecation etc)9
*  What are the vanous interventions -required to effect changes in sanitation
behavior (ex Non-lhand washling etc)?
*  What factors promote deimand for improved sanitation facilities'?
.  What factors motivate or discourage people from  investing in improved
sanitation and hygienic practices?
*  How can subsidies be most effectively used to facilitate and tngger the change?
*  What is the role of individuals, households, communities and local governments
in this effort9
*  What is needed to ensure sustainability of the changed practce?
WVha.cdoes it take to scale up successful sanitation programs?
3.12.6. New Sanitation Strategy of GOM:
In order to find appropriate answers to the above challenges the GOM has studied
vanous successful projects in the country and abroad and held discussions with
vanous stakeholders The key messages that emerged in this process are listed below
and form the basis for development of the new sanitation strategy of GOM.
The key emerging messages are
* The focus should be to stop open defecation rather than building latrmes. This
approach requires a community commitment and recognizes that enforcing good
sanitation behavior requires collective and individual comrnitment
* Focus on creating the demand for sanitation services at the conmimnity rather thar.
at the individual level
* Provide and pernit a vanety of technological options.
* Self-realization rather than a fiscal subsidy provide the sustainable trigger.
* If fiscal incentives are to be used, it should be targeted at the community level.
* Involvement of (Local) Government in strategic partnership with NGOs/CBOs is
critical for success at scale.
3.12.7. Long Term Objective
Total sanitation goes beyond the installation and use of latrines. It means
encouraging commumnties to change existing habits and behavior pattems by using
and maintaining hygiemc latrines, washing hands, keeping food and water covered,
using safe water, and maintaining a clean environment. Total Sanitation can only be
successful when every member of the village community participates, and the
commumty recognizes that there are negative externalities from non-participants and
that 100% participation is essential for success.
3.12.8. Medium Term Objective
Although it is well understood that Total Sanitation is the ultimate goal, the critical
first step is to get people to move from open defecation to fixed-point defecation,
even if it is at the bottom of the sanitation ladder using simple makeshift latrines. In
this context, it is important that commtunities understand the adverse consequences
of current open defecation practices and the implications of poor disposal of faeces,
and switch to fixed-point defecation and adopt improved hygienic practices
44



Framework for Collaboration.
In India the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission is a Government
initiative aiming to transform the water and sanitation sector by replacing hard
engineering attitudes by social objectives It has succeeded in increasing both water
and sanitation coverage, and yet many new water sources are now not working due
to unclear ownership and inadequate maintenance.  The lesson is that while
chansmatic leadershlip and political will at the top can start a process, its
sustainability will ultimately depend upon effecive empowerment processes. These
processes can help people to successfully contend witlh age-old attitudes and
practices, and with the vested interests that are threatened by change.
The role of the State remains indispensable to provide an enabling legal and
regulatory envwromnent and foster access to safe water and sanitation to all citizens;
the partnership between the household or community and the other factors is based
on clear roles and responsibilities of each partner and fair rules of the game;
community involvement is a gradual learning process that must be envisaged with a
long-termn perspective
The principles are:
o Partner communities will be consulted before any watsan schemes are
formulated;
o When undertaking watsan schenmes, the stakeholders will put an emphasis on a
process rather than on a project oriented approach;
o Sanitation will receive equal importance and made integral part of watsan
schemes;
o Women must be involved in all stages of watsan schemes to ensure effective
management;
o Community organizations will get a legal status within an enabling environment
allowing them to operate in security, own the assets or control the source;
o All stakeholders, particularly partner communities will have access and right to
all infornation concerning the scheme to achieve an equal and transparent
relationship in watsan scheme;
o Indigenous leadership wherever available will be strongly encouraged and
supported in all stages of watsan schemes;
o The stakeholders will incorporate traditional/local knowledge, skills and socio-
cultural practices available in the comnmunity to maximize the effectiveness of
watsan schemes;
o The stakeholders will strongly take into consideration the views of partner
communities in choosing the most appropriate watsan technology and level of
services;
o Water prices and tanffs based on equitable and non-discriminatory water
consumption patterns between users will ensure sustainability of community
watsan schemes;
o The assets created will be owned and maintained by the partner community;
o The stakeholders will respect the watsan needs of the rural communities first
before exploiting water resources for urban, agribusiness and industrial purposes;
o The stakeholders will actively promote the protection and conservation of natural
sources when undertaking watsan schemes.



3.12.9. Key Principles for Achieving Total Sanitation
The proposed strategy is based on the following key principles
* A paradigm shift in the approach to sanitation promotion, from construction of
latrines to a focus on behavioral change leading to the elimination of open
defecation
* A shlift in focus from targeting individuals and households to targeting the
communitv
* Related to this, the shilft from individual constru6tion subsidies to community
rewards
* Greater emphasis on personal hygiene and enviromnental sanitation as essential
pre-requisites for achiieving total sanitation
* A shift in the responsibility for implementation and scale up from  the
Central/State Govermnent to lower tiers of Govermnent
GOM has developed this new strategy during the last quarter of the year 2002 and
decided to field test the same in selected districts (Ahmednagar and Nanded, both
having TSC grants). Based on the lessons emerging fTom the field test, the strategy
would be refined and made applicable to all the distncts m the state, GOM has
intimated this new strategy to the GOI and requested for flexibility to use the TSC
grants for the same, in the TSC distncts.
3.12.10. GOM's Approach under the Proposed Project:
It is expected that this new strategy would replace the current TSC formiat and would
nim parallel to the Sant Gadge Baba Cleanliness Campaign. Both the new strategy
and SGBC compliment each other well and the new strategy is almost a
concentrated sub-set of the SGBC.
As explained m the objectives, the open defecation by human beings is the single
largest component that mifluences the rural living environment across the state.
Other issues like solid waste, liquid waste etc affect the enviromnent only in the
larger and denser settlements and are not a universal problem like the open human
defecation. The new strategy would encourage and facilitate all rural coununumties to
focus on elimnination of 100% open defecation and adoption of hygiene practices in a
given settlement through their own efforts, in a way they want to An underlying
assumption is that those communities who solve their open defecation aspects would
also be motivated to solve the other environmental sanitation aspects through their
own collective action.
The SGBC, in any case encourages communities to solve a range of environmental
sanitation issues as enumerated in the list. Thus, both the new strategy and the
SGBC compliment each other well and would encourage the rural communities to
address their environmental sanitation issues on their own.
The GOM would provide and educate the communities about a range of technology
choices that the communities could afford and adopt, as per the given social,
economic; climatic and geographlic conditions The GOM would also encourage the



private sector / local market sectors to identify local technologies and make
available the know-how and requisite skills and materials for implementing and
maintaining these technology choices.  Further, the GOM  would monitor the
effectiveness of these technologies and advice the communities and local markets as
necessary
The expected impact on the environment through the proposed interventions and
possible mitigation measures where needed are summanzed below:

The Basic Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Requirement.
Field experience and studies suggest that there is a minimum quantity of safe
water required for a person to dnnk, prepare food, ensure personal cleanliness and
hygiene and use of an effective latnne. Drinking and cooking need 10-15 liters per
day. Hygiene and sanitation needs are less precise and vary between cultures
typically 20-35 liters per day. Thls gives a total basic requirement of 30-50 liters of
water per day, for a person who tnderstands their personal hygiene needs and uLses a
latrine.
For clanty and consistency, a single basic figureais very usefiul, even if some
people may dispute the precise figure tused and even if actual usage is higher in
pLaces with an increased level of development It is suggesu'd that each person in
the world, as a minimum, needs a 40 liters of water per day. This figure corresponds
well to the figures currently used by the World Health Organization and other
development agencies and governments.
In addition to a minimum of water, each person needs adequate hygiene
education and the use of a latnne.  Sanitation is one of the most important
interventions in improving the human condition. Similarly, hygiene plays a critical
role and must be seen as a major contributor to human well being. Many agencies
do not include hygiene and sanitation in the Basic Requirement, and consequently
hygiene and sanitation are neglected.
The Basic Water, Saniitation and Hygiene Requirement for a person is
therefore defined as adequate personal hygiene, use of a latrine, and 40 liters of
water per day.

4. POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMISISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
This chapter bnefly discLIsses the environmenltal aspects of the project and the
measures envisaged to protect the same while ensuring sustainable and safe drinking
water to rural areas of the State Providilg adequate drnnking water guarantees good
sanitation, hygiene and health. However, it is imperative that the project does not
cause any adverse environmental impact, and wherever it has a negative impact
corrective measures need to be built into the project design. Govermnent of India
and the State government have already laid down environment protection clauses
under various Acts and Rules.
4.1. National Water Policy
Constitution of India enjoins the States to take measures to protect an-d improve the
environment and to safeguard the natural resources including fauna and flora.
Article 51A(g) of the constitution makes it fundamental duty of the individual
citizen to protect and improve the environment.
Recognizing that water is a prirnary natural resoLirce, a basic human need and the
precious asset, the policy provides for following guidelines in planning and
operation of water resource project which is of relevance to the Maharashtra Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project
* Water is a scarce and precious national resource to be planned developed and
conserved as such and on an integrated and environmentally sound basis, keeping
in view the needs of the State
* Water should be made available to water short areas by transfer from other areas
including transfer from river basins on a national perspective
* Water resources development project should be as far as possible planned and
developed as a multipurpose project Provision of drinking water should be a
primary consideration.
* The study of the impact of the project during construction and later on human
lives, settlements, occupation and economic and others aspects should be an
essential component of project planning
* In the planning implementation and operation of the project the preservation of
quality of environment and the ecological balance should be a primary
consideration
* There should be an integrated and multi disciplinary approach to the planning
formulation clearance and implementation of the project.
* A special effort should be made to investigate and formulate projects either in or
for the benefits of inhabited or tribal areas.
* In the planning and operation of the system, water allocation should be broadly as
follow
* Drinking water
. Irrigation
* Hydro power
* Navigation
* Industrial and other use
Thus dnnking water has first pnonty in any water resources development project
and efforts would be to achieve this.

NATIONAL WATER POLICY
National Water Policy (1987) emphasizes the role of water as a prime
natural resource and stresses the need for the national perspective m
water resource planning and development. It recognizes the need to
provide adequate drinking water fecilities in both urban and rural areas
and sanitation facilities to 80% of urban and 25% of rural population.
For maximnizing water quality, the policy recommends observation,
augmentation, maximizing retention and minimizing loss of resource.
On groundwater development, the policy recommends integrated and
coordinated development of surface and groundwater and their
conjunctive use. Importance of fixing the water rates to convey the
scarcity value of the resource especially laid down in the policy. The
policy further sates that the water rates should be fixed so as to cover
the annual operation and maintenance charges and part of the capital
cost. Involvement of farmers in management of water system and in
correction of water rates is encouraged. The policy also touches upon
the issue of water quality and states that both surface and groundwater
quality should be monitored regularly and improved in a phased
manner. Other important recommendations of the policy are to develop
water zones atlas of the Country to restrict economy aspect based on
constraints imposed by water availability and improvement of water
efficiency through education, regulation, incentives and disincentives.
It is claimed that between 1000 and 1700 cu. meters per person! per
annum water availability, the region confronts water stress, where
water shortages are more permissive, and water management becomes
formidable. With less than 1000 cu. meters per person availability a
region becomes water scarcity, and where chronic water shortages
threaten economic development and human health and well-being.
Below 500 cubic meters per person a region crosses water barrier and
region faces water scarcity. India is among the Countiy to form into
the water stress category by year 2025



4.2. Ministry of Environment and Forest
Ministry of Environment and Forest is the nodal agency at National level, whiclh
monitors the environmental impact of different projects. Thle provisions in thie
following Acts ensure protection of environment.
Forest (Conservation) Act (I 930)

Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
Air (Prevention and Control) Act, 1981
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
The Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991
If the polluter pollutes the water in the area, beyond the permissible limits as laid
down in the dnnking water standards, the MOEF has powers to control through
punitive measures if required. MOEF has also declared certain areas as notified
where clearance is required for taking any activity that has relevance to the
environment.
Further, consequent to the Supreme Court judgment GOI has constituted Central
Ground Water Authority, which notifies areas where ground water is polluted or
over exploited.
4.3. State Level Provisions
Government of Maharashtra has passed following Acts dealing with protection of
Environment.
*  Maharashtra Act XVI of 1970 viz. Maharashua Prevention of Water Pollution
Act, 1969
*  Maharashtra Act XLVIII of 19.76 viz. Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage
Board Act, 1976 (as anended twice).

be engaged in or employed for any other person for manually carrying human
excreta or (b) constmict or maintain a dry latrine.
(e) Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission Act 1998 recommends that
electricity tariff charges for RWS Schemes on metered basis at Rs 0 99 per uLut.
In the meantime till meters are installed, the Gram Panchayat would be charged
at Rs 20 per HP per month for RWS Schemes
(f) Criminal Procedure Code( Portion relevant to Protection of water bodies)
(g) Bombay Police Act (relevant portion regarding ptmishment for spoiling
environmental sanitaton in public palaces)
(h) Government Resolution for compulsory construction of toilets in new houses
in rural areas
(i) . Government Resolution for construction of community toilets
Maharashtra Ground water (Regulation) Act 1993 for protecting drinking
water weDls. Annexure IV.
4.4. Maharashtra Groundwater (Regulation for Drinking water) Act 1993:
Government of Maharasbtra is the only state in the cotmtry, which has enacted
Groundwater (Regulation for Drinking water) Act, 1993 applicable to entire State
for protecting drinking water wells. The Act provides for
i.    Prohibition on construction of wells within a certain distance unless
certified by appropriate authority
ii.   Declaration of water scarcity areas every year, depending on rainfafl
pattern for such a period as may be specified
iii.  Declaration of over exploited water sheds and prohibition sinking of
wells in over exploiied watershed except for drinking water wells
iv.    Prohibition of extraction of water from existing wells or closing down
existing wells for a certain period with suitable provisions for payment of
compensation.
4.5. Chemical Quality Laboratories
Well established chemical quality monitoring system exists both for groundwater
and surface water. Samples are routinely collected and analyzed by GSDA, and
CGWB under Hydrology Project. GSDA has established Level II+ and Level II
laboratories at 6 regional centers besides testing kits at each district.  These
laboratories have a capacity to test 600 samples each i.e. 3600 samples every year.
By increasmg the number of Chemists this could be increased to about 6000 samples
a year. CGWB has laboratory facilities to test about 1200 samples a year. Special
samples are collected during epidemic period and in affected areas as industrial
pollution.
GSDA has established a net work of 3370 key wells as Base line stations and
groundwater samples are collected once a year. Out of these 3370 key wells 975
wells are selected as Trend Stations and 578 as Trend cum Surveillance stations
where water samples are collected and analyzed 4 times a year. Further after setting
up of all the laboratones, GSDA has analyzed one round of samples during 2001.



For further strengtlhening of existing water quality testing facilities and setting up of
Mini Labs, GOM   has issued a circular No. WQM  200l/PK/237/PP/12 dated
10' September 2001 lI is planned to create infrastrLctLire for water quality testing at
village level or nearby Pnmary Health Center and even utilize the lab facilities at
schools and colleges
4.6. Bacteriological Analysis
Public Health Department of the state government collects about 7.5 lakh samples
on routine and about I lakh sampie un specific basis These are tested and analyzed
at their regional and districts level laboratones.  Public Health Department has
planned to set up 30 chemical labs at each Primary Health Centers for quick water
analysis of water samples. Besides National Environmental Engmeering Research-
Institute (NEER1) also conducts sampling and analysis for specific pollution studies.
Thus about one million water samples are collected and analyzed annually in the
state.
4.7. Effectiveness of Current Programs and Policies
Government of Maharashtra continuously morntors water quantity, water quality and
enviromental sanitation issues while implementing various programs and corrective
measures are taken wherever required based on the feedback from monitonng
system where the drinking water availability is less than 20 LPCD, three pronged
action are taken: a) Increase the supply through rejuvenation of the source by
conventional and unconventional measures b) Augment the existing source by
increasing the groundwater recharge through rainwater harvesting, and c) Create
supplementary source to meet the demand.
Government of Maharashtra msists 100% cost contribution for individual
connections and provides 30% subsidy for stand post connections.
Data on chen;ical and bactenological analysis of water samples by GSDA, Public
Health Department, CGWB and NEERI is considered while preparing the master
plan for providmg safe drinking water. In Chandrapur, Amravati and Ahmednagar
Districts, Government of Maharashtra is implementing 29 Regional Rural Water
Supply schemes based on surface water since good. quality ground water- is not
available, with financial outlay of Rs. 300 crores from HUDCO.
In other areas where groundwater from deeper aquifers has higher concentration of
fluoride / nitrate, limited quantity of good quality ground water from other sources is
supplied to meet drinking water demand and poor quality water is used for other
purposes. In such areas, Government policy recom-mends adoption of Rainwater
Harvesting. However, m the event where this is not possible, regional rural water
supply schemes based on surface water as sources are planned, as in case of
Yavatrnal. The above measures, although based on supply driven policy,
nevertheless address the issue of adequate supply of good quality drinking water.
4.8. Evolution of Policies and Institutions
Summary of the historical evolution of Government of Mahrashtra's policies and
institutions that implement these policies on the ground are given in Table 4.1.

During the consultation meetings various issues related to quantity and quality of
drinking water, as we]l as sanitation, and hygiene were discussed. People's views
were collected on these.
5.1. Public Consultation at Nagpur
A special public consultation meeting was organized at Nagpur on February 03,
2003 where about 133 people including 37 women and 10 BPL family members
from village Khopdi in Mouda taluka participated. During the meet the different
project components were explained and people's views for their participation and
59



involvement were invited. The participants enthusiastically expressed their views on
each of the project componenits. The villagers opined that since ground water in the
area is polluted and inadequate dunng summer, they would prefer dual use of fresh
water for drinking and poor quality water for other uses Participants mentioned that
quality monitoring is needed and that they would be willing to do this at GP level.
As regards sanitatnon and hygiene, there are very few toilets and practice of open
defecation continues. There are no soak pits nor sullage drains, villagers prefer
individual toilets to community toilets, want good roads, soak pits and sullage
drains. Interestingly all the participa1ts including those belonging to BPL families
are willing to pay their contribution in ..sh and labor required under the project.
Highlights of the deliberations at all the consultation meetings held including the
one at Nagpur, are discussed below. Details of the public consultation meeting at
Nagpur are given in the Annexure V.
5.2. Water and Related Issues
5.2.1. Source of Water
In all the 5 districts ground water is the main source of water supply. In Thane and
Satara districts where groundwater quality is poor surface water is used for drinking
and ground water is used for other pturposes. Open wells are the main source of
water supply in Yavatmal, Satara and Thane districts while hand pump and
borewells are common in other districts. Individual and private connections are
maximum in Nagpur. Water supply through tankers is prevalent in Osmanabad and
Yavatmal.
5.2.2. Water Availability
More than 70 % of the households in Osmanabad and 42 % households in Yavatmal
consume less than 2OLPCD. More than half the households in Nagpur, Thane and
Yavatmal consume 20 to 60 LPCD and 24 % households in Satara use more than 80
LPCD. This reflects the status of availability of clean water in these districts. In
water scare season consumption of water decreases by 15-20 % and use of water for
other than drinking are curtailed due to short supply.
5.2.3. Time Spent on Fetching Water
About 2 to 5 hours are spent on fetching of drinking water in most of the districts. In
Yavatmal (388%) and Satara (26%) households spend more than 5 hours in collecting
water. Except in Nagpur and Thane, men are involved in collecting water. In Nagpur
and Thane, men collect water in case of less than 25% of the households.
5.2.4. Rainwater Harvesting
Very few households practice rainwater harvesting at household level except in
Nagpur and Satara. In Thane and Yavatmal districts a few households do rainwater
harvesting. In Osmanabad a relatively high percentage of households have reported
that they do rainwater harvesting which is a crude method of storing rainwater.
60



5.2.5. Hygiene
In all 5 distncts respondents surveyed follow good hygiene practice like washing
hands before and after defecation In Osmanabad and Satara 100 % of households
wash hands before and after eating
5.2.6. Water Storage
Households store water at more than one place, in kitchen and bathroom. Some
house holds store water in front of the house or open yards in small cement cistern
Villagers are not careful about not contaminatmg drinking water by using ladles or
any other device to take out water from the container. About 88% of households use
glass or mug to take out water. In Thane more than 60% households use ladles.
5.2.7. Disposal of Kitchen Waste
Except in Yavatmal more than 50% households throw kitchen waste out side the
house. Very often pits are dug outside the house for disposing kitchen waste to be
used later as compost. In villages where there are designated waste disposal areas,
wastes are segregated into kitchen waste and other waste. Most of the households
use bins or containers tc dispose other household waste and throw it in a garbage
place.
5.2.8. Waste Water Discharge
Most villages do not have proper drainage system and as such very few household
discharge their wastewater into the drains For majority of households the
wastewater is allowed to flow on the roads. Soak pits are small 2x3 ft. shallow
structures constracted outside the bathroom/kitchen. These soak pits are normally
covered but kept open during monsoon to allow storm water to wash away
wastewater.
5.3 Latrines
Percentage of house holds having latrines is quite low and lowest in Yavatmal and
Satara and highest in Osmanabad (32%). In case of Osmanabad after the earthquake
in 1993, during rehabilitation program, latrine is constructed in each house.
However, most of these latrines are not used and wherever they are used, they are
used by both men and women. More than 75% households in Satara, Nagpur and
Thane are having latrine facilities and are actually using these. In Osmanabad and
Yavatmal actual use of latrines is low mainly due to scarcity of water for flushing
and improper construction and drainage. In Nagpur, Osmanabad and Yavatmal
districts most of the latrines are individual while in Thane and Satara these were
constructed by Gram Panchayat and cost of each latrine ranges between Rs 3000 and
Rs 10000/-. Large percentages of latrines are constructed under various State and
Central government's schemes like Indira Awas Yojana, Gram Shouchalaya Yojana
and in Osmanabad under the earthquake rehabilitation program.



5.4 Open Defecation
Households who do not have latrine facilities practice open defecation and very few
use public toilets. People, especially the women complain many problems in using
open defecation. They have to get up very early and have no privacy. During rainy
season defecation areas become slushy
5.5. Health
There are no reports of any outbreak of major illness. However, incidences of water
related diseases like jaundice, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, and cholera are
reported in almost all villages in all districts. Maximum number of households
suffering from water borne diseases are mn Yavatmal (85.7%) and Nagpur (68.6%).
People are aware of water borne diseases and their symptoms but are not taking
adequate precautionary measures.
Interestingly, significant expenditure is on health in most of the villages. In
Yavatmal, Satara, and Osmanabad average expenditure of the household on health is
Rs 500 per year while in Thane it is Rs. 500 to Rs 1000 per year and in Nagpur it is
more than Rs 1000 per year. Majority of the households do not have PHC in the
village though auxiliary nurses and PHC doctors visit the village once or twice a
week. Private clinics are available but they are costly.
5.6. Effects of Groundwater Draft - Conflicts between Users
In the drought prone area of western Maharashtra, over exploitation has taken place
to support sugarcane and horticulture including grape cultivation. In Sangli and
Satara district 25% and 21% of the total irrigated area is under sugarcane cultivation.
In case of Kolhapur, 68% of the total area is under sugarcane cultivation.
Many villages experience drinking water scarcity during the summer months.
Paradoxically, the problem is acute in districts with high rainfall because of water
intensive cropping pattern. While rice accounts for 71.68% of the total irrigated area
in Ratnagiri and Thane, wheat, jowar and sugarcane are the major crops grown in
other districts.
In the five sample districts, since agriculture is mostly rain fed, there are no conflicts
regarding usage of water. However, in Ashagad village of Thane district, there are
distillery units and pharmaceutical units, which get water from a nearby Raithali
Dam, through an exclusive pipeline, thereby not affecting the drinking water
resource of the village.
Thus the only conflict is between irrigation and drinking water. This could be
resolved by adopting micro-irrigation for water intensive crops like sugarcane,
banana, grape and orange.



5.7. Source Protection
Most of the villages do not have any measure for source protection and the wasted
water flows into the nearby open fields where it stagnates and forms a water pool,
which can be a source for mosquito breeding
However, in a few villages Gram Panchayat / self-imposed restrctions are in place
This range from not allowing bathing and washing activities around the source.
5.8. Watershed Management
In Osmanabad the Agriculture Department and Irrigation Department have carried
out civil works like Contmuous Contour Trenches (CCT) underground bandharas,
cement bandharas, KT weirs (Kolhapur Type), percolation tanks, storage tanks,
nallah bunds etc. for groundwater recharge under watershed development program
In Nagpur District the Salwa GP has checked some small 'streams through small
earthen check dams for rainwater conservation. In Mohgaon Zilpi also Vanrai
bandharas (small earthen check dams) have been initiated and a proposal for roof top
water harvesting has been mooted by the GP to ZP.
Young Men Work for Water And Environment At Hiware Bazar
Yashawant Krishi Gram and Panlot Vikas Sanstha at Hiware Bazar a small
village 17 Km from Ahmednagar, was launched by a group of youngsters led by Mr.
Popatrao Pawar, who was obsessed with the drean to reverse socio-ecological
degradation, and worsening village conditions. Afforestation and water conservation
were the key issues that haunted the group. Tree planting covers all hillocks and all
streams plugged and depleting ground water resources recharged by percolation
tanks, contour bunding, Nalla bunding and even small tanks. This assured drinking
water to entire community even during summer in drought years when rainfall is just
60 mm. Self-regulated crop husbandry practices and crop selection ensured income
to all. Dry land horticulture crops replace sugarcane.
Animal waste is converted into biogas and village garbage into compost. The village
has put ban on all activities that affect water availability and environment. Do
drilling of bore well that affect shallow drinking water wells, no sugarcane and
banana cultivation that require more water and results water depletion in drinking
water, and no selling of land to outsider or land lords.
Low cost latrines are constructed to protect sanitation. Hygiene habits are inculcated
through extension, group discussions and education to adults and children. Twenty-
five Women groups are formed for diversified activities.
Fear of drought and wait for govemment help are matter of history. Hiware Bazar
has taken the legacy of Mr. Annasaheb Hazare of Ralegan Siddhi to further heights
and now the village itself has become a role model to emulate..
No rainwater harvesting is done in Nagpur and Satara sample villages as per the
surveyed households. In Thane and Yavatmal there is a marginal proportion that do
rainwater harvesting. Conversely in Osmanabad more percentage of households
have reported that they do rainwater harvesting, but it must be noted that these are
not the conventional techniques of water harvesting



5.9. Environmental Monitoring Indicators
The Health Department is responsible for carrying out periodic monitoring of
drinking water However, in practice the frequency was abysmally low (once a
year) in many cases. Recently, the Government of Maharashtra carried out chemical
analysis of water samples from all the villages selected for sample study. The
Health Department issues 'Red' cards and 'Green' cards to villages based on the
maintenance of source, regular chlorine dose, maintenance of water supply scheme
appurtenances, etc. Red Card is issued for poor performance and green for Good
Chemical analysis is not mandatory but bacteriological analysis is mandatory and
has to be done once in a month. The PHC is assigned the responsibiliy of collecting
the sample from the villages covered under its jurisdiction. Multi Purpose Worker
(MPW) collects the sample on behalf of PHC. The Health Department/Distnct
Health Laboratory/State Public Health Laboratory, Pune, does the bacteriological
analysis. Chemical analysis is carried out only when complaints regarding
contamination are received by the PHC. Dismfection is carried out periodically by
the Gram Panchayat under the supervision of PHC through MPWs. Tri-chlorate
(TCL) powder, medi-chlor, etc are used as dismfectant with varied frequency.
*     Once / Twice a day durng monsoon.
*     Once / Twice a week during other seasons.
5.10. Environmental Sanitation
More than 83% of the villages have roads up to the village settlement. Quite a few
villages of Latur, Buldhana and Nagpur are not connected by road. Almost all
villages do not have nucca internal roads. The intemal roads normally are a mix of
pucca and kutchha roads. Almost all the villages do not have a planned storm water
drainage system. At best, roadside drains have been/are being constructed under
government schemes, partially covering the village. In villages where such drains
exist, maintenance is poor due to disposal of waste in the drains, which thereby
chokes it.
In case of Bhogji in Osmanabad, wastewater was found to be flowing on the road in
spite of presence of drains. It is pertinent to note that Osmanabad had suffered a
massive earthquake in 1993, which had altered the topography of various villages
and the region. However, in Bojurwada village of Nagpur district most of the
internal roads are metalled and storm water drainage system in the village are well
kept. In Mohgaon Zilpi of Nagpur district also, the internal roads and storm water
drainage system was pucca and well maintained. As most of the villages are pre-
dominantly agrarian in nature, the solid waste generated in the village is used as
manure. Many villages use the kitchen waste for cattle feeding. Generally, the well-
to-do families have a disposal pit in their backyard and they use the manure in their
own farms. The others have a common disposal pits and sell the manure produced
to the farm owners. The money earned is shared based on the number of cattle. No
segregation is practiced but plastic and paper component is insignificant.
The wastewater / sullage discharge is mostly done in the drains or it runs into the
road or drains into soak pits or used in kitchen garden. Almost no village has any
sewerage system. In quite a few villages, the wastewater is drained close to the
64



water source Wastewater / sullage discharge (and stagnation) is not perceived as a
major problem by the villagers It is however, considered a problem if access is
hindered.
The percentage of households having individual/community latnnes in rural areas is
quite low. At many locations, the households do not use their individual latrnes due
to shortage of water.  Water scarcity also prevents use of flush toilets. The
wastewater from the latrine goes to the soak pits and in some cases into the septic
tank. At places, where individual latrines exist, but are not used, instead are used as
a room for storage purposes. In some districts, construction of latrnes is difficult
due to the presence of rocky terrain, thereby making the digging of pits difficult
Public / comnmon toilets are not perceived as a solution because of poor
maintenance.
5.11. Key Institutional And Policy Issues
The field visits brought out many key institutional and policy issues, which would
be relevant for the proposed project. Some of the key issues that emerged durng
interactions with the institutions at different levels as well as with other stakeholders
includmg intended beneficiaries and NGOs are as follows.
a. Unclear Mandate and Role of the VWSCs
While the current institutional arrangement envisages a central role in water
management for the VWSCs, in reality these VWSCs are playing second fiddle to
the Sarpanch and the Gram Sewaks who are the more influential people in the
village. The VWSC role is limited to providing advice when necessary, to the GP.
While in Osmanabad, the formation of VWSC and its role was better umderstood, in
other districts, even if the VWSC were forned, they were not active, and few people
knew about when they were formed, formation process and their activities. In many
places, the selection process, and specially the membership of women, was treated
as a mere ritual that needed to be done. In addition the VWSCs were found to have
inadequate skills, specially technical and financial, to take up the range of
responsibilities expected of them. Osmanabad was different primarily because the
villagers were generally more informed and politically conscious in some of the
villages. Secondly a local NGO had started preliminary mobilization of the
community and was framing clear roles and responsibilities as well as outlining
transparent management processes for the VWSCs. This mobilization process had
brought the VWSC and its members into focus.
b. Poor Operations and Maintenance
While breakdown maintenance is being carried out, regular operation and
maintenance of schemes was not satisfactory. This has been brought out by various
evaluations and reports, and was also witnessed during field survey. In all districts
there were several defunct schemes, partly because of poor siting and scheme
selection and partly because of poor operation and maintenance, and due to over-
emphasis on meeting targets. Lack of funds was often cited as a reason for this state
of affairs and was constraining even very small repairs to be camed out in time. The
overburdening of the Village Water Person and Gram Sewak and the unclear roles
65



and responsibilities of the VWSC coupled with poor teclnical capacities available
locally could be other key reasons for neglect of 0 & M
c. Lack of Participation
The Zilla Parishad (Water Supply Division) and the Gram Panchayat were aware of
the proposed RWSS 11 project and were very keen to bring that project to their
village/district. Between themselves (ZP and GP) they had selected the schemes for
the village and even prepared rough estimates of costs and per capita contributions.
On interaction with the intended beneficiaries it appeared that the scheme selection
process was not transparent, nor participative, and very few -villagers -(other than
some GP members, Gram Sewaks and influential people) knew any details about the
scheine, the service levels to be provided and the shift towards a community-demand
driven approach. In many cases, these selected options were not the most
appropriate or viable, nor were they based on any assessment of "willingness to
pay".
Another example of this rather unilateral approach was the fact that in some of the
villages, some hamlets located at a distance from the main settlements were not
being considered within the opted scheme, primarily to reduce costs, even though
those hamlets were a part of the GPs. While the scheme selection process is intended
to be initiated afresh within the proposed project, this issue is being highlighted to
focus on the challenge ahead to convince and consequently build capacities of these
institutions to adopt a community-centered demand driven approach.
d. Participation of Women and Marginal Communities
Both in the VWSC and in the Gram Panchayats, the number of seats for women
were duly filled. However, whether women effectively participate is the key
question. The picture that has emerged is mixed. In some villages, there is active
participation of women and the mandatory reservation of posts has provided avenues
for women to be heard and participate in decision-making. In the remaining villages,
women remain "passive" participants, and their participation being used to fill a
procedural need to be eligible for projects like RWSS II. As far as marginal
communities go, distance of hamlets is the primary constraint for participation in
GPs and the VWSC as well as in information sharing and awareness. Perhaps one
needs to look at separate VWSCs for hamlets that are located far away from the
main settlement.
e. Role of Iformal Institutions
In the districts visited, there were very few informal institutions. Amongst them one
existing Mahila Mandals was the most prevalent. In addition some of the villages
had Self Help Groups, charitable and religious organizations. However, these
informal institutions were either non-finctional or irregular or have been ftmctioning
without any focus and understanding of their mandate and roles. Saving, thrift,
investment and income enhancing activities have been initiated in some villages.
These groups have also been in the decision processes in the village. But in their
own ways these forums have provided women an opportunity to meet, interact and
discuss issues important to them and have the potential to play a more dynamic role.
The RWSS 1I sees a key role to be played by women in the Women Development
C6't



program, in the VWSC (wlhichi is to have majority women) and in monitoring and
evaluation. These activities/initiatives could be galvanized through these formts
f. Need to Build Capacities
In all the districts, it was evident that the existing Institutions, both formal and
informal, would need a sustained capacity building and support for them to take Up
the roles and responsibilities envisaged for them withun RWSS ll. Capacities would
need to be built in different aspects (legal, financial, technical, managenal,
comnmunity mobilization and development, documentation and reporting as well as
monitoring and evaluation) at all levels and in different stages of the project. A
critical component would be interaction with other villagers and cross leamings as
well as field based training programs and a sustained communication campaign. In
addition to building capacities, a certain amount of support, preferably through local
NGOs, would be essential for the village to go through the learning experience and
emerge confident and able to handle the project implementation and 0 and M
independently.
g. Cost Recovery and Willingness to Pay
Cost recovery was one of the key isssii of concern in RWSS I and the proposed
RWSS II hopes to not only improve cost recovery, it also aims at the community
contributing "at least 10%" of capital cost and 100% of the 0 & M cost This
contribution should ideally be based on the community's ability and willingness to
pay. However, the field survey revealed that the beneficiaries were already
informed, through various sources, that they had to pay only 10% of the capital cost.
On the other hand, ability to pay was a big concern for marginal communities and
BPL families who wanted to see a more flexible approach for community
contribution in the project vis a vis cash and labor.
It was revealed that wherever stake holder from BPL / tribal families are unable to
contribute 10% of the capital cost and 1005 or O&M cost, well to do people in the
village have agreed to pay the shortfall.
h. Monitoring
For monitoring and surveillance of water quality, chemical analysis is not mandatory
but bacteriological analysis is required to be done at least once in a month by the
PHC. In practice the frequency of monitoring the water quality was extremely low
(once a year) in many cases. Chemical analysis is carried out only when complaints
regarding contamination have been received by the PHC. The monitoring and
surveillance is done by the PHC, whose primary responsibility is providing health
care services to the villages covered under its jurisdiction. The samples get analyzed
and the results are sent to the District Health Office for compilation, thereby loosing
valuable time in alerting the authorities responsible for water supply.
Regular monitoring and evaluation of state and central programs, schemes, operation
and maintenance is weak, especially at the village level where the people/institutions
responsible are not adequately trained for the task.

i. Source Sustainability
Although Maharashtra's position in terms of macro ground water availability
appears satisfactory, many areas have problems of progressive decline of water
tables, mainly due to over-exploitation of ground water for agnculture purpose.
Food security considerations have resulted in manifold increase in the number of
irrigation wells leading to over-exploitation of ground water. Practice like charging
for power on horse power basis rather than metered supply for agriculture purposes,
poor collection of electricity charges, direct subsidies for wells, cheap credit for
pump- sets have all worsened the drinking water situation but has helped the
agriculture production. With most of the state being dependent on groundwater for
rural water supply, their sustainability could be a major concern. In general, the
implementation of Grotndwater Act, 1993 has been ineffective. The GSDA does not
have the mandate for implementing the Groundwater Act (GWA) 1993 and it can
only advice the District Collector for implementing restrictions under the
Groundwater Act 1993. With no clear-cut definition of "water scarce" area the
district authorities responsible for implementing the Groundwater Act, 1993 face
political difficulties from strong and influential farmers' lobbies. There is a lack of
awareness amongst people regarding the sustamability issue and issues like cropping
pattern, withdrawal only up to the safe yield and better management rather than
development of groundwater needs to be addressed. A sustainable water
management practice with local community participation needs to be adopted.



6. HOT SPOTS AND ISSUES
Govemment of Maharashtra has been implementing Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Program in large scale in the State to alleviate drinking water scarcity and
improve sanitation conditions in the rural areas. There are difficult situations where
special action plans are necessary to manage these special problems These hotspots
relate to groundwater quantity, quality, samtationi, hygiene and environment
Different strategies and technological options would be evolved and implemented
for hot spots. It is necessary to understand and identify the hot spots
6.1. Hot Sjzts
From the review of the base line environmental data for the project distncts and the
issues that emerged during public consultations in 20 villages from 5 pilot distncts,
it is observed that the main and focal issues relate to water quantity, water quality,
sanitation and hygiene.
6.1.1. Over Exploited and Critical Areas
About 82% of the rural water supply schemes are based on the groundwater.
Groundwater assessment by GSDA shows that presently 27.02 % of the annual
replenishable recharge is utilized. As per revised groundwater assessment by
GSDA/CGWB, norms out of 1108 watershed units in the project area, 69 units
(6.2%) are over-exploited and 40 units (3.6%) are in critical category.

6.1.2. Areas with Progressive Decline of Water Levels
Consequent to excessive Groundwater Extraction, water tables are declining in many
areas, which has impaired the existing drinking water wells. As per the water table

6.2.1 (a). Water Quality Problems in Yavatmal District
The most comprehensive report on water quality assessment in Yavatmnal dist-ict
covenng 9,389 drinking water sources was prepared by NEERI. The chemical water
quality problems encountered in the district are: fluoride, nitrate, iron and total
dissolved solids (TDS). Arsenic was not detected in any water sample.
6.2.1 (b). Fluoride
The analysis of NEERI report indicates the following trend in fluoride concentration
in Yavatmal distnct.
o Only 1922 (20.5%) sources are within the desirable limit of fluonde (< 1-
mg/L)
o  6590 sources (70%) are between 1-1.5 mg/L fluonde concentration
o  877 (9.3%) sources have fluoride concentration > 1.5 mg/L
o  Out of 877 sources 406 sources have fluoride concentration > 2 but < 5 mg/L
o  Out of 877 sources 117 sources have fluoride concentration > 5 mg/L
Details of incidence high fluoride in drinking water, dental fluorosis and skeletal
fluorosis are given below.

The incidence of dental and skeletal fluorosis is based on the annual school
children health survey conducted by health department in 2001. (Thils is based on the
survey of the villages dunng the period of sample collection The health department
has conducted a school health survey in December 2002 that covered 92% of the
children and the results are yet to be analysed
a) However, in Yavatmal distnct only 26 skeletal cases have been reported whicil
also need to be confirmed clinically This could be because (a) people have shlifted
to low fluoride sources in affected distnct, (b) there is a substantial reduction in
fluoride concentration due to groundvvatzir recharge (c) due to changein dietary
habits.
It is therefore recommendedc that a comprehensive cluldren survey be conducted in
all villages where all sources have been affected by high fluonde and altemate
sources do not exist on govermpent records.  The survey should capture the
following: (1) incidence of fluorosis among children; (2) water sources being used
by users; (3) measur,eent of fuoride in all sQurces by field test kits
(government/private andL'used by community), and (4) dietary habits.
6.2.1 (c). Iron
801 (9% sources) water sources have iron concentration in excess of the permissible
limit of 1.0 mg/L  Ninety-five sources out of these 801 water sources have iron
concentration > 5 mg/L.
6.2.1. ( d). Nitrate
As per NEERI report one thousand seven hundred and nine (20% sources) water
sources have nitrate concentration in excess of the permissible limit of 100 mg/L.
6.2.1. (e). Total Dissolved Solids
As per NEERI report niety-five (1% of sources) water sources have TDS
concentration in excess of the maximum permissible limit of 2000 mg/L. This is not
seen as major water quality problem.
6.2.1. (f ) . Bacteriological Pollution
This parameter was not covered umder in the NEERI report. However, the heath
department reports suggest that Bacteriological quality of water is the main water
quality problem in Yavatmal district. The following health related data confirms
this.
Gastro Attacks .           1430 Nos.
Cholera Attacks             28 Nos
Dirrhoea Attacks         30,508 Nos.
Hepatitis Attacks           109 Nos
Typhoid Attacks             120 Nos.

6.2.2. High Nitrate
High concentration of Nitrate in grotmdwater is reported in districts where large
areas are irrigated under Paddy, sugarcane, banana and orange. High concentration
of nitrate in groundwater at shallow depths is becoming alarming. Areas with high
nitrate in ground water are given in Table 6.5

Source Data from GSDA, CGWB, WSSD, NEERI, PHD
It is evident that the major Hot Spot districts from both groundwater quantity and
quality considerations are Nagpur, Jalgaon, Beed, Sangli,Satara, Solapur, Nashik,
Thane, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Yavatmnal and Chandrapur.
6.3. Personal Hygiene
Only 22.4 percentages of the households have access to latrines, which are
constructed under different State and central govermnent programs. Thus large



number of people do not have access either to household or community latrnnes.
Another hygiene issue that emerged dunng public consultationis is inadequate
sanitation facilities at school Only 48.5% schools in rural areas have sanitation
facilities
6.4. Environmental Sanitation
In most of the villages, disposal of sullage, wastewater, cattle dung is improper
causing sanitary problems Stonn drains and all weather internal lanes are absent in
almost all villages Improper disposals of organic wastes, many times close to water
supply source is another hot spot issue. Thus considering the current sanitation and
hygiene conditions entire project area could be constrmed as Hot Spot area
Strategies for tackling water quantity, water quality and sanitation-hygiene issues in
respective hot spot areas would be drawn while implementing the project along with
mitigatory measures

7. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
While considering the launch of any project, it is very important to consider the
potential effects of the project. Along witl thlis, we should also consider the
alteniatives available in case the project does not get implemented Here we consider
the available feasible altematives to the second RWSP: An attempt would be made
to analyze the available alternatives with the following points under consideration
I. Whether the objective of adequate and sustainable water supply and sanitation
delivery services is attained.
2. Whether the environmental impacts have been considered and the necessary
mitigatory measures have been initiated.
3. Whether the end result is an improvement in the quality of life of the
participating commumlties
In order to facilitate comparison on these lines, a "without project" is also
considered.
7.1. Without Project Scenario
Minimum per capita water supply in rural areas prescnbed by Government of
Maharashtra is 40 LPCD. Presently out of 86313 villages and hamlets 59140
villages and hamlets have a safe and adequate source of dnnkmg water supply at 40
LPCD round the year (FC). In 18753 villages and hamlets the source created is not
adequate and needs strengthening (PC). In remaining 8420 villages and hamlets no
safe ground water source is available and requires recourse to alternate sources of
water supply Thus the water quantity problem exists for uncovered and inadequate
villages and hamlets. This project is trying to address the needs of 3750 villages.
As of now GOM is in the process of completing a large number of water supply
schemes, commissioned under the earlier 'Master Plan'. There are about 1907 on-
going schemes under the MJP that require about Rs.1750 crores and the same is
expected to be completed by year 2006 as shown below in Table7.1
Table7.1. Phasing of Water Supply Schemes in Maharashtra

2004-05    81           460       400         61          20
2005-06    20           60        200         20          NIL
Thus we have a wide spectrum of water scarcity patterns in Maharashtra whose
needs have to be addressed. Another significant water supply problem is that of a
previously viable water source becoming dry .The problem is compounded by the
growth in population of Maharashtra (at the rate of 2.5 % per annwn) which calls for
an increase in investments in this sector.



7.2 Programs for Rural Water Supply
Currently GOM is implementing a vanety of programs in the sector, which will be
able to cater to the needs of some of the above villages. The following is an analysis
of the major programs
7.2.1 Minimum Needs Program (MNP) and Accelerated Rural Water Supply
Program (ARWSP)
Government of Maharashtra implements the rural water supply schemes through two
mam programs. One is the Accelerated Rural Water, Supply Program (ARWSP)
funded by the Government of India and the other is mLe Mininum Needs Program
(MNP) funded through budgetary support and raising of bonds and loans from the
open market. GOM gets about Rs 200 crores from the GOI and all this and other
money raised from the market would be used for completing the 'old baggage'
schemes shown in the Table 7.1 above.
Central Government mtroduced the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Program
(ARWSP) in 1971-73 to assist the State Governments. This Program is being
implemented in the state of Maharsahtra since then, in accordance with the
guidelines issued by the Central Govermnent.
GOM   has planned to complete all ongoing schemes being executed by Zilla
Parishad by June 2003. The cost involved is about Rs 75 crores. There are about 240
ongoing water supply schemes under execution by Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran.
These would take some tune to complete.
The State Government of Maharashtra implements the Rural Dnnking Water Supply
Program (RWSP) under the Minimum Needs Program (MNP). It is obligatory on the
part of the State to provide funds under the MNP, at least on a matching basis in
relation to the Central allocations for the ARWSP.
In addition, the GOI has started a new initiative in the form of the Prime Minister's
Gramodaya Yojana (PMGY) starting from the financial year 2000-01 .Rural drinking
water is one of the components of PMGY.
7.2.2 Implementation of Rural Drinking Water Component under Prime
Minister's Gramodaya Yojana (PMGY)
The Prime Minister's Gramodaya Yojana envisages an Additional Central
Assistance for selected basic minimum services in order to focus on certain priority
areas of the Government. The PMGY has two components, i.e., rural roads and other
component has five sectors, namely, primary education, primary health, miral shelter,
niral drinking water and nutrition.
7.2.3. Allocation of funds
Planning Commission, GOI, has fixed a minimum of 15% of the total Additional
Central Assistance (ACA) to each sector under the second component, and the
States/UTs would be required to decide about the remaining 25% among the 5



sectors. Funds under the scheme would be released to States/UTs as Additional
Central Assistance. States tinder general category will be given ACA of which 70 %
will be loan and 30% as grant-in-aid. In case of States in special category ACA
would be as 1 0 % loan and 90% as grant- in- aid for rural water supply
7.2.4. Operationalization of the Scheme
o  Funds released unlder the PMGY-Rural Dnnkmg Water can also be used for
providing matching share under Minimum Needs Program (MNP) and also for
ongoing and new water supply schemes
o  Under the PMGY-Rural Di-inking Water, minimum 25% of the total allocation
for the component has to be uilized on projects/schemes for water conservation,
water harvesting, water recharge and sustainability of the drinking water sources
in respect of D`PAP/DPP areas, over exploited dark/grey blocks and other water
stress/ drought affected areas. Allocation of 25% of the total allocation for
sustainability may not be insisted upon in areas where the water table and
rainfall is high and ground water development is low.
o  Further remaining 75% of the allocation could be used for taking up projects
/schemes to tackle quality related problems and for providing safe drinking water
to Not-Covered (NC) / Partially Covered (PC) habitations. To adopt proper
scientific source finding methods for location of hand pumps/tube wells the
States/UTs are supposed to revive the Scientific Source Finding Committees set
up earlier.
o  The projects under PMGY-Rural Drinking Water should be preferably
implemented by involving local communities/Panchayats.
o  The concemed Department, which implements rural water supply schemes in the
State/UT, should also monitor the progress of implementation of the projects.
7.3. Shivkalin Pani Sathawan Yojana
Inspite of crores of rupees being spent on water supply to rural and urban areas,
many villages/wadis do not get adequate potable drinking water. The main reason
for this is drying up of the original source. Hence there is a necessity of
strengthening of drinking water sources through recharging. To fulfill this need
comprehensive scheme was made for use of rainwater for strengthening the drinking
water sources or storage and use of rainwater at individual or public levels by using
the available technology through people's participation. With this aim in mind, the
Government of Maharashtra has sanctioned the "Shivkalin Pani Sathwan Yojana"
providing for the conventional and non-conventional measures for drinking water
source strengthening, roof top rain water harvesting, construction of tanks in hilly
areas for storage of rain water and similar other measures for sustained availability
of drinking water in the State. Annexure VI
7.3.1.Norms for implementation of these measures:
I. Initially the Program is to be taken up as pilot project in 100 villages and after
one year, to be implemented in the State on regular basis.
2. Priority to be given to villages, which have been tanker fed for the last three
years or wherein various other scarcity measures have been adopted.
3. Out of these, priority is to be given to villages that have received Taluka, District
or State level awards in Sant Gadge Baba Cleanliness Campaign.



4. New schemes are to be taken up only if old ones cannot be revived.
7.3.2. Availability of Funds
1  At least 25/oof the funds reserved for Sub-Mission project from Centrally
Assisted Accelerated Rural Water Supply Scheme
2. Minimum 5% from funds received as central assistance under sector reforms
project in pilot districts.
3. At least 10% from District Maintenance and Repair funds.
4. Funds being made available from by the Eleventlh Finance Commission for
augmentation of conventional drinking water sources
5. Funds available  under Employment Guarantee   Scheme   and  Assured
Employment Scheme to fit the norms prescribed thereof
6. Funds available under the Local D-evelopment Programs of M.P s and M.L.As.
7. Funds received from UNICEF and other international organizations.
This is a Program and not a project as such but the interventions purely address
water supply problem only. Sanitation is absent in this Program.
7.4. Swajaldhara Rural Water Supply Project
Emphasizing the need for taking up commuruty based rural water supply programs,
the Government of India has decided to open up refonn initiatives in the rural water
sector throughout the country. rhis program called "Swajaldhara", has the following
key elements:
*     Demand driven and community participation approach
*  . Panchayats/Communities to plan, implement, operate, maintain and manage
all drinking water schemes.
*     Communities have to contribute 10% of the capital cost upfront in cash
*     Gram Panchayats will have full ownership of the drinking water assets.
*     The users and Panchayats will be responsible for the full operations and
maintenance of the project scheme. Only a one-time 6 months OandM grant
is provided to the community.
*     The eligibility criteria for Swajaldhara projects will be those Gram
Panchayats and Blocks adopting the reforms principles.
*     Any agency as decided by the State or the District could be called as a
'District Implementing Agency'.
Swajaldhara, being a relatively newer initiative being applied universally all over the
country, there is lack of active support for capacity building, which is a very vital
component of the project. Also environrnental concerns are not addressed
adequately.
The following are the key weaknesses of this scheme:
* It is village specific and does not address the needs of a district
* Calls for full upfront cash contiibution and many communities would not in a
position to take care of such a financial condition.
* Does not have any resources allocated for district level support and IEC.



7.5 Total Sanitation
Currently GOM is implementing two types of sanitation programs. The Sant Gadge
Baba Campaign (state wide) with the flunds for the GOM and the TSC in 13 (8 are in
the project area) districts with the funds from GOI. There is no clearly demarcated
funding for the sanitation promotion in the other 17 districts proposed under the
RWSSII project
7.5.1 Objectives
i) Bring about an improvement in the general quality of life in rural areas
Accelerate rural sanitation coverage.
ii) Generate felt demand for sanitation facilities through awareness creation and
health education
iii) Covers school in rural areas with sanitation facilities and promote sanitary
habits among students
iv) Encourage cost effective and appropriate technologies in sanitation.
v) Endeavor to reduce the incidence of water borne and sanitation related diseases
7.5.2 Strategies
A "Demand Driven Approach" has to be adopted with increased stress on awareness
creation and demand generation from the people for sanitary facilities in houses,
schools and for cleaner environments. Subsidy for individual household latrine units
has been reduced. Altemate delivery mechanisms, location specific technology
options and location specific intensive IEC campaigns, involvement of Panchayat
Raj institutions, co-operatives, women groups, self-help groups, NGOs, etc are also
important parts of the strategy. This campaign addresses only sanitation. The holistic
approach to incorporate water supply and samtation in the sai_.i project is missing
here.
7.6 KfW Project
Under the Indo-German Financial Co-operation, the Government of Maharashtra
will receive financial assistance from KfW for the Rural Water Supply Program to
be implemented in Aurangabad, Ahmednagar and Pune districts. The Program is
implemented on the following basis:
1. The Program will be implemented in two phases as an open program. It will
cover 275 villages and reach approximately 4,00,000 inhabitants.
2. The program will follow a bottom-up, village centered and demands driven
approach, including maximum participation of the beneficiaries, starting with
problem identification and continuing through to operations and maintenance.
3. The scheme designs will be village-specific, supply-level based on proper
assessment of demand and affordability.
4. The Program will offer site-specific solutions for the drinking water problem,
with preference for local groundwater based solutions, which are simpler in
technology as well as cheaper in operations, and maintenance (O&M) as
compared to regional surface water based systems.



5. The cost recovery strategies of the program will be directed towards achieving
full 0 &M cost coverage by water tanff as well as partial cost contribution by
the beneficianes
6. The program  will include capacity building measures to empower Village
Panchayats/Village Water Supply and Sanitation Committees (VWSC) to
assume fill responsibility of 0 &M of water supply system.
7.6.1 Project implementation
The project implementation will be in two phases. In Phase-i, 75 villages
(approximately 25 in 2 to 3 clusters in each district) will be covered Thlis phase will
be 30 months duration. There will be a nmd term evaluation of Phase I.ln this
evaluation, the achievements, impact and shortcomings will be reviewed by an
independent consultant
Phase It will be of four years. In this phase, there will be a continued support to 0
&M in 75 villages covered in Phase 1. In additlon; there will be implementation in
200 villages (60 to7O villages per district). In this project support is only for water
supply and this support is given only when sanitation measures are taken care of by
the GOM.
7.7 GOM-DFID Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project:
The project was implemented between 1991 and 1999, covering 187 villages m three
districts- Jalgaon, Nashik and Dhule. The project also attempted to institutionalize
the operation and maintenance of the schemes by setting up Water Management
Units(WMU) at the distrct level.
7.0. Conclusion
Above alternatives indicate that all the available altematives are not sufficient to
meet the needs of the rural communities in the 26 districts Secondly, these sources
of funding are directed at select villages and do not encourage any institutional
building for effectively implementing reform agenda of the state. The second RWSS
project addresses these issues and contemplates support for capacity building. It is
implied  that the project if implemented will lead to maxunum health benefits to
rural population. The major anticipated environmental issues as a result of project
interventions are addressed and mitigatory measures are also integrated m the
proposed project design. The project is expected to bring about a holistic
improvement in the quality of life leading to "prosperity".
Besides the decentralized democratic process imbibed in the project objectives
would enable the stakeholders in decision-making process and with women
participation in VWSC, would empower women in rural areas. The RWSS II Project
also aims to address resoturce sustainability issues, which would be attempted
through integrated water resource management by Aquifer Management Groups to
be set up under the project Another iunportant aspect envisaged in the RWSS II
Project is that it integrates and emphasizes on personal hygiene and environmental
sanitation, besides drinking water and sanitation. This would be achieved through
intense IEC program, which would bring behavior changes Thus the proposed
project is different from other ongoing projects implemented currently and it would
bring positive results in sector reforms



8. IIMPACT ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSES
Ushering new paradigmn while addressing water supply and sanitation program in the
rural areas, Government of Maharashtra has integrated water supply schemes with
hygiene and environmental sanitation Ennched by the experience of supply dnven
program of drinking water and sanitation, the paradigm shift in the present demand
driven project encompasses all activities related to water supply, hygiene, sanitation
and environment and endeavors to address this simultaneously thrG;ugh the project It
is desirable to foresee the positive and negative unpacts of each of the onterventions,
which would be, considered in the project design along with measures to
reduce/alleviate the negative impacts and enhance positive impacts.
With demand driven objectives, the project aims at people's initiative in
identification, implementation and operation and maintenance of the scheme
components. This could be achieved during different phases of the project
1. Indentification, planning and prepanng the project
2. Execution of works after following technical and financial proceduLres
3. Operation activities to be provided by the beneficianes
8.1 Identification and Preparation of Project
Various activities involve debates, deliberations, cross sharing of strategies with and
amongst concemed stakeholders, refining the strategy, understanding the local
conditions for socio-economic and water resources for drinking, irrigation;
personal/community hygiene, sanitation and environment. This requires a strong
IEC campaign, which would be provided by the government, nc.r-government
organizations. During this phase relevant capacity building initiatives and
establishing various groups like VWSC, Mahila Mandal, etc. would be attempted.
During these consultations various alternative options would also be discussed such
as rejuvenation of existing sources, groundwater recharge and conservation for
source strengthening and sustainability, imbibing hygiene and sanitation habits
amongst people for using stmictLures to be created, social responsibility for
environmental sanitation.
Depending upon the technical advice sites for water supply, public toilets,
community dustbins/ garbage - compost pits would be decided. An attempt to
acquire required land for the same would be made through discussions and social
pressures.
8.2. Execution of Works
This includes
Water supply schemes: revival of existing sources, new wells/bore wells, recharge
stmictures for strengthening and sustainability, construction of delivery cistern,
treatment plants, service reservoir, distribution net work for private and public
connections



Sanitation and Hygiene construction of latrine for the commtnity and by the
households sanitation facilities in schools, controlling air pollUtlon in houselhold
kitchens by promoting smokeless chullas, protecting dnnking water source pollution
from washing, cleaning near the source
Environmental Sanitation sullage and storm drains, stonn drains, roads, dust bins,
garbage-comlpost pits, biogas plant, sites for disposal of village and cattle waste
This requires understanding of various technical, financial and management
procedures like preparation of plans and estimates, prepanng tender documents and
finalize the same and awarding contract or executing the works by Grain Sabha and
procunng the matenal by the VWSC or Mahila Mandal, procurement procedures
and uock keeping
lEC: wit;. assistance from government or NGOs or engaging pnvate consultant
would facilitate this process.
8.3 Operation of Works
This includes operation of water source, machinery, pipelines, distribution network,
other civil works like piunp platform, treatment plant, storage reservoir/cistern This
also includes regular testing and monitoring of water quality at village, distnct level
Penodic up gradation for capacity building through IEC or other training programs
for VWSC, Gram Sabha, Gram Panchayat and Zilla Parishad level functionaries
8.4 Impact identification
Intensive IEC programs would help create a mure positive impact of all project
components. However, certain negative impacts, mostly temporary, also need to be
assessed. This would help to draw mitigating measures to reduce their intensity
These are given in Table I below.

8.5 Execution Phase Impacts
During construction of vanous activities normal life is affected because of
movement of people, vehicles and machinery. This includes noise and air /dust
pollution. This is however, only temporary. Repairs and rejuvenation of existing
system disrupts water supply, which could be minimized by proper planning and
staggered execution of works.
Construction involves procurement. Collective procurement mstead of contracted
procurement saves cost and reduces financial burden. It also saves time The activity
increases employment in the village. Village level knowledge is best utilized during
construction of works.
8.6 Operation Phase Impacts
Positive impacts include.
* Safe clean and adequate drinking water
* Planned and appropriate use of drinking water reduces wastage
* Clean surroundings
* Improved health and hygiene results in less expenditure on medicine
* Good sanitation controls outbreak of diseases and epidemics
* Empowerment of women and building confidence
* Saving in time for fetching water generates additional income and better child
care
* Increased employment opportunity for local skilled and unskiHled workers
The negative impacts include
* Ground water over extraction,
* High tariff for water and other sanitary services provided increases financial
burden on poor and BPL families
* Non-recovery of fees likely to affect providing good service
It is evident from the above impact analysis that the positive impacts of the project
interventions outweigh the negative impact and will result in better quality of life of
the people in the area.

9. STRATEGIES AND TECIHNOLOGY OPTIONS
Review of drinking water supply scenario in the project area and the difficulty in
supplying adequate clean and safe water indicate that in certain areas the
groundwater is either not available due to over extraction and progressively
declining water levels or the quality of groundwater is poor for drinking. A set of
special strategies needs to be evolved for these hot spot areas. As regards sanitation
and hygiene, considering the present practice of open defecation and poor status of
environmental sanitation, almost all the project districts require attention Any single
strategy may not be applicable nor acceptable to stakeholders. Therefore, a multi
prong strategy action plan is required to tackle the problems and suggest a range of
technology options for different situations prevailing m the project area. -
The issues are grouped into three categories viz. water quantity issues, water quality
issues and sanitation and hygiene issues and broad strategies envisaged in the project
for addressing these in the hot spot areas are as below.
9.1. Strategy for Water Quantity Issues
The strategy include
o Rejuvenation and rehabilitation of existing sources
o Augmentation of drinking water supply sources through conventional measures
like percolation tank, check dams, weirs, Kolhapur Type weir, bandhara,
recharge trenches etc. and unconventional measures like hydrofractuting, bore
hole blasting, fracture cement sealing etc. ( Annex VIII)
o Increase ground water recharge to sustain the demand
o Rainwater harvesting and roof top rain water harnessing
o Create supplementary source
o  Promote aquifer management groups and educate communities in total water
resouirces management
o Regular monitoring of ground water
9.2. Strategy for Water Quality Issues
Major quality concems are high concentration of fluoride, nitrate, iron, and salinity.
The strategies include.
o Provide drinking water from alternate sources
o Preference to shallow open wells where quality of ground water is comparatively
good than from deep bore wells
o  Continuous chlorination of water supply to maintain a minimum residual
chlorine level (at 0.5mg/litre)
o Mixing contaminated water with fresh water to lower the concentration of
fluoride, nitrate, iron and salinity.
o Provide limited quantity of fresh water for drinking and use poor quality water
for other purposes
o Provide household or conmmunity treatment system
o Continuous water quality monitoring mechanism.



9.2.1. Water Quality Monitoring Issues
GOM is committed to supply safe drinking water Quality of drinking water from
each water supply source/scheme is continuously monitored at different levels. And
appropriate measures are taken wherever water quality problems are noticed. Under
Hydrology Project GSDA has established 6 Regional Laboratories for regular
physical and chemical p,arameters of water samples. To monitor the water quality
GSDA analyses 3370 watei samnples on regular basis for routine basis, 975 from
trend stations and 578 samples from trend cum surveillance stations. Recently GoM
has completed 10% random sample survey for chemical testing of--water- samples
from drinking water sources in all the districts by assigning the task to NEERI.
Based on the results of these analyses, 100% drinking water source sample testing is
planned in Yavatmal, Bhandara, Nagpur and Chandrapur districts. NEERI has
completed this study in Yavatmal district and work m Bhandara and Nagpur is
progressing GOM has also distributed 1000 field kits for testing residual chlorne.
In case of individual rural water supply scheme the VWSC should appoint a person,
who will take the sample for O.T. (Orthotodolene test) regularly for observing
residual chlorne and if test found negative, the conmittee should immediately send
the water sample to the nearest rural hospital or Primary Health Cunter for detail
investigation and at the same tine water should be immediately disiDfected by
mixmg TCL powder m an appropriate proportion.
Many times 0 T. test is negative because T.C.L. Powder, due to bad handling or its
exposure to air for a longer time, loses the chlorine content: This requires addmg
extra doses than prescribed. The Water Quality Inspector at Block / Taluka level
would decide the extra quantity of TCL to maintain the residual chlorine. The O.T
test indicates the level of disinfections and does not necessarily indicate
bacteriological contamination.
9.2.2 Proposed Water Quality Monitoring Strategy
Public Health departmnent is entrusted with the responsibility of water quality survey
and identify the reason for water pollution and remedial measures. Based on the
feedback PHD would ascertain the safety of the drinking water source and advice
the concerned agency whenever required.
The water quality monitoring is carried out through a) water quality control by
agency responsible for providing drinking water, b) water quality surveillance on
continuous and periodic basis by PHD / GSDA.
a) The water quality control at taluka / block level is monitored by Junior Engineer
in water supply departrnent of Panchyat Samittee appointed as Water Quality
Inspector, who will carry water test of minimum 20% villages of taluka in a
month. If the water quality is found unsuitable, he should immediately inforn to
concerned Gram Panchyat and the Block Development Officer.



b) In order to avoid pollution of water sources due to unclean surroundings in most
of the villages, the water quality inspector should carry out penodical
environmental surveys and  note the changes for remedial action. lie should
send a monthly report of environmental surveys to the Executive Engineer
(Water Supply Dept.) Zilla Parishad and Block Development Officer
When F F.C (Field Fecal Coliform) test of any water source is repeatedly
positive, water sample should be sent for detailed test to the District Public
Health Laboratory. The surrotnding of the source should be surveyed to
examine contamination from nearby toilets or compost pits or sullage disposal
points, and take necessary action to protect drinking water. The results of the
laboratory should be communicated to the village water and sanitation
conmmittee, Block Development Officer and Executive Engineer.
c) The B.D.O. should guide and supervise with the help of Extension Officer
(health) and Gramsewak (village level worker). He should ensure that training is
given to those village water committees in regulating water quality and traming
should be arranged by the Extension Officer (health) with the help of Junior
Engineer and Medical Officer from Primary Health Center. He should also
obtain monthly progress report from Gramsewak, on water supply and water
quality regulating, analyze the report and give proper guidance to Village level
Water Supply and Sanitation Committee
The monthly report of all villages in the project should be consolidated and the
consolidated report should be sent to the District Water Supply Officer and Chief
Executive Officer before IOh of following month.
9.2.3. Institutional Arrangement for Water Quality Monitoring
The GOM has planned a three-tier strategy to monitor quality of drinking water.
This includes
A. Village Level
o The 0. T. test for inspection of water quality at village level is carried out by the
multipurpose health worker called village health worker (VHW).
o The results of 0. T. test should be recorded by the VHW in the record
book. If the test is negaiive , it should be brought to the notice of the staff
of village water supply committee.
o  If 0. T. test is negative, water sample should be drawn for further bacterial
test and be given to the concemed primary health center.,
o  The   Medical Officer of the P.H.C. should test in the mini laboratory in
P.H.C. If the adequate equipment to test presence of a bacteria responsible
for a particular water borne/related diseases is not available he should
send the   water sample to the   rural hospital  for F.F.C. test and
communicate the results to the village panchyat / village water and sanitation
committee.
o If F.F.C. test of some water source are positive again and again, sample of water
sources should be sent to the distnct public health laboratory for detailed
bacteria inspection, the environment of sources should be surveyed for
cleanliness and cause of pollution ascertained and remedies suggested to the
village Panchayat.
92



*  Health Assistant of the Primary Health Center should guide V.H.W. In this
regard and monitor their work. V.H.W. should submit water inspection report
to the Medical Officer.
*  The Medical Officer should send consolidated  report of the public health
center  before  1 6"' day  of every month  to the district health center and
endorse the copy to Block Development Officer, Panchyat Samittee
B. Taluka Level
*  The Junior Engineer, Medical Officer of Public Health Center, Multipurpose
Worker of concerned area and Health assistant should supervise the water
quality survey work at taluka level. The Extension Officer (health) will be
responsible in this connection.
*  ii) The above -am supervise the water sources cleanliness, and availability
of    essential chemical for water purification
*  iii) Red  color  certificate (red card) prescribed  by  the  goverment has
essentially to be given by the Medical Officer of concerned Prnmary
Health Center to those  village / hamlet where quality of water supply is
nlOt safe. Similarly, Green color certificate (green card) given by the Medical
Officer to those village/ hamlet where quality of water is fresh and safe for
drinking. Thus after completing the survey every year from October to
January, the consolidated report should be sent by the Block Development
Officer through the Distnct Health Officer to the Chief Executive Officer
in a consolidated form which would be reviewed by the CEO of ZP and
wherever required mitigating action would be initiated including change of
source.
C. District Level
The District Water Supply Committee should review   without   delay  the
deficiencies in the water quality monitoring system schemes and prepare time
bound action plan in respect of villages which have received Red color
certificate. The Medical Officer at primary health center should again visit every
village/hamlet which were issued Red color certificate. The Medical Officer shall
issue a Green card to the village AIamlet.
9.2.4. Monitoring of Pure Water Supply and Epidemic Control
i. At district level, The Chief Executive Officer and District Water supply Officer
are responsible for such health and water quality survey.  -
ii. The Divisional Commissioner should monitor at the Divisional level, water
quality surveys and shall send a consolidated report to the state government every
month.
In case of any epidemic, Secretary (Health), Secretary (Water Supply and
Sanitation), Director General (Health) shall review the sitLation and report to the
Chief Secretary regarding implementation of appropriate measures for the control of
epidemic.
9.2.5. Management Information System
It is very important that the factual infornation of the water quality monitorng work
at every level is made available in the prescnbed formats to the appropriate authority
for taking mitigating and remedial measures. This facilitates taking important
9;



decisions on fuiture planning of work, works to be taken up urgently, removing of
deficiencies experienced, monitoning and co-ordination of work of different
departments, making financial provisions etc The organizational flow chart for the
water quality testing, surveillance and for information management is shown in

9.3. Water Quality Monitoring Strategy for Yavarmal District
Considenng the pronounced effect of highi concentration of fluonde in dnnking
water in Yavatmal district, a separate water quality monitoring strategy would be
adopted for Yavatmal district
The district laboratory has limited capacity to carry out both chemical and
bacteriological test. The constraints include humani, financial and logistical
resources. The district public health laboratory can test 1000 water samples for
chemical analysis (10 parameters) and another 1500 samples for bactenological
pollution.
Considering that there are nearly 9500 public water sources and these water sources
have to be monitored periodically, it is necessary to decentralize water quality
monitoring of certain parameter usmg reliable field test kits. The parameters could
include fecal pollution, fluonde and nitrate The H2S based bactenological test kit
developed by Defence Research Laboratory and fluoride and nitrate test kits
developed by National Chermcal Laboratory (NCL), Pune can be used by PHCs.
The recommended periodicity of water quality tests is as under.
Bacteriological Test     Quarterly and monthly from May-August
Fluoride           :     Once in twelve months
Nitrate                  Once in twelve months
The results of field test kits should be conveyed by PHCs to the district public health
laboratory. Ten percent of the water sources must be randomly tested by laboratory
methods.
There is also, need to computerize water quality data so as to facilitate regular
update, quick analysis and generation of reports The water quality data can be
maintained by the district public health laboratory and updated at every six months.
To introduce the second tier, it will be necessary to train PHC staff in the use of field
test kits, reporting and remedial measure.
9.3.1.Suggested Actions
Based on the above the following follow-up actions are suggested.  -
o  Fix a signboard near all high fluoride (> 1.5 mg/L) soLrces clearly indicating
fluoride concentration and with a message that this water source is not
suitable for drinking water
o  Test all private water sources and inforn users about their suitability for
drinking water supply.
o  Provide at least one safe-water supply option in all villages and habitations
currently without an alternate water source. Dug well and RWB tank are
excellent options. Water treatment should be considered only when other
options are not techno-economically feasible.
o A comprehensive children survey is conducted in all villages where all
sources have been affected by high fluoride and alternate sources do not
exist on govemment records. The survey should capture the following: (1)
incidence of fluorosis among children; (2) water sources being used by
users; (3) measurenment of fluoride in all sources (government/private and



used by community); and (4) dietary habits This data will be useful in
developing the fluonde mitigation strategy and further course of action
o  Considenng   that nearly  80%  groundwater sources have   fluoride
concentration above desirable level 1 mg/L and many sources are
bactenrologically polluted, it is necessary that an intensive IEC campaign is
launched to educate people about ill health effects of bacten'ological and
fluoride pollution in drinkmg water, role of nutrition in reducinlg the adverse
health impact of hIigh fluonde drinking water, importance personal hygiene
and preventive measures (better nutrition, use of low fluoride water sources
for drinking water, safe handling of water to minimize bactenological
contamination during handling and chlorination etc) througlh medical and
para-medical staff, teachers and community leaders. For this purpose it is to
develop a comprehensive lEC strategy. Attractive signboards may also be
placed near hospitals, PHCs, schools and in anarkets to inform people about
the ill health effects of high fluoride water and preventive measures
o Develop a comprehensive WQM Strategy including a computerized
Management Information System with clear guidelines on reporting
requirements. There can be two tiers for WQM as under
i.    The first-tier will be the laboratory based testing either at the district
laboratory or block level laboratory; and
ii.   The second-tier will PHC based for testing water sources under its
jurisdiction for select parameters (Fluoride and Fecal pollution) field
test kit
o Conduct a Two-day Training Workshop to train trainers in identification and
management of fluorosis. The target group will include dental and orthopedic
surgeons and general physicians. These trainers could act as resource persons
for training medical, para-medical staff and teachers.
o Conduct a One/two-day Workshop for training trainers in the use of water
quality field test kits. These trainers will act as resource persons fQr traming
PHC doctors and para-medical staff in the use of field test kits and reporting
requirements.
o Conduct a district-specific nutrition study to develop IEC strategy for
promotion of recipes rich in calcium, vitamin C and anti-oxidants.
o Conduct a study on select 50 high fluoride water sources to evaluate
quarterly variation in fluoride.level due to recharge of groundwater due to
rainwater.
9.4. Household Sanitation
The strategies to stop open defecation include
o     massive program of construction of latrines
o     Insist on construction of individual latrines by each household
o     promoting multi seat cost effective community latrines
o    'compulsory use of constructed latrines
9.5. Environmental sanitation
This include
o    provide sullage and storm drains with proper disposals
o. insist on individual/household compost pits for household wastage
'96



disposal using the compost for backyard garden
*    insist on household and community toilets
*   identify suitable sites away from drinking water source for disposal of
community waste village garbage and cattle dung
*    construct internal roads and pavements
*    effective IEC campaign for peoples participation and attitudinal change for
good sanitation and hygiene
9.6. Technology Options
9.6.1. Fluoride
The best solution to the fluoride problem is of course to avoid locating wells in high
fluoride aquifers. The fluonde concentration often fluctuates within the same
catchment basin and an improvement may be obtained through change of well site
However, in the absence of any alternative source of safe drinking water, the
defluoridation techniques may be practiced for safe drinking water. Various
Artificial recharge to ground water, including Aquifer Storage Recovery (ASR)
techniques may be applied to improve the quality of water by dilution. Some of the
remedial techniques are descnbed here which can be followed depending upon the
resources availability and other conditions. Annexure V11.1
A. Defluoridation Techniques
The most common defluoridation techniques are the methods using aluminum
compounds as absorption media. These can be divided into two categories - those
based upon the addition of chemicals to cause precipitation and complexation and
those based upon ion exchange
a. Complexation methods --- Nalgonda Model
The technique, in India popularly known as the "Nalgonda model", is based on
mixing the raw water with alummum sulfate or alum (Potassium-aluminum sulfate),
followed by precipitation, settling and filtration. Lime is added to ensure adequate
alkalinity for an effective hydrolysis of the aluminun salts, thus preventing residual
aluminum to remain in the treated water. Nornally, bleaching powder is also added
b. Ion Exchange method:
A simple version of this method, using aluminum oxide as ion exchanger, is
marketed in India under the name "Prasanthi technique". The raw water is poured
over an aluminum oxide filter and the defluoridated water is then stored in a storage
tank.
c. Domestic Defluoridation:
Defluoridation at domestic level can be carried out in a container (bucket) of 40 liter
capacity with a tap 3-5 cm above bottom of the container for the withdrawal of
treated water after precipitation and settling the raw water taken in the container.
This is mixed with adequate amount of aluminum sulfate solution (alum), lime or
97



sodium carbonate and bleaching powder depending upon its alkalinity and fluoride
content Alwn solution is added first and mixed well with water. Lime or sodium
carbonate solution then added and the water stirred slowly for 20 minutes and
allowed to settle for nearly on hour and are withdrawn. The solution, which contains
permissible amount of fluoride, is withdrawn through the tap for consumption.
B. Fill-and-Draw Defluoridation Plant Technology for Rural Water Supply
Fill-and-Draw defluoridation plant technology based on Nalgonda Technique is
designed for removal of excess fluonde from water, which is most suitable for Rural
Water Supply
C. Fill-and-D. aw Defluoruidation Plant for Small Community.
This is a best method for communities upto 200 population. Raw water is pumped or
poured into the tank and the required amount of alum, lime or sodium carbonate and
bleaching powder added with stirring The contents are stirred slowly for ten
minutes and allowed to settle for two hours. The defluoridated water is withdrawn
and supplied through stand posts. The settled sludge is discarded in a safe location or
used by other chemical industries. The plant can be located in the open and a semi-
skilled labor can operate the unit independently.
9.6.2. Nitrate
Where ground water contains high concentration of nitrate it requires treatment
before distribution. Following methods are used for treatment of nitrate. Selection of
any of these would depend on the concentration of nitrate and the capacity of water
required to be treated as well as stakeholders' choice and acceptability. Anne-ure
VIBI.2
a. Ion Selective Method
A specially developed nitrate selective ion exchange resin is used for removal of
nitrate. This is a compact and economical method, which requires less chemicals and
no electricity. This method is useful for small capacity water supply schemes.
b. Bio-chemnical Denitrification:
By using denitrifying bacteria and microbes like Achromobacter, Aerobacter,
Lactobacillus, Proteus, Pseudomonas. These bacteria are capable of dissimulatory
nitrate removal. If the dissolved oxygen in water is high it suppresses the reaction.
The process requires skilled operation and could be used only for regional rural
water supply schemes.
c. Alternate Souirce-
In areas where groundwater is highly polluted with Nitrate, it is advantage to change
the source groundwater to surface water or locate the groundwater source away from
Nitrate polluted zone and transport water from distances.



d. Dilution with Low Nitrate water-
The water containmg hIlgh levels of nitrate could be combined with an equal amount
of water wvth a low level of nitrate to achieve a safe concentration of nitrate
e. Supply of Limited Fresh water
Provide limited quantity of good quality surface or ground water for drinking and
groundwater with high nitrate content could be used for other purposes like bathing
and washing clothes, utensils etc There are other treatment options, which require
higher skills for operation and are normally practiced for regional rLral water supply
schemes.
f. Reverse Osmosis:
The demineralization of water in this process is done by putting it under pressure
and forcmg through a membrane that filters out minerals and nitrate One half to
two-thirds of water remains behind the membrane as rejected water However,
besides skilled operation, disposal of sludge is difficult as it is likely to get recycled
into the groundwater. This method is used only for large-scale application as in
Regional Rural Water Supply schemes.
9.6.3. Iron
High iron content in dnrnking water requires treatment, as it is likely to cause
discoloration, turbidity, taste vanation and encrustation and corrosion of distribution
pipes. Removal of iron is simple and can be achieved by aeration of water and
settling of the iron oxide sludge formed by aeration. Two technology options are
a. Package Plant Developed by NERRI
NEERI has developed the iron removal plant for rural water supply schemes. The
plant is based on average discharge of 1000 liters per hour suitable for India Mark 11
or equivalent hand pumps. The hydraulic loading is adequate to serve a population
of 250 at 10 LPCD for 10 hlours operation.
b. Plant for Larger Community
In cases where bore well or tube is the source of water supply and community size is
more than 500 households per bore well, a simple and inexpensive treatment unit for
removal of iron is recommended so that the difficulties of operation and
maintenance are minimum. The plant basically includes aeration and sedimentation
of iron through sand filter. Design details are given in the Annexure V11.3
9.7. Treatment for Bacterial Contamination
Disinfections will be an essential part of the water supply scheme as it would make
the water free from all bactenal contamination and makes it safe for drinking. In
rural areas, owing to lack of sanitation, waste water treatment facilities and poor
99



personal hygiene, bactenal contamination of drinking water is common and it is the
cause of spread of diseases. Annexure. V11.4. Treatment methods are
9.7.1. Chemical Method
Chemical method involves addition of chemicals to water that kills pathogens.
Disinfecting chemicals normally used are potassium pennanganate and hydrogen
peroxide, aluminum sulfate, chlonne and chlorine compounds including chlorine
tables.
9.7.2.Non Chemical Method
It is a simple method of heating and boiling water before use or exposing water to
UV rays. This method is adopted by individual households and cannot be-practiced
for community water supply.
9.8. Groundwater Recharge
Based on the hydrogeological situations and considering the rainfall and surface
water availability in the project districts, various technological options for ground
water recharge for source sustainability are given in the matrix. Table 9.1. Selection
of any one or combination of different technologies depend on the local conditions,
demand for water and cost of works. Annexure Vli.
9.9. Household Sanitation lIssue
In spite of government efforts for construction of individual toilets for providing
better hygienic environment, 84% of the population resorts to open defecation.
Among those having toilet facilities, only 57% are actually us'g the toilets. This is
due to lack of awareness of good hygienic behavior. According to 2001 census, out
of 110 lakh rural families, only 22 lakh rural families are having toilet facilities.
Most of the rural comnmunity believes that children's' faeces are not harmful and the
faeces are dumped into the common garbage dump or left to dry. After 1996, State
Government launched massive toilet construction Program, statewide Sant
Gadgebaba clean village campaign and Total Sanitation Campaign, but still the
present level of coverage is only 18%.
9.9.1. Hotspots
The present scenario of coverage of household latrines is not encouraging; as only
18% rural population is having individual toilets hence the entire project area can be
identified as Hotspots or particularly some tribal districts like Nandurbar,
Gadchiroli, Nagpur and Hingoli are considered as very high hotspots area where
coverage of individual latrine coverage is below the state average.
9.9.2. Strategy for Hlotspots
9.9.2.1. Household sanitaton: Government of Maharashtra is in the process of
implementing a new sanitation policy, which focuses on stopping open defecation
The main features of this policy are as follows:
100



*  Community based incentive for construction of toilets
*  Effective IEC campaign through Sant Gadgebaba Clean Village Campaign
* Inclusion of more and more districts under Total Sanitation Campaign Program
* Propagation of safe and appropriate low cost technology options upto lower level
of community.
9.9.2.2. Environmental Sanitation: the statewide Sant Gadgebaba clean village
Campaign has already improved the environmental sanitation scenano in some
particular districts. Some lacunae, which were observed dunng implementation
period, will be improved so that effective IEC and other components of the
campaign will be implemented properly.
Once the demand is generated for various components of total sanitation, the
individual toilets, community toilets and school sanitation structures will be
constructed for community at large.
The proper strategy for sustainability and 0 & M of constructed toilets will be
promoted.
The program for construction of open drain under Jawahar Rozgar Yojana run by the
Rural Development will be accelerated.
The construction of Soak Pit in whole project area will be promoted.
The adaptability of smokeless chulhas and solar cookers will be promoted
The other non-conventional system for disposal of wastewater like bio-pump
technology will be utilized
A massive tree plantation program in the whole project area will be implemented to
mitigate the ill effects of air pollution.
Vermiculture technique for treatment of biodegradable waste, which is also income
generation source, will be promoted.
9.9.3.Technology Option: Household Sanitation
a. User acceptance:
The primary consideration of technology options is user preference and choice of
what people want and what they are willing to pay for. No particular set of
technologies or technology should be prescribed, although unsafe or
environmentally detrimental options should not be promoted. The range of
technology options must be affordable.
Basic requirement for appropriate technology in human excreta management:
* Low cost
* Easy to constnict
* Easy to clean
* Easy to maintain
* Odorless
* Aesthetically good



o Suitable to climate and soil
o Safe for water sources
o Excreta not accessible to insects and animals
o  Land surface remains clean
o Recycling potential as fertilizer
b. On-site Aerobic Digestion System
i. Covering of Night Soil
It is not a technology but a behavioral practice. Covering faeces with loose soil after
defecation prevents direct contact of vectors like flies with the faeces and puts a
barrier in the fecal- oral chain. It is a concept that can be promoted as a first step
whlle promoting fixed spot defecation
ii. Trenching Method
People working on farms may dig a small trench each time they defecate and then
cover the feaces with the soil. This is sometimes known as cot method. Pits or
trenches are 300 mm deep and may be used for several weeks. Excavated soil is
heaped beside the pit/trench and some of the soil is put over faeces after each use
Decomposition in shallow trenches is rapid because of the large bacterial population
in the topsoil, but flies breed in large numbers and hookworm larvae spread around
the holes. Hookworm as larvae can migrate upwards from excreta buried less than
one meter deep to penetrate the soles of feet of subsequent users. To prevent these,
wooden planks may be used for footrests.
iii. Pit latrines
Nearly all the different models prevalent today of low cost on site sanitation are
different versions of pit latrines. Pit latrines may be simple pit latrines, ventilated pit
latrines, ventilated double pit latrines, pour flush latrines, offset pour flush latrines
and raised pit latrines. Out of the above pit latrines, the most popular and common
pit latrine is twin pit pour flush latrine approved by UNDP. Design details are given
in the Annexure LX.2
910. Technical Option For Environmental Sanitation
9.10.1. Sullage
Sullage is all household wastewater except wastewater from toilets. It is sometime
termed as grey water. lt is the wastewater from baths, sinks etc. which may be
expected to contain- considerably fewer pathogenic microorganisms than sewage.
Also it contains salts, solids and organic as well as inorganic materials. It must be
noted that out of the total water used by consumers almost 80 % of it comes from the
household as sullage. The volume of sullage produced depends on the type of water
supply. Annexure nX.1



9.10.2 Soak Pit
In soak pit method a pit of suitable dimensions is to be dug on ground- The
dimensions of the pit are length Im, width I m and depth I m. This pit is lined on all
its four sides and at the base due to which an area of 5 sqm is available As a result
of this water absorption increases by 5 times. The sullage is not spilled but it
gradually seeps in the soil. After digging the pit of required dimensions the pit is
filled with stone aggregates of varymg sizes With large sized stones at bottom and
smaller size at the top. On these aggregates either a plastic sheet or tree branches are
laUdrfd on this layer a layer of sand is spread out. On this sand layer a layer of fine
earth is spread. The earth layer is slightly elevated as compared to surrounding
ground level. At the base, intermediate and penphcra! region of the pit earthen pots
of 6 to 8 inch diameter with 5 to 6 holes are placed. It i^ necessary that the neck of
pots should produce out of the earth layer These pots are filled with dried grass,
which act as filter media. The outlet pipe carrying household sullage is placed on
these earthen pots so that the sullage will fall in central region of the pots. Due to
the presence of dry grass all the suspended matter in the sullage gets engulfed in it
and the jittered sullage water moves down through the crevices between aggregates
and is absorbed by the surrounding earth.
9.10.3. Leach Pit
The main aim of domestic on site sullage management is to produce zero community
sullage. Failure in achieving this objective leads to adoption of other management
tools and community sullage management.
When the sullage produced is m excess of the sullage handling capacity of soak pit
then in such cases leach pits are adopted. About 1.5 m dia and 1 m depth pit is dug
in earth. The boundary of pit is lined with brick network. The base of the pit is left
empty and not concreted. The water is accumulated in the pit and it seeps into earth
,through brick lining and the base of pit. This pit is covered at top with stone slab or
R.C.C. cover. One side of the pit has a provision for filling of water sealed inlet.
The advantage of the water sealed inlet is that sullage will not be exposed to
atmosphere and there will be no access to flies and mosquitoes.
9.11.Kitchen Gardening
If the sullage produced is in excess of leach pit handling capacity and if suitable
quantity of land is not available then the only option left is using the sullage for
kitchen gardening. Before applying the sullage to the garden it is passed through
cold-water grease trap. The effluent is used for cultivating vegetables and fruits. It
is important to note that the water is recycled and used by families for their
economic property.
9.12.Open drains
While deciding the dimensions of the drain it is necessary to consider information on
quantity of sullage, sullage carrying velocity, turns and curves to be given to the
drain and gradient slope. By properly constructing the drains considering all above
points efficient sullage transport can be achieved. Design parameters are given in the
Annexure.
103



9.13. Biodegradable wasites.
Vermiculture
With the help of earthworm organic biodegradable wastes are converted  to
excellent quality manure This has been proved through various experiments and
expenence. As per vanous conditions appropriate technique and appropriate class of
earthworm must be selected. The commonly used earthworm for vermni-composting
iS:
i)  Acenia
]i) Feretema elongata
iii) Lubncus terestris
Details of Vermi-composting technology are given in Annexure.
9.14. Indoor Air Pollution
Indoor air pollution is a greater threat to health than outdoor air pollution. The "Rule
of 1000" states that a pollutant released indoors is 1000 times more likely to reach
people's lungs than a pollutant released outdoors, since it is released at close
proximity. Pollutant concentrations can be extremely high, exceeding WHO
guidelines by a factor of more than 100. The use of bio mass fuels, such as wood,
dung, agricultural waste and coal, as cooking fuel is the principle cause of indoor air
pollution. The smoke from biomass fuels is a complex mixture of aerosols, which
contain significant amounts of carbon monoxide, suspended particulate matter,
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Inhahlng this smoke poses the risk of chronic
respiratory disorders, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
The smoke also contains several organic compounds that are toxic, mutagenic and
carcinogenic smoky fireplaces.
The technology option to control indoor pollution is to provide ventilation in the
kitchen and promote use of smokeless chulla and use of gobar gas for cooking. The
project intends to encourage these.
9.15. Region wise Appropriate Sanitation Technology Options
The most appropriate technology is that which best meets the needs and aspirations
of the people within all local constraints. In order to assess what is most appropriate
some important factors will have to be considered.
1. Physical Factors
a) Nature of soil
b) Presence of rock /hard strata.
c) Penneability to water, rainfall and water logging.
2. Financial constraints.
3. Construction material available
4. Availability of water
5. Ambient temperature - however in case of Maharashtra, this does not vary as
significantly as to influence technology choice.



Geographical regions cannot possibly be taken as units for appropriate technology
selection. This is due to the fact that rLral sanitation interventions are on such a
small scale that localized situation influence the choice. However, to provide a broad
guideline, a judicious combination of geographic, climatic and geological conditions
in various regions in Maharashtra the state could divided in three categones for
purposes of appropriate sanitation technology selection.
A. Region with latente and rocky soil with heavy rainfall without much water
logging. This is mainly Konkan region and Ghat Matha (higher altitudes on
both western and eastern slopes of Sahyadri range).
B. Seashore areas along Konkan region where water table is very high due to
seepage of seawater
C. The regions along large rivers where biack cotton soil layer is very deep -
-sometimes exceeding 7-8 meters Pockets of such deep black soil areas exist in
western Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada. For the purpose of a broad
guideline, it could be said that plains of Marathwada and Vidarbha fall into this
category.
D. The regions where top soil layer shallow - for 1 to 2 feet, followed by murrum
soil layers at lower levels Most of western Maharashtra, parts of Vidarbha and
Marathwada fall into this category.
In these four regions the further appropnateness of technology would depend on
mainly five criteria
1. Availability of water
2. Availability for capital cost mvestment
3. Water logging dunng rainy season.
4. High subsoil water table, say less than 1.5 m from surface.
5. Size of the family.
Based on the above-mentioned conditions the preferred technologies may be as
follows:
9.15.1. Human Excreta Management
The available range of technologies is:
1.    Aerobic digestion based
2.    Simple shallow trench. latrine and its variations.
3.    Compost latrine (e g. Gopuri latrine)
4.    Pour flush single pit or double pit latrine with various pit options as far as,
size, construction material, construction methodologies, super structure etc.
5.    The essential technology option all these variations will be a latrine pan with
steep gradient and 20 mm water seal trap.
6.    Sopa Sandas havmg flap type latrine pan and vent pipe of minimum 100 mm
dia. This type can be single pit or double pit with various pit options as far
as size, construction material, construction methodologies, super structure
etc.
9.15.2. Anaerobic Digestion based
i) Aqua privy with large HRT (preferably 45 days)
105



ii) Septic tank with large HRT (preferably 45 days)
iiM) Human excreta based biogas plant
a. For Region A
1. If there is paucity of funds and high level of motivation various options of trench
latrines may be temporanly suitable
2. In rocky situation, heavily water-logging area, moderate capital and high level of
motivation and willingness to handle manure frequently compost latrine like
Gopuri latrine can be a suitable option.
3. Where moderate quantity of water and moderate capital is available, pour flush
latrines with multiple variations in pit and superstructure will be suitable.
Latrine blerks also can be used in construction.
4. In areas with scarcity of water but moderate availability of water 'Sopa Sandas'
with use of flap type pan and vent pipe can be used.
5. In rocky areas where even lined pits cannot be used, anaerobic digestion based
processes would be suitable.
If acceptance for the use of biogas from human nightsoil is present, then nightsoil
based biogas plant would be ideal. The effluent can be composted with agricultural
or vegetation waste for recovery of fertilizers. Otherwise aqua privy or septic tank
with arrangement for proper effluent management will have to be considered.
b. For Region B
1. If the seeping sea water level is below 1 m, depending on availability of water,
pour flush pit type water seal trap latrine with suitable variations can be used. In
case of water shortage, 'Sopa Sandas' with flap type would be appropriate.
2. If underground sea water table is very high, anaerobic digestion based
technologies like biogas plant aqua privy or septic tank will be advisable.
c. For Region C
1. If there is paucity of funds and high level of motivation, various options of
trench latrines may be temporarily suitable.
2. In these regions brick work or masonry work is likely to crack and break.
Therefore, any such construction needs to be avoided. In such situations use of
ferro cement technology would be most advisable. Designs with superimposed
super structure should avoided. (The pits should be offset from the
superstructure).
As far as the designs are concerned, all the designs depending on given situation can
be used.
d. For Region D
Depending on other factors, not dependent on soil conditions, any of the above
mentioned technologies could be used.
106



e. Animal Excreta Management
Any of the following technologies can be used
1. Various composting technologies in rocky places, Nadep method above ground
would be appropnrate
2. Vermicomposting
3. Biogas plant
9.16. Garbage Management
For garbage management there may not Se any regional specification.
1. As far as possible the house hold should .anage its own garbage by
a) Composting
b) Vermi composting in suitable pits.
c) Vermi compostmg directly into plant pots
d) Use in biogas plants
2. Community garbage
a) Composting
b) Vermi composting
9.17. Sullage Management
9.17.1.Individual Sullage
As far as possible the household should manage its own sullage.  For domestic
management availability of owned land would be necessary. Depending on quantity
of sullage, mainly three technologies would be available namely
i) soak pit
ii) leach pit
iii) kitchen gardening.
The choice will depend on quantity of sullage and permeability of soil. In rocky
areas kitchen gardening on artificially made up ground is the available option.-
9.17.2.Community Sullage
a. Carniage system properly designed (please refer to notes in the Sanitation Study
for appropriate design of gutters)
b. For final treatment wastewater stabilization pond is most ideal technology. The
subsequent stabilized water can be used for irrigation, gardening, fishpond etc.
For sullage management there are not any region specifications except for region B
where sullage septic tanks may be considered.

10. ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN
The water suLpply and sanitation project as contemplated by the State government is
aimed to provide clean, safe and adequate drinking water and to improve health,
hygiene and sanitary conditions in villages. Providing sustained water supply from
ground water or surface water requires assurance for both quantity and quality. The
present project envisages and relies more on groundwater, which is available locally,
can be developed at economic cost and in short time. Sustained availability of
groundwater has quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Both these are threatened
by other competing user sectors like agriculture and industry. The drinking water
source is also liable for contamination and pollution due to natural and man-made
causes. Thus drinking water sustainability encompasses many environmental and
ecological issues that need to be identified, addressed and integrated in the project
%-sign
10.] Water Quantity issues:
Minimun per capita water supply in rural areas prescribed by Government of
Maharashtra is 40 LPCD. Presently out of 86313 villages and hamlets 59140
villages and hamlets have a safe and adequate source of drinking water supply at 40
LPCD round the year. In 18753 villages and hamlets the source created is not
adequate and needs strengthening. In remaining 8420 villages and hamlets no safe
ground water source is available and requires recourse to alternate sources of water
supply. Thus the water quantity problem exists for uncovered and partly covered
villages and hamlets. This project is trying to address the needs of 3750 villages
10.1.1. Groundwater availability
Groundwater is over-exploited in 109 watershed units. Further, if the present
situation continues, it'is estimated that by year 2030, drinking water may not be
adequate in additional 170 watershed units.
10.1.2. Declining water table
In 72 talukas water tables are progressively declining at 30 cm or more per year as a
result of excessive groumd water withdrawal. As a result of regional lowering of
water table many of the drinking water shallow open wells, bore wells and hand
pumps in these areas have either dried or become unserviceable. Trend analysis also
indicates that if the present situation were allowed to continue water table would
show progressive decline at a much faster rate than present in about 168 additional
watershed units.
The situation, therefore, requires a holistic approach and integrated water resources
management to protect drinking water sources.
10.1.3. Mitigating Measures
Sustained availability of groundwater and its protection would be achieved through
artificial recharge to groundwater to augment groundwater availability to balance
supply and demand, and by increasing the yield of a drinking well by rejuvenating
the source. This could be achieved through conventional and tnconventional



measures like constniction of percolation tanks, contour bunding, cement bandhara,
Vanrai bandhara, Gabbian stnucture, Kolliapur Type (KT) weirs, village tanks, farn
ponds, hydrofractuLnnig, bore hole blasting etc. Selection of one or combination of
these works would depend on hydrogeologicial conditions at the water supply
source
Secondly, the communities in the participating villages would be educated through
IEC about the need to conserve groundwater by optimizing the varnous demands and
controlling the current practice of over withdrawal
Aquifer Managemenit Groups would be set up for integrated water resource
management These groups would assess and decide on the intersectoral allocation
of water and oversee the utillzation of water so as to ensure sustainable drnking
water supply in a village
10.1.4. Rainwater Harvesting:
Rainwater harvesting is an important activity that augments surface and ground
water availability for domestic water needs in the area. This mitigating method
would be adopted for strengthening drinking water sources.
10.1.5. Harnessing of Springs
In mountainous regions with high rainfall and high topographlc relief more than 81
% of the rainfall is lost to sea and the region often faces drmking water scarcity from
February until next monsoon. Harnessing the innumerable spnngs that exist in these
areas would serve as a more dependable source of water supply to small habitations
Where upland stream are available, water from these sources could be diverted
through gravity mains or nsmg mains for distribution to areas with population
belowlOOO. The mechanism would be evolved to measure and monitor spnng
discharge during different seasons and the data collected would be used for
designing of civil works required for hamessing of springs.
10.1.6. Increase irrigation efficiency
Farmers would be persuaded to adopt micro irrigation system for hlgh water
constuning crops to reduce irrigation draft and protect drinking water sources.
WSSD would liaise with the Irrigation Departnent and encourage them to organize
IEC programs to educate farmers commtnity about the benefits of adoptmg micro
irrigation system for increasing irrigation efficiency and conserving water.
10.1.7. Reduction of water loss in domestic supply
Studies by Indian water Works Association indicate that the loss of water in piped
water supply scheme due to leakages range from 17 to 44%  Prevention of leakages,
introduction of water saving devices, regular maintenance and education under IEC
about efficient water use can bring down domestic water wastage to 10 - 12% IEC
program would be organized to achieve this.
l19



10.1.8. Repairs to Tanks and Ponds
Most of the village tanks, which are used as alternate sources of drinking water
supply, are silted. Desilting these to restore their near designed capacity and
simultaneously protecting these from access to animal would increase their water
availability
10.1.9. Groundwater Monitoring.
A group of para-professionals at the village level would be traincd to monitor
groundwater development and recommend appropnate measures foi exercising
provisions under the Groundwater Act to protect drinking water source. This would
include
o  prohibit construction of new wells within certain distance
o  Regulation of extraction of ground water for other than drnking water wells in
water scarcity areas and within 1 km from drinking water well
o prohibit sinking new wells for irrigation  in over -exploited and critical
watersheds
GOM shall expedite setting up of Mabarashtra Groundwater Regulatory Authority/
Maharashtra Water Resoturces Regulatory Authornty.
10.2.Water Quality issues
Groundwater in most areas of the State is of acceptable quality. However, there are
certain areas where qualty of groundwater is unsatisfactory. Water quality problems
are grouped in two categories
A. Natural Contamination
10.2.1. Salinity
In the river alluvium in parts of Buldhana, Akola and parts of Nagpur Solapur,
Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts groundwater is saline and getting adequate
quantity of fresh water is difficult. In these areas drinking water supply schemes
would be located on surface water, including rainwater harvesting. In coastal areas,
which are prone to sea water ingression, water supply schemes would be based on
shallow open wells instead of bore wells.
B. ChemicaD Contamination
10.2.2. Fluoride
Groundwater in deeper aquifers in parts of Yavatmal,, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli,
Nagpur, Parbhani, Osmanabad, Latur, Solapur, Sangli, Jalna, Beed, Sindhudurg,
districts has high concentration of fluoride than in shallow aquifers. The mitigating
measures would include
o Prefer shallow open well instead of bore wells/tube wells.



* Dilution by mixing groundwater from shallow aquifers containing less fluoride
than that from deep aquifers containing higher concentration of fluoride so as to
reduce the total fluoride concentration
*  Treat water by a range of technology options either before distnbution or at
household level as per preference and affordability of the commtnity in a given
village
e  Promote dual sourcing for all the water needs of the community by providing
limited quantity of fresh water for drinking and using fluonde contaminated
water for other allowable purposes such as bathing, washing clothes etc.
*  Promote knowledge about healthy diet that has adequate level of calcium  and
vitamin C to counter the effects ctluoride on health
10.2.3. Nitrate
Groundwater m parts of Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli  Sangli, Solapur, Satara,
Jalna, Beed, Osmanabad, Latur, Parbhani has high Nitrate content mainly due to
excess use of fertilizers for sugarcane, paddy, orange and cotton Control measures
would include
* Mapping of area with high Nitrate in groundwater.
* Ad'mocawing wsid encvmagmg thmough TMC, use of Bio-ferthi;Lers and organic
manare and a voA4ng excessn itrogen fertil!izers
* Drinking water source should be located at least 500 meters away from irrigated
area.
* Locate cattle sheds and sewage disposal at least 500 meters away from drinking
water source.
* Lining of compost pit in brick masonry.
*  Washing, bathing and other domestic activities near the source should be
avoided.
10.2.4. Iron
High concentration of iron is present in groundwater in Ratnagiri, Chandrapur,
Sindhudurg, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Solapur, Nagpur, and Kolhapur districts due to
high iron minerals in the geological formations. Mitigating measures would be to
allow iron minerals to settle in the cistem or service reservoir before distribution.
Such storage units should be cleaned once in three months and the residual iron
sludge should be removed and disposed off at safe locations.
10.3. Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Issues
The mitigating measures would include
1. Triggering a mind set change amongst the communities to eliminate the practice
of open defecation and shift over to "fixed point defecation" through innovative
community actions. Such a trigger would be achieved through IEC and
appropriate community methods. The communities would be informed about
various choices of latrine designs so as to enable them to construct a latrine as
per their preference and affordability.
2. Network of sullage and regular drains would be created / repaired/ upgraded to
minimize contamination.
3. Construct/upgrade village lanes to reduce air and noise pollution



4   Encourage Venni composting techniques for decomposition of solid waste
5. Intense IEC campaign for education to instill the hiabit of washing hands
after defecation and before and after eating food.
6. Enable regular water quality monitoinig and surveillance througlh para
professionals at the village level

It may be noted that the project of its own does not envisage any negative impact on
the environment due to the proposed interventions. However, the project would be
regularly monitored for any such negative impact that might occur due to improper
implementation of any of the interventions and same would be uimediately mitigate
the negative impact, if any, through appropriate measures.
10.4. Environmental Monitoring and Performance Indicators
Project implementation involves various interventions to achieve the objectives of
providing safe, clean, and adequate drinking water on sustainable basis and
improving health and sanitation conditions in the villages. Simultaneously, to protect
and improve the environmental conditions to achieve the goal, vanrous mitigating
measures would be taken up. For evaluating and monitornng environmental issues a
set of Performance Indicators have been identified along with the monitoring
agencies responsible at different levels. Table 10.2

10.5. Institutional Arrangement
The project envisages to builld on the existing PRI based institutional model
that enables demand driven commnitmty action The following is a bnef description
of the model
Village level   Gram   Panchayat (GP) working under the guidance andi
direction of the Gram Sabha would be the focal point
VWSC as a sub-committee of the GP selected in an open and
transparent manner in a Grain Sabha.
The GP/ VWSC would take responsibility for planning,
implementing, procurement, constniction management and 0
&M of the scheemes.
All crucial decisions regarding technology choice, cost of the
scheme, major procurement, 0 &M tariff,etc will be taken in a
Gram Sabbha.
A cadre of para-profecsionals would be developed withlin
VWSC to assist in scale up and long-term sustenance
Appropriate tramling would be provided to GP, VWSC
members, CBO    members through professionals/ agencies
contracted by ZP.
District Level  The 'Water works and Conservation Committee' as existing in
the Zilla Parishad would be the policy making and supervising
body at the District level. This committee is headed by the
President of the ZP and is an elected representative. The Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of the ZP acts as the admimstrative
head and link between implementing machinery and elected
representative. Under this committee there will be 3 teams with
distinct functions.
A District Facilitation Team (DFT) under the leadership of Dy
CEO-Village Panchayat (VP) or an equivalent officer would
act as the facilitating team. Tihis team would provide support to
the GP/ VWSCs either directly or through NGOs and other
professional bodies as needed. This team will also facilitate the
process of contracting NGOs, Technical consultants, supplier
etc. as needed by the GP/ VWSC at different stages and would
monitor their performance.
The second team 'District Appraisal Team' will be headed by
the Executive Engineer of the WSD and will be responsible for
technical evaluation of the proposals that come from the
GP/VWSCs and also checking the quality of the construction at
various stages and releasing financial assistance to GPs Third
team i.e. Accounting Wmg shall manage funds and timely
submission of claims to PPMU
It is envisaged that both these teams would work with 'fire
walls' under a common leadership of CEO /Additional CEO of
the ZP.
State Level.    The Reform Support Unit (current PPMU) at the State level
plays a very broad support role. The RSU will build the



capacities of the ZP (who will in turn build capacity at GP),
monitor the processes, have program quality checks and bring
out necessary guide lines for implementers from time to time.
The RSU will also monitor the quality of the reform process
and advise the GOM accordingly
Line Agencies   The existing line agencies, especially the GSDA and the MJP
Would be re-structured so that they would be able to play a
consultant's role to the communities as per the emerging
demand.
It might be noted that the process of taking away the
implementation responsibility from these agencies has already
started in the state. Out of the 14,000 staff in the MJP about
500 and out of 2000 staff in GSDA about 800 staff have
already been transferred to the WSDs in the ZPs and about
2000 posts in both these organizations have been abolished.
NGOs / Private  NGOs/ pnvate agencies would be contracted to support the
agencies.       project at various levels as per need. The RSU would revise the
_____________   existing NGO selection guidelines suitably.
The proposed model encourages a complete bottom up process and also provides
full scope for the communities to play a vital role and ultimately own the project.
This wll also compliment the national agenda of strengthening the grass root level
tlrough PRI organizations
A potential risk in this approach will be the lack of required capacity at the District
and the GP level for implementmg an enabling approach. However, this will be
addressed by way of:
o  Implementing the project in phases. Districts would be taicen up in batches and
manageable number of the GPs would be taken up in the first phase so that
adequate attention could be paid to build their capacity and qualitative scaling
will be ensured.
o  The project cycle at the village level envisages sufficient time for capacity
building of the GP/ VWSC members.
o  The project also builds appropriate funds for capacity development agenda.
o  The current approaches for capacity building in the sector reforms project
districts would be used here also.
The Envirommental Analysis shows that the proposed Second Maharashtra Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project itself will not cause any adverse environmental
impacts. The project will bring positive health and environmental benefits to the
project stake holders, through supply of safe and adequate drinking water and
creation of necessary environmental sanitation facilities in the project villages. The
recomnended environrmental mitigation measures appropriately integrated in the
project design would have a net positive effect on the environment. The facilities
created in the project villages will be operated and mamtained by the beneficiaries
and the GPs through necessary capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the
services.

GOVERNMENT OF MAHARASHTRA,
Water Supply & Sanitation Department,
Government Resolution No TSC-2000/CR-352/WS-16,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032
Dated the 27th July 2000
Read: - Letter No W-1 1013/6/99/TM, (CRSP), dated 23 04 1999 from   Rural
Development Department, of Central Govemment
Preamble:- The usual concept of sanitation is confined to disposal of human excreta
However, this limited idea no more reflects the concept in its totality and needs to
include  liquid and solid waste disposal, food hygiene, personal as well as
environmnental sanitation. The guidelines for Centrally Sponsored Rural Sanitation
Program  (CRSP) were first issued in November 1996  In March 1993, these
guidelines were modified The guidelines were once again modified by the Central
Government and made applicable since Apnl, 1999. The Restructured Centrally
Sponsored Rural Sanitation Program (RCSRSP) proposes to implement the policy to
imbibe the total sanitation concept amongst the masses The previous program of the
Central Government was target onented However, according to the new policy it
has been decided to provide at least 50% of the rural people sanitation facilities and
to change   the strategy of implementation  from  "target onented" to "demand
oriented" with a view  to make this total sanitation program  more effective and
people oriented This program will now be implemented in following two phases -
(1) Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC).- It will be implemented in the first year in the
districts selected as "Pilot District " by Central Government.
(2) Allocation Based Sanitation Program- It will be implemented in the remaining
districts However, by the end of Ninth Five Year Plan "Total Sanitation Campaign"
shall be implemented in stages in all the districts by phasing out Allocation Based
Sanitation Program. There is no difference in the obiective of both the programs. In
the districts selected as pilot districts the comprehensive project for whole district
will be prepared to include all the aspects of total sanitation and the fin&1cial
assistance shall be made available within specified time in accordance with the
approved project. In other districts the program will be implemented to the extent
possible within the available financial allocation till they are approved  as "Total
6



Sanitation Campaign Distrcts" and  the projects based financial assistance is made
available The issue of giving sanction to this modified Centrally Sponsored Program
for implementation in the state was under the consideration of State Government

Centrally Sponsored Rural Sanitation Program in the rural areas of the State in

4.2    Key Issties
4 2 1 Water Supply Arrangements -
Grampanchayat dug wells - 2
Hand Pumps - 5 (all working)
Water Quality TDS, Hardness and Chloride beyond permissible limits
Villagers use hand pump water for other domestic purposes and not for cooking and
drinking Use of dug wells discontinued since construction of bore wells installed
with Hand pump Hand pump location is well distnbuted Not enough attention paid
to their chlorination In summer hand pumps become defunct due to lowering of
water levels and water is supplied through tankers. There is willingness to pay for
improved services in the water supply related services Most women felt the need to
have availability of water at their doorsteps as it would save their time and reduce
their hardships involved in collection of water
4.2 2  Sanitation Issues
Village has 16 private latrines and no community latnne. Construction of individual
latrines is preferred to community latrines at common place
There is only one common drain, which remains choked. There is demand for a few
more drains. Availability of solid waste disposable site:
Collection of solid wastes at the household level varies from collecting the waste in a
bin or a packet and throwing it directly outside the house It was reported that there
are smalH pits around the village Each family has a designated pit, which is used not
only for the household waste but also for the cattle dung etc. Some people also bum
the waste outside their homes. There is no segregation of the biodegradable and non-
biodegradable waste
4 2 3  Health Issues
People and children usually suffer from Malaria, Typhoid, Cough, Gastroenteritis and
occasionally with Jaundice It is due to consumption of water with bacteriological
contamination and concentration of TDS, chlorides and total hardness beyond
permissible limits
5. Workshop Proceedings:
Village Sarpanch put forth salient features of village and present water supply,
sanitation and health status of village Joint Director, GSDA explained the project
components related to water supply in terms of Water quantity and quality issues and
DHO, Z P explained the sanitation and health component of the project Executive

Women in the village are never called for Gramsabha meetings although they have
earnest desire to participate in all activities related to water supply and sanitation
Total cost of the proposed village water supply scheme under 'Swaraj Dhara' is Rs
14,97,309/- 10% of capital cost is Rs. 1 49 lakhs Majority of village population
belongs to well to do category migrated from A. P. and expressed their willingness to
pay as well for 100% maintenance of scheme
Such type of public consultation workshop organised for the first time ' Community
beneficiaries from all categones including women were found to be extremely
responsive and willing to participate in all activities  Besides chloride and total
harness beyond limit, High TDS concentration in the range of 1500 to 3340 mg/I is
major point of concern for the entire target group.
Strengthening of existing drinking water sources may not be useful since all the
dnnking water sources with high TDS, total hardness and chloride Even protection
by implementing provisions in Maharashtra Ground Water Act may not be effective in
view of water quality problem
Community has focus to stop open defecation and there is demand for sanitation
services at user level i e demand for individual latnnes rather than demand for
community latrines Well to do families in particular have self-realization rather than
demand for fiscal subsidy They have also realized that improper sanitation and
unhygienic habits lead to major health problems amongst children

PREAMBLE:
I Groundwater is the main source for dnnking water in rural areas Almost 85%
schemes in rural areas are based on groundwater However, due to over-exploitation of
groundwater and inadequate recharge, such sources dry up resulting in failure of the
scheme Government of Maharashtra, since the creation of this State, has adopted
various measures for dnnking water supply to rural and urban areas In spite of
spending thousands of crores of rupees over the years, even now many villages/wadis
do not get adequate potable drinking water Where vanous drinking water supply
schemes have been taken up, water from surface or groundwater based sources at
considerable distance has to be brought for piped water supply schemes. The main
reason for this is the drying up of the original source(s).
2 It is, therefore, necessary to lay greater emphasis on strengthening the drinking
water sources by recharge. However, instead of doing that as soon as a source goes
dry, a new scheme is taken up One more reason for this is that, the water supply
schemes include expenditure for items like development of source, distribution, stand-
posts, but no provision is made for source strengthening, if the source becomes
inadequate
3.As mentioned above, majority of water supply schemes are based on groundwater
sources Some efforts have been made for strengthening of such sources through
adoption of various water conservation measures and improving the over-all water
levels However, the additional water made available by such recharge is used not
34



necessarily for drinking water purposes only but also harvested by some people for
other purposes The main reason for that is that the right to groundwater has not been
established by any legislation unlike in the case surface water It is generally assured
that groundwater available under a peace of land belongs to the owner of the land and
the can use it as he wants
4 In order to alleviate the scarcity of drinking water, Government has enforced the
Maharashtra Groundwater (Regulation for Drinking Water Purposes) Act, 1993 and
Rules thereof in 1995 The Collectors of the districts have been empowered to protect
the drinking water sources through the provisions of Act / rules, but it has not helped
niuch
5 Instead of just the above legal provisions, for proper planning of water by the village
level community by considering that the water available in the village belongs to
village and as a whole giving priority to the drinking water, in respect of those villages
in the State, which consistently often face drinking water scarcity and are tankerfed,
Government had issued instructions wide Resolution dated 28/9/2000 referred at (3)
above, regarding implementation of " Three pronged Strategy " However, effective
implementation of this Government Resolution has not commenced as yet, at village
level
6 As per the circular dated 11/11/1998 referred at (1) above, instructions were issued
by this Department to all the implementing agencies for taking up measures for
rainwater harvesting and its use for drinking water purposes However, it does not
appear that the work has been taken up seriously by the implementing agency
7 Even if the water storage in watershed is augmented by taking conventional water
conservation measures, it will be practically and politically difficult to impose
restrictions on the use for imgation and other purposes, so as to preserve adequate
quantity for drinking purposes
8 During the last year's scarcity penod, tankers had to be made available on large scale
and many other scarcity relief measures had to be taken up. The main reason behind
this has been found to be the depletion or drying up of the sources of water even when
the system of the water supply scheme is available in the concemed village
9 Under various water conservation measures, the recharge to groundwater is basically
received from rainwater Hence it would be appropriate if the rainwater could be
directly used for recharge or rainwater being very pure if it could be used directly for
drinking purpose  Under these circumstances, it was under consideration of the
Govemment to take up a Program and implement a comprehensive scheme for use of
rainwater for strengthening the drinking water sources or storage and use of rainwater
at individual or public levels by using the available technology through people's
participation

Govern ment Resolution
Considering all the aspects mentioned in the Prearnble, and for sustainable availability
of drinking water from the water supply schemes , Governmeit is pleased to accord
sanction to the implementation of "Shivka]in Pant Sathawan Yojana" providing for the
conventional and non-conventional measures for drinking water source strengthening,
roof-top rain water harvesting, construction of the tanks in the hilly areas of village for
storage of rain water and similar other measures for sustained availability of drinking
water in the State.
2 The measures included in the "Shivkalin Pani Sathawan Yojana", nomis for the
implementation and the availability of funds therefore are as below
A)     Measures
Necessary measures for collecting the rainwater for drinking and other purposes by
adopting roof-top rain water harvesting on all the public and government buildings in
villages, towns and cities
X Measures for collecting the rainwater for drinking and domestic use by adopting
roof-top rain water harvesting on private houses and structures
n Measures for constnicting storage tanks in the hilly areas of village and storing
spring water for drnking and other purpose
in.Measures for collection of rain water and its direct recharge into the public drinking
water sources by all possible conventional and un-conventional methods
iv Other c_nventional measures, by which dnnking water can be made available (e g
water conservation measures like desilting and deepening of tanks /wells, check dams,
etc )
v Unconventioiial measures like jacket well, bore-blast technique, fracture seal
cementation, stream blasting; recharging through borewells etc will be implemented
in selected villages / wadis of all the districts in the state.
vi.Besides these, other scientific and technically feasible innovative methods for
augmentation of water depending on the local situation and traditional wisdom,
B) Above mentioned measures should be implemented as per the norms given below
i) Initially this program should be taken up as a pilot project in the current year in
100 villages / wadis of each of the districts in the State, from the Government
and other public funds.
ii) From the next financial year, this program should be implemented in the State
on regular basis
ii) There is no objection for independent implementation of the program by the
individual and public institutions / beneficiaries from their own funds
iv) While selecting these villages, pnority will be given to those villages which
were tanker-fed during last 3 years or have to be tackled by various measures



under scarcity In such villages, no other new scheme under scarcity relief or
under tanker-free program under implementation in the should have becn
taken up or where such schemes are operational but water supply is less than
prevailing per capita norms
v) Amongst the tanker-fed villages, priority will be given to those villages which
had received awards at taluka district, division  or state level under Sant
Gadage Baba Gram Swachhata Abhiyan.(Saint Gadage B3aba Clean Village
Campaign)
vi) In addition to the award winner villages under Sant Gadage Baba Gram
Swachhata Abhiyan, if the Gram Sablia of other tanker-fed villages resolve to
take up the scheme, they will be given the next priority for this program
vii) Some villages, which are not scarcity affected but eager to adopt rain water
harvesting, come forward, and if the villages from above mentioned priorities
(i)-(vi) are not available, they will be included in this program
viii) In the villages where original source has become inadequate and there is a
demand for new source or a new scheme, before taking up new schemes or
new sources in such villages, possibility of ground water recharge and source
strengthening through rain water harvesting for solving the problem will be
ascertained If this is not possible, then only new source / scheme should be
taken up
C Availability of Funds:
1)     At least 25% of the funds reserved for Sub-Mission project from  the
centrally assisted Accelerated Rural Water Supply Scheme and state funded
minimum Needs Program will be spent for these measures.
ni)    In the Pilot Project Distncts, which receive central assistance under Sector
Reforms Program, minimum 5% of the funds will be spent on these
measures
iii)   At least 10% from the District Maintenance & Repairs Fund of the Zilla
Parishad created for maintenance of the water supply schemes will be
utilised for these measures
iv)    Funds being  made available by the XI Finance Commission      for
augmentation of conventional drinking water sources shall be used for these
measures
v)     The Employment Guarantee Scheme and Assured Employment Scheme
funds will be utilised for such of these measures as fit in to their norms
vi)    Funds as would be made available from  the Local Area Development
Program Funds of M Ps and M L As
vii)   Funds received for these measures from UNICEF and other international
organisations will be used for this purpose
37



B)     Guidelines for implementation of the program
I In the villages where these measures are to be taken, the informationi of existing
private and public water sources as well as the rainfall data should first be compiled
2 Information of available water and its quality, should be collected (participation of
village youth, women and students in this is expected)
3 Total requirement of water for the village should be assessed This should be
assessed by taking into consideration the combined requirements of drinking water,
domestic consumption, agricultural and industrial uses and need for cattle population
4 Information -should be obtained regarding present use of water available in the
village for above mentioned purposes (Village should seek assistance of the technical
officers from Zilla Parishad and voluntary organisations for the purpose )
5 On the basis of above information, preliminary list of the measures to be adopted for
removing the difference in the available water and requirement of water should be
prepared in the Gram Sabha These measures can be as given below and the decision
for this should be taken as warranted by the situation, by the Gram Sabha, -
a)   Deciding the priority of utilisation of water as per availability of
water, in which first priority to be given for drinking water
b)   Increasing the water charges for irrigation, drinking water and
other purposes / adopting modem methods for proper utilisation of
water
c)   Imposing community   restnctions on the depth of wells being
constructed for irrigation / community control on the present use of
water
d)   Imposing community restnctions on the wells / borewells to be
constructed for imgation
e)   Taking penal action through appropriate resolution of the Gram
Sabha against those who do not adhere to the stipulated utilisation
of the water, or causing wastage of water
f)   Imposing restrictions on the use of water by factories in the village
and for prevention of pollution
g)   Taking action as per section 16 of the Groundwater Act,1993
against those found misusing the water sources and scheme
h)   Making recommendations to the Competent Authority for refusing
vanous concessions or debarring from holding a public post, in
case of those who do not abide by the decisions taken by the
village in the Gram Sabha.
The Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee designated by the Gram Sabha
will compile all the above information through various means and put up before the
Gram Sabha For this, the infonnation should be first collected on famnily / ward



/wadi /habitation level It will be necessary to take group-wise meetings at various
levels Separate wadi / habitation level meetings of the women will have to be taken
Assistance of the women's groups, youth groups, schools and government agencies
like Talathi , Gram Sevak will be taken As per necessity, the village will also take the
assistance of individuals / voluntary organisations as well as Zilla Parishad or
government agencies who arc conversant with the methods of compilation of sucIh
information
(I) After compilation of the above information and discussions thereon at
various levels, it should be finally submitted to the Gram Sabha called
spzcifically for this purpose  After taking into consideration the above
information, the Gram Sabha will prepare a draft plan for the use of
available water in the village In this draft plan, mention should be made
regarding measures for augmentation of water, various constructions
under these measures, expenditure for the same, items to be taken up at
the individual and community level, financial provisions therefor,
contribution of the beneficiaries to be obtained for individual
construction, participation of the beneficiaries in the community works
etc Stages of implementation of program, time span and the financial,
technical and management assistance expected from the Government
should also be mentioned
(2) Gram Sabha can invite the district or taluka level officers of the Zilla
Parishad, and Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency, if their
guidance is necessary  Gram Sabha should also discuss the decisions
taken at the ward / wadi / habitation level and women's group meetings
For providing information to Gram Sabha, regarding the advice and co-
operation given by   voluntary organtsations / individuals , such
organisations / individuals should also be invited to the Gran Sabha
(3) Some times, Gram Sabha may have to be called 2-3 times, if necessary
(4)  After preparation of the Action Plan as mentioned above, designs and
plans of the involved schemes for actual implementation should be
prepared   For this purpose, assistance of, Zilla Parishad, GSDA,
voluntary organisations or private experts may be taken Before taking
such assistance, appropriate contract or M.O U should be made with the
relevant agency, as necessary
(5)  Agency for implementation of the program should be decided in the
Gram Sabha This may include participation of the beneficiaries, Village
Panchayat, Village level Water Supply & Sanitation Committee, and the
women's group, youth group, sports group, schools, colleges, etc in the
village



(6)  For appointing by transparent methods, the out-side technical and works
agency for implementation, the Village level Water Supply & Sanitation
Committee designated by the Gram Sabha will attend to the necessary
work of preparation of tender documents, advertisement of tenders,
actual scrutiny of the tenders received, and taking final decision, issue of
work order to the selected agency, monitoring of the agency's work,
purchase of  material required for the scheme as per the procedure
stipulated by the Government or as per rate contract, payment of the
stage-wise bills of the work countersigned by the engineers appointed by
the Zilla Parishad or relevant Government P2partment The Gram Sabha
resolution so authorising the committee should incorporate the details of
the items of work I responsibility in which full powers are given to the
Committee and in which the Committee has to take the final approval by
the Gran Sabha after completing the preliminary action
(7)  The Village Water Supply & Sanitation Comirttee  will be a sub-
committee of the Village Panchayat Minimum one-third members of
this Committee shall be from out of the members of the Gram Panchayat,
but they will be elected by the Gram Sabha only While selecting this
committee, at least 50 % women as well as appropnate number of
representatives from backward communities shall be included Similarly,
it is necessary to ensure appropriate representation of each of the wadi /
habitation in the area of the Village Panchayat on their Committee A
separate meetings of the women as well as of each wadi/ habitation will
have to be conducted before the meeting of Gram Sabha In these
meetings, the panel of members including women to be sent on the
Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee should be prepared and
sent to the Gram Sabha Gram Sabha will select the members for the
Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee from these panels only
Subject to maintaining the prescnbed percentage and representation of
women and habitations, there is no objection to the inclusion of even all
the Village Panchayat mernbers in the Village Water Supply & Sanitation
Committee if the Gram Sabha so resolves The decision as to whether
the Sarpanch or anybody else should be the Chairman of the Village
Water Supply & Sanitation Committee is also to be taken by the Gram
Sabha This decision is entirely in the  purview of the Gram Sabha
Procedure regarding selection of the Village Water Supply & Sanitation
Committee as mentioned in the Government Resolution referred at
sr no 4 above should be followed
(8)  Identity card should be issued to the members of the implementing and
410



supervisory agencies So also the responsibilit'y and power/authorities
should be i\ en to specific persons for lodging complaint with the police,
under section 16 of the Groundwater Act, against those causing damage
to the water supply sources and schemes
(9)  As per the decision of the Gram Sabha, technical assistance of GSDA,
voluntary orpanisations, Zilla Parishad, relevant government departments
or outside experts for all the above works may be taken For these works,
the 'financial standards' prepared by the relevant technical departments
of the Government will be the 'approved standards' As per the local
conditions, appropriate changes can be made in these, on the advice of
the experts and traditional wisdom of the villagers  However, such
works should be taken up only after obtaining approval of the Gram
Sabha and the sanction of the committee constituted under the
chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad for final
sanction  As far as possible the committee should not approve the
expenditure beyond the standards except with sufficient justification
(10) The district level committee under the chairmanship of the Chief
Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad, will accord approval to the Action
Plan prepared by the village and the schemes therein, as per the
availability of financial provisions For compilaion of the information
regarding sources in the village and preparation of the actual plan,
financial assistance to the extent of Rs 5,000/- will be given to the
village and the amount will be deposited in the ,account of the Village
Water Supply & Sanitation Committee. It will be allowed to spend this
amount for survey and preparation of action plan However, the District
Committee will grant permission for withdrawal of this amount only after
submission of the report
(11) If there is any dispute between two villages regarding use of water
arising out of the action plan, it will be settled by the District Committee
under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer
(12) Special training regarding preparation of plans and compilation of
necessary information will be given to some persons at the village level
(13) If the water sources in the village are being polluted by some factory, the
responsibility for lodging complaint with the Pollution Control Board
will be of Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee, as per the
directives of the Gram Sabha. Similarly, the responsibility for lodging
complaints with the District Collector regarding creation of any water
sources in contravention of the Groundwater Act will also rest with the
Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee



(14) There are conventional and unconventional methods for augmentation of
availability of water  Strengthening of sources like  tanks, streams,
springs, etc can be taken up under conventional measures As per the
situation in the village, development and strengthening of drinking water
sources by excavation of storage tanks in the hilly area, desilting of
tanks, village tanks and impounding the springs can be taken up
(1 5) Based on the rainfall, rainwater harvesting structures on the individual
houses and public buildings may be taken These can be taken up in
the areas receiving an average rainfall of  more than 20 cms ( 8
inches)
(16) The details regarding norms for roof-top area, methods, material required
and how much water can be stored as well as the standard expenditure
for that are given in the Annexure-Il of the Government Resolution dated
14 02 2002 There is scope for economising on standard expenditure by
using locally available materials Arrangements to impart training for
erection of these structures will be made through GSDA, Zilla Parishads,
voluntary organisations, UNICEF and individual experts
(17) After the approval for action plan by the District level Committee under
the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad,
appropnate funds will be made available for the village every year by
taking  into  consideration  the total financial funds  available.
Implementation of the program is to be done as decided by the Gram
Sabha after the approval of the Committee, but only the approved works
should be taken up for implementation. However, there is no objection
for taking up other works from their own funds.
(18) Inspection of various works taken up under this program will be done by
GSDA, govemment appointed experts, voluntary organisation and
officers of the Zilla Panshad. After approval of the Gram Sabha, funds
will be distributed to the concemed implementing agencies and
individual beneficiaries. For this purpose, amounts will be disbursed
according to the stages (mile stone) of works
(19) These works can not be taken up through contractors independently and
on Tum Key Basis, but assistance of voluntary organisations can be
taken  Wherever possible, works should be done at the community
level Where there is no altemative, contractors can be appointed for
specific technical works, by adopting transparent methods.  Labour
component of these works will have to be undertaken by the concemed
beneficiary in case of individual schemes and by the villagers in case of
community schemes. In case of the schemes involving large component
42



of unskilled / semi-skilled works, the village may give priority to the
beneficiaries who are regularly dependent on labour work for their
livehhood, for doing that part of work over and above the voluntary
labour  They should be paid wages at the normal rates and their
voluntary contribLition in terms of their wish and as decided by Gram
Sabha, may be adjusted from these wages  Those who do not wish to
contribute voluntary labour, their contribution should be taken in cash
from them  Since this contribution is to be taken @ 10%, Gram Sabha
will have to ensure that the amount to be adjusted from the wages of
those giving the voluntary lahour is not more than those giving the cash
contnbution In fact the Gram Sabha should factor in the criteria of
affordability and having capacity of each individual while deciding an
their contribution towards Popular contribution
(20) The material required for this scheme should, as far as possible, be
procured from the suppliers pre-qualified by Zilla Parishad and
Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran For this purpose the village ( the
Village Water Supply & Samtation Committee as may be resolved by
the Gram Sabha) should invite tenders and the supplier selected from
these suppliers should be given the order For technical work involved in
this, the expenditure can be made on payment of fees for technical
advice, to GSDA / MJP or individual experts / voluntary organisations as
decided by Gram Sabha, at the prescribed rates
(21) To obtain Govemment funds for taking up public or individual measures
for rainwater harvesting and thereby recharging the sources or creating
storage of water, the Gram Sabha will select the public sources /
buildings and individual beneficiaries  Gram  Sabha approval is,
however, not necessary if any body wants to take up these schemes from
their own funds However, powers and responsibilities to ensure that
such construction does not affect the overall village management of
water and for necessary intervention will rest with the Village Water
Supply & Sanitation Committee and the Gram Sabha
3      At the district level, a committee should be constituted as given below, to
examine the proposal received from the Village Panchayat as decided by the Gram
Sabha, and to decide the intense priority and sanction the schemes

Committee can also give necessary directives to the conceined officer for
planning at the village level
4      The district level committee wvill take the following action on the proposals
received -
(1) Structures for recharge of public drinking water sources or -rainwater
harvesting public places / -buildings can be taken up from the funds
reserved for this purpose under the Centrally assisted Accelerated Rural
Water Supply Program A proposal should be prepared for this and
submitted with recommendations to the Technical Committee under the
chairmanship of the Secretary, Water Supply & Sanitation Department
As may be necessary, the Technical Committee may consider delegating
these powers to the District Committee  After the approval of the
Technical Committee, the powers for implementation of the proposal
will be vested with the Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee
and Gram Sabha At the village level, while implementing the approved
proposals, the Village Water Supply & Sanitation Committee will follow
the procedure laid down by the Government vide Resolutions dated 27th
July 2000 and 3rd September, 2001 for implementation of water supply
schemes through people's participation, so far as they are reluctant to the
scheme
(2) The schemes mentioned in the Para I above can also be taken from the
M L A / M P Local Area Development Scheme funds The scheme can
be taken up if such measures are proposed by the concemed people's
representative and if the technical approval is given by tlh Committee
under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer Power to accord
administrative approval for such schemes will however, be with the
District Collector.
(3) The Committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer
will accord approval for taking up these measures from the funds
reserved for such measures in the Sub-Mission Project under Minimum
Needs Program

(5) Funds made available by UNICEF can be used for Rainwater Harvesting
structures on individual houses / buildings or recharge of private wells /
borewells For this, 10% of the total expenditure as popular contnbution
from the beneficiary (in cash, kind or in the form of voluntary labour)
will be necessary Out of the remaining, 60% from UNICEF and 30% by
the State Government will be made available from the funds reserved
under various schemes The power to sanction such structures, as per the
recommendations of Gram Sabha will be ve'sted with the District
Committee unider the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer
However, the implementation is to be done entirely by the individual
beneficiary  Assistance in this connection may be taken from the
voluntary organisations or Village Panchayat  Responsibility of
supervision of these works will rest with the Water Supply and Sanitation
Committee,  Zilla  Parishad,  government  appointed  voluntary
organisations, GSDA (as will be decided by the Government)
(6) If the UNICEF assistance required for individual structures, as per the
demand from the village is inadequate, powers to take decision for
making available the entire 90 % component from other various funds
mentioned above a'nd after taking into consideration the requirement of
funds for public sources, will be vested with' the Water Supply &
Sanitation Department
(7) In the pilot districts selected from Central Government's Sector Reforms
Program, this scheme will be implemented from the grants available
under Sector Reform Program of Central Government
(8) As mentioned above, it will be the responsibility of the Distnct
Committee to train the masons for construction of such structures The
training program will be organised with the concurrence of Village
Panchayat Priority for this should be given to women and youth in the
village
5      In order to make this program successful, the Chief Executive Officer should
organise Publicity Campaign with the help of N G Os at district level Publicity
Campaign at State level will also be taken up as per necessity
6      Henceforth while giving permission for construction of individual houses /
public buildings / school buildings in rural areas, the Competent Authority should not
give permission unless the structure for rainwater harvesting is included For this
purpose, these restrictions will be imposed by taking into consideration the average
rainfall, roof type, minimum area, material to be used, etc in the concerned village
The action regarding the administrative orders or necessary modifications in the rules
will be done separately by Rural Development Department
15



7 Decision to urban areas, will be taken up after the study by Uiban Development
Department and, orders will be issued in due course of time
8 Rainwater harvesting and recharge structures should be taken in all Government
offices and buildings in the State Expenditure on this should be incurred from the

Technical Options for treatmeiit of Fluoride in Drinking water
The best sol:o on to the fluoride problem is of course to avoid locating wells in high
fluoride aquifers .The fluoride concentration often fluctuates within the same
catchment basin and an improvement may be obtained through change of well site
However, in the absence of any alternative source of safe drinking water, the
defluoridation techniques may be practiced for safe drinking water-Varioius Artificial
recharge to ground water, including Aquifer Storage Recovery (ASR) techniques may
be applied to improve the quality of water by dilution' Some of the remedial
techniques are described here which can be followed depending upon the resources
availability and other conditions
1.  Defluoridation Techniques
The most common defluorndation techniques are the methods using aluminum
compounds as absorption media These can be divided into two categories - those
based upon the addition of chemicals to cause precipitation and complexation and
those based upon ion exchange
a. Complexation methods
The technique, in India popularly known as the "Nalgonda model", Is based on
mixing the raw water with aluminum sulphate or alum (Potassium-aluminum
sulphate), followed by precipitation, settling and filtration Lime is added to ensure
adequate alkalinity for an effective hydrolysis of the aluminum salts, thus preventing
residual aluminum to remain in the treated water Norrnally, bleaching powder Is also
added for disaffection
b. Ion Exchange method:
A simple version of this method, using aluminum oxide as ion exchanger, is marketed
in India under the narne  "Prasanthi technique " The raw water is poured over an
aluminum oxide filter and the defluorudated water is then stored in a storage tank
Aluminum oxide with its iso-electnc point has approximately pH 9 5 In most natural
waters, it will remove anions below this pH and cations above. There are models
available both for domestic and community use The manufacturer has described the
procedure while using these plants in five steps, Acidification, Loading, Back
washing, Rinsing and Regeneration The frequency for back washing and rinsing is not
included In the information from the manufacturer Regeneration has to be done once
in a year for the domestic plants and once a month for the community plants
2. Domestic Defluoridation:
Defluoridation at domestic level can be carried out in a container (bucket) of 60 liter
capacity with a tap 3-5 cm above bottom of the contaner for the withdrawal of treated
water after precipitation and settling the raw water taken in the container, is mixed
with adequate amount of aluminum sulphate solution (alum), lime or sodium
carbonate and bleaching powder depending upon its alkalinity and fluoride content
Alum solution is added first and mixed well with water Lime or sodium carbonate
47



solution then added and the water stirred slowly for 20 mm ites and allowed to settle
for nearly an hour and is withdrawn The supematent which contains permissible
amount of fluoride is withdrawn through the tap for consumption. The settled sludge is
discarded Approximate volumes of alum solutions for defluoridatiion of 40 litels of
water are given below

Technology Options for treatment of Nitrate in Drinking water
In areas where groundwater is highly polluted with Nitrate, it is advantage to change
the source from ground water to surface water or locate the ground water souL-ce away
from Nitrate polluted zone and transport water from distance Another option is water
containing high levels of nitrate could be combined with an equal amount of water
with a low level of nitrate to achieve a safe concentration of nitrate In areas where
obtaining adequate drinking water of good quality is difficult it is advisable to Provide
limited quantity of good quality surface of ground water for drinking and for other
uses ground water with higher nitrate could be supplied
Following technological options are available for treatment of Nitrate Depending on
the local situation single or combination of these wdould be adopted for location
specific problem
I Treatment Techniques:
These techniques consist of ion exchange, biochemical denitrification and reverse
osmosis Although none of these techniques are completely effective in removing all
nitrate from well water or any other sub surface water The success rate of these
techniques depends on the condition of plant operation and the other contaminants
found in water
2 Ion Exchange:
In the ion exchange process special resins are used to exchange some ions with nitrate
Most often chlonde is exchanged with nitrate The ion exchange unit is a tank filed
with special resin beads that are charged with chloride As water containing nitrate
flows through the tank, the resin takes up in exchange for nitrate The resin can then be
recharged by back washing with a brine solution (sodium chloride) and re-used
Laboratory experiments have shown that ion exchange resin can reduce nitrate
concentration from as high as 250 mglL of Nitrate to 2 5 mg/L However, there are
some drawbacks to ion exchange systems. First in addition to exchanging nitrates the
resin beads will also take up sulphate in exchange for chloride. Therefore, if sulphates
are present in the water supply, the capacity of resin to take up nitrate is reduced
Second the resin may also make the water corrosive For the resin the water must go
through a neutralizing system after going through the ion exchange unit Finally, the
backwash brines, which are high in nitrate, must be disposed off properly so they do
not re-contaminated the groundwater supply
3. Bio-chemical dentnrfication
Wherever ground water is containing nitrate above 45 mg/A it requires treatment
Following methods are used for treatment of Nitrate m the water
Method I
Ion selective method
A specially developed nitrate selective ion exchange resin is used for the nitrate
removal systems This resin reduces nitrates to less than 45 ppm WHO limit This
treatment for removal of nitrates is compact and economical Method requires fewer
chemicals and no electricity Spent resin can be regenerated by Sodium Chloride
(Ordinary salt solution)
Method 11
Removal of nitrates is also possible biologically under "anoxic" conditions The
process is known as de-nitrification Conversion of Nitrate-Nitrogen to a readily
removable form can be accomplished by several genera of bacteria Some of them are.
5i



Achromobacter, Aerobacter, Lactobacillus, Micro coccus, Proteus, Pseudomonas and
Spirillum These bacteria are heterotrophs capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction, a
two step process The first step is conversion of nitrate to nitrite This stage is followed
by production of nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas
The reaction for nitrate reduction is
N03 ---     N02 ------ No ----- N20 ----- N2
The last three compounds are gaseous products that can released to the atmosphere
In denitrifying systems, dissolved oxygen concentration is the critical parameter The
presence of DO will suppress the enzyme system needed for de-nitrification
Alkalinity is produced during the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas resulting in an
increases in pH The optimal pH lies between 7 and 8 with different optimums for
different bactenal productions
The process requires skilled operation and will not be suitable for rural water supply
scheme
4. Reverse Osmosis:
The demineralization of water in this process is done by putting it under pressure and
force through a membrane that filters out rmnerals and nitrate One half to two-thirds
of water remains behind the membrane as rejected water. The yield of treated water to
reject water is related to the amount of pressure applied the lower the water pressures,
the greater the volume of reject water. Higher-yields systems use water pressures in
excess of 1 50 psi

Technology Options for treatment of lron in drinkinig water
High Iron content in groundwater is objectionable because of discoloration , turbidity
taste variation and deposits in distribution mains Iron removal is however very simple
and can be achieved by aeration of water and seting out of the iron oxide sludg,e
formed by aeration Removal methods are as given below
A) Package Plant ( Hand pump attachable iron Removal Plant)
For rural water supplk scheme package type iron removal plants are developed 1!
NEERI Brief description of such plant is oiven in the subsequent sub section
The plant is based on awerage discharge of 1 m3/hr of India Mark lI-or equivalent hand
pump the hydraulic loading is adequate to serve a population of 250 at 10 liters of
water per person and 10 hour operation daily
The plant comprises of three chambers
Oxidation Chamber
Flocculation charnber
Sedimentation chamber
Hand pump water is sprayed over an oxidation  the aerated water flows over baffle
plate to a flocculation chamber The water then flows to a sedimentation chamber The
water can passes through plate settles and to the filter where the filtered water is drawn
through a tap after chlorination
The Ferric precipitate settles as sludge and requires periodic scouring depending upon
raw water qualirn and quality drawn
No chemical is used except for chlorine solution for disaffection The plant requires
cleaning twice a month The operation and maintenance cost are low
The capital cost is about Rs 15,000
b) Plant for Larger Communities.
Incase where hand pump is not a source and community size is larger then 500 souls a
simple and inexpensive treatment unit for the removal of iron is suggested so that the
difficulties of operation and maintenance are minimum The scheme designed for
containing free carbon dioxide and dissolved iron and compnses of aeration chamber,
sedimentation basin and sand filters
Aeration rate of 1 26 m3 /m2 /hr are employed for aerating water In low alkalinity
water provision for adding sodium carbonate is to be provided Sedimentation basin
having a detention period of 3hrs is used for clarifying water Slow or rapid gravity
sand filter is used for filtering water
Based on the design critena discussed above iron removal plants are designed Sizes of
various Aerator and Settling Tank for iron removal plant for different community size
are given below in Table I and Table 2

Technology Option for Treatment For Bacterial Contamination (Disinfecting)
Disinfections will be essential part of all water supply schemes Disinfections process
makes water free from all sort of bacterial contamination and thus safe for drinkinog In
rural areas, because of lack of sanitation, wastewater treatment facilities and poor
personal hygiene, contamination of water sources by sewage or fecal matter cannoi be
ruled out   Wherever water quality indicates presence of disease producing
microorganisms, Disinfections can be carried out before water is supplied to
consun;er,
Various methods are available for disinfecting water These are broadly classified into
two categories
Chemical Method
Non - Chemical Method
Chemical Methods involve addition of chemicals to the water, which kills the
pathogens to make water safe for drinking Following chemicals can be employed for
the purpose of Disinfections
Oxidizing chemicals including halogens, ozone and other oxidants such as potassium
permanganate and hydrogen peroxide
Metals Salts Like Aluminum sulfate, etc
Alkalis and Acids
Surface active Chemicals
Non-chemical methods are heating, exposure to UV and X- rays
Heating water for disinfecting is a common methods used by households
However this can not be adopted in community water supply scheme
Disinfecting by UV is getting popular for household and community water supply
schemes However this requires continuous power supply,. also Disinfection is
effective only if carried out at user point Contamination in line can not be avoided
because method does not provided residual disinfectant in the water
Thus the households can employ non - chemical methods, but they will not be suitable
for community water supply schemes.
In rural water supply scheme chemical methods will be method of choice because of
cost effectiveness, low skill requirement, easy availability of common disinfecting
chemicals
The following should be criteria for selecting good disinfectants
Effective in killing pathogenic microorganisms.
Readily soluble
Not imparting taste, odor or color to water
Non toxic to human life
Easy to detect
Easy to handle, transport. apply and control
Readily available
Details of altemative disinfecting chemicals and their use in rural water supply scheme
will be given in Technical Manual
Potassium permanganate is an effective and safe disinfectant However its use is
associated with following disadvantages
High cost of chemical in comparison to chlorine and chlonne compounds
55



Not easily available
Impart color odor and taste to water
Requires careful addition excess dosing increases manganese content in water
Ozone is also a good and clean disinfectant but its use in rural water supply scheme
will not be feasible for following reasons
High capitol cost
High 0 & M skill requirement
Continuous power requirement
Non - availability of residual disinfectant for preventing contamination of water in
supply line
Chlorine and Chlorine compounds which are widely used as disinfectants are
discussed here below
Chlorine compounds used in disinfection
Chlonne as disinfectant can be applied in following forms
Chlorine Gas Greenish yellow. toxic, heavier than air, dry
Gas non - corrosive, soluble
Chlorine Lime
(Bleaching Powder). Easily available source of chlonne, cheap, easy
to apply Chlorine content is 30 %
High - test hypochlorite. 60- 70 % available chlorine granular or tablet form
Sodium hypochlorite- Available in sodium forms 12 -1 5 percent available chlonne
Chlorine Dioxide Strong Oxidizing bleaching agent
Chlorine Tablet
Chlorine can be applied to water by three methods
By the addition of weak solution of calcium or sodium hypochlonte or commercial
bleaching powder
By the addition of weak solution of chlorine prepared by electrolyzing a solution of
brine
By the addition of chlonne, either in gaseous form or in a form of solution made by
dissolving gaseous chlorine in a small auxiliary flow of water, the chlonne gas being
obtained from pressurized chlorine cylinders
Advantages, disadvantages and applicability of above three methods are given below

2.11.Gabian Bandhara
*  The structure made from the UCR boulder and wire mesh, across the nala bed.
*  Suitable, simple and less expensive for the sites where, it is not possible to provide
soil bunds due to non availability of proper location for the weir and cement bunds
due to pucca foundation problem
*  Recharge to nearby well through percolation of stored water in the nala bed
Essential factors -
*  Average 10-15 mt Nala bed width

done voluntarily then wire mesh expenditure per sq m is Rs 20 The wire mesh is
supplied free of cost if the bandhara is constructed through 'Vanrai Institute' 45
sq m wire mesh is required for above mentioned bandhara The cost of wire
mesh including fastening charges say Rs. 100, comes to Rs 1000 (i e 45 sq m.x
Rs 20 per sq m + I 00) As per revised temporary norms the expenditure per cubic
mt Comes to Rs 21 1 to 217
2.12. Vanrai Bandhara.
After September the water flow is retarded, therefore temporary Vanrai Bandharas
61



can be constructed by using empty cement bags and arresting flow water from the
nala, stream etc By erecting such structures and retarding the flow rate it is possible
to percolate more water in the ground and increase the water level in the irrigation
wells and drinking water wells, If the farmers, villagers, cultivators, and student
participate voluntarily in this work, the drinking water problem can be solved within
minimum time and expenditure
On an average Rs 1 000 expenditure for construction of bandhara of 1000 cement bags
(empty) is incurred if the villagers contribute their labor voluntarily. On both the sides
of bandhara, 10-15 hectares land is irrigated from the dug wells or directly from the
water in the nala Suitable crops such as sunflower, Jowar, wheat, vegetables etc can
be taken up Also due to water storage, water levels in the nearby wells increase by
about 1 5 to 2 mt Which can be sufficient to solve the drinking water problem The
above facts have been disclosed during the survey conducted by the 'Vanrai Institute'
Work procedure for Vanrai Bandhara
Selection of site - Nala slope between two bandharas should be up to
3% The height of both the nala banks should be I to 1.5 mt
2.    Construction material -- Empty cement bags, sand or sand mixed soil,
plastic thread for stitching and stitching poker
Construction method.
After selecting the site for the bandhara by considering nala slope and the watershed
generally excavation for foundation of 1 5 to 2 Mt Wide and 0 30 mt deep is done on
the entire width of nala, then empty cement bags should be filled with sand or sand
mixed soil and mouth of the bag should be stitched by the plastic thread All such
stitched bags should be placed on after another across the entire width of nala and first
layer should be completed Second layer of bags should be arranged in such a way that
the bag in the second layer comes on the joint of two bags in the first layer One layer
of soil should be placed after completion of 2-3 layers of the bags, on the entire
length of bags  Water is arrested due to soil layer on the top of bags  Water is
arrested due to soil layer on the top of bags and soil between the Joints This makes
the structure strong and sturdy
Generally, the expenditure is Rs. 1000, for the bandhara having 1 mt height & 1000
empty cement bags (Rs 2500 for 20 mt Length) This expenditure is only on account
of 1000 empty cement bags. This cost of empty cement bags, considering the
increasing work volume, may increase in the future. Such Vanrai Bandharas are
mainly constructed in the water scarcity affected areas, as a temporary measures
2.13 Underground Bandhara
Essential factors --
o Nala having more than I mt sand layer construction.
O Excavation of sand upto hard rock of nala bed.
O Soil filling at the bottom in the excavated portion, wetting the soil, consolidation
by pressing and ramnming the soil to obtain desired density.
O Filling the soil up to the height of the nala bed
Benefits
o Recharge of water in the surrounding areas of Nala This gives permanent benefit
to the nearby wells, Water being in the sand layers and soft rocks below the
ground evaporation does not take place and entire water is completely available
for use
62



2.14.Farm Ponds.
Essential Factors -
* The areas receiving rainfall generally 700mm or more (District of Bhandara
Gadchiroli & Chandrapur)
* Land slope upto 3%
* Average size - 20m x 20 m x 3m The farmer has to bear addition expenditure on
account of bigger size
* Required land has to be donated by the farmer willingly and free of cost
* Maintenance is entrusted to the farmer
* Can not be implemented in irrigation projects areas
* If the project is of individual one, 20% amount of the project has to be borne by
the farmer
*   If the farmer does the labour work voluntanly amounting to 20% of the project
cost remaining work is done through the Goverfimefnt - -  - -
Essential things to be complied before starting the work and during execution
I    The soil of the recharge trench where the trench is to be constructed should be
spread over on the both side of the Nala bank If the land is private then
necessary consent should be obtained from the land owner for spreading the
soil
in   While the work is in progress, it necessary to have formation wise height
sketch on a separate paper
iII   If the rock is struck at the bottom, then the depth of the trench should not be
blasted in any case for further deepening.
IV.  The length of the trench is more along the flow direction while excavating the
soil from the trench, the hard rock may stnke at different depth and it should
be left as it is and in no case blasting should be carried out
3. Unconventional measure for strengthening of drinking water sources
3.1.Utility of unconventional measures.
Though the possibility of implementing the unconventional measures for developing
irrigation capacity on large scale is less, but it has been observed that these measures
are very much useful for strengthening of dnnking water sources
Utility of unconventional measures - points to make it more clear
I      unconventional measures are very efficient, useful and effective for the
limited area.
2.     Unconventional project is permanent measure (except artificial recharge
through borewell project)
3      Due to excessive withdrawal of the groundwater, the groundwater level is
depleted in some areas The groundwater level in such areas can be raised
to some extent by additional recharge through the unconventional
recharge projects so as to help in maintaining Geohydrological balance
4      Water loss due to evaporation is avoided, as the recharged water is stored
underground
5.     As compared to surface water storage, the groundwater is safe from
vanous types of contaminations
Measures for groundwater conservation and development under the integrated
watershed area development program, and for strengthening of dnnking water sources
under scarcity and tanker free program.
*   Implementing agency - Groundwater Survey & Development Agency
3.2. Fracture Seal Cementation ( cut off wall )
*  Drilling of shallow depth (10-I5Mt) bores having 1-2 mt Spacing in two rows
across the nala bed covering entire width
* Cement slurry is injected into the drilled bores with the help of grouting pump
*  Cement slurry under pressure, enters Into the water beanng fractures, joints etc
63



and seal them
Benefit
Water bearing fractures generally available in the depth range of 6 to 15 mt And these
are responsible for sub-surface run-off and due to this the well does not store sufficient
water By cement grouting these fractures are sealed thereby arresting sub-surface run-
off by of cut-off wall Due to this well storage is improved and it can supply for more
period
3.3.Jacket well
This technique is to artificially create the fractures, joints etc by carrying out
blasting- Operations in the drilled bores The new fractures are created in the vicinity
of the source well and also existing fractures are interconnected Due to this water
storage and supply capacity of the well is improved
Construction and work procedure-
-o Dniling of shallow depth bores around the source well in circular or semi circular
patter depending upon geological conditions so as to form ajacket around the well
o Depth of bores is slightly less than the depth of well
o The bores are charged with explosives and blasted
o Due to blasting, artificial fractures are created and connected to the well
o The groundwater available around the well is percolated into the well and supply
capacity of the well is increased
3.4.Bore Blast Technique (BBT)
The purpose of this technique is to artificially create fractures and improve storage
capacity of the source well  This method is suitable for the areas where there is
assured and heavy rainfall but the sources become dry because of the non porous or
less porous formation.
Construction and wok procedure.
O  The bores are drilled to a required depth in the upper side of the source area and
blasted by charging them with dynamites.
o Groundwater storage during the monsoon is created in the artificially created
fractures and joints.
o This storage is made available to the source well or borewell on the down side
thereby strengthening the source
o  This measure is useful and beneficial for small harmlets i.e wadilvasti/padaitanda
etc having population less than 150 and having acute drnking water scarcity of
drinking water
3.5. Stream Blasting
This technique is useful for channeling the sub surface water flow artificial below the
nala bed, and connecting it to the source well situated on the nala bank
Construction & work procedure
o Required number of bores depending upon geological formation are drilled in the
nala bed.
o Blasting of these bores is carried out by charging them with dynamites
o  Artificial fractures and joints are created and also existing fractures & joints are
extended and interconnected.
o The groundwater flow below the nala bed is connected to the source well thereby
mcreasing the groundwater availability in the well
4.Artificial recharge to groundwater
4.1.Bore well flooding
Technique
12 to 15 % recharge is done to the shallow depth water bearing formations by
implementing the conventional measures such as percolation tanks. Cement plugs or
underground ground bandhara. Out of this very less storage percolates to the deeper
64



aquifer Instead of conventional measures if bore well flooding technique is adopted,
then 100 % ground water can be percolated in deeper aquifers
Benefits
I   During the period f monsoon if the water from the river, nala or the water
from the shallow depth wells is injected with the help of pump or siphon into
the bore well, it goes to deeper zones and can be stored there in the porosity
created after withdrawal of water from the aquifer The water to be injected
has to silt free
ii   It is possible to store the additional water from the shallow aquifers which is
lost as rejected run off, for future use
III   Evaporation is avoided and hence 100% of water stored cold be used
Iv   No bactenological contamination
Essential Geological Conditions for recharge
a  Borewell proposed to be flooded should be high yielding and should
have deep static water table
b  Bore should be tapping fractured zones
c. If the bore well is dry due to over extraction, I t advantageous for
recharge
d. Specific yield of the geological formation should be reasonably high
to receive the recharge
6.     Hydrofracturing
In rural areas, bore well is the main source of drinking water supply However, at
many places the drinking water wells have gone dry or are poor yielding and could not
be fitted either with hand pump or a mechanical pumps If the fractures or the joints
tapped by the bore well could be increased or their density enhanced, the yield of bore
well substantially increases. The poor yielding wells can be rejuvenated by the
technique called Hydraulic Fracturing usually called Hydrofracturing Dunng
hydrofractunng new fractures are created artificially that increases secondary porosity
of the formation and resultant yield of the bore well Existing clogged or chocked
fractures or joints are cleaned and cleared and their permeability increases
Unconnected fractures get interconnected. By adopting this technique bore well yield
increases by 17 to 30 %
Method
Bore well is completely filled with water so as to remove any air in the well
Hydraulic packers are installed into bore well at specified depth to create confined
conditions. The packers assembly has to be always below the depth of the casing pipe
and in the hard rock Water under pressure from the water pump is injected into the
bore well. Due to this additional injected water, the water pressure in the bore well
rises till the new fractures are created to dissipate ate the pressure Once the fracture
is created or opened it is further propagated and gets connected to the net work of
water bearing fractures
The quality of water to be injected has to good and suitable for drinking. It should be
free from any contamination or pollution Hydrofracturing operations are carried out
in a bore well at different packer setting depth

ANNEXURE IX.l
Technical Options for Stillage and Garbage Management
Sullage
1.1    Introduction:
1.1 I  Sullage is all household wastewater except wastewater from toilets  It is
sometimes termed as Gr .-y water It is the wastewater from baths, sinks etc which
may be expected to contain considerably fewer pathogenic microorganisms than
sewage Also it contains salts, solids and organic as well as inorganic materials It
must be noted that out of the total water used by consumers almost 80 % of it comes
from the household as sullage. The volume of sullage produced depends on the type of
water supply
1. 1 2 Sullage needs to be disposed off hygienically as it is less hazardous than
sewage Interest and research in sullage handling has increased in both developed
as well as developing countries In developed countnes there is a growing trend
in use of sewerless chemical toilets and separate disposal of sullage as a way to
overcome with various environmental problems
1 1 3 In developing countries there is growing realisation of financial and other
difficulties associated with the provision of water based sewerage system There
is growing interest in day on site management system
1.2 Origin/ Source and Contribution of Each Source-.
1.2.1 .The Survey camed out in the villages and in Gadge Baba villages shows th
following observations
Origin                    Mean

4)     Toilet                      15
1.3    Management
Improper sullage management can be main reason for epidemic diseases such as
dengue, malana etc As far as aesthetics in concemed accumulation of sullage is
highly undesirable. In rural India the accumulation of sullage is a potential health
hazard  After realizing the importance of sullage management it is necessary to
identify and implement suitable sullage treatment units. Normally there are five kinds
of sullage disposal systems-
o  Casual disposal
o  Garden watering
o   On site disposal by soakl pit
o  Drainage in open drains
o   Drainage in covered drains or sewers
- Survey camed out dunng the present study
66



In rural areas mainly three mctihods of sullage management can be adopted
a) Domestic
b) Community sullage transport
c) Final treatment
In the domestic sullage management it wilt be the responsibiiity of the particular
family to manage their own sullage and ensure zero community sullage Domestically
generated sullage which cannot be managed domestically would form a community
sullage In the community sullage management systems it is the responsibility of the
local goverming unit to provide sullage management systems
The implementat]on of a particular system depends on
1) availabilhty of funds
2) geographic conditions
3) availability of land and other factors
1.4    Low Cost Management Systems
The low cost sullage management systems include
i) On site management
ii) Other management techniques
1.4.1  On Site Management
On site management is dependent on the quantity of sullage and nature of soil There
are three types of on site management systems
i)  Soak pit
ii) Leach pit
ii) Kitchen gardening
1.4.1.1 Soak Pit
In soak pit method a pit of suitable diym-.ensions is to be dug on ground. The dimensions
of the pit are Length I m, Width 1 rm and Depth 1 m
This pit is lined on all its four sides and at the base due to which an area of 5 sqm is
available. As a result of which water absorption are increases by 5 times The sullage
is not spilled on sullage but it gradually seeps in the soil. After digging the pit of
requested dimensions the pit is filled with stone aggregates of varying sizes With
large sized stones at bottom and smaller sizes at top. On these aggregates either a
plastic sheet or tree branches are laid out and on this layer a layer of sand is spread
out. At last on the sand layer a layer of fine earth is spread The earth layer is slightly
elevated as compared to surrounding ground level.  Al the base, intermediate and
peripheral region of the pit Earthen pots of 6 to 8 inch dia with 5 to 6 holes are placed.
It is necessary that the neck of pots should produced out of the earth layer. These pots
are filled with dried grass, which act as filter media  The outlet pipe carrying
household sullage is placed on these earthen pots so that the sullage will fall in central
region of the pots Due to the presence of dry grass all the suspended matter in the
sullage gets engulfed in it and the jittered sullage water moves down through the
crevices between aggregates and is absorbed by the surrounding earth
1 4 1 2 Soak Pit
The main aim of domestic on site sullage management is to produce zero community
sullage Failure in achieving this objective leads to adoption of other management
tools and community sullage management.
When the sullage produced is in excess of the sullage handling capacity of soak pit
then in such cases leach pits are adopted  About 1.5 m dia and I m depth pit is dug in
earth The boundaiy of pit is lined with brick network. The base of the pit is left
empty and not concerted The water is accumulated in the pit and it seeps into earth
67



through brick lining and the base of pit This pit is covered at top with stone slab or
R C C cover One side of the pit has a provision for filling of water sealed inlet The
advantage of the water sealed inlet is that sullage will not be exposed to atmosphere
and there will be no access to flies and mosquitoes
1.4.1.3 Kitchen Gardening
If the sullage produced is in excess of leachpit handling capacity and if suitable
quantity of land is not available then the only option left is using the sullage for
kitchen gardening Before applying the sullage to the garden it is passed through cold
water grease trap  The effluent is used for cultivating vegetables and fruits It is
important to note that the water is recycled and used by families for their economic
property
1.5 Other Management Tools/ Community Sullage Transport
-Transpfortation of sullage is an imported item in low cost sullage treatment The other
management tools include
a) Sullage transportation
b) Sullage treatment
c) Sullage recycling
1.5.1  Sullage Transport
In low cost sullage treatment method sullage can be transported by any of the
following three methods
i) open drains
ii) covered drains (as per requirement)
iii) low diameter taps
1.5.1.1 Open drains
It is important to note that all minute features must be considered in the design and the
construction of open drains While deciding the dimensions of the drain the following
data ir necessary:
i) Quantity of sullage
ii) Sullage carrying velocity
ii) Tums and curves to be given to the drain
iv) Gradient slope
By properly constructing the drams considenng all above points efficient
sullage transport can be achieved
Acute turns and curves must be avoided. However if it is necessary to provide tums
and curves then they must be> 900
Gradient is an important design parameter Certain amount of velocity must be
maintained in the drain during peak as well as lean period to avoid accumulation of
sludge in the drain  This minimum velocity to be maintained is known as self-
cleansing velocity
1.5.1.1.1 Design of open drains
Generally in rural areas, in Maharashtra, open drains are constructed to carry away the
community sullage. These drains are designed as storm water drains and are expected
to carry dry weather sullage The existing drain design in Maharashtra is a uniform
cross section (rectangular) This uniforn cross section is unable to generate flowing
velocity to dry season sullage It is therefore recommended that a variable cross
section design be adopted for construction of open drains The typical drawing is
shown below Such a variable design would ensure flow in dry weather conditions as
well as storn occurrences
Fig. 11 Cross section of an ideal open drain
68



1 5 1 2 Covered Drains
If it is necessary to cover the open drains to prevent fall of garbage in it then they must
be suitably covered  However in rural areas covered drains are not advisable for
following reasons
I)     high capital cost involved
ni)    high operation and maintenance costs
1.6 Final Treatment
Final treatment and ultimate management of treated sullage is an important issue
Simple affordable technologies for the final treatment of sullage are available and if
recycling of sullage is envisaged the whole process becomes a no profit no loss
proposition or in some cases a profitable alternative
Final treatment will include
1)        Waste stabilisation pond
2)         Aerated lagoons or oxidation ditch
3)         Reuse
Considering the present status in Malharashtra, Waste Stabilisation ponds are the most
ideal for Final treatment of rural sullage
Aerated Lagoons and Oxidation ditclh are options which have a high capital and
operational cost and hence not suitable for Gram Panchayats
1.7 Waste Stabilization Ponds
Waste stabilization ponds are large shallow basin enclosed by earthen embankments in
which raw sewage is treated by entirely natural process involving both algae and
bactena These processes are unaided by human intervention as a result of which the
rate of oxidation is low retention period is high about 35 days to 40 days.
The waste stabilisation ponds comprise of following three components
a)     Anaerobic pond
b)     Facultative pond
c)     Maturation pond
Suitability
1)     Suitable in areas where sufficient land is available
2) Used in areas with hot climate and where temperature which is most
favourable for their operation
Advantages
i) low construction costs
ii) minimum maintenance requirements
69



IIIJC) IlU:lvIt UVJII)PIVt  iCIIUVdl VI UdUctillt
1.7.1 Anaerobic Ponds
These ponds are designed to receive such a high organic loading that they are
completely devoid of dissolved oxygen They are most advantageously used to pretreat
strong wastes, which have a high solids content. These solids settle down at the
boniom  and are digested anaerobically  The partially clear supematant liquid is
discharged in the facultative pond or further treatment Important requirements for
successful operation of anaerobic ponds are
I)     Appropriate balance between acid forming and methanogenic bacteria
ii)    Temperature > 150 C is necessary
iii)   Pond pH > 6
If above requirements are met then sludge accumulation is minimal, desludging can be
done in 3 to 5 years
1.7.2  Facultative Ponds
The term facultative means a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic conditions  The
facultative pond consist of aerobic conditions in upper layers and anaerobic condition
in bottom layers These ponds are increasingly used for treatment of effluent from
septic tanks and anaerobic ponds
Oxygen required for upper layers of ponds comes from reassertion through surface
Most of the oxygen is supplied through the photosynthetic activity of the algae which
grow naturally in ponds containing enough nutrients and light energy Due to growth
of algae the pond acquires green colour The pond bacteria utilize algal oxygen to
oxidize the organic matter One major product of bacterial activity Is CO2 which is
utilized by algae in photosynthesis reaction. Thus a symbiotic relationship is observed
in this pond. The depth of this pond is about 3 to 4 ft.
1.7.3 Maturation Pond
They are used as second stage facultative ponds Their main function is the destruction
of pathogens by providing in hospitable environment To remo- BoD from 50 to 70
mg/ lit to < 25 mg/lit two ponds in series are required with a detention time of 7 days
Their depth is in range of I to 1.5 m as shallow ponds are more effective in destruction
of pathogens as compared to deeper ponds.
1.8    ReuseConsidering the fact of water scarcity in rural areas the" effluent coming
out of sullage treatment unit can be reused to achieve economy and prosperity. The
common areas where treated sullage effluent is used are
i) Pisciculture Ponds are created to store the treated sullage effluent where
breeding of fishes can be encouraged.
ii) Farming: Treated effluent can be used in watering farmlands
iii) Gardening Treated effluent can be used in gardening and tree plantation
activity Concept of nalla parks can be implemented
2. Garbage Management
Garbage includes all sorts of putrescible organic wastes obtained from kitchen, hotels,
restaurants etc all waste food articles, vegetable peelings, fruit peelings, etc are
included in this term. These wastes are organic in nature and are likely to decompose
quickly producing foul odours and health hazards They may also result in breeding of
flies, mosquitoes, insects, etc Hence garbage must be disposed quickly and properly
When it is scientifically processed and composted then it is possible to produce
valuable products such as fertilizers etc.
2.1    Classification
Depending on the garbage management techniques garbage can be classified as
I Biodegradable garbage
70



2 Non biodegradable garbage
3 Mud, sand, aggregate, etc
4   Hazardous wastes
2.2 Necessity of Garbage Managenient:
Capacity to manage garbage is not keeping pace with the growing rate of garbage
production As a result there is garbage accumulation From this garbage organic wet
biodegradable waste has considerable nuisance value It is a positive health hazard as
it can spread pathogens and it can provide suitable conditions for insect breeding
There is limited awareness about the necessity to manage garbage hygienically besides
recycling it as a source of wealth The garbage management issue consists of three
components
*      Domestic Sarbage level
*      Transportation-J the community garbage
*      Final treatment and management of community garbage
2.3   Garbage composition
The charactenstics of garbage are changing  very fast  Percentage of non-
biodegradable garbage is steadily increasing Plastic garbage has become a big
nuisance Hence while managing garbage due importance is given for the management
of non-biodegradable garbage If the garbage is separated at source or its production is
minimized then garbage management is very easy If each family manages the garbage
hygienically and systematically at domestic level then it will lead to production of zero
community garbage This will be an ideal situation To have zero community garbage
the separation methods, recycling of the non-biodegradable wastes and management of
the biodegradable wastes must be efficient However achieving zero community
garbage requires high motivation and behavioural change. If all the domestic garbage
is not managed at the domestic level due to various factors then the garbage overflow
will result in community garbage Such garbage is to be managed by the local self-
govt institutions In this system transportation and the final treatment of the garbage
are important aspects of garbage management systems The transport system must be
efficient and sustainable The final treatment of garbage is a neglected aspect In many
cases garbage is literally dumped just outside the habitation limits. This is hazardous
Vermi-composting is one of the cheapest options in the final treatment of garbage
However this process is found to be very cumbersome It is important to note that the
low cost garbage treatment technologies must reach at the grass root levels For this to
happen suitable technology transfer mechanism must be formulated
2.3.1 Bio-degradable wastes:
The major portion of the garbage is composed of biodegradable wastes Mostly it Is
found in wet condition. It mainly consists of
I     Kitchen wastes
2     Rotten vegetables
3     Meat, fish
4     Leaves.
5.    Tree branches etc
Through bacteria and fungi nature continuously breaks down and digests the organic
and biodegradable wastes With increase in human population and settlements the
quantity of biodegradable wastes is steadily increasing In India the climatic and
temperature conditions are favorable for natural and.biological decomposition of
wastes. However in the countries with severely cold climate the conditions commonly
used are incineration and chemical decomposition However adoption of above
techniques proves to be harmful as they pollute the environment. Hence biological
treatment is an eco-friendly method
2.3.2 On site management of Biodegradable wastes
2.3.2.1 Composting
71



IJomposting is a biological method ot decomposing the solid biodegradable wastes
Composting can be effected either under aerobic conditions or anaerobic conditions
The final end products are manure called compost or humus, which has a great
demand as fertilizer on four land
Basically composting is an aerobic process because it involves piling up of refuse and
its regular turming either manually or by mechanical devices so as to ensure sufficient
supply of air and oxygen during its decomposition by bacteria, fingi and other micro
organisms like actinomycetes  Initially the process starts with mesophilic bacteria
which oxidize organic mater to carbon-di-oxide and liberate heat. The temperature
rises to about 450 C At this point the thermophilic bacteria take over the
decomposition process During this phase the temperature to about 60° C After about
three weeks the compost is stabilised and this is shown by appreciate fall in the
temperature of the compost mass The final compost has an earthy smell and a dark
brown colour  The final compost has an earthN smell and a dark brown colour
Moisture content is an important parameter as it affects in maintaining aerobic
conditions To achieve an optimum rate of aerobic actually, usually moisture content
is kept at about 55%
In rural India composting can be carned out by any of the following three methods
i)     Bangalore method
1i)   Indore method
in)    Nadep method
2 3 2 2. Bangalore Method:
The Bangalore method is primarily anaerobic is nature It does to involve in any
tunming or handling of mass and hence it is cleaner than the Indore method This
method is widely used by Municipal corporations throughout the country The refuse
and other solid wastes are piled up in layers in an underground trench of about liOm x
1.5 m x 1.5 m This mass is covered at its top layer of earth of about 15 cm thickness
and is finally left over for decomposition
With in two to three days of burial intensive biological action starts taking place and
organic matter begins to be destroyed Due to evolution of heat till temperature of
decomposing mass nses to 750 C This heat produced prevents breeding of the flies
by destroying the larvae After about 4 to 5 months (depending on the season) the
refuse gets stabilized and changes to a brown coloured odourless powdery mass called
humus The humus is removed from trenches and sieved on 12.5 m sieve to remove
stones, glass particles, bnckbats etc and sold in the market as manure The empty
trenches can be again used for fresh batches of refThe initial carbon to nitrogen ratio
and moisture content of the compost heap are two important factors that control the
success of this method. The compost produced is free of pathogens and contains
1%nmtrogen, 11 % of phosphorous as P2 05 and 1 5 % of potassium of K20 on dry
basis, thus proving to be available nutnent for the soil.
2 3 2 3. Indore Method
The Indore method uses manual tuming of piled up mass for its decomposition under
aerobic conditions In this method the layers of vegetable wastes and other residue
and soil are altemately piled in depth of 7 5 cm to 10 cm to a total depth of about 1 5
m in a trench or above the ground to form a mound called as a window The mixture
is kept aerobic by turning regularly for 2 to 3 months at an interval of 5 to 7 days The
compost mass is then kept for another I to 1 I/2 months unturned after which compost
becomes ready for use. The entire process takes about 4 to 5 months. This method is
primarily aerobic in nature
2.3.2.4. NADEP Method
In this method a garbage bin is built on ground with the help of bricks  Certain
openings are left in the brick joints to maintain aerobic conditions in the bin Garbage,
72



dung and earth are tilled in this bin in layers TIhe manure obtained by this method is
of good quality However. this method involves high initial cost. which works against
this method
2.4    Biogas Technologi
Biogas plant works on the principle of anaerobic digestion  The biodegradable
organic matter is decomposed in oxygen less environment  The products of this,
reaction are the inflammable methane gas, carbon-di-oxide, hydrogen etc along with
the above gases manure is also obtained
The biogas plant can be advantageously set up if the quantity of biodegradable organic
matter produced is large Those materials which can be digested anaerobically are
separated from other materials The biogas obtained from the reactor is used for
cooking purpose while the manure obtained can be used on .agricultural farmiands
The commonly used materials are
(i) Rotten vegetables -
(ii) Kitchen wastes from households and hotels etc
Composting Vs Biogas
Composting Biogas (I)Gases produced in composting method are of negligible
quantity and they readily escape in atmosphere _Methane produced in biogas plant can
be used for cooking purposes (2) End product obtained is manure only End products
obtained are biogas and manure (3) Quality of manure obtained is slightly infenor _
Quality of manure is superior (4 ) Manure obtained is not entirely pathogen free
Hence handling of this manure may prove hazardous for human beings The manure
obtained from biogas plant is almost pathogen free (5) Nitrogen content of manure is
less Nitrogen of manure is twce of that obtained in composting method (6) manure
obtained from incomplete digestion may be source of breeding, Of fltes thus causing
nuisance No such fly breeding problem encountered (7) Chance of spread of foul
odour surrounding are is more Chance of spread of foul odour in Surrounding area is
less.
Naturally from the farmers point of view biogas plant will be convenient, economic
and healthy.
2 5    Vermiculture
With the help of earthwonms organic biodegradable wastes can be converted to
excellent quality manure. This fact has been proved through various experiments and
expenence Earthworms use the organic matter as their food. After carrying out
research on vanous strains of earthworm it has been found that a few types of
earthworm are more efficient in conversion of wastes in manure  These types of
earthworm are specially grown and left in garbage heap Earthworms eat the waste
and convert it to humus enriched manure. This manure, rich in nutnents, proves to be
highly useful in agncultural operations  As per vanous conditions appropriate
technique and appropnate class of earthworms must be selected. The commonly used
earthworms for vermicomposting are
(i) Acenia foetida
(n) Feretema elongata
(ii) Lubricus terestris
Out of the above types Acenia foetida and lubricus terestous are used to produce
manure from garbage while Feretema elongata is used to produce manure from animal
dung
2.6    On Site Management of Non Biodegradable Wastes
Glass, plastic, wood, rubber, various metals etc are included in this category Most of
73



these materials are separated from the waste, treated and reused. Those materials
which cannot be recycled or reused are disposal off either by incineration or chemical
action
In our country many people earn livelihood by recycling of wastes These people must
be encouraged by giving them proper support and benefits This technique helps in
saving a lot of national resources  Truly speaking separation of wastes in
biodegradable and non-biodegradable format must take place at source itself This
helps in saving lot of time and money as well as labour This also helps in minimizing
the accumulation of wastes in public places and maintaining cleanliness
2 6.1  Stone, Dust etc
These are natural constituents and there is no need for any action on them They are
mixed in the ground itself
2.6.2  Hazardous Wastes
The wastes from hospitals and other such institutions is classified as hazardous waste.
They are called as hazardous wastes because there is an increased chance of spread of
disease through them. These wastes are disposed off by sterilization and incineration
procedures
2.7    Community Garbage
If the domestic garbage management techniques are successfully implemented then
there will be zero community garbage produced However, there may anse certain
circumstances or situation where domestic garbage produced cannot be managed on
site  Such garbage is dumped at public places Hence it will be the responsibility of
local self-govemment institutions to manage this waste  These institutions must
highlight proper course of action and see to it is stnctly implemented Following are
some of the important parameters in community garbage management
2.7.lCollection of Garbage
In rural areas most of the families have tendency to throw away their garbage out of
their residential limits. However it will be convenient if all the garbage produced in
the village is allowed to be collected at one particular place such as dust bins. The
dustbins rrust be provided in sufficient numbers at appropnate places. In absence of
dustbins the people tend to throw their garbage in open drains. This cause obstruction
to sullage flow and affects sullage as well as garbage management adversely. Hence
sufficient number of dustbmns must be appropriately located in the villages and people
must be educated, trained and encouraged to use them
2.7.1 Garbage Transport
The garbage collected in the garbage bins must be transported to the point of final
treatment through efficient transportation system. The transportation system is the
responsibility of the local self-govemment body. This system depends on the size of
the colony, local geographical conditions, financial capabilities of the local self-
govemment body.
The commonly used transportation units are
I)     bucket
ii)    Hand carts
iii)   Bullock carts
Iv)    Self driven vehicles
While transporting the garbage it should be properly covered and care should be taken
that it is not spilled during its movement
2.7.3 Final Management
74



By using any one of the above mentioned methods the local self-govemment body can
manage the garbage efficiently Composting and vermi composting are the two
convenient methods of garbage management Previously the garbage was constituted
only of biodegradable organic matter As a result of this the manure produced found
enthusiastic support from the farmers However recently the composition of garbage is
changing If the garbage is subjected as it is, without any separation, to composting
then the manure produced will contain glass, metals, plastic etc This manure is not
used by the farmers However, if the garbage components are separated at source then
good quality manure can be produced
However, in absence of efficient separation system the garbage is treated through
vermi composting The manure produced is sieved on sieves and glass, plastic metals
etc are separated from manure These separated components now can be sold
2.7.4 Public Awareness
Public awareness is very important in garbage management Unless there is awareness
in the society about --
a) use of appropriate garbage management technology
b) separation of garbage at source
c) proper disposal of garbage in garbage bins
d) efficient garbage transport system
e) final treatment of garbage
The garbage will not be efficiently managed Keeping this point in mind each and
every villager must be aware and alert and see to it that the garbage produced in the
village is efficiently managed  To generate more and more public interest in this
management system vanous programs have to be implemented

The excreta is carried into subsurface leach pits through pipes or covered
drains and one pit is used at a time The liquid infiltrates into the soil through
the holes in the pit lining. The gases also disperse into the soil, and therefore
the provision of rent pipe for its outlet is not necessary When one pit is full,
the excreta is diverted to the second pit The filled pit can be conveniently
emptied after a rest period of one and a half years, dunng which pathogens are
inactivated and the organic matter decomposed Thus the two pits can be used
altematively and continuously.
In a single pit system desludging is required immediately after the pit is filled
up, and therefore, involves handling of fresh and undigested excreta which is
hazardous to health Single leach pits are appropnlate only if a mechanical
desludging vacuum tanker is readily available, or if the pit is abandoned when
ful
3.   Design leach Pits
The size of the leach pits is determined first on the basis of the volume
required for storage of solid matter, and then it is checked whether it provides
sufficient infiltrative surface area for infiltrating waste water to the
surroundings soil If it does not, the volume should be increased to provide
adequate infiltrative surface area A free space of at least 300mm must be
provided above the invert level of the inlet pipes or drains upto the bottom of
the pit cover
3.1 Sludge Storage Volume
The volume required is calculated on the basis of sludge accumulation rate,
the number of persons likely to use the latrine, and the design sludge storage
period
Storage             Sludge accumulation
Volume       =      rate X Number of users
needed              X Design storage period
76



3.1.1 Sludge Accumulation
A leach pit is classified as wet or dry depending on wliether the grounid water
table is above or below the bottom of the pit In dry pits the storage volume
needed is calculated only on basis of sludge accumulation rate But in wet pits
even though the sludge accumulation rate is lower, the pit volume has to be
increased to prevent flooding due to surcharge For designing pits, the volumc
needed per person per year is given below
Table- I
Pit design - Volume Per Capita Per Year in cubic meters
Material used           Dry pits      Wet Pits +
for anal cleansing                    (2 year desludging
Interval)
Water                 0.04*            0.078
Soft paper'           0.053            0.104
Other anal cleansing materials such as hard paper, leaves mudballs, com
cobs, etc. are unsuitable for use with PF latrines as they block the trap and the
interconnecting pipes or drains
3.1.2 Number Of Users
The number of persons likely to use the latnne varies from house to house,
but to standardize construction details, pits are designed for 5,1 0 and 1 5 users
If the users in the household are more than 15, it is better to provide two pairs
of pits of appropriate size.
3.1.3 Storage Period
The minimum design interval between successive manual desludging of pits
could be one and a half years which is the period required for inactivation of
the most persistent pathogen present in faecal matter (ascaris ova) To allow
for a reasonable degree of operational flexibility as well as to provide at least
2 year storage volume. However, if necessary, the pits can be designed for
longer periods
3.2 Infiltration Area
The area required for infiltration is calculated by taking into account the
expected total daily flow to the pit and the long term infiltration rate of the
soil where the pits are to be located

clog in the course of time
3.2.1  Long term Infiltration Rate
The infiltration rate for different types of soil is taken to calculate the
infiltrative surface area required as shown in Table 2.
Table - 2
Long Term Infiltration Rates for Different Soil Types*
Soil Type                    Litres per M2 per-

Porous silty loams, Porous   20
silty clay loams
Silty clay loams, clay       10
3.2.2 Flow to the Pit
Unless more specific data is available, flow to the pit is taken as 9.5 litres' per
day per person This includes unne, excreta and water used for anal cleansing
after defecation and flushing The total flow in the pit is calculated by
multiplying the expected number u. latnne users by 9.5 and adding 5 litres+
For the water used for washing and cleaning the latnne floor and squatting
pan
4. Suitability of Pits for Various Geographical Conditions
4.1 Pits in Water Logged, Flood Prone and High Sub-soil Water Areas
In high sub-soil, water logged or flood prone areas, the pits should be raised
above the ground level to a height such that the invert of the incoming
drains/pipes is just above the likely flood water or sub-soil water level
Rasing the pipes will necessitate raising the latrine floor also.
In pits located in water logged or flood prone areas, earth should be filled and
well compacted all around the pits in 100 mm width and up to the top
(Drawing on page 6). It is not necessary to raise the pits by more than 300mm
(free space as specified In page 4) above the plinth of the house because if
water rises above the plinth, the residents will anyway vacate the house.
In high sub-soil water areas, about 300mm filling all around the pits may be
done depending on site conditions
In these situations, the pits should be designed as wet pits taking into
consideration the infiltration rate of the type of soil.
78



4 2 Pits in Snow Region
Experience has shown that PE latrines with twin pits function satisfactonly in
areas subjected to snow fall in winter The pits can be designed on the same
considerations as those in the plains and should be constructed below the frost
iine
4.3 Pits In Rocky Strata
In rocky strata with soil layers in between, leach pits are designed on the same
principles as those for low sub-soil water level taking the long term
infiltration capacity of the soil as 20 litres per Sq m per day However, in
rock with fissures, chalk formations, old root channels, pollution can flow
over a very long    distance, hence these conditions demand  careful
investigation and adoption of pollution safeguards (see page 17)-
In impervious rocky strata, since there will be no infiltration of liquid, the pits
will function as holding tanks In such situations, a PF latrine with leachino
pits is not a suitable system.
4 4 Pits in Soils with Low Infiltration Capacity
Leaching capacity tends to be the limiting factor when the infiltrative capacity
of soil is low In these circumstances, there are two options, construct a larger
pit, or increase the cntical leachmg area The former option is costly, while
the latter can be accomplished by backfilling and compacting with brick
ballast, gravel, sand etc, in the required width all around the pit, since the
leaching area is the vertical surface of the excavation of the pit rather than the
external wall of the pit
Pits in Black Cotton Soil are designed on the basis of whether the pit is wet or
dry, taking the infiltration rate as 10 litres per sq. meter per day However, a
minimum 300mm* Vertical fill (envelope all around the pit) of sand, gravel or
ballast of small sizes should be provided all around the pit, 'outside the pit
lining, to separate the soil and the pit lining as well as to increase the
infiltrative surface area
4.5 Pits Where Space is a Constraint
Where circular pits of standard sizes cannot be constructed due to space
constraint, deeper pits with smaller diameter (not less than 750 mm), or
combined- oval, square or rectangular pits divided into two equal
compartments by a partition wall, may be provided. In case of
combined pits, the partition wall, as well as the adjoining side walls up
to 225mm width, should not have any holes. The partition wall should
be 225rnm deeper than the pit lining. Both faces of the partition wall
should be plastered in cement mortar 1:6
4.6 Size of the Leach Pits
The sizes of pits have been worked out for 5, 10 and 15 users (See page 4
under "No of users") assuming
a    2 year desludging interval
b    Volume needed for dry pits 0 04m3 lcap/yr and for wet pits 0.078m3
/cap/yr
c    Hydraulic loading 9 5 I/cap/day plus 5 litres for washing latrine floor
79



and
d    Long term infiltration rate of the soil 10,20,30 and 50 1 /m2lday
The depths given in the tables are effective depths measured from the invert
of pipes or drains to the bottom of the pit The total depth of the pit would be
300mm more-than the depths specified in the tables, to allow for free space
4.7 Shape of Pits
Wherever possible circular pits should be constructed because of their
structural strength and relative larger surface area
4.8 Location and Orientation of Pits.
The Pit,, as far as possible, should be located within the premises of the
house. However, if this is not possible, they can be located under the street ot
foot path. In such cases, the pit cover should be designed to withstand the
expected load which it will be subjected to.
Ideally, the pit should be placed symmetrically at the back of the squatting
pan, as shown in the drawings on page 7 and 9. if site conditions do not
permit this lay out, the pits can be located in any angle as properly sloped
with a minimum gradient of 1:15 and have no sharp bends.
4.9 Spacing Between Two Pits
The space between the two pits' should be at least the effective depth' of the
pit If the spacing has to be reduced, an impervious barrier such as cut-off
screen or puddle caly wall should be provided between them.
5. Construction of Pour Flush latrines
5.1 Latrine Cubicle
The minimum interval size° of the latnne cubicle should be 750mm from
side to side and 900mm from front to back. In firm soil the depth of the
foundation should be as shown m drawings on page 25 and 27. In loose or
filled or balck cotton soil, the foundation should be designed as per site
conditions The plinth should be a minimum of 225 mm above the ground
level.
5.2 Squatting Pan and Trap
The pan could be of Ceramic, Glassfibre Reinforced Plastics (GRP), Cement
Concentrate (CC) Cement Mosaic, Poly Propylene (PP) Poly Vinyl Chloride
(PVC). Ceramic pans are the best but costliest. Mosaic or cement concentrate
pans have the advantage that they can be manufactured locally by trained
masons, but they are heavy and the surface tends to become rough afler long
use. Their acceptance is lower than other types
Traps for ceramic pans are made of the same material but for GRP pans,
High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) traps are used. For mosaic and cement
concentrate pans, traps are of cement concentrate
The nm of the squatting pan should be installed horizontally and the trap
connected to ensure a 20mm waterseal. While fixing the trap, keep the top of
80



the inlet and the top curvature of the trap honzontal, the squatting pan should
then be fixed over the trap in such a way that its rim is horizontal and flush
with the latrine floor This process will ensure 20mm waterseal in the trap
The distance between the pan and the back wall of the latrine superstructure
should be about 20mm
5.3 Footrests
These can be of ceramic, cement concentrate, cement mosaic or plastered
brick The top of the foot-rests should be bout 20 mm above the floor level
and inclined slightly away from the squatting pan in the front Alternatively
foot rests can be integral part of plastic or ceramic squatting pans
5.4 Pit Lining
-5.4.1 Brick lining
The pits should be lined to avoid collapsing Bncks jointed in 1 6 Cement
mortar are most commonly used for lining The thickness of the brick lining
could be 75mm, but due to poor acceptance and difficulty in coilstruction,
the lining is generally made 1I 5mm thick.
5.4.2 Size of holes in brick lining
The lining in the brickwork should be by honey-combing up to the
invert level of the incoming pipe or drain The size of the holes should
be about 50mm wide, and extend to the full height of the brick course
For simpler construction, holes should be provided in
alternate bnck
courses. If the soil is sandy or a sand envelope is provided or there are
chance of damage by field rats, the width of the opening should be
reduced to 12 to 15 mm Where the foundation of the building is close
to the pit, holes should not be made in the portion of lining facing the
foundation However, while designmg pits in such a situation, the
infiltrative area should be increased because less surface area would
be available for infiltration due to bnck work without holes The
lining above the invert of the pipes or drains, up to the bottom pit
cover, should be in solid bnck, i e. with no openings
5.4.3 Cement cvoncrete Ring Lining
The concrete rings used for lining should be 40mm thick about 300mmin
height and
constructed with 1 '3.6 cement concrete, reinforced with 2 rings of 6mm dia
mild steel bars The first nng is placed after casting 50 mm of height and the
second ring is placed at a height of 250mm. Each ring should have two rows
of 50mm circular holes staggered about 200mm apart The rings are not to be
jointed with mortar but are put
one over the other Below the pit cover two courses of brick work in cement
mortar 1 6 should be provided for supporting the pit cover The use of
concrete rings is advantageous in the construction of wet pits
5 .4.4 Burnt Clay Rings
Where available, burnt clay nngs of uniform deep cherry red or copper colour
with
holes can also be used for lining pits where they are not subjected to heavy
pressures
81



of loading
5.4.5StoneLining
Stones or latrine bricks could be used depending upon their availability and
cost Lining can be constructed in random rubble stone open jointed pitching
(no mortar) with one layer at the bottom and the other in the middle, in the
concrete mortar 1 6
5.5 Pit Bottom
Expect where precauttons are to be taken to prevent pollution of drinking
water
sources, the pit bottorm should be left in a natural condition
5.6 Distance of Pits from Foundation
Pits up to I 7m depth can be safely located at a distance of 500mm from the
existing
structure (distance between the foundation of the building to penphery of pit).
For 2m
deep pits, a safe distance is 900mm
5.7 Pit Cover
Usually Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) 1 2 4 slabs are used for covenng
the pits, but depending upon the availability and cost, flagstones can also be
cast in two pieces for convenience of handling The thickness. of a RCC pit
cover will depend upon the load expected to come on it For pits located
inside the premises of the household, where they are not subjected to heavy
loading, the thickness can be 50 mm but in such cases the covers should be
centrally cast with stone ballast to ensure quality control. Bnck ballast (of
overbumt or first class brick) can be used where stone ballast is not easily
available and is costly, but the thickness of the slab should be increased to
75mm.
5.8 Interconnection Between Pits and Squatting pan
The trap is connected to the pit through a 75mm brick channel of "U" cross
sectional
shape covered with bricks jointed with weak mortar or mud or cement mortar
1 12or
75mm dia A C. or PVC non pressure pipe In case pipes are used, a chamber
of
minimum size 250mm x 250mm (Drawing on page 16) should be provided at
the bifurcation point to facilitate cleaning and allowing flow to the pit In the
case of a drain, the 'y' portion of the dran serves the sarne purpose. The
channel or pipe should have a minimum gradient of 1 15 The pipe or drain
leading to the point not in use should be completely sealed with a temporary
plug, say of brick, stone or concrete
etc. joined with weak mortar.
5.9 Latrine Superstructuire
The superstructure should be designed to ensure privacy, convenience,
comfort and
easy maintenance. It should be well ventilated It can be any of the following
types in
the case of a bnck or concrete superstructure being unaffordable



I White or colour washed Jute, or thick plastic sheet enclosures on a
bamboo frame,
ll  Mud with a thatched or tiled roof,
Ill Date palm or bamboo matting with bamboo frame and a thatched or tiled
roof,
IV. In the hills, walls of slates or small stone pieces and a roof of slates
It is advisable to provide a superstructure along with the latrine suostructure
to
ensure its immediate use
6.Pollution Safeguards
Proper information and investigation of both geological/hydrological
conditions of sites where pits are to be located, and the location of drinking
water sources, size, all are pre-requisites in planning, designing and
construction of on-site low cost sanitation systems to ensure that pollution risk
to ground water and water distnbution mains is minimal Faulty construction
and wrong data/information regarding hydrogeological conditions may lead to
pollution of dnnking water sources
To ensure that the risk of polluting ground water and dnnking water sources is
minimal, the following safeguards should be taken while locating the pits
a) Drinking water should be obtained from another source or from the same
aquifer. but at a point beyond the reach of any faecal pollution from the
leach pits.
b) If the soil is fine (effective size 0 2mm or less), the pits can be located at a
minimum distance of 3m from the drinking water sources, provided the
maximum ground water level throughout the year is 2m or more below
the pit bottom (low water table) If the water table is higher, i e less than
2mr below the pit bottom, the safe distance should be increased to !Omi
c) If the soil is coarse (effective size more than 0.2mm), the same safe
distances as specified above can be maintained by providing a 500 mm
thick sand envelope, of fine sand of 0 2 mm effective size, all around the
pit, and sealing the bottom of the pit with an impervious material such as-
puddle clay, a plastic sheet, lean cement concrete; or cement stabihsed
soil.
d) If the pits are located under a footpath or a road, or if a water supply main
is within a distance of 3m from the pits, the invert level of the pipes or
drains connecting the leach pits should be kept below the level of the
water main, or I m below the ground level If this is not possible due to
site considerations, the Joints of the water main should be encased in
concrete
7. Operation and maintenance of TPPF Latrine
Operation and maintenance of TPPF latrine is very simple but it is
necessary
to educate the users regarding its proper use and maintenance.
7.1 Diversion of Flow From One Pit to Another
83



Only one of the two pits is to be used at a time It is very important to
cnmpletely seal the entry to the pit, which is not use This is done by
blocking one of the branches of the drain or in the case of a pipe, by
blocking the mouth of one pipe at thejunction chamber (see page 13)
When water does not flow out of the pan, either there is chokage or
the point in use is full If by rodding, the chokage is not removed,
then the pit in use is full and the flow needs to be diverted to the
second pit For this, remove the cover of the drain or junction
chamber and take out the blockage to allow the flow tot he pit not in
use and block the flow to the pit which is full Cover the drain or the
junction chamber properly so that foul smell is not emitted
7.2 Removal And Disposal of Pit Sludge
When. the filled pit is allowed to rest for a minimum of one and a half
years, the pit contents are completely digested and free of foul smell
- The pit can then be safely emptied manually, without being hazardous
to health, by the householder himself or through the local authority or
a
private agency However, in the case of combined pits and pits
located
in water logged and high sub-soil water areas, de-sludging of pits
should be done carefully because the sludge rmght not be completely
safe and dry to handle due to travel of pathogens from the pit in use to
the pit to be desludged After the pit is emptied, the pit cover should
be
placed in position and the joint made air tight. The humus collected
has
rich manure value and is a good soil conditioner The either in the
kitchen garden or the fields, but from wet pits it can be used only
when
it is sun dned.
7.3 Do's and Dont's
The following Do's and Dont's should be explained tot he users
Do's
o   Keep a bucket full of water outside the latrine.
o   Keep a 2 litre can in the latrine filled with water for flushing
o   Before use, pour a little quantity of water to wet the pan so that excreta
a    slide smoothly into the pit
o   Flush the excreta after each use
o   Pour a little quantity of water, say half litre ion the squatting pan after
urination.
o   The squatting pan should be cleaned daily with a soft broom or soft
brush with a long handle after sprinkling a small quantity of water and
detergent powder.
o   Use minimum quantity of water in washing the pan and latrine floor.
O   Wash hands, using soap or ash after defecation at the assigned place
84



*    If any construction defect is observed dunng the guarantee period,
report the matter tot he local authority or the construction agency
*    When the pit is in use is full, rodding should be done from the pan side
as discussed on page 19
*    If the trap gets choked, rodding should be done from the pan side as
well as from the rear side by means of a split bamboo stick, after
removing the cover of the drain or junction chamber
*    Care should be taken when desludging the pits located in water logged
or high sub-soil water areas and in the case of combined pits, as the
humus may not be safe for handling
Don't's
*    Do not use both the pits at same time.
*    Do not use more than 2hitres of water for each flushing (if the waste is
not flushed with 2 litres, pour more water at the specific spots for
flushing the waste )
*    Do not use caustic soda or acid for cleaning the pan
*    Do not throw sweepings, vegetable or fruit peelings, rags, cotton waste,
and cleaning materials like com cobs, mud balls, stone pieces, leaves
etc. in the pan or the pits
*   Do not allow rain water, kitchen or bath waste water to enter the leach
pits

*   Do not throw lighted cigarette butts in the pan
*   Do not desludging the pit before one and a half years of its being out of
use
8. Supervisor check during construction

Review of Water Quality Problems and Mitigation Measures
In Yavatmal District in Maharashtra
BN Arun Kumar Mudgal,
Consultant (Water and Environmental Sanitation)
Background
At the req.'est of the Water Supply and Sanitation Department (WSSD),
Government of Maharashtra (GOM), a review team comprising Arun Kumar
Mudgal, Consultant and J V R Murthy, Sector Reforms Coordinator, Water
and Sanitation Progarm (WSP) visited Yavatmal district and Mumbai,-0-14
February 2003 for a "Review of Water Quality Problems and Mitigation
Measures in Yavatmal District in Maharashtra"
Objectives
The objectives of the review were
I      To review the existing water quality situation and mitigation
strategy adopted by Zila Parishad to address water quality
problems.
ni     To make recommendations for improvements
Review Methodology
The review methodology includes the following
I      Discussions with the CEO and other -relevant officials of Water
Supply Department (WSD), Zila Panshad, District Helath
Department, Ground Water Survey and Development Agency
(GSDA), Block and gram panchayats and Primary Health Centres
(PHCs) and interaction with communities and the private sector.
ni     Analysis of water quality and health data and debrnefing on the
review team's observations and recommendations.
The list of persons met is in given in Amnex 1.
About the District
Yavatmal district covers an area of 13,582 Km2 and ranks 6h in area among
the distncts in Maharashtra. As per the 1991 census, the total population is
2.077 million (24.60 mnllion as per 2001 census) and rural areas accounting
for 1.741 million people The district headquarter is located at Yavatmal, a
town For administrative purposes, the distnct has been divided into 16 taluks
viz. Arni, Babhulgaon, Darwha, Digras, Ghatanzi, Kalamb, Mahagaon,
Maregaon, Ner, Pandharkavda, Pusad, Ralegaon, Umarkhed, Wani, Yavatmal
and Zarn Jamni. The number of inhabited villages is 1,751
Watersheds and rainfall The two prominent rivers passing through the
district are Wardha and Penganaga, which flow through the boundary districts
forming distnct boundaries.  The district has 64 watersheds, which are
classified as white (exploitation below 65%) indicating that the groundwater
90



has not been overexploited The annual rainfall in the district vanes from 890-
1,125 mm - more in the eastern part and less in the western part of the district
Drinking Water Sources There are nearly 9,500 public drinking water
sources, which can be broadly categorized as under
Handpumps on borewells     3,813
Dugwells                   4,739
Regional water supply        275
Piped water supply           673
While piped water supply covers one village, the regional water supply
schemes cover        more than one village The source for these schemes
can be a river or borewell or dugwell The rural population largely depends
on groundwater for drinking water
Water Quality Problems
GOM and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) sponsored a water
quality assessment of community sources jointly in 2,001 The National
Environmental Engineenng Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur - a premier
R&D institution, carried out the assessment  The report was published in
September 2001. This is the most comprehensive water quality report on
water quality assessment in Yavatmal distnct covering 9,389 dnnking water
sources. However, it may be noted that the report does not cover all dnnking
water sources, as samples from water sources identified earlier as high
fluoride sources by Zilla Panshad were not sent by the department of health to
NEERI Therefore, some of the villages like Berhanpur in Kalamb taluk and
Mangipur in Pandharkawada taluk do not find place in the NEERI report
Secondly, as the samples were collected dunng Febraury April months, some
samples from the dug wells have been not sent for testing as those sources
have dned up.
The chermcal water quality problems encountered in the distnct are fluonde,
nitrate, iron and total dissolved solids (TDS) Arsenic was not detected in any
water sample
Fluoride: Consuming fluoride-contaminated water even in low concentrations
can cause health problems in India, as the intake of water is high and
nutritional status, particularly among low-income group.women and children.
is poor. Keeping this in mind the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has
lowered the desirable fluoride level' to I milligram per litre as against the
WHO guideline value of 1 5 mg/L In the absence of altemate safe water
source the Indian Standard permits use of water sources with fluonde levels
not exceeding 1.5 milligram per litre As excess fluoride is injurious to health
it should not normally exceed one milligrarn per litre. A chemical toxin
fluoride causes health problems of three kinds Based on the extent of damage
to the tissues, fluorosis can be of three types, Dental, Skeletal and Non-
skeletal. Fluorosis can occur in infants, children and adults. Men and women,
irrespective of age, can become victims of the disease
The analysis of NEERI report indicates the following trend in fluonde
concentration in Yavatnal district
IS 10500-1991 - Dnnkng Waler Quality Specifications
91



Only 1922 (20 5%) sources are within the desirable limit of fluoride (< 1
mg/L)
6590 sources (70%) are between 1-1 5 mg/L fluoride concentration
877 (9 3%) sources have fluoride concentration > 1 5 mg/L
Out of 877 sources 406 sources have fluoride concentration > 2 but < 5 mg/L
Out of 877 sources 17 sources have fluoride concentration > 5 mg/L
The following table gives details of incidence high fluoride in drinking water,
dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis

* The incidence of dental and skeletal fluorosis is based on the annual school
children health survey conducted by health department in 2001 (This is based
on the survey of the villages dunng the penod of sample collection. The
health department has conducted a school health survey in December 2002
that covered 92% of the children and the results are yet to be analysed. )
It may be noted that 79% dental fluorosis cases and over 90% skeletal cases
have been reported from Ghatanji and Pandharkawada taluks. Surprisingly no
dental/skeletal cases have been reported in many blocks e g Arani,
Babhulgaon, Darwha, Digras, Ner and Pusad where high fluoride water
sources do exist The incidence of fluorosis is largely confined to two blocks
Overall the average incidence of dental fluorosis in the district is less than 0.5
per water source (fluoride concentration > 1 5 mg/L) Only 26 skeletal cases
have been reported which also need to be confirned clinically This raises a
number of questions, which need to be investigated further
a) Have people shifted to low fluoride sources in affected districts?
92



b) Is there a substantial reduction in fluoride concentration due to
groundwater recharge due to rainfall, which ens,ures low fluoride
water for 8-9 months in a year?
c) Is the reporting of dental and skeletal fluorosis accurate and
comprehensive?
d) Is low incidence of fluorosis related to the existing dietary habits?
A brief interaction with Primary Health Centre (PHC), Sawalh indicates that
people in two villages (Chimata, Zaparwadi) in Arni Taluk and listed in
NEERI report as "Fluoride Affected Villages without Alternate Sources" do
not use high fluoride sources -Instead, they use either river or private well
which are low in fluoride concentration
It is therefore recommended that a comprehensive children survey be
conducted in all villages where all sources have been affected by high fluoride
and alternate sources do not exist on govemment records The survey should
capture the following (]) incidence of fluorosis among children, (2) water
sources being used by users, (3) measurement of fluoride in all sources by
field test kits (government/private and used by community); and (4) dietary
habits
Iron It is the second most abundant metal found in the earth's crust, of which
it accounts for about 5% Taste is not usually noticeable at iron concentration
up to 0.3 mg/L Concentration > I mg/L imparts taste and colour to water that
may not be acceptable to users  Iron is an essential, element in human
nutrition Ingestion of high fluonde water does not have any significant
adverse health impact - excepting that it can cause gastrointeznnal irritation
Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed no health-
based guideline value for iron
As per IS- 10500-1991, the desirable and maximum permissible concentration
of iron in drinking water are 0 03 mg/L and I mg/L respectively Eight
hundred one (9% sources) water sources have iron concentration in excess of
the permissible limit of I 0 mg/L Ninety-five sources out of these 801 water
sources have iron concentration > 5 mg/L.
Iron does not have any senous health effects However, it reduces acceptance
of a water source is significantly if iron concentration is> 2 mg/L
Nitrate Nitrate is a naturally occumng ion that is part of the nitrogen cycle
The increasing use of artificial fertilizers, the disposal of waste (particularly
from animal farming), toilet leach pits, and change In land use contribute
increased nitrate level in groundwater. In shallow water tables, nitrates
concentration is expected to be higher
As per IS. 10500-1991, the desirable and maximum permissible concentration
of nitrate in dnnking water are 45 mg/L and 100 mg/L respectively
93



The toxicity of nitrate to human is thought to be solely the consequence of its
reduction to nitrite The major biological effect2 of nitrite in humans is its
involvement in the oxidation of nornal heamoglobin to methaemoglobin,
which is unable to transport oxygen to tissues. The reduced oxygen transport
becomes clinically manifest when methaemoglobin concentration exceeds
10% of that of haemoglobin The normal methaeglobin level human being <
2%, and in infants under 3 months of age less than 3% 7he haemoglobin in
infan children is more suisceptlible to methaemoglobin This clilncal svymptom
is known as blhe baby syndrome. Other groups especially susceptible to
methaemoglobInaemia include pregnant women and people deficlent in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or methaemoglobin reduciance.
As per NEER] report one thousand seven hundred and nine (20% sources)
water sources have nitrate concentration in excess of the permissible limit of
1 00 mg/L
Total Dissolved Solids The total dissolved solids (TDS) is the term used to
descrbe the inorganic salts and small amounts of organic matter present in
solution in water There are no serious health impact due to high TDS and
therefore WHO has not issued health based guideline values for TDS
However, user acceptance is significantly lower when TDS > 2000 mg/L As
per IS 10500-1991, the desirable and maximum permlissible concentration of
TDS in drnking water are 500 mg/L and 2000 mg/L respectively
As per NEERI report ninety-five (1% of sources) water sources have TDS
concentration in excess of the maximum permissible limit of 2000 mg/L This
is not seen as major water quality problem
Bacteriological Pollution. This parameter was not covered under in the
NEERI report However, the heath department reports suggest that
Bacteriological quality of water is the NUMBER ONE WATER QUALITY
problem in Yavatmal district The following health related data confirns the
above
Table 2 - Water borne related case reported and registered in government
hospitals and PHCs dunng the year 2001
Gastro attacks       -       1430 Nos resulting in seven deaths
Cholera       -         28 Nos
Dirrhoea             -      30,508 Nos
Hepatitis            -        109 Nos
Typhoid              -        120 Nos.
Many cases are not reported to government hospitals as pnvate medical
practitioners treat people suffering from above mentioned diseases
Water Quality Monitoring
The district laboratory has limited capacity to carry out both chemical and
bactenological test. The constraints include human, financial and logistical
2 WHO Guidelines for dnnhing water quality, volume 2, health cntena and other
supporting informaton
94



resources The distnct public health laboratory can test 1 000 water samples
for chemical analysis (10 parameters) and another 1500 samples for
bactenological pollution
Considering that there are nearly 10,000 public water sources and these water
sources have to be monitored periodically, it is necessary to decentralize
water quality monitoring of certain parameter using reliable field test kits The
parameters could include fecal pollution, fluoride and nitrate The H2S based
bacteriological test kit developed by Defence Research Laboratory and
fluoride and nitrate test kits developed by National Chemical Laboratory
(NCL), Pune can be used by PHCs The recommended periodicity of water
quality tests is as under
Bactenological Test         Quarterly and monthly from May-August
Fluoride                    Once in twelve months
Nitrate                     Once5 Mi twelve months
The results of field test kits should be conveyed by PHCs to the district public
health laboratory Ten percent of the water sources must be randomly tested
by laboratory methods
There is also need to computerise water quality data so as to facilitate regular
update, quick analysis and generation of reports The water quality data can
be maintained by the distnct public health laboratory and updated at every six
months To introduce the second tier, it will be necessary to train PHC staff
in the use of field test kits, reporting and remedial measure
It is recommended that a two -day Training Workshop is organized to tran 20
master trainers from Yavatmal, Nanded and Chandrapur distncts, who could
then train PHC staff in the use of field test kits, reporting mechanism and
preventive/remedial measures. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive
water quality monitoring strategy to clearly define the role of different
organizations, frequency of tests, parameters to be tested, laboratory and field
test kit methods to be used and reporting requirements Mr 0 G B Nambiar,
Deputy Director, NCL, Pune will be an ideal resource person to conduct such
a training programme
Capacity Building for Detection of Fluorosis
During discussions with the district health authorites, it was felt that there is a
need to build capacity in the detection of dental, skeletal and non-skeletal
fluorosis Therefore, it is recommended that A Two-day Training Workshop
be conducted to train 20 to 30 master trainers from Chandrapur, Nanded and
Yavatnal dstricts The target group could include dental surgeons, orthopedic
and general practitioners from government hospitals These master trainers
could then train district medical and paramedical staff in the detection of
dental, skeletal and non-skeletal fluorosis. Dr A K Susheela, will be an ideal
resource person for conducting such a workshop.

Mitigation Initiatives
The Zilla Panshad and other agencies have initiated a number of mitigation
measures which are summarized below
A  Marking of all high fluoride sources and informing people to take
drinking water from alternate sources
> Provision of alternate safe water source in villages where all sources
have fluonde concentration > 1 5 mg/L
L UNICEF in association with Zilla Panshad have constructed
household based rainwater harvesting tanks each of 1 0,000 L
capacity
>  An ion-exchange based treatment plant has been installed in Mangi
village in Pandharkawada taluk
Findings and Observatioins
The following are the findings and observations
o  Bactenological pollition is number one water quality problem
followed by fluonde  However, as per the department of health
statistics, the incidence of dental fluorosis among children is rather
low l e less than 0 5 per polluted water source (Fluonde > 1 5 mg/L)
This aspect needs further investigation
o  Nearly 80% water sources have fluonde concentration > desirable
concentration (1 mg/L).
O  Zilla Panshad has taken a number of steps to supply safe water to the
villages with no alternate safe source. These include provision of safe
source (dug wells, piped water supply schemes, water tankers, water
treatment unit) and informing people about high fluoride sources and
use of low fluonde sources for dnnking water
o  Dug wells < 15 M deep, generally have low fluonde. A six meter
diameter well costs nearly Rs. 250,000. Users prefer to use such
sources and such a source can provide low fluoride water for 10-11
months in a year However, dug wells are generally bacteriologically
polluted unless they are disinfected frequently using bleaching
powder Dug well water is also likely to have higher nitrate
concentration
o  GSDA can provide technical assistance In selecting suitable site for a
dug well by drilling a test borehole and checking fluonde
concentration to ensure that dug well water has low fluoride
concentration. It can also help WSD in designing effective water-
recharge structures.
o  The high fluoride water sources were not clearly marked to indicate
that the source is not fit for drinking water Only in one case, a
signboard was fixed near the source indicating level of fluoride
concentration in the source and a clear warning that it should not be
used for drawing dnnking water.
O  People in general were aware of polluted sources and were taking
water from low-fluoride sources when such sources were available
within the village. However, in Berhanpur village in Kalarnb taluk
people were using high-fluoride sources as no alternate source was
available Such villages should be provided alternate water source at
the earliest
o Considering that the annual rainfall in Yavatmal is above 900 mrn,
the rainwater harvesting at the household level is an excellent



technical option to obtain chemically and bacteriologically safe
water UNICEF has constructed a few 10,000 litre ferro-cement tanks
as demonstration units The cost of construction is Rs 1 60 per iter
As an alternative use of syntax type HDPE tanks can be considered
A 5,000 L tank can provide high quality drinking water to a family of
five members for at least 10 months, if used exclusively for drinking
and cooking purposes
* PHC staff and people were not aware that dietI rich in calcium,
vitamin C and anti-oxidants could help reduce the adverse health
impact of fluoride
An ion-exchange resin based fluoride removal handpump attached
demonstration unit has been installed in Mangipur village by M/S
Ion Exc.ar.ge (India) Ltd, but it is not in use for quite some time as
people draw their drinking water requirements from a dug well
provided by Zilla Panshad In addition, there are some concems that
need to be addressed before such treatment plants are_ used on a
large-scale These concerns to be addressed are
Every third day regeneration is too frequent and difficult to
practice Can the frequency of regeneration be reduced9
ni     How to ensure that correct quality of alum is used for
regeneration? Some grades of alum are highly toxIc
III    To make sure that residual aluminium level in treated water
after regeneration is well below the desirable limit of 0 2
mg/L.
iv     Each treatment unit should be provided with a field test kit to
check if fluonde concentration in treated water iS within the
permissible limit. This will also help in establishing an
appropnate regeneration cycle
v.     Ensure that the effluent from regeneration is disposed in safe
manner.
The manufacture imay be requested to furmish more details- on the
above and steps proposed to address the above concems.  An
independent evaluation of the unit by a reputed laboratory is
recommended
It is weHl known that community level treatment plants are not
sustainable in the long-tenm due to lack of requisite O&M support
Therefore, introduction of any community-based water treatnent
technology in rural areas should be seen as the last option
* District level public health laboratory has limited capacity to test
water samples and can not test all water sources once a month The
laboratory does not have any logistics support to carry out random
checks on water sources. The district laboratory has one Ion Meter
with ion selective electrode to test fluoride concentiation.  The
laboratory should enter into an annual maintenance contract with the
supplier of the equipment to ensure that it remains in good condition.
This instrument can also be used to check fluornde level in urine in
those clinical cases where fluorosis is suspected Higher fluoride level
indicates potential nsk of fluorosis in a person The test protocol will
remain same as adopted for testing a water sample.
* PHC have presence right up to the grassroots level with 15 rural
hospitals, 61 PHCs and 374 sub-centres. It can effectively test water
sources within their junsdiction for fluoride and bacteriological
pollution by using field test kits However, it will be necessary to
build capacity within PHCs for this addional activity

o   The Department of Health is well placed to launch the IEC campaign
to educate people about ill health effects of bacteriological and
fluoride pollution in drinking water, role of nutrition in reducing the
adverse impact of high fluoride drinking water, importance personal
hygiene and preventive measures (better nutrition, use of low fluoride
water sources for drinking water, safe handling of water to minimize
bactenological contamination during handling and chlonnation etc)
through medical and para-medical staff
o   NEERI report provides extensive and reliable water quality database
However, it is necessary to continuously monitor water sources for
select parameters and  update water quality database.   This
arrangement is not in place at present
Suggested Actions
Based on the above the following follow-up actions are suggested.
o  Fix a sign-board near all high fluoride (> 1 5 mg/L) sources clearly
indicating fluoride concentration and with a message that this water
source is not suitable for dnnking water
o  Test all private water sources and inform users about their suitability
for dnnking water supply.
O   Provide at least one safe-water supply option in all villages and
habitations currently without an altemate water source Dug well and
RWH tank are excellent options. Water treatment should be
considered only when other options are not techno-economically
feasible
o  A comprehensive children survey be conducted in all villages where
all sources have been affected by high fluoride and altemate sources
do not exist on government records. The survey should capture the
following  (1) incidence of fluorosis among children, (2) water
sources being used by users; (3) measurement of fluoride in all
sources (govemment/pnrvate and used by comununity), and (4)
- dietary habits Thils data will be useful in developing the fluonde
mitigation strategy and further course of action
o  Considering that nearly 80% groundwater sources have fluoride
concentration above desirable level I mg/L and many sources are
bactenologically polluted pollution, it is necessary that an intensive
IEC campaign is launched to educate people about ill health effects
of bactenological and fluoride pollution in drinking water, role of
nutrition in reducing the adverse health impact of high fluonde
dnnking water, importance personal hygiene and preventive
measures (better nutrition, use of low fluoride water sources for
drinking water, safe handlng of water to minimize bacteriological
contamination during handling and chlorination etc) through medical
and para-medical staff, teachers and community leaders For this
purpose it is to develop a comprehensive [EC strategy. Attractive
signboards may also be placed near hospitals, PHCs, schools and in
markets to inform people about the ill health effects of high fluoride
water and preventive measures
o  Develop a comprehensive WQM Strategy including a computerized
Management Information System with clear guidelines on reporting
requirements There can be two tiers for WQM as under.
i      The first-tier will be the laboratory based testing either at the
distnct laboratory or block level laboratory, and
ii.    The second-tier will PHC based for testing water sources
under its junsdiction for select parameters (Fluonde and
Fecal pollution) field test kit

c3  Conduct a Two-day Training    Workshop   to train trainers in
identification and management of fluorosis The target group will
include dental and orthopedic surgeons and general physicians These
trainers could act as resource persons for training medical, para-
medical staff and teachers
0  Conduct a One/two-day Workshop for traming trainers in the use of
water quality field test kits These trainers will act as a resource
persons for training PHC doctors and and para-roedical staff in the
use of field test kits and reporting requirements .
L  Conduct a district-specific nutrition study to develop IEC strategy for
promotion of recipies rich in calcium, vitamin C and aniti-oxidants
o  Conduct a study on select 50 high fluoride water sources to evaluate
quarterly variation in fluoride level due to recharge of groundwater
due to rainwater
State related:
also are in the geographical vicinity to each other The GOM has requested
for a comprehensive strategy development for these 4 districts A review visit
similar to the above one could be undertaken by this team and the findings
could be discussed in a workshop to arrive at a broad strategy for the 4
distncts specifically and the state as a There are about 14 districts in the state
that have high fluondes in the dnnking water samples Yavatmal, Chandrapur,
Nanded and Nagpur rate high amongst them aiid whole
