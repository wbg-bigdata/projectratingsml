Section I : Introduction
1.     Maharashtra has 7.3 million persons categorized as Scheduled Tribe (ST) which
constitute about 9.27 % of the total population of the State (Table-1). Tribal population
wise, Maharashtra ranks second in the country (next only to Madhya Pradesh) and
accounts for 11% of the total tribal population in the country. The tribal population of
Maharashtra belongs to 47 communities (Table-2) and has been categorized for
development purposes as: (i) tribal people living in Scheduled areas' and adjoining tribal
concentrated areas; (ii) small pockets of concentration outside the sub plan areas; (iii)
dispersed tribal groups, and (iv) primitive tribal groups. Development efforts have been
undertaken mainly through 15 Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) and 35
Modified Area Development Approach (MADA). Despite these efforts, tribals continue
to be beset with high incidence of poverty, illiteracy, poor health and minimal/
unhygienic sanitation facilities. Their political participation and relationship with
Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) are rather weak, further deepening their 'exclusion'. As
a consequence, special attention needs to be accorded to them vis-ai-vis non-tribals. Some
adjustments may have to be made in the design of the delivery systems so as to ensure
that project benefits reach them. Thus, in accordance with the Bank policy on indigenous
peoples outlined in its Operational Directive (OD) 4.202,  the proposed project has
developed a Tribal Development Plan (TDP) to ensure that they participate in the project
based on an informed decision making and that they derive full benefits from the project.3
2.     The project had enlisted the services of an external consulting agency4 to conduct
a comprehensive study and suggest recommendations for the formnulation of a draft tribal
development plan. This preparatory efforts involved several consultation workshops with
a variety of stakeholders at different levels - Hamlet, Village, Block, District and State. A
second round of stakeholder consultations were held by the Project Planning and
Management Unit (PPMU) separately as well as jointly with the Bank mission to seek a
feedback on the draft plan (details related to stakeholder consultations are presented in an
annexure 5). The tribal development plan had subsequently been finalized in discussions
with the Government of Maharashtra departments such as Tribal Development, Rural
Development, Irrigation, Water Supply and Sanitation and Forests. A summary of the
study and tribal development plan is presented in this note. The TDP follows the format
of the "Indigenous Peoples Development Plan" as outlined in OD 4.20. Section 1 serves
as an Introduction. A review of the Tribal Development cum Regulatory Framework is
presented in Section 2. Beneficiary Assessment including baseline socio-economic as
well as water supply and sanitation      information  are discussed in Section 3.
Subsequently, stakeholder analysis is discussed in the next section and significant issues
l Explained in a later section.
2 (OD) 4.20 stipulates that they: (i) benefit from development projects, and (ii) avoid or mrtigate potentially
adverse effects on them, if any caused by Bank-assisted activities. Special actions are required where Bank
investment affect people whose social and economic status restricts their capacity to assert thetr interests
and rights.
3 It may be noted that there will be no adverse effects, direct or indirect, on the tribals as a result of the
project's activities.

J1l   Tribal Development! Regulatory Framework
3.    Towards protecting the interest of tribals, many safeguards are provided under the
Indian constitution. This section reviews such safeguards and the associated laws and
regulations governing tribal development and water and sanitation activities in the state.
3.1   Scheduled Areas. Towards safeguarding the tribals' interests, the Indian
constitution recognizes two distinct tribal territories under its Article 2446. The first is the
Scheduled Area where the provision of the Fifth Schedule applies over large areas of
tribal middle India (of which Maharashtra is a part). The other is the Sixth Schedule,
which applies to the administration in the tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya,
Tripura and Nagaland in North Eastern India. Criteria followed for declaring an area as
Scheduled Area are: preponderance of tribal population; compactness and reasonable
size of the area; under-developed nature of thte area; and marked disparity in economic
standard of the people. These criteria are not spelt out in the Constitution but have
become well established. The constitution empowers the President to declare an area as
'scheduled' as well as to re-schedule and alter it. The Fifth Schedule while defining the
Scheduled Areas, elaborates the provisions with regard to their administration and control
thereof.
3.1.1 Scheduled Areas of Maharashtra extend over 46,531 sq km and cover 13 districts
and 48 Tehsils.  They comprise 16 towns and 5,809 villages. Their total population
amounts to 9.7 million, of which 37% are tribals. Boundaries of the Scheduled Areas in
Maharashtra coincide with those of Tribal Sub Plan Areas.
3.2   Tribal Sub Plan Areas. The Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) was formulated to address
the problem of inadequate funds from the general Annual and Five year plans for the
development of Scheduled Areas and to make adequate financial provision for the tribal
population. TSP is thus an approach meant to ensure a separate financial provision for the
integrated development of tribals. It ensures allocation of funds to tribal areas from State
Plan as well as from Central Ministries, at least proportionate to the tribal population of
the State, and to the overall proportionate tribal population of the country from the budget
of Central Ministries and Financial Institutions. TSP's main objectives include: (i)
narrowing the gap between the level of development of TSP areas and other areas of the
State; (ii) improving the standard and quality of life of the tribal community; (iii) tackling
the important problems faced by the tribals; and (iv) eliminating the exploitation of the
tribals, speeding up the socio-economic development, building up an inner strength
among the tribals and improving their organizational capacity. Within a TSP area,
certain areas (mostly, Block) of tribal concentration are carved out as Integrated Tribal
Development Project (ITDP) areas, each of which is headed by a Project Officer (PO). In
Maharashtra, there are 24 such ITDPs approved by the Government of India (GOI). The
6 This reflects the uniqueness of the 'tnbal' factor within the national framework and the intentions of the
constitution makers to secure political rights for tribals.

State recognizes 11 of these as sensitive areas and has appointed officers from Indian
Administrative and Indian Forest Services as Project Officers (POs) and they have been
declared as Additional Collectors and Additional Chief Executive Officers of the
concerned Zilla Parishads (ZP). In accordance with the guidelines issued by the GOI,
the State of Maharashtra has adopted the following criteria to identify areas under TSP:
(a) All villages in the Scheduled Areas (as identified in 1950)
(b) All Tribal Development Blocks
(c) All Tehsils having 50% or more of tribal population
(d) Villages/areas which can be constituted as pockets outside the above mentioned
areas or which were contiguous to such areas and which together had a
predominantly tribal population and/ or the inclusion of which in the TSP areas
was administratively expedient.
3.3   Additional Tribal Sub Plan (ATSP). In addition to declaring Scheduled Areas
as per GOI stipulations, Government of Maharashtra (GOM) has brought under a special
focus (equivalent to TSP), a large number of villages in the districts of Raigad and
Bhandara, as well as some additional villages in Chandrapur, Yavatmal and Pune, though
these would not strictly qualify (according to the GOI stipulations). This additional
inclusion involves 773 villages, christened as Additional TSP (ATSP) villages, the total
population of which is 575,000 - with tribals amounting to 181,000 (31 %).
3.4   Modified Area Development Approach (MADA). To be covered under the
Modified Area Development Approach (MADA), groups of villages must have a total-
population of about 10,000 and more than half of it must be tribal population. Similarly,
so-called Mini-MADA Pockets include clusters of two or three villages with a total
population of 5,000 and a tribal population of more than 50%. In Maharashtra, 1,459
villages with a total population of 764,000 - of which 58% are tribals - are included under
MADA and Mini-MADA Pockets.
3.4.1 Though the GOI has declined to place these additional villages in the same
footing as the main TSP areas, the State government is extending all benefits available to
the tribals in TSP areas (as approved by GOI) to the tribals of ATSP, MADA and Mini-
MADA areas. A total of 2,232 villages with a total population of 1.34 million (a little
more than half are tribals) now constitute this category. Overall, in Maharashtra, now
49% of the tribals live in scheduled areas (main TSP area), 2.5% in ATSP areas, 6 % in
MADA and mini MADA pockets. The remaining 42.5% of the tribals live outside all
these areas. The break up is provided in Table- 3.

Decentralization and local governance
3.5    The 73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution provides, among other things, for
the Panchayats to be entrusted with powers in matters relating to "Minor Irrigation,
Water Management and Watershed Developments; Drinking Water; Waterways and
maintenance of community assets". The salient features of the Amendment includes: (i) a
3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having a population of over 2 million; (ii)
regular Panchayat elections every 5 years; and (iii) Reservation of seats for Scheduled
Tribes and Scheduled Castes in proportion of their population and reservation of at least 1/3
seats for women. The powers and responsibilities of the Panchayats include: (i) preparation
of plans for economic development and social justice; (ii) implementation of schemes for
economic development in relation to the 29 subjects given in the 11h Schedule of the
Constitution; and (iii) to levy, collect and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls and fees.
3.5.1  Extension of Panchayati Raj to Scheduled Areas. On -the basis of the
recommendations of a Committee (headed by Mr D S Bhuria, a Member of Parliament) set
up to explore possibilities of extension of provisions under Part IX of the Constitution
concerning Panchaysts to Scheduled Areas, the Panchayati Raj (Extension to Scheduled
Areas) Act, 1996 was enacted. The Act extends Panchayats to tribal/ scheduled areas of the
8 states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan. This Act allows greater recognition to the tribal
economic and socio-cultural systems, autonomy for local governance and control over
natural resources in Scheduled Areas of the country. It sees the community (individual
habitation) as the basic unit of self governance and places a great deal of responsibility
on the Gram Sabha which has been defined as a representation of a habitation or a
10

group of habitations, or a hamlet or a group of hamlets, comprising a community and
managing its affairs in accordance with traditions and customs.
3.5.2 Some of the Powers of the Gram Sabha as envisaged by the Act are (7):
*   Safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of the people.
*   Approval of the plans, programs and projects for social and economic development
before such plans and programs are taken up for implementation by the Village
Panchayat

Safeguards against Exploitation of Tribals
3.6    Tribal Lands. Land is the main source of livelihood for the tribals in the state as
nearly 90%  of tribals are engaged in agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural
laborers. However there has been a process of land alienation since the 19t century,
which still continues, despite regulations to prevent the process. Land alienation normally
takes place in the following ways (8)
(i)    Money lenders take possession of lands of those tribals who have incurred
into debt with them based on oral agreements. As written records are absent,
such lands are often never returned.
(ii)   Rich landlords take tribal lands on the promise of some sort of exchange,
which however never happens.

(iii)  Money lenders take tribal lands on long term lease with or without the
Collectors permission. They then register themselves as tenants and become
owners under the tenancy acts.
(iv)  Non-transferable "Inami" lands are made transferable on payment of money s
that they can be alienated to non-tribals.
(v)   Tribal lands are auctioned by Cooperatives Credit Societies on non-payment
of dues and purchased by non-tribals.
3.6.1  To safeguard tribals against illicit land alienation,  the Government of
Maharashtra has undertaken the following legislative measures:
3.6.1.1      Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and Tenancy Laws (Amendment)
Act, 1974. This Act has an objective of preventing transfer of land to non-ST persons by
amending the existing laws. The Act came into force July 1974 and puts restrictions on
future alienation of land belonging to tribals by way of sales with affect from July, 1974.
The tribals were prohibited from transferring their lands by way of gifts, exchange,
mortgage, lease or otherwise, without prior permission of the Collector, which in turn
requires the approval of the State government. The Collector has to satisfy
himself/herself that no other tribal from the same village or within a range of 5 kms is
willing to accept the tribal's land for the same value as offered by the non-tribal. If a
tribal land is taken by a non-tribal, it is within the Collector's powers to declare such
transfers as invalid, and such lands stand forfeited to the Government, free from all
encumbrances.
3.6.1.2      Maharashtra Restoration of Land to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1974.
This Act provides for restoration of such tribal lands involved in legal and valid transfers
including exchanges between 1957 and 1974. This Act has been made applicable to all
the cases involving tribals in the state, whether living in Scheduled Areas or outside.
However these provisions have excluded land put to non-agricultural use by the non-
tribal transferee before July 1974. The revenue department of the State government is
responsible for implementation of these legal provisions. The Tahsildars need to identify
land transfer cases, and any appeals against the Tehsildar's orders would have to be put to
Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal.
3.6.1.3 To assist tribal households to pay the compensation for the land restored to them,
a scheme of financial assistance is being implemented.
3.6.1.4 As a result of these Acts, of the 45,6354 cases registered for land restoration, land
was ordered to be restored in 20,824 cases and land has actually been restored in 19,947
cases.
3.6.1.5 Some studies on the problem of land alienation among tribals indicate that though
the impacts of these acts have been positive, they have not been as effective as envisaged.
Main reasons are the following (9):

* Tribals have not been very responsive towards personal cultivation of land restored to
them primarily because they do not have the economic ability to access agriculture
inputs for cultivation.
* The implementation proved to be filled with hurdles because of the number of writ
petitions filed by non-tribals in the case of eviction proceedings initiated against
them. The consequent stay orders prolonged proceedings.
* There exists a big gap between physical and actual possession of the land. In other
words the defacto and dejure status of the possession of land differed. The record of
right and mutation entries affected on restoration remain unaltered.
Economic exploitation
3.7.1 The Maharashtra Tribals Economic Condition (Improvement) Act, 1976 is a
measure aimed at bringing effective economic improvement to the tribals, by protecting
them from exploitation. To achieve this objective, the Act makes any lending made
before the commencement of the Act, invalid ab initio and prohibits marketing of certain
agricultural and minor forest produce in specified tribal areas by private agencies. The
Act provides for suitable alternative arrangements in the Tribal Areas for the marketing
of such produce.
3.7.2  Monopoly Procurement of Specified Items.    The State Government has
appointed the Maharashtra State Co-operative Tribal Development Corporation (TDC) as
Chief Agent and the Adivasi (Tribal) Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies (ACSs) as its
Sub-Agents, for the purpose of procurement of notified agricultural and minor forest
produce from the tribals. The Maharashtra State Co-operative Tribal Development
Corporation procures 21 agricultural and 31 minor forest products, at about 581 centers in
the tribals areas, on a monopoly basis.
3.7.3 Consumption Finance. With the prohibition of private money lending in tribal
areas, it is necessary to provide credit facilities to the tribals, for their development and
consumption needs. Credit requirements for developmental activities are provided under
various schemes including the Nucleus Budget.
3.7.4 Maharashtra Sales of Trees by occupants belonging to Scheduled Tribes
(Regulation) Act, 1969. This is one of the protective legislations administered by the
Revenue and Forest Department, meant to enable the tribals to earn remunerative prices
for their forest produce by eliminating unscrupulous middlemen/contractors.
3.8   Excise Policy. The State Government's Excise Policy in tribal areas has been
influenced by the following factors:-
(a) Most of the tribals are in the habit of drinking regularly. Drinking of alcohol
is a part of tribal culture.
(b) This fact gives a vast scope for the exploitation of tribals in tribal areas unless
the sale of liquor in the tribal areas is regulated and/or controlled.

The State Govemment, after taking these factors into consideration, has taken the
following decisions:
(a)   An order under Section 139 (I) (C) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949, has
been issued under No. BPA-0876/836/PRO-3, dated the 25th April 1980,
permitting the tribals in selected tribal areas to prepare their own traditional
drinks for personal and social purposes. However, brewing of liquor for
commercial purpose is strictly prohibited.
(b)   Country liquor retail shops in selected tribal areas have been closed with
effect from the 30th July 1979.
3.9   Laws and policies on water and sanitation. As the Tribal Development Plan is
being prepared within the context of a water and sanitation project, relevant key
regulations and policies of the Government of Maharashtra pertaining to the sector are
outlined in Annexure-2.
Other Important agencies at State Level
3.10  Tribal Research and Training Institute (TRIE). The Tribal Research and
Training Institute (TRI) was established in 1962 at Pune by the Govenmment of
Marharashtra with the main objectives of conducting research about the tribals in general
and specific areas of economic activities affecting tribal life in particular; carrying out of
evaluation and monitoring of developmental schemes; collecting and disseminating
information regarding tribal life; organizing training programmes for tribal persons; and
building up a museum and a library on tribals. Major activities of the institute include: (i)
encouraging tribal art and handicrafts by arranging handicraft exhibitions, perfonning
arts, competitions and exposure arrangements; (ii) conducting benchmark surveys; (iii)
undertaking evaluation studies; (iv) conducting quantitative and qualitative research
studies on various aspects of tribal life; (v) producing documentary films; and (vi)
managing a tribal cultural museum.
3.11  Maharashtra State Co-operative Tribal Development Corporation Ltd.,
(TDC). This has been established in 1972 with the idea of supplying essential consumer
goods to tribal areas. In its current fonn its responsibilities have been expanded to include
the provision of consumption finance to small cultivators, landless labor and village
artisans (belonging to Scheduled Tribes). It works as sole agent of the State Govemrnment
for procurement of specified items under the Maharashtra Tribal Economic Condition
(Improvement) Act, 1976.

III Beneficiary Assessment: (Baseline Data)
4.    Tribals in Maharashtra. Bhils, Gonds, Mahadeo Kolis, Malhar Kolis, Warlis,
Koknas, Katkaris, Thakars, Kolams, Andhs, Pardhans etc. are some of the major tribes of
Maharashtra. A large proportion of them live in isolated pockets and have restricted
themselves to certain specific geographical areas. The 47 scheduled tribal groups are
geographically found in three regions, namely: (i) Sahyadri Region - in the districts of
Thane, Raigad, Nasik and Pune; (ii) Satpuda Region - in the districts of Dhule, Jalgaon,
Aurangabad and Amravati; and (iii) Gondwan Region - in the districts of Chandrapur,
Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Yavatmal and Nagpur. Tribals are spread rather unevenly across
the districts. In relative terms, Dhule district shows the highest concentration, followed
by Gadchiroli, Nashik, and Thane. Of the 30 districts (recently increased to 33), 7 have a
tribal population of approximately 1% while as many as 13 (43 % of total districts) have
a tribal population exceeding 10% of the total tribal population (Table-1). 13 tribal
groups have a population exceeding 100,000 (Table-4). District-wise distribution of STs
by groups is presented in Table- 5.

5.      Tribals are distinctly  different from   non-tribals in terms of     isolated and
inaccessible habitation, high incidence of poverty, illiteracy, low health status. Isolated
habitation can be gauged by the fact that population density (Tribal Sub Plan Areas) is
less than 20 in some cases and in most cases, it ranges between 30-70 (Table-6) - as
compared to the state average of 256 persons per sq km. As many as 1,472 villages/
settlements (out of a total of 6,122), which account for 24% of the total settlements, are
identified by the Tribal Department as inaccessible (Annexure- 3).

The Infant mortality rate in tribal areas amounts to 110 as against 59 in non-tribal areas

6.     Nearly 85% of tribals in Maharashtra eke out their living from agriculture. While
47% are cultivators, the remaining 53 % are laborers. In the ITDP areas, proportion of
landless households range between 12 to 68, average being 43% (Table-10). Average
annual household income in these areas is about Rs 7,000 (poverty level income is
estimated at Rs 20,000) with food accounting for 77% of their expenditure (Table-1 1). As
a consequence, most tribal families are below poverty line, average being 91% (Table-
12). The extent of poverty can be gauged from comparisons with the non-tribal
population (Figures 3 and 4). 91% of tribal population is below poverty line as against
35% among non-tribals. Though no formal evaluation/studies are available, it is evident
that even after five decades of development efforts, STs continue to relatively constitute
the most backward and vulnerable sections of the population in the State with extremely
weak                                  economic                                  base.

7.    Primitive Tribal Groups (PTG) in Maharashtra. As mentioned earlier, there
are 3 Primitive Tribes (PTG10) in the state, namely Katkaris, Madia Gonds and Kolams,
whose human development index ranks much lower than the tribals, in general
(especially their sex ratio and literacy). The majority of them are landless, their seasonal
migration is high, unemployment among the youth is very high, and their access to basic
amenities (including transport and communication facilities) is poor.
8.    De-notified and Nomadic Tribes in Maharashtra.        The Nomadic and
Denotified tribes (NT and DNT respectively) constitute approximately 5 million people
in Maharashtra. In the State, there are 313 Nomadic Tribes and 198 Denotified Tribes.
While some of these tribes enjoy the ST status in the nearby States, they are not included
in the ST list in Maharashtra. Even within the state there are differences. While groups
like Kaikadi and Pardhi in Vidarbha region are recognized as STs (as this area was
previously part of Madhya Pradesh), they are not recognized as such in the rest of the
State. (11)
8.1   List of DNT: This list includes: Berad, Bestar Bhatma, Kaikadi, Kankarbhat,
Katabu, Lamani, Phase -Pardhi, Raj-Pardhi, Rajput- Bhatma, Ramoshi, Vadar, Waghari
and Chhapparbandh.
8.2   List of Nomadic Tribes: This list includes: Bawa, Beldar, Baradi,Bhute,
Chalwadi, Chitrkathi, Garudi, Ghisadi, Golla, Gondali, Gopal,Helwe, Joshi, Ksi-Kapadi,
'0 There are categorized as such accordmg to the following cnteria: pre-agricultural stage of development,
stagnant population and literacy level.

9.    Villages in and around Forests areas. There are 15,600 villages inside and in
the fringes of forest areas in Maharashtra (12). What were previously called "Forest
Villages" have all been declared revenue villages, and the Forest Department no longer
controls the development activities in the revenue areas inside forests. However any
activities that involve forest land outside the village boundary, even if it is for laying a
pipeline, would require clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest. This
requirement is necessary even for activities involving very small pieces of land and may
take many months. In some of the visited villages in Gadchiroli and Chadrapur districts,
inhabitants stated they have been asking to be resettled as the forest department does not
allow any development activities (likce road and electricity) to take place, and it creates
problems if they access forest products.
10.   Issues of access and rights become more serious in protected areas like parks and
sanctuaries. Here the Forest Department exercises stricter control on local communities
while the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 prohibits the majority of human activities. The
map in the next page shows the distribution of parks and sanctuaries in the state. It is
evident that most of these have a tribal population that is highly dependent on forest
resources.
11.   Access to Water and Sanitation. Disaggregated water supply and sanitation'
status data viz., separate for tribals and non-tribals, are not available for the state as a
whole. Yet, given that some districts are predominantly tribal, some conclusions can be
drawn.
11.1  Quantity of Water Supply. The state has 40, 794 villages and 45, 896 Wadis
(Hamlets) (1997 data) and a little over half of them (27,654 villages and 25,508 Wadis)
are identified to beset with 'water scarcity' problems (Table-13 ). As per the WS&SD, as
on April 2000, only 55% villages had supply exceeding 40 Ipcd with safe source, 33.75%
villages had safe source but inadequate water supply (10 to 40 lpcd), 8.25% villages with
no safe source and supply less than 10 lpcd and 3% villages not covered at all by a safe
source. The district-wise details of number of villages and the availability of safe water
supply are presented in Table- 14 . Tribal districts do have significant number of 'not
covered' villages either due to non availability of potable water locally or due to lack in
access.

11.2 Tribal areas. Out of 8,484 tribal villages in TSP, ATSP, MADA and Mini
MADA areas, only 2891 of them have been covered by rural water supply facilities. The
primary source of drinking water in most villages has been reported to be ground water,
while in some areas like Gadchiroli, surface water is widely used for domestic
consumption. Table-14 (Fig. 5) provides information of the tribal village that face water
shortage for up to 4 months.
11.3   Water Quality. Many districts with a high percentage of tribal population face
water quality problems. For example, Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Nagpur, and Gadchiroli
face fluoride problem, while Yavatmal, Nagpur and Chandrapur are affected by excess of
iron. Yavatmal, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar districts face the problem of brackishness.
Yavatmal, Nagpur, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts have major nitrate problems.
12.    Sanitation. No disaggregated data are available. About 1.8 million household
latrines are reported to have been constructed by the Government. Till 1996,
approximately 81,000 toilets were constructed while the remaining have been constructed
during the years 1996-2000. The state has about 11 million rural households and 0.6
million is reported to have household latrines. Primary surveys reveal that situation is
much worse in tribal

areas. Substantial gap exists between number of household latrines constructed and those
put into usage. Other environmental sanitation facilities such as drainage, waste water
disposal are normally absent in tribal villages.
13.   Tribals in the project districts. Maharashtra State has 33 districts. Of these, 8
districts are or will be covered under KFW and Sector Reform projects (SRP). The
proposed project will cover the remaining 25 districts in the state (Table-15). They
comprise a tribal population of 5.81 million which amounts to about 80 % of the state's
total tribal population.
Baseline Information - Primary Data based
14.   A summary of the baseline information generated through field surveys in 7
districts is provided below13:
Tribal Settlements
Tribal settlement patterns are quite unique and distinct from that of the non  tribal
settlements. They comprise one or more Main Village (s) and a number of hamlets spread
across a wide area. Distances from the main village are normally in the range of 2-3 Km
but sometimes they can be in range of 20 Km.
Even in tribal districts, the proportion of tribals in a Village Panchayat as a whole varies
from 7% to 100% of the total population. Generally, the main village is inhabited by a
relatively less number of tribals. Correspondingly, a relatively higher number of tribal
households is found in the surrounding hamlets.
Population in a settlement ranges between 20 and 2000. Households, accordingly, range
between 6 and 300.
Majority of the houses are kuchcha (mud walls and thatched roof). Similarly, internal
roads in most settlements are also kuchcha (not metalled). Very few houses have
electricity connections.
Being isolated and away from market centers, access to amenities such as school, college,
primary health center, hospital, post office and banks are very poor. A nearest bank /
hospital could be as far away as 30 Km.
Land use patterns comprise not only private and public (pastures) but also forest lands. In
villages surrounded by the forests, land tenure is not very clear and well defined. Land
holdings of some of the tribal families were regularized by the state during 1974-78.
Since then, no such regularization has been attempted. There are villages in which less
than 15% households have clear titles. For the others, the status of land holding is
generally classified as "encroached".
3 Details are available on request from the PPMU

Land holdings are small (less than 5 acres). Agriculture productivity is quite low (as
lands are non irrigated), with the result that a large majority of population (45-70%)
works as agriculture laborers. Very few people have regular jobs.
Social capital is quite low. Except for a few women self-help groups, normally, no
organizations exists.
Water Supply and Sanitation
Water requirement for drinking and cooking, as expressed by the tribals, ranges between
20 to 40 Ipcd. Access to water supply is quite low as sources are at a distance. Many of
these sources go dry in summer rendering, in particular, women to high difficulty. Water
collection is normally the responsibility of women and they make 4-5 trips in a day to
collect water. Difficulty in water fetching depends upon the distance to be traversed and
time taken for waiting at standposts. Traversing up to 3 Km (undulating terrain) during
summer is not uncommon. Erratic power supply and load shedding renders unreliable and
affects the daily routine of the community.
Hygiene status (personal, household and community) is quite poor. Small and kuchcha
houses with animals being an integral part of the household and no drainage/ solid waste
removal facilities are typical characteristics of tribal settlements.
Household latrines are normally not found, with the result that open defecation is quite
common. Women complain that open defecation results in: lack of privacy, traversing
long distance, restricted to certain period in a day, fear of insects and wild animals, and
slushy paths in monsoon season.
Preference ranking revealed that both men and women expressed water as a top priority.
While accessibility was an issue for women, men desired good quality potable water.
Similarly, men wanted public/ group latrines, women preferred individual latrines.
Ventilation in the kitchens is quite poor in most households. A window or a vent pipe to
make way for the smoke is missing, resulting in irritation in eyes and problems in lungs.
15.   A clear demand for drainage and environmental sanitation, though felt as a need
in many areas, was not articulated forcefully, with a few exceptions. In most cases,
drainage was viewed as something "that also could be done". These observations make a
case   for   extensive  educational  efforts  at   generating  a   demand.

Village Panchavats
Village Panchayat activities are generally concentrated only in the main village(s)
rendering the hamlets neglected.
Although all villages have representation in Village Panchayats, the representatives did
not frequently interact with their chairman, as the office is located in the main village.
Interactions between Village Panchayats and local communities are normally very poor.
Many hamlets expressed a sense of alienation from it.
Tribal Development Department and the Development Schemes:.
As per a study carried out by the Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune, 90% of the
respondents were aware of only 7-8 schemes out of the 326 different tribal development
schemes being planned and implemented by different line departments. Schemes, which
tribals were aware of, include the provision of: bullock carts, milch cows, goats& poultry,
pumpsets & diesel engines, housing and supply of tiles. Moreover, awareness levels vary
substantially across the tribal groups and blocks/ districts. Nevertheless, even Village
Panchayat members were aware of not more than 20 schemes.
The Gram Sevak constitutes the general channel for dissemination is information.
However, in many cases, it is observed that the Gram Sevak operates from Tehsil and
visits tribal settlements rarely. Neither are Gram Sabhas convened nor any alternative
fora exist to inform/ share/ discuss with the communities about development programs.
IV: Stakeholder Analysis
16.   A summary of the key stakeholders' analysis viz., issues, status and concerns as
expressed by key stakeholders is presented below:
16.1  Tribal Women. Women are the water managers in the households.
Women and girl children fetch water. They decide which sources to use, the quantity of
water to be brought home in different seasons as the frequency of activities such as
bathing and washing clothes and the amount of water to be used for different household
activities. However, some households reported that men too are involved in fetching
water, specially during summers when water was to be accessed from distant sources.
Tribal women generally spend between 1.5 to 3 hours in a day fetching water. While
better off women (particularly in the main village) have relatively easier access to water
(private connections and standposts), poorer hamlet-based families inevitably suffer as
they are more dependent on hand pumps and bore wells. Many such women have to
work as agricultural and non-agricultural labor and lose precious labor time fetching
water for the household. This problem becomes more acute during the water scarce
seasons (February through May) and during the agriculture seasons. There are a large
number of instances wherein women are unable to go to work due to unreliable and
inadequate water supply, specially during summers and hence they lose wages.
30

16.1.1   Expectations and Concerns. Women would ideally want private connections
to make their lives easier. However they were also aware of the fact that private
connections would require higher contributions that could be beyond their ability to pay.
In such a circumstance, the following emerged as key expectations:
Tribal Women's Expectations
*  Accessibility and availability of water source, either through public stand posts or
through hand pumps and borewells, all throughout the year. Accessibility in hilly
areas is expressed in terms of the distance to be covered and the ease of approach. In
plains, accepting that water levels drop during summer, accessibility meant at least
one perennial water source within a reasonable distance.
*  Reliability of water supply, i.e., not to be subject to factors such as electricity
availability, machine breakdowns and low water pressure. Delivery should be for a
stipulated time and for the duration that it is planned for.
*  Timings of the water supply should coincide with the work schedule of women.
Many women work as wage laborers, collect firewood, forest produces etc., and
hence prefer water supplies in the early hours of the morning and late in the evening
when they come back from work.
*  Service level. So long as the issues listed above are no problem, lower levels of
delivery (say, 20-30 lpcd) too are acceptable.
*  Household latrines-Privacy. Women do desire latrines as latrines would provide
them with the needed privacy. Very few, however, desired private household latrines
as affordability is an issue. The majority desires either group or public latrines. Space
constraint was mentioned by the communities in clustered settlements.
*  Health facilities. Accessible and affordable health facilities constitute a major
requirement.
Tribal Women's Concerns
*  Affordability. They may not have the ability to contribute towards capital cost
*  Participation/ Inclusion. Women do not normally get to know about planned
activities nor are they involved subsequently.
*  Technological options. Technological options should be such as to render operation
and maintenance easier and cheaper.
*  Livelihood Support, in particular, employment, and access to health and education
are a key concerns.
16.2  Tribal Men. The expectations of men were similar to women for better access to
water and sanitation. In some villages the men were more vocal about the need for proper
drains and wanted a better life with less drudgery for their women folk. The men in
hamlets emphasized the need for a separate water and sanitation committee for tribal
hamlets. As a matter of fact, they strongly desired  that all decisions related to
technological option, delivery design, household contributions, operation and
31



Second Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Tribal Development Plan
Page 32 of 60
maintenance, etc., be made and executed at hamlet level and not at Village panchayat
level.
Tribal Men's Concerns
o  Affordability. Inability to contribute towards capital cost. Demand flexible payment
mechanisms and bulk of it in labor, rather than cash.
O Participation. Most men and women will find it difficult to participate in village
meetings during day time as they have to go for wage labor. As a consequence,
critical decisions are likely to be made without their knowledge nor their
participation. Ensuring participation, in particular, by women and by the poor
assumes significance.
o  Village Panchayat vs Habitation. Village Panchayats normally do not involve other
residents, especially hamlets' residents, in decision making. Panchayats select costly
options in order for its members to benefit from a higher share. As a consequence, the
time needed to complete the schemes is higher and so are its costs. Moreover, O&M
would also be costly and difficult.
o  Transparency and Accountability. Village Panchayats' functioning is devoid of
transparency and accountability. Men are concerned that the status quo will be
maintained even in the case of this project.
o Capacity Building. Inadequate experience and technical expertise to operate and
maintain facilities at the village level. Adequate support to building capacity is
important.
16.3  Village Panchayat. The proposed project design has the Village Panchayat as the
focal point viz., as primary management unit. Village Panchayats naturally are very
enthusiastic about the project and in most places they had already decided on the design
(and costs thereof) of water supply facilities. These were those originally designed by the
Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) under their plan of activity. No consultations with
other residents were ever done nor any intentions shown or shared. Their expectations
include:
Gram Panchayats - Expectations
o The water and sanitation scheme construction should commence at once.
o The scheme they propose is accepted without changes.
o They remain the most powerful body in the village.
o  They get political mileage from a successful WSS scheme.
o Capital cost contribution and O&M are not major issues. People would
enthusiastically contribute 10% of the capital cost and 100% 0 & M cost of the
project. These costs are all manageable.
o In some places, Village Panchayat were expecting contributions from trusts and
industrial bodies, and were hoping that they would not require contributions from the
BPL and tribal families.
o  There is no requirement for a major change of its style of functioning.
32

Page 33 of 60
Gram Panchavats -- Concerns
*  Any delay in the project may get the local people angry and cynical, after all the
raised expectations.
*  Their village might not get selected for the project.
*  If people are given too many choices in terms of payments and choice of scheme, no
one will pay and the scheme will not take off.
*  All decisions should be centralized at the Village Panchayat level. Other bodies, like
the Village Water and Sanitation Committees, may become a parallel influential
body, eroding the status of the Village Panchayat.
*  Village Panchayat are not confident about the communities' technical capability to
operate and maintain the schemes.
Village Panchavats Vs Habitations
16.4  In case a Village Panchayat comprises more than a village/ hamlet, development
activities must be carried out equitably in all of them. However, this happens very rarely.
As a matter of fact, only very small percentages of people resulted to have been in any
way involved in or informed about Village Panchayat's activities. People viewed the
Village Panchayat as a distant entity, not really within their scope of influence or
involvement. Several factors are responsible for this. The Village Panchayat's
functioning is normally greatly influenced by a few rich and powerful people who drive
the agenda by keeping their interests in mind. With the result that the communities
neither participate nor are they consulted. There is therefore a certain sense of alienation
from and apathy towards the Village Panchayat across the different communities. Thus,
communities' expectations and concerns from/ about Village Panchayats appear
particularly relevant:
Communities' Expectations from Village Panchayat
*  The project should trigger a change in Village Panchayat's style of functioning,
reforming it into a more transparent, democratic and accountable body
*  Decision making should rest with hamlets and the Village Panchayat should act as a
facilitator and not as provider.
*  The Village Panchayat should ensure that all villages and hamlets have equal access
to development activities and development funds from the Village Panchayat.
Communities' Concerns about the Village Panchavat
* Village Panchayat is too powerful to change. There might be temporary "posturing"
for the project, which will change as soon as the project activities are under way.

o Village Panchayat is primarily concerned with water and does not see sanitation and
drainage as equally important issues.
o  While main villages will be the focal point, hamlets and remote villages will get
neglected.
o  Village Panchayats will prefer large single schemes (overhead tanks and piped water
supply) which reflect the preference of richer families for private connections and
private latrines and will not explore smaller decentralized schemes which are less
costly.
o  Poor and hamlet-based communities will be neglected.
17.   Tribal Development Department
17.1  Tribal Development Department (TDD), set up in 1983, is the nodal agency for tribal
development in the state, meant to look after the tribals' welfare and development. Following a
reorganization made in 1992 aimed at an unitary command, the department has a Tribal
Commissioner with Nashik as headquarters; and four Additional Tribal Commissioners at Thane,
Nashik, Amravati and Nagpur. Macro level guidance and steering rests with a Tribes Advisory
Council (TAC) (set up as per the provisions of Schedule V of the constitution) of which Chief
Minister is the Chairman and the Tribal Development Minister,Vice Chairman. Secretary, Tribal
Development Department is the ex-officio Secretary of the Council. The main function of the
Council is to advise the Governor on important matters pertaining to the welfare and
advancement of scheduled tribes in the State. The Chief Minister also heads the Cabinet Sub-
committee for the Tribal Sub-Plan at the state level. This committee is responsible for approving
the formulation of the Tribal sub-plan, as well as monitor and supervise its implementation.
17.1.2 District level administrative arrangements. Plans (like the Five year plans) are
formulated keeping the district as a basic unit. Responsibility for formulating plans as well as
implementation and monitoring at the district level rests with the District Planning and
Development Councils (DPDC) headed by a Minister, called 'District / Guardian Minister'.
Special Executive Committees have been constituted in the 14 tribal districts of Maharashtra,
under the DPDC to ensure public participation in planning, implementation and monitoring of
the schemes for tribal development. In addition to other representatives from the district level
government machinery, the Project Officer from the ITDP is the ex-officio joint secretary of the
Committee. The Collectors of the district and the CEO of the Zilla Parishad are designated ex-
officio Additional Tribal Commissioners (ATC). The Project Officers of the ITDPs are placed
under the ATCs for co-ordination, supervision and implementation at district level.
18. Key Issues related to the Tribal Development Department
o  TDD is a mere fund channelizing agency'4 . Barring a few education irrigation
schemes, most tribal development schemes are planned and implemented by other
14 TDD's Plan outlay works out to about US$ 100- 120 million; an equally good amount is available to
meet non-plan expenses
34

line departments. Despite relevant expertise and experience, TDD do not have an
opportunity to influence the programs either in planning or implementation.
*  Planning by the line departments is rather exclusively top-down, hence lacking in
a holistic perspective. The line departments take the funds the implement it the
way they implement their other programs
*  TDD is not monitoring the projects financed by them. Data base is very weak.
Except data on physical and financial targets/ achievements, no information on
outputs/ outcomes are available.
*  In the absence of any feedback, changes into the intervention are very rarely
made. Leave alone content and approach, even the title continues to be same for
over decades. With no systematic feedback, neither learning is possible, nor is the
TDD able to influence the policies/ programs. Expertise available in the TDD is
thus not being put into an effective usage.
*  While the sensitive ITDPs are supposed to have IAS and IFS officers as Project
Officers, in reality, this does not happen and most of the POs in ITDP areas are
from the TDD. Hence the TDD remains a low profile and un-influential
department. Senior officers see ITDP postings as "punishment posting".
* The Planning Officers in ATC offices in Nagpur and Nashik were concerned
about the lack of funds and the fact that only about 40-50% of the planned budget
actually comes into their hands for expenditure. However the irony is that
significant amount of funds from the department also are surrendered by different
ITDPs every year.
* In the remoto areas of Gadchiroli and Chandrapur, the department was concerned
about lack of adequate manpower to interact with the villagers on a regular basis.
These areas were also impacted by the Naxalite movement making traveling and
field visits unsafe.
19.   Water Supply and Sanitation Department (WSSD). Water Supply and Sanitation
Department, Government of Maharashtra, is a key stakeholder, as it is currently engaged in
preparing the proposed project. Subsequently, it will shoulder responsibility for implementation,
monitoring and evaluation. The department has been traditionally strong on technical
competence (engineering/ contract aspects) and will have to equip itself with social/ institutional
capacity.
V: Tribal Driven Development
20.   Given the existing development/ regulatory framework including constitutional
provisions under the 73rd amendment, and issues identified through stakeholder analyses in the
backdrop of the current rural water supply and sanitation status, objectives are defined together
35



Second Maharashitra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Tribal Development Plan
Page 36 of 60
with a strategy and a plan of action including institutional arrangements and the costs thereof are
developed for a TDP in this section.
21.       Strategy. The concept of self-help and community sharing of resources is ingrained
in the tribal culture. Involving local communities in decision-making is a part of the tradition.
Key issues are discussed and conflicts, if any, are resolved in the presence of hereditary village
head and other elders. Thus, the project's strategy of decentralization to Village Panchayats and
User Groups, in broad terms, fits in well with the tribal socio-economic characteristics and
cultural values. At the same time, however, a study on 'traditional' systems of governance
among tribals will also be completed during the first year of the project, with a view to identify
culturally-appropriate ways of local governance and hence to improve tribals' participation and
inclusion. The tribal development strategy, hence, will also be premised on the Community-
Demand Driven (CDD) principles of: (i) autonomy; (ii) subsidiarity; (iii) self selection and
demand driven; (iv) participation, (v) inclusion & equity; (vi) transparency & accountability; and
(vii) cost sharing. Initially, efforts will be made at creating an 'enabling' environment so as to
provide for informed decision making, to participate or otherwise, in the project. Subsequently,
tribals, mobilized into groups, will be capacitated to plan, implement and operate and maintain
the project activities/facilities. Scheme cycle and the associated rules and regulations have,
accordingly, been evolved in discussions with tribals and other relevant stakeholders. Special
technical assistance through professional agencies will be ensured.  All other rules and
regulations, specially related to capital cost contribution and operation and maintenance will
remain the samne. The difference, however, will lie in its operationalization. In addition, to ensure
that this is not a one-time sort of intervention, and to help in mainstreaming CDD based
approaches into the tribal development as a whole in the State, project provides for TDD's
strengthening. Thus, the tribal development plan will have two major objectives: (i) one related
to rural water supply and sanitation delivery being attempted through fostering and
empowering autonomous, inclusive, equitable and accountable grassroots tribal institutions;
and (ii) institutional strengthening, to enable the State government, in general and the TDD in
particular to imbibe the CDD    approach towards tribal development.   Elements of
operationalizing the strategy are presented below, separately for RWSS and Institutional
Strengthening.
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Delivery
22. Primary Management Unit. In accordance with the national constitutional provision and
experiences gained elsewhere in the country, each habitation/ hamlet will work as the basic
management unit, instead of the Village Panchayat. That is, for the purpose of TDP, an
individual hamlet or a cluster of hamlets (hereinafter, for the purpose of simplicity, referred to as
"Tribal Para"15) comprising 30-50 households, will be the focal point. Thus Tribal Paras will be
responsible for planning, procuring, constructing, operating and maintaining water supply and
sanitation activities.
23. All denotified and nomadic tribes' habitations too will be considered au par with the STs .
5 15 Para, m local parlance, means hamlet
36

Page 3 7 of 60
24. Prioritization. Tribal habitations will receive priority for participation in the project. All
tribal settlements in a project district will automatically be eligible to participate in the project.
25. Tribal Para Definition. Recognizing that population could be mixed (tribal and non-tribal),
all habitations with at least 50% tribal households will be considered as a Tribal Para.
26. Gram Sabha. The 'Gram Sabha', the general body, will comprise all people of a Tribal
Para.
27.    Village Panchayat. village Panchayat's responsibility will include: (i) aiding and
facilitating the Tribal Paras, as and when requested by the latter, in executing the project
activities; (ii) monitoring of the Para wise progress as designed under the project; (iii) providing
leadership and be responsible, if the need arises, for settling inter Para/ hamlet issues; and (iv)
acting as a conduit between Paras and other external agencies.
28.   Zilla Parishad (ZP), housing the district support units (DSU), will be responsible for
steering the project in a district.
29.    Self Selection and Demand Driven. Project preparation recognizes that tribal
habitations will not be able to express a demand and make an application on their own. Also, it is
also doubtful whether project's general IEC (Information, Education, Communication) efforts
will succeed in reaching them. Hence, under TDP, an application (on behalf of a Tribal Para)
could be made by any proponent such as: NGOs, consultants, Tribal Development Department
(including ITDP), Village Panchayats, BPs and ZPs. However, tribals' willingness, in principle,
should be ascertained before making applications. Towards enabling this, PPMU/DSU will
launch an appropriate IEC campaign as well as prepare an application format.
30.   Delineating Tribal Para. All applications will be examined by the district level project
management team and delineate tribal Paras taking technical, social, economic and institutional
aspects into account. Towards ensuring that WSS facilities are tribal-friendly, all efforts will be
made to make sure that each Tribal Para will have an independent water supply system. Multi-
Para and/ or multi-Village Panchayat schemes, as a rule, will be avoided.
30.1   Technological Alternatives. Proponents and the DSUs will, as a rule, make available a
basket of alternative technological options for improving water supply and sanitation facilities
which are cost effective and culture-friendly. Full information on the merits and demerits of each
technology will be provided to the tribals to enable an informed and appropriate decision
making. Small scale and decentralized, rather than single large scheme will be encouraged so as
to ensure that the local needs are not subsumed in large and elaborate schemes. Repair and
rehabilitation including augmenting and modernizing existing schemes will be preferred over
entirely new schemes.
31.   Autonomy, Decentralization and Inclusion. Once a Tribal Para has expressed an
interest in participating in the project, and the same is endorsed by the district support team,
residents of the Para will be mobilized into a Tribal Para'6 Water Supply and Sanitation
37

Page 38 of 60
Committee (TPWSC) which will be responsible for planning, procuring, constructing,
implementing and operating and maintaining WSS facility. TPWSC will be established as a sub-
committee of the Village Panchayat and separate by-laws (governing functioning of TPWSC)
drafted by the GOM will, among other things, ensure autonomy and decentralization. The
committee will be formed based on three essential elements: representativeness, responsiveness
and responsibility. All decision making including the choice of a technology (location, spread,
size etc) will rest with the TPWSC. Project's funds will flow into the accounts of the TPWSC
and they will operate the project investments. A 'sub project cycle' has been developed which
details activities to be carried out (in the Pre-Planning, Planning, Implementation, and Post
Implementation O&M Phases). Against each activity, roles/responsibility of a particular
actor/agency are specified.
32.    Towards ensuring ownership, transparency and accountability, every TPWSC will
be enabled to prepare a PRA (Participatory Rural Appraisal)-based Para Water & Sanitation Plan
(TPWSP).This will form an attachment to a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the three
principal actors -TPWSC, GP and ZP. Once approved by signatures, this will not only be the
basis for implementation, but it would also enable comparative assessments in future. The
elements of such a plan are listed in the box below.
Tribal Para Water Supply and Sanitation Plan
Community Mobilization, comprsing: (a) Social Mobilization details relating to PWSC
formation as well as registration and opening of the bank account; (b) Socio-economic
survey for a social mapping; (c) water sources mapping; (d) superimposing social map on
water resources map, on a top sheet, to depict the existing situation and identify gaps (if
any); and (e) computing situational index.
Community Contribution Mobilization plan detailing household-wise cash and labor shares.
Detailed technical project report (DPR) with details about choices considered and the
discussions thereof as well as the cost particulars related to water supply.
Ground Water Recharge (GWR), point recharge, focusing on the water supply source.
Operation and Management (O&M) Plan including the likely tariff, income and expenses.
Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion plan detailing objectives, inputs, scheduling and the likely
outputs. Results of the baseline healthy home surveys will also be an integral part of the
module.
Women Development Initiatives (WDI) will spell out how women have been mobilized, the
process of their deciding on the choice of activities; financing mechanism; expected
outputs and the NGO support.
Environmental Management Plan, outlining measures to address environmental issues including
those related to sanitation.
Capacity Building Initiatives will include the programs planned (class room/ lecture mode as well
as field based), likely participants, scheduling,  community development support,
implementation arrangements, the post implementation follow-up.
Implementation schedule, including schedule for delivery of inputs and services, schedule for
monitoring of the progress, success indicators and capacity enhancements.
Community Monitoring. Besides implementation, benefits likely to accrue to different subgroups
as well as to the community as a whole will be monitored by the community. Simple
indicators, as identified and articulated by the community themselves, will be deployed for
the purpose.
Study on Traditional Systems of Governance - tribal people have customary institutions to
regulate social life, manage common resources and resolve conflicts. An understanding of
38



Second Maharashtra Rzral Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Tribal Development Plan
Page 39 of 60
these institutions will help improving tribals' participation and effectiveness of local
governance.
Mutual obligations and responsibilities on the part of all the three signatories - TWSC and
ZPED will be detailed out in respect of each of the activity in the scheme cycle.
33.   The TPWSP approved by the Tribal Para'7 Water Supply and Sanitation Committee
(TPWSC) will be submitted to ZP for further processing, i.e., to be approved. In addition, the
project will support a Village Panchayat Strengthening Plan.
34.   Project Support Units in the ZP will be responsible for identifying and arranging capacity
building needs as well as professional  technical assistance (TA --both engineering and
community development) to Paras. Services of a non-government Service Agency (SA --
NGOs, Consultants, etc) will be enlisted to provide the TA to the Village Panchayats and Paras.
All these arrangements will be formalized through a Tri-Partite Planning Phase Agreement ( to
be signed by Village Panchayats, ZP and SA) and a quadrilateral contract among ZP, village
Panchayats, and SA and the respective Para. GOM will issue an appropriate directive to make
these arrangements, in particular, project funds to flow to Paras. Thus, the institutional
arrangements would include: PWSC at the Para level, with executive responsibilities; village
Panchayats at Village Panchayat level, with guiding and monitoring; ZP at the district level,
with facilitating, and monitoring; and PPMU at the state level, with policy, fund and monitoring
responsibilities.
35.   Organizational arrangements at the district level will include: (i) a District Facilitation
Team (DFT), to address software related issues; and (ii) District Appraisal Team, to address
technical aspects. DFT in the tribal districts will have a tribal development management
specialist (TDMS). In addition, the state level PMU will also have a TDMS in its social
development team.
36.   The cost sharing arrangements are:
Para/ PWSC         ZP/ GOM
Water Supply         Capital Cost       5% (1% cash)       95%
O&M                100%
Sanitation           Capital Cost       5% (1% cash)       95%
O&M                100%
Household Latrines   Capital cost       100%
O&M                100%

37.   Fund flows to Tribal Paras. Once planning phase is through, implementation phase
proposals are prepared & approved, and IPQAs are signed, project funds will flow to the Paras.
This will be released in four installments: (i) first installment, 40%, of the IPQA budget to be
released upfront; (ii) second, 40%, after 80% of the first installment is utilized; (iii) 10% as the
third , after the first installment is utilized fully, and 80% of second installment is utilized; and
(iv) 10% around Implementation Phase Completion Report (IPCR).
38.   Targeting, Project Coverage and Implementation Schedule. Of the 25 project districts
included in the proposed project, 10 districts have significant tribal population, and are normally
defined as "tribal districts". These 10 districts are of high significance for the project and they
are: Thane, Nasik, Yavatmal, Wardha, Nagapur, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gadchorili, Dhule
and Nandurbar. Tribal population across the 10 districts is about 4.94 million which amounts to
85% of the total tribal population. These districts comprise about 6700 settlements which are
categorized either as Non-covered or Partially Covered (Table- 15 ). Given the demand driven
and self-selection stipulation and discounting for the non-tribal settlements, the project would
expect demand to emanate from about 2,000 tribal settlements. Provisions are made for
additional 200 settlements falling outside the purview of the 10 districts. 2,200 settlements will
be covered in 4 batches (each about 15 to 18 months- preplanning, 3 months; planning, 6
months; implementation, 3-6 months; and post implementation, 3 months), over a period of six
years. To enable focused attention and continuous learning, only 2-3 districts will be covered in
each batch. District-wise coverage is worked out in consultation with local experts (Table--17).

39.   Forest- Tribals Interface. There are villages inside and on the periphery of the
forests in Maharashtra. What were previously called 'forest villages' have all been
declared revenue villages, and the forest department no longer controls the development
activities in revenue areas inside the forests. However, any activity to be taken outside
the revenue boundaries require endorsement from the forest department. Particular cases
of such type include: source identification and development and pipe laying. National
Policy of Joint Forest Management provides a solution so far as the reserved forests are
concerned. Project Planning and Management Unit (PPMIU) will discuss this with the
Forest Department and will issue a directive to this regard.
Institutional Strengthening
40.   The project's institutional strengthening component will support capacity building
and strengthening of the tribal department and Village Panchayats. The former includes:
(i) a comprehensive evaluation of the functioning and performance of the tribal
development department activities (Rs 5 million); (ii) general management development
of the TDD personnel; (Rs 5 million); (iii) setting up of a computerized MIS system (Rs
10 million); (iv) Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Resource Centers in 100 Ashram
Schools, similar to the Tribal Development Commissioner mooted project, "Promotion of
Sanitation through Tribal Schools" by a Nashik based NGO, Nirmal Gram Nirmal
Kendra (Rs 5 million); (v) Barefoot Health Workers scheme, on the lines of Tribal
Development Commissioner's (and UNICEF) Project Concept Note: "Upgradation of
Hamlet and Village Health Services in Tribal areas", (Rs 2.5 million); and (vi) piloting
CDD based Integrated Tribal Development Planning in some 10 tribal GPs (Rs 2.5
million). In addition, a sum of Rs 5 million is set apart for strengthening the TRI.
41

41.   Costs/ Budget. Based on the field experiences and to ensure that low cost and
O&M friendly technologies are promoted, per capita capital cost for water supply will not
exceed Rs 2,000. As aconsequence, water supply construction cost will be around Rs
500,000 per Para. For 2,200 Paras, tota Icosts will amount to Rs 1,100 million. Sanitation
cost is worked out at about Rs 200 per capita, aggregating to Rs 110 million. 20% of the
construction costs (Rs 12 million) will be towards technical assistance from SAs. Thus,
Rs 1,210 million is budgeted for water supply and sanitation costs. Institutional
Strengthening is budgeted at Rs 30 million. The two together add to Rs 1,240 million.
Details are provided in the cost table.
42.   Financing. While technical assistance costs towards demonstrating CDD based
integrated tribal development planning formulation will be met out of the project funds,
TDD will meet with the investment costs. PPMU will seek assurance from the TDD to
this effect. Remaining funds will flow from the project.
43.   lLnstitutional Arrangements. PPMU  will provide for TTD   and Forest
Departments' representation on all the project management committees both at the state
and district levels.
44. Monitoring and Evaluation. The project has planned a four-fold monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system:
Community Monitoring -- Each Tribal Para will be capacitated to assess the
implementation performance themselves. Simple formats involving indicators
(chiefly, quantitative and some qualitative) as perceived and articulated by the
communities will be developed for the purpose. Essentially, this will be an
assessment of the 'observed' occurrences against 'expected' or planned actions. This
will be conducted throughout the scheme cycle. Details will be captured in the
TWSPs Results of individual Paras will be aggregated by the respective
NGOs/PSU and maintained at the state level through a computerized management
information system (MIS).
Process Monitoring -- This will aim at assessing the participatory processes
(expected to result in empowerment of tribals). It will be done for the first two
batches, by an external agency. This will also include an assessment of the
functioning and performance of the institutional arrangements.
Sustainability Monitoring - to assess the likelihood of sustainability of the service
delivery, in a sample settlement, in each batch and to draw up action plans for post-
implementation support employing a Village Immersion Program-based approach.
This will be done by a team of different set of stakeholders including the village
communities.
Impact Evaluation - While a lessons leamed note will be prepared by the end of
the first batch, a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts as a result of the TDP
intervention, at the end of the program, will be conducted by an external agency.

The Consultations centered around the proposed water and sanitation project, the issues
and concerns of the communities and sub groups and their expectations from this project.
In the first round, 20 villages were visited as a part of the social assessment study and
village level consultations and FGDs with women, tribal groups and other marginal
communities (SC households, BPL families) were held. In the next round, 7 Village
Panchayats with predominantly tribal population were visited to specifically look at tribal
development issues. This entailed hamlet level and village Panchayat level consultations,
PRA exercises, and preparing tribal development plans along with the concerned
community over a period of two days. The plans, which have been summarized in section
5 of this report, have been endorsed by the respective tribal communities, and this
endorsement at different locations have been put in the subsequent pages.
