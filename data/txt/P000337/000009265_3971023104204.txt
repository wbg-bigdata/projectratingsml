SECOND DOUALA PORT PROJECT (LOAN 1321/CREDIT 657-CM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The principal objectives of the project were:
(a)   to provide additional capacity at Douala port for traffic
projected through 1985;
(b)   to enable specialized log carriers and semi-specialized
container ships to use the port; and
(c)   to improve road and rail access to the port and traffic
within the port.
2.       To achieve these objectives the project comprised the following
elements:
(a)   construction of a new log port;
(b)   construction of a 500 m deep-water berth with storage area
and transit sheds;
(c)   supply and installation of utilities;
(d)   a 530 m fishing berth with associated facilities;
(e)   dredging of the 22 km access channel to a depth of about
-7.5 m;
(f)   construction of new rail sidings, a new railroad
marshalling yard, and access roads;
(g)   rehabilitation of the existing port; and
(h)   consulting services for the supervision of construction.
3.       Total project cost was US$145 million, about 21% higher than
estimated at appraisal mainly due to a justified increase of the original
project scope. The project was financed by several co-donors (AfDB,
BADEA, CCCE, CIDA, FAC and KfW) with the Bank providing US$25 million.



- iv -
4.       The project was successful.  All elements have been
satisfactorily implemented and the recalculated economic rate of return
shows 22% against 18% estimated at appraisal. Higher than expected
benefits obtained from rental of land for oil companies offset the 21%
cost increase.  The National Port Authority's (NPA) financial performance
improved under the project and substantial productivity gains were
achieved.
5.       The following points may be of particular interest:
(a)   the consultants selected for construction supervision were
not the same as those who had carried out the feasibility
studies and had prepared the tender documents, resulting
in difficulties to resolve site problems of this complex
project (para. 3.11);
(b)   reasons for cost increase (paras. 3.14 to 3.16);
(c)   the cofinancing of the project with numerous donors made
project management complex and difficult and led to delays
in implementation and disbursements (paras. 3.19, 3.20 and
9.06a);
(d)   management performance and shift of emphasis from
construction management to management of port operations
and maintenance (paras. 4.04 to 4.06);
(e)   NPA's training program (paras. 4.15 to 4.17);
(f)   productivit- increase (para. 5.03); and
(g)   adequacy of traffic forecast (para. 7.02).

SECOND DOUALA PORT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Cameroon, with a population of about 8.3 million, an area of
about 475,000 km2 and per capita GNP of about $670 (1980), is one of the
more dynamic and wealthier countries in West Africa, with substantial
potential for further economic growth. The GDP growth rate increased
from about 4.2% p.a. during the Second Plan period (FY1966-1971) to 4.4%
p.a. during the Third Plan (FY1972-1976), to about 8% p.a. during FY1977-
1981. Rapid expansion in agriculture, manufacturing and mining,
including promising recent gas and petroleum discoveries and increasing
gas and crude oil exports, supported by increased consumption and capital
investments, contributed substantially to the economic growth.
1.02     During the Second and Third Plans the Government gave high pri-
ority to the transport sector to provide a basic infrastructure for the
economy, to interconnect regions, to open up new areas and to provide the
necessary infrastructure for foreign trade. This was followed by a grad-
ual shift towards the productive (agriculture, manufacturing and mining)
and social sectors. The share of transport investments fell from a high
37% realized during the Third Plan (FY1972-1976) to a planned 26% for the
Fourth Plan (FY1977-1981).
1.03     With continuing Government priority being given to agriculture
(both for exports and domestic consumption), expected substantial
increases in oil and gas production and with vast and still largely unex-
ploited natural resources, particularly forestry, hydroelectric and min-
eral resources, the outlook for continued economic growth appears favor-
able. This growth however, will depend, among other factors, on the
maintenance, improvement and expansion of the transport system, including
the Port of Douala. So far, the Bank has helped finance the following
transport projects:
- The First Highway Project, completed in 1975 (US$12 million Loan
663-C! and US$7 million Credit 180-CN, larch 1970)
- The First Railway Project, completed in 1975 (US$5.2 million
Loan 687-CM, June 1971)
- The First Douala Port Project, completed in 1976 (US$1.5 million
Credit 229-CM, in January 1971)



- 2 -
- The Second Highway Project, completed in 1978 (US$24 million
Credit 429-CM and US$24 million Loan 935-CM, December 1973)
- The Second Railway Project, completed in 1978 (US$16 million
Loan 1038-CM, September 1974)
- The Third Highway Project, completed in 1982 (US$16.5 million
Loan 1515-CM, October 1978)
- The Railway Engineering Project, completed in 1979 (Third
Railway Project, US$2.3 million Loan S4-CM, June 1976)
- The Fourth Highway Project (US$38.0 million Loan 1723-CM and
US$10 million Credit 926-CM, November 1979)
- The Fourth Railway Project (US$27.0 million Loan 1734-CM and
US$20.0 million Credit 936-C1, January 1980).
1.04     The Second Douala Port Project, subject of this completion
report, was financed together with eight co-donors under
Credit/Loan 657/1321 CM and substantially completed in 1981.  The Com-
pletion Report is based on the folloving:
- Appraisal Report of a Second Douala Port Project
- Data available in Bank files
- Findings of a final supervision mission which visited Cameroon
in February 1982
- The draft PCR prepared by the NPA.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The Government of Cameroon and the NPA requested assistance from
the Bank and other donors in the implementation of the Second Douala Port
project, to meet the port's needs through 1985. This project was fore-
seen as a logical extension of the First Douala Port project, which had
increased port capacity to meet requirements until feasibility studies
and implementation of the Second Port Project could be carried out.
2.02     Feasibility studies were undertaken by consultants   Alternative
sites along the Cameroonian coast and also within the Wouri estuary were
considered. Douala was selected because of its accessibility by rail to
a large area of forest reserves in southern and eastern Cameroon and
because of its existing port infrastructure. Over the longer term, con-
sultant's studies envisaged the possibility of additional facilities for
oil tankers, and possibly bauxite traffic at Pointe Limboh, west of
Victoria. Over the long term, it may also be appropriate to develop port
facilities to the south near Kribi.



2.03     The Second Douala Port Project was designed to overcome the two
major obstacles to development of the port of Douala, namely, its limited
channel depth and lack of space for landward growth. The channel
entrance had a limiting depth of about 5 m below low water datum,
restricting size of fully-laden vessels which could enter or leave the
port to about 3,500 dwt at high-water. Expansion was difficult in any
direction; development upstream would have been hampered by limited water
depth and the existing fishing industry, while development on the
Bonaberi side of the channel involved problems of access and of its
zoning for industrial development. Seaward development was also a
problem due to location in that direction of a dockyard and naval base
and to the sharp upward slope of the land behind the port facilities.
2.04     The solution provided through the project included dredging of
the channel entrance to 7.5 m below low water datum over a length of
22 ka, with a depth of -9.5 m at the outer bar. Sand from the dredged
channel would be used to reclaim land, both downstream and upstream of
the existing port facilities. Buildings inhibiting expansion of the port
downstream would be demolished, and the dockyard would be relocated
upstream.
2.05     Principal objectives of the project were:
(i)   to provide additional capacity at Douala port for traffic
projected through 1985, particularly to provide separate
facilities for log exports and container traffic;
(ii)  to increase the depth of the access channel at Douala to
enable specialized log carriers to up to 20,000 dwt and
semi-specialized container ships to use the port; and
(iii) to improve road and rail access to the port and traffic
from within the port.
2.06     The original project comprised the following principal elements.
A.  Downstream Port Development
(i)   Construction of a new log port consisting of reclaimed
area totaling about 20 ha for the reception, sorting, and
storage of logs, a shallow quay of 50 m for launching and
exporting logs within sheltered water, and three deep-

E. Rehabilitation of the Existing Port
Removal of railway sidings and repair of paved aprons within the
present port area.
F.  Consulting Services for Supervision of Construction
2.07     Negotiations took place in June 1976; the Board approved the
project August 1976; and the loan/credit became effective in June 1977.
The Bank's financing consisted of a loan of US$15 million and a credit of
US$10 million equivalent. The tota±l foreign exchange requirement for the
Second Douala Port Project was estimated at US$72 million, with a total
cost of US$120 million.
2.08     The project has proved to be an appropriate step in furthering
the transport sector, emphasizing for the forseeable future the priority
of the Port of Douala, which is handling 93% ^: Cameroon's foreign trade
today. Two other highly important transportation projects, the upgrading
of the Douala-Yaounde Road and the realignment of certain sections of the
Trans-Cameroon Railway will further strengthen the inland links of this
main port (Fifth Highways Project, approved in June 1982 and Fourtk.
Railway Project, approved in June 1979).



III.  PROJECT IMPLEKENTATION
A. Main Civil Works
3.01     Civil works consisted mainly of elements described in para. 2.06
except for the following changes:
(i)   In the log port the basin was dredged to -9 m depth
instead of -3 m, three 25 m long ramps were added to
launch logs, and mooriag dolphins at the side of the
entrance channel were not built; and
(ii)  Container berths were lengthened from 240 m to 400 m, two
RotRo berths added (100 m long) and storage area increased
to 22.6 ha. In addition, land was drained for long-term
storage, leveled, and services for future warehouses
built.
Downstream Port Development
3.02     The assumption in the project appraisal had been that sufficient
clean sand would be available through project dredging to reclaim 20 ha
of land for the log port. In fact, as dredging proceeded, the soil com-
position turned out to be much more clayal than anticipated with only
1,400.000 m3 suitable against a need of 4 490.000 a-.  (Dredging of the
channel was expected to yield 3,600.000 ;3 and the log basin another
2,250.000 m?). The Government/NPA and co-donors C (Table 1) met in
August and November 1977 to solve the problem, by increasing the depth of
the log basin from -3 m to -9 m. This added depth yielded the additional
fill necessary.
3.03     The design of the proposed container/general cargo berth was
also amended in the course of project execution, partly as a result of
the unexpected nature of the subsoil and partly because NPA with the
donors' concurrence decided to exercise the option left open at appraisal
to extend the berth from 240 to 400 m. The principal technical changes
prompted by the subsoil included lowering of the anchor rods between the
steel sheet piles and the anchor wall and installing heavier Larssen
profiles (no. VI instead of V). In addition the container crane grade
beams were built on spread footings, rather than piles as originally
planned. This may cause problems later because of ground settlement.
3.04     The financing of major structural changes were approved by the
group C co-donors involved in the downstream port development (Table 1)
in meetings in August and November 1977. At that time, it was determined
to extend the quay not only to 400 m, but to a total of 500 m.  The new
configuration would include two container berths along a continuous
wharf, with a Ro/Ro berth at the head, served by two mooring dolphins.
The additional 100 meters was included to provide two berths for Ro/Ro
vessels, both for use of the stern or slewing ramps. Other amendments
included shifting the entire wharf downstream by 200 m; enlarging the
container yard to 22.6 ha from 20 ha; and relocating the transit shed



which had been included in the original design. The changes resulted in
a year's delay in completion of the quays, in October 1979 instead of
October 1978 (Table 2). The additional costs of the container quays
totaled US$13.25 m of which US$11.04 m was borne by Cameroon and the rest
by KfW (Table 1).
Upstream Port Development
3.05     The dredging for the dockyard and fishing port and the adjacent
reclamation started in April 1977 and was _stisfactorily completed in
June 1977. Sheet piles for the 560 a of quay were driven on schedule and
the whole quay and its backfill were placed in August 1978, only one
month later. Utilities were completed satisfactorily at the end of May
1979. Moorings were ready to receive the new 500 ton floating dry dock
when it was supplied on February 10, 1979.
3.06     Construction of the facilities for the fishing industry were
completed in mid-1980, a year later than expected. In the course of
construction, changes were made in design of various facilities which
added US$4.96 million to the cost (Table 3). In construction of the ice
factory, owing to delays in delivery of equilment there were problems
between the main contractor and the subcontractors related to scheduling
of construction. In addition, because of faulty construction of the ice
factory, some of the equipment was damaged. Repairs were completed in
June 1980, with additional costs borne by the contractor.
Dredging
3.07     As per the project design, CIDA agreed to supply a trailing
suction dredger and auxiliary equipment to dredge the Wouri Channel to a
depth of -7.5 m along its 22 km length, and to -9.5 m at its outer bar.
Due to a 6-month delay in the start of dredging, the Canadian contract
expired before the work was finished (December 31, 1980) and a Datch firm
was hired to complete the job.  This firm has dredged an additional 1.5
million a3, but as of the time of the completion mission, the depth of
-9.5 m had still not been reached at the bar1  although the channel
itself had been dredged satisfactorily.
3.08     The appraisal indicated that during dredging, the behavior of
the Channel and estuary would be kept under review to provide information
on siltation and hence to determine the most suitable methods and equip-
ment for maintenance dredging. Since siltation has turned out to be
greater than expected, with perhaps 2 million m3 accumulating yearly over
the 22 km length and another 500,000 m3 in the log port basin, DPA is
consulting experts at the Port of Rouen on a maintenance program. At
appraisal the Bank advised NPA to limit dredging to -3.5 m, which would
admit shallow draft floating craft. This was because few ships of a
larger draft use the log port, and so it did not appear economical to
maintain it at -9 m.  However, NPA has not followed the Bank's advice and
1/ NPA expects to complete this dredging by mid-i983.



- 7 -
has recently dredged 800,000 m3 to a depth of -9 m and is expected to
maintain this depth in the future.
Road and Rail Access
3.09     Road and rail access installations were completed almost a year
behind schedule (late 1979 rather than end 1978), due to delays in evacu-
ation and demolition of a variety of facilities in the area. The loan
agreement had stipulated that by June 30, 1978, the Government would have
completed all legal steps necessary for NPA to acquire the lands for
these installations.  In fact however the Besseke Market and the Navy
Installation were not evacuated until late 1978 and construction work
only began in October 1978, a year behind schedule. A second problem in
regards to this component arose due to failure to anticipate that the new
road and rail facilities would interfere with existing water, electricity
and telephone utilities along Boulevard Leclerc. The adjustments needed
to accomodate these utilities added US$500,000 to the cost of the compo-
nent, most of which was borne by the Government/NPA. The completed rail
and road system greatly facilitates transport to and from the port and
between the different parts of the port and their back-up areas.
Port Rehabilitation
3.10    The rehabilitation of the existing quays included re-laying of
the concrete blocks of the quay apron, the modification and deletion of
rail tracks, and the establishment of better paved links from the quay to
the rear access road which serves the entire port. The work was sche-
duled for 1979 but executed in 1980 under a contract with a French con-
tractor based in Cameroon. The delay resulted from a request of the FED
to readvertise the bid invitation and the introduction of new government
procedures in bid analysis.
Consultant Services
3.11     At the appraisal CIDA agreed to finance about 80 staff-years of
consulting services to supervise execution of the project. In accordance
with its procurement regulations, CIDA financed a Canadian consulting
consortium (3 firms) to supervise construction. This arrangment was
acceptable to the Bank, all co-donors, the Cameroon Government and NPA.
However, it had its weaknesses. The consultants supervising construction
had not carried out the feasibility studies and preparation of bid docu-
ments. Consequently, they were handicapped in effectively resolving
field problems related to the execution of this complex project. In
addition, as cited by EPA, the field personnel's technical qualifications
were weak, which caused difficulties and delays in assuring an appro-
priate response to the numerous technical problems that surfaced during
execution of works, for example, in reviewing and approving designs. The
scope of the consultants' responsibility spanned the entire project.
They participated in tender negotiations of the contract of the main
civil works, and supervised this complex and many-sided work
satisfactorily. They were responsible for on-site supervision of the
project, employing an on-site team of some 50 employees, including 10



-8 -
expatriates. They participated in redesigning the downstream port faci-
lities, and produced comprehensive and useful reports on all parts of the
project. Design and supervision of the dredger in Canada were executed
by Canadian Naval Architects.
Drainage for Long-Term Storage Facilities
3.12     In September 1978, Cameroon Government, NPA and the co-donors
agreed to expand the long-term storage capacity of the port by draining
large areas of land along its perimeter and to extend roads to the new
area. The decision was made at the same time it was determined to add a
second container berth to the downstream port facilities. The cost of
US$8.3 million was borne by CCCE (US$6.67 million) and the Cameroon
Government and NPA (US$1.63 million).  Enough land was drained to permit
construction of 15 long-term warehouses of 5,000 m each. The work was
contracted through local competitive bidding and the job was completed in
a prompt and satisfactory way.
B. Tenders and Procurement
3.13     The main civil works which included the upstream and downstream
ports, road and rail access and various buildings (Table 4) were all
contracted through ICB (International Competitive Bidding). Pre-
selection of main contractors took place between July and October 1975
and bidding took place between December 1975 and March 31, 1976. The
contracts were awarded to a French firm and to a Dutch firm. Items being
financed by CIDA, the dredger, its crew, the floating dry dock, fishing
port buildings and consultant services (item E under Table 1), were to be
contracted directly with Canadian firms under the Canadian Government's
bilateral aid procedures. The dredging was mostly fiuished by a Canadian
subsidiary of the Dutch contractor. The construction of the dredger and
the floating dock were satisfactorily executed by Canadian firms in
Canada. A Canadian firm built the fishing port buildings. The
French Government, in spite of its procurement regulations requiring
French equipment, accepted tendering in the Cameroon market for the
wooden railway ties for the railway extension.
C. Project Costs
3.14     The actual project cost was US$145.2 million or 21% higher than
the estimated appraisal figure of US$120.16 million. The most important
factors in these cost increases include:
(i)   an increase of US$9.6 million due to construction of an
additional container berth in the downstream port (final
cost of US$13.3 million compared with the initial estimate
of US$3.7 million);
(ii) cost increase of US$10.2 million in access road construc-
tion because of increases in volume (final cost of



- 9 -
US$16.3, compared with initial estimate of US$6.1
million); and
(iii) an addition of US$8.7 million for the unanticipated
drainage of adjacent land for long-term storage.
3-15     Other cost increases included an additional US$2.5 million for
the dredger and equipment; an additional US$2.3 million for fishing port
buildings; US$1.5 million for downstream port utilities; and an overrun
of US$1 million on consulting services.
3.16     There were major savings of US$12.3 million in two areas: the
total cost for dredging was US$8.6 million less than anticipated and for
land acquisition US$3.7 million under the appraisal estimate (see Table 4
for additional details).
3.17     Additional funding was provided as follows:
Cameroon Govt.
and NPA       11.18 million US dollars
CIDA                 4.96
CCCE                 6.67
KfW                   2.22
TOTAL           25.03 million US dollars
(See Table 3 for details.)
5.18     Inflation in terms of price contingencies, was only slightly
more important in the cost of the project than anticipated at appraisal,
amounting to 12.6 of the total actual cost or 15% of the total
anticipated cost at appraisal.
D. Project Financing
3.19     At appraisal, 5 financing groups were formed to finance the
project. These included (see Table 1):
Group A: combined Cameroon Government, NPA and ADB for financing
the upstream port infrastructure. Total Finance Sum: US$ 9.35
million, compared with US$6.22 million estimate at appraisal.
Group B: combined Cameroon Government, NPA, ADB, and BADEA for
financing of roads and rails and utilities for the upstream and
downstream harbour extension. Total Finance Sum: US$22.96
million, compared with US$17.28 million at appraisal.
Group C: combined Cameroon Government, NPA, IBRD, FAC, FED, and
KfW for financing the main civil works, comprising channel
dredging (for fill only), dredging of inner basin of downstream
port and infrastructure and further rehabilitation of the aprons



- 10 -
and roads and tracks of the existing port amounting to
US$48.42 million, compared with US$47.34 million at appraisal.
Group D: combined CCCE and FAC financing workshops and equipment
of the shipyard. Total amount: US$3.76 million, compared with
US$3.48 million at appraieal.
Group B: combined Cameroon Government, NPA and CIDA for the
supply of a floating dock, a hopper-dredger and equipment, the
dredging of the access channel, fishing port buildings and the
fees for the consultants, supervising the works. Total amount:
US$38.49 million, compared with US$42.75 at appraisal (see
Table 1 for details).
Financing arrangements for unanticipated project costs included:
Group F: Cameroon incurred the US$670,000 necessary for
additional land compared with US$3.08 million at appraisal.
Group G: the extra costs of the two container quays were
financed by group C (which was initially responsible for the
downstream port develolment) primarily by Cameroon (US$11.04
million) and KfW (US$2.22 million).
Group X: th_ costs of the new drainage project were undertaken
by Cameroon (US$1.63 million) and CCCE (US$6.67 million).
E. Disbursement
3.20     At the time of appraisal it was assumed that the Bank loan of
US$25 million would be fully disbursed by June 30, 1980. A lag in
disbursements until Nay 15, 1981 developed, mainly because of the cross
effectiveness conditions and as a result of lengthy and complicated
procedures in preparation and processing of the application for
payments. One way to reduce these delays would have been for the Bank's
Resident Representative in Cameroon to process applications for payment
on behalf of the Bank; however, he is not vested with this authority.
The possibility of introducing this method of processing was reviewed but
not found acceptable by the Bank. Disbursement was scheduled to start
December 31, 1976, but the first disbursement was made on June 30,
1977. NPA's draft completion report concluded that the complex
combination of donors and finance agreements caused delays in
disbursement. Actual and expected disbursements are given in Table 5.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMAJCE AND DEVELOPIENT
A. The National Port Authority (NPA)
4.01     The National Port Authority was established in 1972 in connec-
tion with the Bank's first port project. It is a financially and opera-
tionally autonomous public corporation for administration, maintenance



- 11 -
and construction of all coastal and river ports, for the maintenance of
navigational aids and for the management of industrial port activities.
In addition to Douala, which is by far the most important port, it has
responsibility for three smaller coastal ports, Kribi, Tiko/Victoria-
Pointe Limboh, and a small seasonal river port at Garoua.
4.02     The Government is responsible for approving tariff changes and
for covering NPA's losses, if any. NPA's management and administration
have improved substantially since the establishment of the Port Authority
and are generally sound.
4.03     The present organizational structure, and that existing at the
time of appraisal, are presented in Charts 1 and 2, respectively.
B. Management and Organizational Effectiveness
4.04     NPA's management at the departmental and top levels is being
progressively Africanized whenever qualified Cameroonians are avail-
able. Newlyv cr-ated divisions such as those in charge of Statistics and
Management Control are initially manned by technical assistants with
suitable counterparts. Most managerial staff is well qualified and expe-
rienced, and the quality of NPA's high-level managerial team is one of
its strong points. At the intermediate management level however, the
weakness of financial incentives in NPA's remuneration system and of
career planning has resulted in a rather apathetic attitude. NPA is
aware of this problem and is trying to improve the situation.
Organizational improvements are being dealt with in the proposed Third
Douala Port Project.
C. Changes in Organizational Structure
4.05     A few noteworthy changes in NPA's organizational structure are
first, that NPA has been increasingly decentralized since 1973, and
secondly, that in 1976 the Directorate of Technical Studies received
increased technical assistance to facilitate implementation of the large
extension to the Douala Port under the Second Port Project.
4.06     Prior to 1979, the emphasis in the organization and management
was, rightly, on strengthening the technical departments in NPA, through
technical assistance and hiring qualified young engineers. From 1979 on,
with the near completion of the extension project, the emphasis shifted
to management, operations, and maintenance of the new port. Both a
Directorate of Finances and a management control unit were created with
technical assistants financed and provided by the French Economic
Cooperation Agency (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique - CCCE).
These two units report directly to the Director General. For the
improvement of port operations, a division of training was created in
1980 with Canadian technical assistance, also provided under the Second
Port Project. In order to improve port maintenance, the Directorate of
Civil Works is at present being reinforced with technical assistance
transferred from the Directorate of Studies.



- 12 -
D. Effectiveness of Long Range Planning
and Management Information System
Long Range Planning
4.07     Long-term corporate planning is still rudimentary; in contrast,
infrastructure investment planning is adequate due to consulting services
provided inder the Second Port Project. A Division of Economic Studies
and Planning in the Directorate of General Studies was created in 1979,
but due to inadequate staffing has not fulfilled NPA's expectations.
This sector of the Directorate of General Studies is in the process of
being reinforced with qualified local staff for economic studies and
long-term planning.
4.08     NPA's long-term financial planning needs further improvement,
and this is being followed up in the proposed Third Douala Port
Project. A methodology has been established for financial projections
and management planning.
Budgeting and Management Control
4.09     The port's budgeting and management control systems have been
modernized under the Second Port Project with technical assistance
financed by CCCE. With this new budgeting system, NPA prepares an annual
operating budget and can compare the actual result with the budgeted
figure for each cost and revenue center. A budget review is conducted
every month by the Director General. The technical assistant who has
been appointed to assist NPA in the implementation of the budgetV.ng and
costing system will be retained for an additional two years, but IPA has
difficulties in finding a qualified counterpart to take over at .e end
of the expatriate's assignment.
Accounting System
4.10     NPA's accounting system is generally satisfactory.  It was
successfully computerized and produces useful documents for decision-
making at management level. NPA's fixed assets were revalued in 1981, as
agreed under the Second Port Project. The revalued figures will be used
for cost accounting, including calculation of depreciation at replacement
cost, and for proposals of tariff adjustments. Accounts are available,
within two months of the closing date of the fiscal year. They are
audited by a private auditor, in addition to the comptroller appointed by
the Government. Auditing procedures, particularly regarding borrowers'
accounts, have met Bank standards.
Statistics and Management Information
4.11     NPA has completely revised its statistical system in light of
recent increases in port traffic. Additional improvements are still
imperative if the management information system is to work adequately.
Main weaknesses include: (a) inter aepartmental circulation of
information; (b) availability at the working level of basic technical



- 13 -
documentation on port operations, economics, and legal aspects; and (c)
*        organization of an adequate record office and documentation center mainly
for civil works, drawings, hydrography and dredging, and statistics.
Data Processing
4.12     In the past, data processing for public entities was closely
controlled by the Government, and NPA's data processing was performed
mainly on the Presidency's computer. The constraints and delays of this
system have become untenable as the volume of NPA's requirements have
increased, and recently the Government has agreed to permit autonomous
public entities to handle their own data processing. NPA is therefore
considering the acquisition of its own data processing system.
E. Staffing and Training
4.13     NPA's present (FY 1982) staff totals 1,152 with 75 at management
level, compared with a total of 837 with 32 at management level during
the appraisal year (FY 1975). The annual growth rate of management level
staff has averaged 12.9% while that of total staff has been only 3.7%.
In particular, there has been an increase in staff in the Directorate of
Workshops and of Civil Works where the workload has not increased
appreciably.
4.14     Following the completion of major civil works under this
project, the need for technical assistance has reduced. Local
technicians appear to be adequate for repair and maintenance work.
4.15     NPA's technical training has improved significantly in the past
three years. Under the Second Port Project, CIDA financed the reorgani-
zation of NPA's internal training system which resulted in the organi-
zation of an adequate locally staffed training unit (with 24 part-time
trainers, a qualified head of the training unit and support staff),
and in the definition of 12 training curricula.
4.16     In addition to this internal training system, NPA makes use of
training abroad for special requirements. Training activities have been
sponsored by CIDA, the World Bank, IPER (Le Havre), NUFIC (Holland), the
Port of Anvers, and organizations such as CEGOS. The managerial capabi-
lities of the staff have appreciably improved as a result.
4.17     NPA has undertaken to prepare a full training plan for all its
work force, with Canadian technical assistance. Recently it prepared a
tentative five-year training plan for training abroad, but the plan seems
ambitious in view of NPA's operational needs, exceeds NPA's financial
capacity (costing each year more than 3% of NPA's operating revenues) and
would require the simultaneous absence of many of NPA's upper-level
managers, thus handicapping NPA's decision-making capabilities. NPA is
revising this plan. The internal training plan is nearly completed, and
is expected to be presented to the Bank for review by December 31, 1982.

V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. General Description
5.01     NPA's responsibilities include provision of navigational aids,
pilotage, operation of a dockyard for repairs of its work boats and other
small craft, maintenance dredging in the port and at the entrance
channel, operation of the new ice plant and refrigerated storage for fish
and shrimp, and maintenance of port infrastructure. General cargo and
Ro/Ro are handled by five 'ndependent stevedoring companies: SOCOPAO,
CANATRANS, SOAM, TRANSCAP and SOCOMAC. In addition to their privately-
owned warehouses, these companies lease sheds and open storage from
NPA. The container terminal is operated by a consortium composed of the
five stevedoring companies. Lopg traffic is handled by two autonomous
companies with their own log-carrying equipment ashore, as well as tugs
and barges.  NPA is a minor shareholder in these two companies.   Alumina
and its products are loaded and unloaded from ships by ALUCAM; cement
clinker, by CINENCAM. Both are partly owned by the state.
5.02     There are no restrictions on night or holiday work, and the port
operates an average of 12 hours per day. The present arrangements for
handling general cargo are reasonably satisfactory; productivity is about
1,000 tons of general cargo per meter of wharf, and five containers per
hook per hour. This is somewhat better than other well-managed West
African ports. Improvements however could be made in maintenance
dredging in the channel and along berths, as well as in buoyage,
pilotage, handling of fruit, and customs clearance procedures (the con-
tainer storage time is about 45 days, due to slow clearing procedures).
B. Actual Performance Compared
with Appraisal Specifications
5.03     Actual operating performance has developed as expected in the
appraisal report, particularly for handling of general cargo. Although
the vast majority of the cargo is still handled by the break bulk or
mixed method (1,355,000 tons as compared with 267,000 tons by full con-
tainer vessels at the container berths and 95,000 tons in the Ro/Ro in
1981--Annex 1, Table 8), the introduction of modern handling methods has
significantly upgraded the overall efficiency of the port. Efficiency
indicators (Table 6) show that overall 640 tons were handled per ship per
day in 1981, compared with 456 in 1976. The hendling rates for both
general cargo and mixed vessels as well as for full container vessels,
improved significantly. An alternative indicator, tons handled per meter
of quay, reflects the same pattern: while the efficiency of handling
break bulk cargo dropped from 953 tons/meter in 1976 to 841 tons/meter in
1981, the average efficiency at the general cargo facilities was 1,110
tons/meter reflecting the clear superiority of the new container and
Ro/Ro methods berths where efficiency was 1,916 tons/meter--twice as high
as for the break bulk cargo berths. Further productivity gains can be
achieved at the container berths, particularly when container cranes are
procured.



- 15 -
5.04     As anticipated at appraisal, goods and containers are being
handled, loaded and unloaded with the vessels' gear and stacking is done
by fork-lift trucks ashore. There is plenty of room in the 22.6 ha con-
tainer stock yard to handle existing traffic according to these methods,
and there is no need as yet to convert to rail-mounted container crane.
Although Ro/Ro traffic has been increasing (95,000 T in 1981 vs. 81,000 T
in 1980, and 87 ships in 1981 against 67 in 1980), the existing stern
ramp Ro/Ro berth will easily be able to handle further increases of Ro/Ro
traffic, and the second Ro/Ro berth could be appropriately modified and
utilized for container traffic.
5.05     As regards the log port, mooring dolphins for log ships have not
yet been constructed; this is the only part of the log handling which has
not been completed. Currently, logs are mainly being loaded from the
water side of the general cargo berths, rather than from mooring dolphins
at the side of the channel as originally planned. The rest of the proce-
dure currently is working smoothly: logs arrive by rail at new sidings
and are stored in the newly reclaimed 20 ha area, the floatable ones are
launched into the basin and the others are loaded on barges. Although
presently, in view of low demand for logs in Europe, the rehabilitated
general cargo berths can accomodate loading of logs from the water side,
in the future, when general cargo berths will have reached their full
capacity, consideration should be given to constructing the planned
mooring dolphins or buoys for loading logs in the ships.
C. Upstream Port Development
5.06     Although fishing has not expanded at the rate anticipated in the
appraisal report, the upstream port is being fairly well utilized. The
Cameroon Navy is using a number of the berths, pending completion of a
new naval basin at the downstream port; the riverside reclaimed areas are
utilized by the Elf Oil company for their supply operations. NPA is
repairing its own dredgers, tugs and launches at the floating docks, and
an increase in repair activity for the national fleet may also occur as
the fleet grows. Meanwhile, altbough fishing landings have stagnated at
the 1978 levels, the ice market, fish market, and cold storage facili-
ties, while being underutilized, are functioning satisfactorily.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
6.01     Since 1976, NPA has followed the financing plan agreed upon
under the second Port Project, which was designed to increase the cash
generated from operations sufficiently to finance its share of the proj-
ect (5%), and to service the debt incurred for the port expansion.
6.02     From 1977 to 1981, cash generated from operations, defined as
operating revenue minus working expenditures, increased satisfactorily
although marginally less than projected at appraisal: it amounted to
CFAF 2,778 billion as compared to an expected CFAF 3,123 billion, an
increase of 27% per annum. The increase in operating revenue was subs-
tantial - 27.7% per annum, 17% more than projected - but working expend-



- 16 -
itures increased similarly - 26% per annum, 31% above projections because
of higher inflation, and of under-estimated expenditures for material and
supplies. This produced a temporary cash shortage, but traffic and cost
projections suggest that this situation will not worsen: the port will
generate by FY1985 about CFAF 7,250 billion in cash, enough to cover
current expenditures, debt service and generate in addition some CFAF 2
billion for capital investment.
6.03     Operating revenue increased from 1976 to 1981 by 239%,
(Table 8). The increase was due in part to a 41.9% growth in traffic and
in part to a 138% upward adjustment in tariffs. Diring appraisal, NPA
had agreed (a) to increase tariffs to achieve the agreed 5% financial
rate of return by FY1981, and (b) to adjust them to reflect the cost of
providing various port services. In line with this policy, NPA imposed a
200% increase on ships and rentals to compensate for the decline or
standstill in the number of ships, despite an increase in tonnage from
2,488,000 tons in 1976 to 3,532,000 tons in 1981. This decline was a
direct result of the increased efficiency of the new port, which resulted
in a 71% increase in ship load and a significant improvement in cargo
handling productivity. Tariffs on other services were adjusted by about
50% only. Still, the total tariff increase has been insufficient to
provide the expected 5% rate of return -- the actual rate of return on
fixed assets is 2.1% only -- and more tariff incrases will be needed in
FY82 TO FY85.
6.04     The annual 26% increase in working expenditures may seem high,
considering that traffic growth has little effect on working expend-
itures. The detailed analysis, however, indicates that most of the
increase was attributable to a 50% per annum increase in consumption and
supplier cost. This was due to the increase in fuel prices, consumption
for the maintenance and operation of the new port -- including permanent
lighting of the storage areas -- and increase in port activity. On the
contrary, the recorded 11% annual increase in general expenses and 16%
annual increase in staff costs indicate that NPA's cost control policy
was reasonable.
6.05     In addition to the cumulative CFAF 9,659 million cash generated
from operations from FY1976 to FY1981, Douala Port received funds from
two other sources: long-term loans over the period totaled CFAF
25,755 million, and subsidies and grants an additional CFAF
8,002 million. Total long-term sources during those years was CFAF
43,416 million (Table 7). Over these same years, NPA's fund applications
included a total of CFAF 41,653 million investment in fixed assets plus
debt servicing costs of CFAF 3,139 million, for a total of CI F 44,792
million. Therefore, CFAF 1,376 million were financed out of short-term
debts, weakening NPA's liquidity situation. This departed significantly
from appraisal projections: total long-term sources of funds had been
projected at CFAF 33,789 million, and applications at CFAF 30,592 million
for the same time span; this should have permitted NPA to strengthen its
working capital and liquidity on its own funds. This departure from
projections was due (i) to the execution of NPA's investment program
ahead of schedule, because of the higher than anticipated traffic



- 17 -
increase; (ii) to the high rate of capital investment financing on NPA's
own funds for the rehabilitation of the old quays; and (iii) to important
works on force account performed for the reclamation of land in the down-
stream port. All these investments were economically justified.
6.06     NPA's liquidity could be improved considerably if billing and
collection procedures were more efficient. The Customs Administration
still handles billing and collecting on merchandise, as it did prior to
creation of NPA, and has fallen well behind in turning over cash receiv-
ables to NPA. Cash reserves of CFAF 1,112 million as of FY1976 (Table 9)
have been used to cover the increasing gap between working capital and
the net current assets excluding cash; as a result the cash situation has
become negative, and a net overdraft of CFAF 291 million was observed in
FY1981. This situation, however, is expected to improve in the near
future, because of the lower level of capital investment in NPA's
investment plan and greater cash generation expected from significant
future traffic increases and tariff adjustments.
VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Traffic
7.01     Total commercial traffic (excluding fishing traffic) through
Douala Port increased from 2.0 million tons in 1975 (appraisal year) to
3.5 million tons in 1981 (Table 10) - an average growth of 10 percent per
year. The downstream project-related traffic (general cargo and logs)
increased in the same years from 1.2 to 2.0 million tons or 8.7 percent
per year.
7.02     The total amount of the project-related traffic coincided
closely with the forecast from 1975-81, although imports exceeded expect-
ations and log exports fell below, as indicated in the following summary
(from Table 10):
Project Related Traffic (1981)
('000 tons)
Percent of
Actual    Forecast   Deviation    Deviation
Project-Related Imports       1,191        850        + 311         + 38%
Project-Related Exports         526        562        -  36         -  6%
(except logs)
Logs                            303        620        - 317         - 51%
Total Project-Related       2,020      2,032        -  42         - 2%
7.03     The traffic forecast for 1982-85 (Annex 1, Table 3) predicts
that by 1985, the projected traffic, close to the maximum capacity of the
existing port, will have been reached--some 3,240 million tons, including
600,000 tons by full container vessels, 240,000 tons Ro/Ro traffic,
438,000 tons of log traffic and 1,962,000 tons of break bulk traffic
(part of which will be containers handled by multi-purpose vessels). The



- 18 -
benefits from traffic increases beyond 1985 were not taken into account,
as they will require additional port capacity.
B. Project Components and Economic Benefits
7.04     Economic benefits were expected to result from three project
components: (i) downstream facilities; (ii) channel dredging; and (iii)
upstream facilities. The details of the analysis are given in Annex 1.
Downstream Facilities
7.05     At appraisal, the economic benefits of the downstream facilities
were expected to result from: (i) avoidance of ship waiting time, and
(ii) avoidance of costs associated with diversion of traffic to other
ports and the construction at Manoka of a log facility. The rate was
calculated at 18%.
7.06     In this report the cost and benefit streams were recalculated on
the assumption that without the project, a lighterage system would have
been constructed in Douala port to accomodate excess traffic. Both the
appraisal and this report assume that full capacity of the old port would
have been reached by 1982, and that benefits of avoiding alternatives
would begin to accrue at that time. The recalculated cost and benefit
streams are detailed in Tables 4 and 5, Annex 1, and indicate an economic
rate of return of 22%. As in the appraisal, this economic rate of return
is underestimated to the extent that it disregards (i) avoidance of cargo
waiting costs, (ii) shortening of ship service time, and (iii)
productivity increases in port operations. Data are still lacking to
provide meaningful statistics on these three benefits.
7.07     The economic rate of return to Cameroon, considering that 90% of
the benefit would accrue to the country, was over 16% in the appraisal.
The remaining 10% of the benefits were considered to accrue to ship
owners. In this report, the rate of return to Cameroon has been recal-
culated, assuming full benefits to Cameroon of avoiding lighterage, and
60% of ship-waiting avoidance benefits. On this basis the rate of return
to Cameroon is estimated at 18%.
Channel Dredging
7.08     The benefits from channel dredging were based in the appraisal
on (a) economies from use of specialized log carriers, (b) reduction of
ship-waiting time, and (c) elimination of suboptimal ship routing. The
corresponding rate of return was 19%, with an 13% ERR for Cameroon. Due
to sluggish log exports, specialized log carriers had not been introduced
as of the writing of this report, and therefore stream (a) was not
included in recalculation of benefits. Appraisal figures were used for
(b) and (c), with a 10% increase reflecting ship cost increases (Annex 1,
Table 6). The economic rate of return has been recalculated at 14%, with
a 10% ERR to the Cameroon. This assumes, as at appraisal, that 75% of
the benefits accrue to Cameroon; actually, ao most of these benefits



- 19 -
relate to chartered vessels, a higher percentage of recapture appears
likely, and the calculated ERR to Cameroon is a conservative estimate.
Upstream Facilities
7.09     The rate of return for the upstream facilities was estimated at
10% in the appraisal and was based on the value added within Cameroon (i)
from substitution of locally caught fish for imports, and (ii) from the
dockyard operation. These benefits have been less than expected, but the
upstream port has been earning revenues from unanticipated sources:
rental of land for oil exploration companies, and rentals of the market-
ing place and refrigerating facilities. These have yielded US$2,150,000
annually. Costs of building the fishing port were 28% higher, however,
than anticipated at appraisal. The economic rate of return has been
recalculated at 9%, similar to appraisal estimate.
Total Project
7.10     The overall economic rate of return of the project is 16% to
Cameroon.  The distribution of costs and the rate of return by r-oject
component is as follows:

7.11     The downstream facilities and the channel dredging continue to
be justified by the economic re-evaluation, while the economic justifi-
cation of the upstream facilities remains marginally acceptable. 
overall rate of return of 16%, however, is satisfactory.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     In the course of the execution of the project, the Bank's
financial involvement dropped from 21% to 9% of the total project,
because (i) none of the increases in total cost (US$120 million to US$145



- 20 -
million) were borne by the Bank, and more important, (ii) half the loan
and credit were sold to Norway (Table 3).
8.02     The Bank's involvement throughout the project was appreciated by
the Government and NPA. The Bank had a major role in technical project
preparation and mobilization of considerable co-financing, and assisted
in setting of targets and defining goals. The Bank has been able to
assist NPA to improve its operations, productivity, organization and
management, as well as its financial performance.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The physical components of the Second Douala Port Project were
successfully completed except for remaining dredging at the outer bar
expected to be completed mid-1983.  Level of workmanship was good, cost
increases were reasonable, and the schedule was adhered to as well as
could be expected.
9.02     The economic rate of return is satisfactory, thanks in
particular to the high return on the downstream facilities.
9.03     Further productivity gains, particularly at the new container
terminal, appear possible.
9.04     NPA's financial performance improved under the project, albeit
not as much as expected. Timely implementation of measures envisaged and
agreed in principle under the proposed Third Port Project would raise
NPA's cash generation to satisfactory levels.
9.05     NPA complied reasonably well -with credit and loan covenants,
except for the submission of a maintenance dredging program which is
still pending.
9.06     The following lessons learned may be of benefit in future
projects in Cameroon:
(a)   The large number of co-financiers in the Second Douala
Port Project caused difficulties in making decisions when
the project had to be modified. Also, dealing with the
many different procurement and disbursement procedures of
various co-donors placed an administrative burden on
NPA. Accordingly in the future, when possible, the number
of co-financiers should be kept to a minimum.
(b)   Delays in Bank disbursements could be reduced if authority
were given to the Resident Representative in Cameroon to
authorize disbursements through telex; thus time necessary
in mailing the official documents to the Bank may be
offset, and delays in Bank disbursement shortened.



- 21 -
(c)   Changing conBultants between project preparation and
project execution, as well as the insufficient technical
expertise of the field supervising staff caused some
difficulties and delays in project execution. In the
future, when possible, changes in consultants should be
avoided and a greater emphasis should be given to the
technical qualifications of the field staff.

ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
1.       This annex deals with the technical aspects of the economic
evaluation, and it includes four parts:
(a)   Part I deals with the downstream facilities;
(b)   Part II discusses channel dredging;
(c)   Part III deals with the upstream facilities; and
(d)   Part IV deals with re-evaluation of the total project.
Part I - Downstream Facilities
2.       To calculate the benefits from avoidan e of ship waiting costs,
the Bank's simulation model (PORTSIM) is used.2ll  The input data is based
on informetion obtained from NPA for the years 1980 and 1981. In
calibration of the model for these years, the results for the runs fit
the actual data well, particularly with respect to berth occupancy and
ship waiting time. The costs of ship delays in port were taken from
"Representative Ship Costs" by A & P Appledore Ltd, August 1980 (Table 1
of this annex). The main results of the simulation runs are given in
Table 2 of this annex.
3.       Actual downstream project-related traffic foe 1^731, as well as
the forecast for the years 1982-1985, is given in Table 3 to this
Annex. The actual quantity in 1981 was already 2,020,000 tons, which
would have caused tremendous waiting costs without the project.
4.       We assumed that without the project, a lighterage system would
be introduced in 1981 to handle the traf ic in excess of 2,020,000 ton.
Using data calculated for another port,'/ the relevant lighterage cost
would be about 20 US$/ton.
5.       A detailed comparison between the costs with and without the
project is shown in Table 4 in this annex. It should be noted that the
benefits calculated are an underestimate, since (i) cargo waiting-time
costs are ignored in the comparison because of lac& of available data;
and (ii) the expected productivity increase due to the project is ignored
and hence ship service time reduction; and no allowance was made for
future productivity improvements with the projects, particulary at the
container terminal, thus limiting the amount of lighterage in the without
case and hence project benefits. The cost and ben%Zit streams of the
downstream project are given in Table 5 in this annex, by which the
economic rate of return is 22%, compared with 18% an the Appraisal.
1/ Since we could not find the detailed Working Papers of the appraisal
economic evaluation, our results can be compared only globally to the
previous ones, and not step by step.

Annex 1
Page 2
If it is assumed that all the benefits accrue to Cameroon, the
rate of return from the downstream facilities to Cameroon equals 22%,
compared with 18% in the Appraisal. However, it is possible that part of
the cost-saving to the shipping companies resulting from avoidance of
ship-waiting time will not be passed on to Cameroon through lower charges
for carrying goods into aud out of Douala or avoided congestion
surcharges. Taking each of two benefit streams discussed above, it is
clear that benefits resulting from avoidance of traffic diversion to the
lighterage system represent economic benefit to Cameroon. This leaves
benefits from avoidance of ship-waiting time.
7.       The extent to which that part of the benefit not directly
extracted is passed on depends upon a number of factors, of which the
most important are: (a) the long-run degree of competition in shipping,
which is partly a function of the importance of cartels; (b) the extent
to which there is cross-subsiziation of shipping charges within a given
shipping route (such as Europe-West Africa), so that goods passing
through high-cost ports (in terms of port chargs and the quality of
service provided) are not subject to proportionately higher charges, and
the stability of the situation; (c) the extent to which benefits
generated will be directly extracted through increases in real port
tariffs; and (d) participation of national flag vessels in the trade.
8.       The rate of return to Cameroon from the downstream port facili-
ties has been estimated at 18%, assuming full benefit from lighterage
system avoidance, 60% of ship-waiting avoidance benefit (100% for
national flag vessels and 50% for foreign flag vessels) and ignoring that
a greater share could be recaptured through real increases in port
tariffs. This seems to be a minimum estimate and compares with 16% at
Appraisal.
Part II - Channel Dredging
9.       The project included dredging the Wouri Channel to 7.5 m below
low water datum. The objective was to reduce costs associated with:
(a)   the necessity either to wait for high tides to enter or
exit from the port, or in the case of large vessels, to
enter or exit with cargo volumes constrained by available
water depth.
(b)   the existing sub-optimal routing of deeper drafted
shipping on West African routes, necessitated by draft
limitations in Douala.
(c)   the inability of bulk log carriers to use the port at the
previous channel depth.
10.      The expectations with respect to (a) and (b) have been fulfil-
led, but firm quantitative figures could not be obtained in Douala.
Therefore, the benefits in the Appraisal, which seem to reflect the



- 34 -
Annex I
Page 3
current situation, are used in this report after being raised by about
10% because of ship cost increase.1/
11.      The log export has not been converted to specialized log car-
riers, and because of the stagnation in log exports and the organization
of the log trade in Cameroon there is no certainty that such carriers
will be introduced in a significant scale in the foreseeable future.
Therefore, these benefits were ignored.
12.      The stream of costs and benefits is given in Table 6 in this
annex. The economic rate of return is about 14%, compared with 19% in
the appraisal report. The discrepancy between the two rates is particu-
larly due to the avoidance of benefits from use of specialized log
carriers in our analysis.  The rate of return to Cameroon, assuming that
80% of ship benefits accrue to Cameroon, amounts to 10%, compared with
13% in the Appraisal.
Part III - Upstream Facilities
13.      This part of the project includes the fishing port and the re-
pair facilities.
14.      At appraisal time, the view of NPA and the consultants was that
maintenance of even the existing facilities would be very difficult, and
the congestion could have a significant effect on the efficiency of fish-
ing port operations.
15.      In the appraisal report the benefits from the improved fishing
port facilities have been measured in terms of value added within
Cameroon by the local supply of fish versus importation of fish. As
shown in Table 4 in Annex 8 of the appraisal report the value added-sup-
posed to grow from CFAF 120 million in 1978 to 310 million in 1981 and to
435 million in 1985. Actually, the local fishing growth has been less
than expected in the Appraisal, as can be shown by the following statis-
tics of the fishing traffic expressed in index numbers (1975=100,:
1975      1976      1977       1978      1979     1980
Forecast             100       102        102       105       116       i26
Actual               100        114       117       115        107      12;)
1/ See Annex 1, Table 1.
2/  Since we do not have updated data on fishing tonnage, the number of
boats has been taken for calculation of the index of actual fishing. The
number of boats from 1975 to 1980, respectively, were: 835, 955, 973,
962, 891, and 1,001. For ealculation of the forecast index, the total
tonnage of commercial fishing landings from Table 5, page 3 in the
Appraisal is used.



- 35 -
Annex 1
Page 4
As can be observed from the indices, the actual fishing growth was
greater than forecast until 1978, and then became almost stagnant until
1980. The actual index in 1980 (120) is just 5% less than the forecast
(126). Therefore, we assume that 95% of the expected benefit from local
fishing will also take place in the coming years.
16.      Benefits stemming from improvement of the fishing port effi-
ciency (and not included in the Appraisal) are partially represented by
the revenues of NPA from renting the new facilities in the fishing port
since 1981 (marketing place and refrigerating facility) which is about
CFAF 400 million (about US$1.33 million according to the current rate of
exchange). The benefits by reducing the congestion of the boats are not
reflected by this amount. Another benefit not considered in the ap-
praisal is the use of land in the fishing port by oil research compa-
nies. The annual rentals, which are taken as an approximate for the
benefit, are CFAF 250 million (approximately US$830,000) since FY 1981.
This benefit could not have been obtained without the project.
17.      The project workshop/repair facilities comprise a building for
repairs, the necessary machinery, and a 500 ton floating dock. The bene-
fits attributable depend upon the increment in local value added gene-
rated by repair operations. Actually, this part of the project did not
yield any significant benefit, and it is ignored in our calculation of
the rate of return.
18.      The resulting stream of costs and benfits is shown in Table 7 in
this annex. The investment data are taken from Table 5 in this annex.
The economic rate of return is about 9%, compared with 10% of the
Appraisal.
Part IV - Economic Re-evaluation
of the Whole Project
19.      It has been shown above that the components of the Project yield
the following rates of return:
Economic Rate

Total                   19%       16%        17%      14%
As mentioned in para. 8 above, this is a minimum estimate.

Third Douala Port Project, January 29, 1982, Annex 4, Table 6.1 (by subtracting the cargoes mentioned
in footnote I above). The forecast for 1982 is smoothed by taking the arithmetic average between the
of 1981 (which was a depressed year) and 1983.
3/ Taking into account the log handled along breakbulk berths, the present capacity will be fully
utilized in 1984.  See Footnote 1 in Table 2 of this Annex.
4/ The reason for loading logs onto ships alongside the breakbulk cargo is because it will be
transported by general cargo ships, and its handling will be partially parallel to handling other
cargoes on these ships. The quantities are calculated according to forecasts from the Third Douala
Port Project Yellow Cover :.ppraisal Report, March 5, 1982, Annex 4, Table 6.1.
5/ Capacity limitations. For container berth - see footnote 1 in Table 2 in this annex.

1/ For 1981, in which all the cargoes will be served along the berths, the simulation data (extrapolated by regression) are used.
For other years, the data are calculated according to the cost of the alternative lighterage system (20 USS/ton).
2/ Part of log exports is included in the general cargo (see Table I of this annex). To calculate the ship-waiting cost of the
breakbulk cargo, 15/16 of the quantity of cargo was taken, assuming that 1/16 will be handled on the container and Ro/Ro berths (see
footnote 1 in Table 2 of this annex).
3/ The ship-waiting cost for ships along the dolphins is taken as being about 70% of the ship-waiting cost of the Ro/Ro ships,
considering the similar quantities and the lower ship-day cost.

I/ We assume that the project makes it possible to handle the following
quantities: General break-bulk cargo - 1,970,000 tons including semi-
container vessels (as explained below); containers - 600,000 tons; Ro/Ro
- 240,000 tons; total general cargo - 2,840,000 tons; logs - all the
forecasted quantities. Therefore, taking into account that part of the
logs should be handled with the breakbulk cargoes (see Table 1 in this
annex), the capacity will sufflce with this forecast until 1984 (for
which the forecast traffic, except logs, is 2,785,000 tons). These
figures are based on the results of the simulation runs, shown in Table 3
of this annex. Since the rate of utilization of the container berth by
full container ships is 65% when 600,000 tons of containerized cargo is
handlee per year, multi-purpose ships can use these berths (with lower
priority) during the time they are not used. Assuming that the total
rate of utilization of these berths will be 85%, an additional 100 m
((0.85 - 0.65) x 500 a - 100 a) can be taken, an increase of 1/15 to the
capacity of break-bulk cargo handling. It is assumed that, with the
project, the capacity for break-bulk cargo is about 1,900,000 tons. With
the logs handled along the breakbulk berths (Table 1 in this amnex), this
capacity will be fully utilized in 1984.
