MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERFATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TC THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR SHE FORESTS MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Madagascar for SDR 5.1 million (USS 7.0 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance a Forests Management and Protection
Project. The project would be co-financed by a grant from the Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) for US$ 6.5 million and by a grant from the
Norwegian Ministry of Development Cooperation (NMDC) for US$ 2.0 million.
The Swiss and the Norwegian grants would be administered by the
Association.
2.       Background.  With a population of ten million inhabitants and a
per-capita income of US$ 265 in 1986, Msdagascar is one of the poorest
countries in the world. In the 1975-78 and 1984-86 periods, economic
growth remained below population growth, and between 1979 and 1983,
agriculture production stAgnated. Forests in Madagascar are of particular
environmental and economic significa-ce due to their high level of
biological diversity, their watershed protection function in a country
highly susceptible to erosion, and their supply of fuelwood and
construction materials. The uniqueness of the forest combined with the
high rate of deforestation has brought the attention of the Government of
Madagascar and the international community to the need for urgent action to
improve the management of wood resources and forest production.
3.       Since 1974, the Bank group financed in the forestry sector of
Madagascar two projects on an industrial pine plantation (Mangoro
plantation run by the Fanalamanga parastatal corporation) for producing
woodpulp. The export market for wood pulp did not materialize and pine
trees did not grow as expected. In addition, it became apparent that the
two projects did not address major issues that Madagascar faces: (a)
difficulties within the Forestry Department (FD) in dealing with forest
management (exploitation control and inventory), nature conservation
(protection of forest reserves and soil conservation) and reforestation;
(b) difficulties in preventing the urban and rural populations from
destroying forests for energy (charcoal) and (c) difficulties in attracting
the private sector in replanting and ir exploiting rationally forest
products (sawlogs).
4.       The proposed project is the outcome of an ongoing dialogue between
the Government and the Association on forestry sector strategy. Based on
two Association-FAO/CP missions, it was agreed that a forestry sector
approach would be more appropriate than the originally restricted
industrial plantation focus. During the pre-appraisal mission, the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources
(IUCN) and the World Wildlife Fund International contributed to the
preparation of the natural forest protection component. The project was
appraised in June 1987.



-2-
C.        Present obiectives:  In order to address the priority issues
facing the forestry sector in Madagascar, project objectives are to: (i)
strengthen the FD capacity to plan and manage the sector and focus its
activities on priority programs; (ii) prevent further degradation of
protected natural forests; (iii) stimulate private reforestation by rural
and urban populations; and (iv) assist Fanalamanga in att. acting private
investment for wood-processing activities once the plantatl3n reaches the
production stage.
6.       Prolect Description.  The proposed Project includes thxee
components: (i) DEF (Direction des Eaux et Forits) reinforcement
including (a) institutional strengthening activities focused on sector
planning and monitoring, financial management and human resource
development; (b) support to priority FD programs in forest management,
private reforestation promotion, and seed supply; and (c) support to
applied research; (ii) a natural forest protection component containing in
the first phase (3 years), pilot actions in two representative forest
reserves, the creation of a new National Park, and training leading to
program implementation during the second phase; and (4ii) reorientation of
Mangoro plantation to limit its activities to a sylvicultural program
oriented toward charcoal and sawlog production in the best performing
areas.   Project execution responsibility would rest with Fanalamanga for
;1angoro plantation activities and with the FD for all FD activities and for
the natural forest conservation program. The project, to be excuted over a
period of 7 years, provides funds for civil works; vehicles, furniture and
equipment; training; technical assistance; and incremental operating costs.
The total cost of the project is estimated at USS 22.6 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 14.2 million (63%). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, end the disbursement schedule
are shown irn Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Madagascar are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A mnap is attached (IBRD t 20657). The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6994 MAG, dated December 1987, is also attached.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  In line with the on-going dialogue
with the Association (para. 4), the Government has responded by elaborating
a Forestry Sector Development Stracegy and a National Conservation
Strategy. These strategies, although appropriate, have not yet been
translated into operational plans reflecting a clear sense of priority
within available resources and institutional capabilities. The project
will assist the FD in elaborating balanced plans and in strengthening
managerial capabilities. The project has been designed with the
expectation of having a synergistic effect with two other Association
projects: Energy I (fuelwood production and training for charcoal
manufacturer) and the Second Agricultural Institution Project (management
strengthening in sector policy in particular, and institution development,
in general). The project also responds to the Bank Group commitment to
assist Sub-sahara African countr'es in dealing with deforestation, fuelw-od
supply and conservation issues.



-3-
8.       Agreed actions.  The following agreements were resched during
negotiations: (i) FD staff redeployment plan for project activities
including timetable and staff selection procedures; (ii) IDA review of
annual work programs of PD and Fanalamanga; (iii) annual IDA review of a
rolling, three-year sector Public Expenditure Program starting with the
1989-1991 cycle and review before initiation of each new forestry project
above US$1 million; (iv) measures to increase stumpage fee and improve
collection; (v) change of the seed supply policy and applied research
program; and (vi) establishment of a new National Park (Andasibe) and
undertaking of a mid-term review for the Natural Forest Protection
component and for the AIVF (Integrated Forest Valley Development) program.
The Association received a policy statement for Fanalamanga defining its
development strategy. Under this statement, Fanalamanga could invest,
without Government funds, in semi-industrial operations, in competition
with other private entrepreneurs. A covenant, in the Credit Agreement
stipulates that, prior to initiation, the Government will furnish to the
Association for approval each new forestry project having a cost in excess
of $3 million. Fanalamanga will (a) create a marketing service to p.omote
its products to private entrepreneurs for processing, and (b) reduce its
personnel by one third by the end of 1988. The Government has agreed to
convert to equity its long term debt due by Fanalamanga. A cross-effective
agreement between IDA credit and Swiss and Norwegian Grants will be a
condition of effectiveness.
9.       Benefits.  The benefits of this project would include:  (i) long-
term impacts of effective forestry management on agricultural and forest
productivity, (such as lower erosion, higher yields) and on biological
diversity; (ii) increased economic returrs to rural and urban population
from reforestation and soil conservation activities; and (iii) increased
domestic market supply for charcoal and sawlog from Mangoro plantation.
10.      Risks.  The following factors could affect project results:  (i)
insufficient enforcement related to forest management activities would
depress wood-product prices; (ii) FD personnel instability or failure to
renew staff and focus on priority areas could undermine institutional
development results; and (iii) inadequate management of sector/project
activities at senior levels. Project emphasis on annually agreed work
programs, on task and geographical selectivity, and on human resource
development (training) aim at reducing these risks.
11.      Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
