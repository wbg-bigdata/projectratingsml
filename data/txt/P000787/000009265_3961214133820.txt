ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Loan 3046-GA
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Road Maintenance Project in
Gabon, for which Loan 3046-GA in the amount of US$30.0 million equivalent was approved on
July 10, 1989 and made effective on October 5, 1989.
The Loan 3046-GA was closed on June 30, 1995, following a second extension of the
original closing date of December 31, 1993. The last disbursement took place on November 8,
1995. A balance of US$462,351 was cancelled on January 5, 1996. Cofinancing for the project
was provided by AfDB and Government sources.
Tle ICR was prepared by Messrs. Kyriakos and Gerard Tenaille, consultants, under the
responsibility of the Infrastructure Division, Central Africa and Indian Ocean Departnent. It is
based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement and additional clauses to the Agreement
and material in the project file. The Borrower did not provide an evaluation report or summary,
but provided comments which are included in Part I of this ICR.

GABONESE REPUBLIC
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
LOAN 3046-GA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank had not been involved in the transport sector since 1975, when the Second
Highway Project was completed. The First Highway Project (Loan 385-GA, US$12.0 million,
1964) was for the reconstruction of three road sections, and the Second Highway Project
(Loan 580-GA, US$6.0 million, 1969) for the reconstruction of another two road sections. Then,
over several decades, large investments were made in the railway and civil aviation sub-sectors, and
roads were neglected. As a result, the road network deteriorated so severely that its condition becamne a
mnajor bottleneck to the country's economy. In 1988, the Governnent decided, with the help of the
World Bank and the African Development Bank, to upgrade its road system through improved
maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing road network (para. 1).
Project Objectives
2.     The main objectives of the project were to: (a) preserve the Government's investment in the
road network and extend its useful life; (b) optimize the Government's limited resources available
for road maintenance; (c) maintain vehicle operating costs at a reasonable and stable level; (d)
improve access to productive agricultural and forestry areas; (e) develop a national capacity to
plan, manage and supervise road maintenance and rehabilitation, gradually taking over in-line
positions held by foreign experts; and (f) initiate changes in policies regarding road maintenance
organization and methods of execution (para.2).
3.     These objectives, although very clear, proved unreasonable. Given the lack of competent,
trained people to be assigned to the project, it was unwise to execute two-thirds of the road
maintenance program by force account (US$58.4 million). On the whole, these objectives were very
demanding both institutionally and financially for the Borrower, which had to finance US$77.4 million
of the project cost, including taxes, when at appraisal its share was estimated at 44.5 percent, i.e.
US$48.9 million (para.3).
Implementation Experience and Results
4.     The project was carried out primarily through massive technical assistance: eighteen technical
assistant expatriates, 12 financed by the Bank loan, for a cost of US$10 million, plus six financed by
French Cooperation, and it had no impact, from a long-term perspective, on institutional development
(para.6).
5.     The physical objectives were substantially achieved. Transport conditions were significantly
enhanced. The length of roads actually maintained was virtually the same as envisaged at appraisal. For



(iii)
bridge repairs, only 16 out of a total of 29 bridges were repaired. The road network was extended from
7,200 km to 7,600 km and traffic conditions improved significantly (para.23). The top management of
the General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP) was competent and committed to reform. This
made the introduction of a set of reforms proposed by the technical assistance team possible.
Reforms included the introduction of rigorous road maintenance planning (para. 10).
6.     On the other hand, two major measures were deferred until the end of the project but never
implemented: the institutional reforms of the Directorate for Road and Airport Maintenance
(DERA) and of the Directorate of Equipment (DOM). From the beginning of the project, the
reforms were subject to endless studies, discussions, repeated reminders from Bank supervision
missions, and postponement of scheduled dates for official decisions. The real issue at stake was
that their effective implementation required unpopular and courageous decisions to carry out
massive lay-offs in the midst of a particularly difficult economic situation (para.8).
7.     The training program was moderately successful. The final objective, however, could not
be achieved because the implementation period was too short and did not allow for a gradual
transfer of in-line positions from foreign technical assistants to competent and trained nationals
(paras. 16-17).
8.     The Government fulfilled its commitment to secure local funding required for project
completion, even exceeding its anticipated portion by 58 percent. However, delays in the release of
budget and local fund disbursements resulted in untimely payment of suppliers which adversely affected
performance. The cost accounting system was poor, and did not ensure proper pricing for works
executed by force account (para. 19).
9.     At appraisal in 1989, the project cost was estimated at CFAF 34 billion, all taxes included
(US$110 million). During the project life, several factors caused the project cost to increase to
CFAF 37.8 billion (US$122.3 million): (a) additional purchase of road construction equipment; (b)
further road deterioration between the appraisal date in July 1988 and the project execution starting date
in April 1991; (c) underestimation of unit cost and physical quantities at appraisal; and (d) additional
supervision of works required for contracted-out maintenance program. In addition, due to the
extension of the implementation period, the cost of the technical assistance also increased from
US$6.5 to US$12.0 million. By the end of 1993, total actual project costs amounted to CFAF 47.5
billion all taxes included (para.21).
10.    Project implementation was completed at the end of 1994, with a one-year delay, because
the construction schedule estimated at appraisal was not realistic. The closing date was extended
by one year to allow completion of the project, and another extension was granted to June 30,
1995, in order to finance some institutional studies for the road sector reorganization.
11.    On the whole, the Bank's performance was not satisfactory: (a) the preparation team
accepted the program prepared by a consulting firm on behalf of the Government in November 1987 and
did not object to the huge volume of maintenance works to be carried out by force account; (b) the pre-
appraisal mission, in April 1988, was devoted to discussions to reduce the project scope and costs; (c)
the appraisal mission which took place in July 1988 did not devote enough time and expertise for proper
evaluation of the project, despite the importance of the technical and financial implications of the force
account works, the risk linked to total reliance on expatriate technical assistance for its implementation,
and the complex nature of the institutional reforn program proposed; (d) Bank supervision of physical
implementation in particular was insufficient: only one field visit was carried out, almost at project



(iv)
completion, by the task manager who was himself not an engineer; and (e) Bank reporting on the project
was generally insufficient (paras.27-30).
12.    The Borrower's performance was mixed: satisfactory for the preparation of the project, but
unsatisfactory for its implementation and completion. On financial aspects, the Goverment exceeded its
commitment to secure local funding required for project completion. However, delays in the release of
budget and local fund disbursements resulted in untimely payment of suppliers and additional costs
which adversely affected project performance. The institutional reforms proved difficult to implement
The Government never made a decision on the reform of DERA and DOM, which the Bank insisted on
for years. The physical components of the project were implemented reasonably well, but this is due to
the technical assistance more than to the local staff, who were appointed late or not at all (paras.32-34).
13.   In conclusion, the outcome of the project has been unsatisfactory (para.35) and its
sustainability uncertain (para.26).
Conclusions, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
14.    The main lessons are that: (a) the force account has proven an ineffective and inappropriate
method of road maintenance, as has already been demonstrated in other similar countries; (b) the
Department of Equipment (DOM) is a heavy financial burden impeding any attempt at improvement;
and (c) traiing should be viewed within the broader perspective of a long-term human resource
development strategy. All these will require commitment to and continuity in a necessary reform process
from the Government, road organization and donors (para.4 1).
15.    For future operations, all mechanized works should be executed by private contractors,
and the existing fleet of public works equipment should be sold to private firms. A Road Network
Improvement Project (PARR), financed by many extemal donors, is under implementation, but
these important investments should be selective and aim at transport rather than infrastructure
needs. Overall, a transport project should assist the Government in resolving the institutional issues
which were neglected under the Road Maintenance Project (Ln. 3046-GA), specifically the increased
participation of the private sector in road maintenance and the establishment of financial mechanisms for
road capital preservation.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
GABONESE REPUBLIC
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
LOAN 3046-GA
PART I: PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
Background
1.     The Road Maintenance Project came more than ten years after the previous Bank
support to Gabon in the road sub-sector, and was the Bank's first involvement in road
maintenance in this country. It was viewed as a complement to the other SAL measures
(Loan 2933-GA, approved on April 21, 1988) aimed at restructuring the five main transport
parastatals and correcting the investment imbalances in the various transportation modes. Over
several decades, large investments had been made in the railway and civil aviation sub-sectors,
and roads had been neglected. As a result, the road network deteriorated so severely that its
condition became a mnajor bottleneck to the country's economy. In 1988, the Government
decided, with the help of the World Bank and the African Development Bank, to upgrade its road
system through improved maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing road network.
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Project Objectives
2.     According to the SAR, the objectives of the project were to: (a) preserve Govemment's
investment in the road network and extend its useful life; (b) optimize the Governmment's limited
resources available for road maintenance; (c) maintain vehicle operating costs at a reasonable and
stable level; (d) improve access to productive agricultural and forestry areas; (e) develop a
national capacity to plan, manage and supervise road maintenance and rehabilitation, gradually
taking over in-line positions held by foreign experts; and (f) initiate changes in policies regarding
road maintenance organization and methods of execution.
3.     These objectives, although clear, proved unreasonable. The project design did not fit
these objectives. The four-year period allocated for implementation was too short and unmealistic.
Given the lack of competent and trained people in the road sector, it was unwise to execute
two-thirds of the road maintenance by force account (US$58.4 million). At the time of appraisal,
this was justified by the obligation to use existing equipment but, as soon as the project started, a
large part of this equipment was found to be beyond repair and most of it had to be replaced.
Moreover, force account did not conform to the SAL's objectives to enhance private sector
development. On the whole, these objectives were very demanding, both institutionally and
financially for the Borrower, which had to finance US$77.4 million of the project cost, including
taxes, when at appraisal its share was estimated at 44.5 percent, i.e. US$48.9 million.

Project Description
4.     The project components were:
(a)    The carrying out, by contract, of a three-year programn of road mnaintenane
comprising: (i) routine maintenance on about 460 kan of priority paved roads; (b)
improved maintenance of some 1,300 km of unpaved roads; and (c) urgent repairs
on 29 steel bridges;
(b)    The carrying out, by force account, of routine maintenance on some 5,200 kmn of
unpaved roads for the first two years. The third year, this capacity was to expand
to cover the earth roads under the responsibility of MTPECAT (some 6,500 kIn);
(c)    Training of road maintenance staff,
(d)    Institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works, Equipment,
Construction and Territorial Development (MTPECAT), with the help of technical
assistance (18 experts over 2 years, later extended to 3.5 years); and
(e)    The carrying out of technical and economic studies for the development of the road
sector.
5.     The main risks were expressed in the SAR: first, the possibility of not achieving all the
institutional objectives, including performance targets for force account works; second, insufficient
level of funding or untimely release of local funds; and third, local pressure to do works not in the
program. Only the third risk did not materialize.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.     The main institutional objective was to develop an indigenous capacity to plan, manage and
supervise road maintenance and rehabilitation, gradually taking over in-line positions now held by
foreigners. This objective was not met, for several reasons:
(a)    Even though the technical assistance under the project was massive: 18 TA
expatriates, 12 financed by the Bank loan, for a cost of US$10 million, plus six
financed by the French Cooperation, it had no impact, from a long-term
perspective, on institutional development, because the work was mainly done by the
expatriates, not by their Gabonese counterparts. From the short-term perspective of
an emergency program, technical assistance was well conceived, as it penritted to
build up, out of a precarious situation and in a very short period of time, a capable
field maintenance capacity that could implement satisfactorily a considerable
number of maintenance works.
(b)    Some counterparts were appointed late in the project life and others were not
appointed at all. For example, the counterpart to the cost accounting specialist was
appointed in February 1993, and no counterpart was assigned to the Training Unit.



3
(c)    The ability to transfer skills to local staff varied widely amnong expatriates, and
many trainees lacked the minimum required qualifications for the job.
(d)    The three-year duration of the training program was too short, considering the
weaknesses of some of the nationals to be trained. For these reasons, the Borrower
requested the Bank to extend the technical assistance contract by one year. The
Bank approved the request in part for key expatriates.
7.     In conclusion, technical assistance would still be badly needed if road maintenance continued
to be made by force account, which is the main sector issue. It would be much easier and cost-
effective to maintain the road network by contract with private companies. Technical assistance
could be reduced to a minimum level, as could the need for competent national staff in the public
service.
8.     An Action Plan was annexed to the SAR as Annexes 4-14 and to the Loan Agreement as
Schedule 5. It included institutional, functional and operational measures necessary for project
implementation. This Action Plan did not achieve most of its objectives. Two major measures were
deferred until the end of the project: the institutional reformns of the Directorate for Road and Airport
Maintenance (DERA) and of the Directorate of Equipment (DOM). Since the beginning of the
project, these reforms were subject to endless studies, discussions, repeated reminders from Bank
supervision missions, and postponement of scheduled dates for official decisions. The real issue at
stake was that their effective implernentation required unpopular and courageous decisions to cariy
out massive lay-offs in the midst of a particularly difficult economic situation.
Directorate for Road and Airport Maintenance (DERA)
9.     The DERA regional organization has a vertical structure with separate autonomous
subdivisions and specialized maintenance task brigades within each subdivision. This vertical
structure creates rigidity, which leads to two main issues. The first, equipment breakdown in the
field, is common, resulting in an interruption of activity for the entire brigade. Shortages of spare
parts, lengthy procurement processes, and aging fleets cause work interruptions which might last
months. Due to the rigidity and mismanagement of the present organization, there is no flexibility for
borrowing equipment from other brigades, renting equipment, or making changes in schedule, in
order to keep working and maintain an acceptable rate of productivity. The second type of issue
relates to the fact that each regional directorate and each of its subdivisions have their own
equipment, workshop, and spare parts stock. In many cases, a costly redundancy results. Judicious
grouping, better coordination, real management of the equipment pool and maintenance, and better
work planning and execution could introduce significant benefits.
General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP)
10.    The top management of the General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP) was competent
and committed to reform. This made the introduction of a set of reforms proposed by the technical
assistance team possible. The most prominent project achievement was the setting up of a rigorous
road maintenance planning, controlling and monitoring system which involves the following elements:
(a)    Assessment, by the subdivision engineer, of road conditions, based on a visual
inspection. The purpose of the assessment is to verify empirical rules of the Road



4
Research Center of Gabon, which relates roughness to traffic and type of soi,
which serves as a basis for programming;
(b)    Assessment of maintenance needs based on the findings of the previous step and a
catalogue of the 12 standardized types of maintenance works;
(c)    Setting performance standards in light of previous years' actual performance;
(d)    Preparation of annual work load and budget program by each directorate from the
data collected, performance standards, and a set of service levels. Regional budget
requests are summed up and presented to the Government. If fewer funds than
requested are allocated, adjustments are made by reducing the level of maintenance
service; and
(e)    Monitoring of work progress through performance reports submitted weekly and
monthly. In addition, the regional offices and headquarters hold monthly meetings
to evaluate the performance for the month. Any major difference is accounted for.
The system has instilled a sense of accountability and competition, as the
comparison of work performance is discussed openly among the staff of the
regional directorates.
11.    This system could prove to be an effective and efficient tool if the following weaknesses
were addressed:
(a)    Annual planning based on rolling pluri-annual programming would be a better
methodology, more consistent with useful road life. Setting up this methodology is
envisaged under a consultancy study. However, the provision of updated and
reliable data on road and structure conditions, traffic, and construction and
maintenance costs will be essential to the implementation of this useful tool;
(b)   Two parallel General Directorates from MTPECAT: DGTP and the General
Directorate of Studies and Programmation (DGEP) are both involved in planning.
It should be envisaged that the DGEP becomes an entity within DGTP, since the
current structure does not allow for close coordination between the two
Directorates.
12.    On the performance side, DGTP still suffers from major technical weaknesses:
(a)    The project has put emphasis on quantity, i.e. the average daily output, rather than
on the quality of works;
(b)    The assessment of quality is not based on conformity to defined specifications, but
on the subjective appreciation of the subdivision engineer;
(c)    Due to the force account nature of its operations, cost is a secondary element and
not of particular concem for DERA management;
(d)    Road linear diagrams do exist, but they are not updated and do not report
maintenance operations that have been executed.



5
13.    A Computerized Road Data Bank, a costly and sophisticated system, has been put in place,
but is not yet operational because of the lack of trained technicians and shortage of engineers capable
of using it.
Directorate of Equipment (DOM)
14.    Great weaknesses within the DOM  remain, constituting a heavy burden that could
jeopardize project sustainability. During the project, a great effort was made in terms of acquisition
of equipment (CFAF 10.5 billion, or US$35 million), purchase of tools and spare parts, workshop
and building improvements, as well as in setting up procedures and written instructions for preventive
maintenance, inspection, repair monitoring, etc. But there are still a lot of shortcomings:
(a)    Equipment: The current equipment fleet includes about 583 serviceable units, with
a replacement value of CFAF 20 billion (US$40 million). No renewal policy has
been set up and implemented even though it would be necessary to rnew about
CFAF 2.5 billion of equipment (US$5.0 million) on a yearly basis. In a few years,
this could become critical, resulting in a costly increase for repairs and spare parts,
and consequently in more frequent breakdowns and work interruptions. In any case,
difficult and costly decisions have to be taken, as no provisions have been made in
the budget for such purposes; and
(b)    Maintenance: Equipment maintenance has not really improved. Since equipment
was new, road work maintenance was not gready affected. Regional workshops
have not been strengthened enough to provide human skills, organization, space
management and spare parts supply compatible with the fleet maintenance needs.
15.    A Bank-financed study has been carried out under the project to review the possibility of
contracting out operation and maintenance of the equipment to a private company with the Ministry
remaining the owner of the equipment. Although this proposal would partly solve the problem,
another, more definite solution would entail selling this equipment by auction to various contractors.
Training
16.    The various operations to be undertaken under the project comprised:
(a)    Training of the existing personnel for the nmchanized crews constituted under the
program (34 crews);
(b)    Basic training of personnel to be hired to constitute these crews;
(c)    Individual training courses abroad for 18 professionals, and study trips; and
(d)    Specific training seminars for the supervisory staff ofthe regional and local units.
17.    This training program  was moderately successful.  Two hundred and eighty-eight
individuals were trained compared to the 426 envisaged at appraisal. These included remmen, gang
leaders, operators, drivers, chief mechanics, and mechanics. In addition, about seven counterpart



6
employees were trained on the job by the expatriate technical assistants. The average training
duration was 15 months, which is a bit too short to ensure a gradual taking-over of line positions.
18.   In conclusion, the institutional development objectives of the project were partly reached.
The amount of work carried out by force account was far too large. The Ministry did not have
enough competent staff to do the job. Private contractors were not given the opportunity to bid for
works. The component required massive technical assistance which executed the project almost
entirely on its own. A large fleet of equipment was acquired under the project, but is poorly
maintained. The best solution would be to scale down this force account operation and eventually
dissolve the operation by contracting out to the private sector the road maintenance works, and selling
the equipment.
FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS
19.    The Government fulfilled its commitment to secure the local funding required for project
completion, even exceeding its anticipated portion by 58 percent. Disbursements of external funds
were satisfactory, under the control of a special unit, assisted by the technical assistance team.
Budgeting and disbursement procedures improved (for external financing only). However, delays in
release of budget and local fund disbursements resulted in untimely payment to suppliers and
adversely affected performance. The cost accounting system was poor, and did not ensure proper
pricing for works executed by force account.
20.    The establishment of a Road Fund was envisaged to secure sustained conditions for a steady
local funding of road maintenance. A detailed study was carried out at the end of the project, with
Bank financing which provided the various elements to set up the Road Fund.
21.    Project cost was estimated, at appraisal in 1989, at CFAF34 billion, all taxes included
(US$110 million). During the project's life, several factors caused an increase in the project cost to
CFAF 37.8 billion (US$122.3 million): (a) additional purchase of road construction equipment; (b)
further road deterioration between the appraisal date in July 1988 and the project execution starting
date in April 1991; (c) underestimate of unit cost and physical quantities at appraisal; and (d)
additional supervision of works required for the contracted-out maintenance program. By the end of
1993, total actual project costs amounted to CFAF 47.5 billion, all taxes included. Major reasons for
the CFAF 10 billion overrun are: (a) CFAF 4.4 billion for replacetnent of existing equipment; (b)
CFAF 5.0 billion for financing unplanned emergency works; (c) CFAF 0.8 billion for studies,
training, and technical assistance for 1993.
22.    In conclusion, the main cause of the big increase in project cost is the execution of road
maintenance by force account. The cost of the technical assistance required by these force account
operations increased from US$6.5 million to US$12.0 million (representing up to 40 percent of the
IBRD Loan). The equipment purchase increased from US$23 million to US$38 million (although
only US$7 million were disbursed from the loan, representing 23 percent of the IBRD Loan).

PHYSICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
23.    Transport conditions were significantly enhanced. The length of roads actually mnaintained
was virtually the same as envisaged at appraisal. For bridge repairs, only 16 out of a total of 29
bridges were repaired. The road network was extended from 7,200 km to 7,600 km and traffic
conditions improved significantly. Therefore, the physical objectives were substantially achieved.
Economic Evaluation
24.    In 1988, an economic evaluation study was entrusted by the Government to a consultant, in
view of soliciting Bank financing. The study was carried out on the basis of updated road conditions
and traffic data obtained from surveys conducted by the Ministry, the Road Research Center (CG2R)
and the National Laboratory (LBTPG). For contracted-out maintenance works, the study showed for
earth roads an average rate of retum of about 100 percent, ranging from 14 percent to over 200
percent and, for paved roads, an average rate of retum of 26 percent, ranging from 12 percent to over
60 percent. For force account works, the study showed a rate of return of 43 percent, for an assumed
5.610 km network, incorporating the costs of equipment purchases, technical assistance and training.
Economic justification of the project after completion is difficult, because of the absence of (a)
reliable data, and (b) a cost accounting system providing proper maintenance unit costs.
Nevertheless, in 1993, DGTP issued a traffic count report which showed erratic figures and presented
the economic evaluation of the forecasted 1994 road maintenance program. The economic indicator
used to justify the program was the ratio vehicle operating benefits (B) over costs of the works (C).
The results show that the average ratio (B/C) is 9 for unpaved roads, and that for at least 90 percent
of the road network this ratio is over 1. This report concludes that the program was considered
economically viable.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
25.    The major factors affecting the project were: (a) the budget situation, difficult from project
inception, did not allow timely allocation of funding, which resulted in delays in disbursement of local
funds, late delivery of spare parts, and late payments to suppliers; and (b) insufficiently trained
national staff. As a result, the maintenance work program slowed.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
26.    The project's fundamental aim to put in place sustainable mechanisms for financing and
mnanaging road maintenance was partially achieved. The public finance situation, aggravated because
of the 50 percent devaluation of the CFAF, left the country unable to provide enough funds for the
maintenance of past investment. The Road Fund for road maintenance has not been established.
There is a serious lack of mid-level managerial skills and technical assistance. The maintenance of
the huge fleet of public works equipment purchased under the project will continue to absorb a large
part of the budget allocated to road maintenance. Therefore, project sustainability is uncertain.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
27.    The Bank's performance for the preparation of the project was not satisfactory. The
preparation team accepted the program prepared by a consulting firm on behalf of the Government in
November 1987, and did not object to the huge volume of maintenance works to be carried out by
force account. The pre-appraisal mission in April 1988 was devoted to discussions to reduce project



8
scope and costs. The appraisal mission which took place in July 1988 did not devote enough time
and expertise for proper evaluation of the project, despite the importance of the technical and
financial implications of the force account works, the risk linked to total reliance on expatriate
technical assistance for implementation, and the complex nature of the institutional reform program
proposed.
28.    Bank supervision of physical implementation in particular was insufficient. Although the
Bank carried out ten supervision missions during the project implementation period (twice a year on
average), half of which included a highway engineer, only one field visit was carried out, almost at
project completion, by the task manager, who was not an engineer. There was no visit to workshop
facilities. Another field visit took place only for the purpose of preparing the ICR The quality of
follow-up varied widely, depending on the task manager in charge. This clearly indicates that the
Bank has devoted little time to field work supervision, and did not get a first-hand knowledge of
actual perforrmance through direct contact with the reality in the field. In addition, five task managers
were responsible for the project over a period of six years, which provided no continuity for the
implementation.
29.    Concerning procurement, there was a rmisprocurement for the purchase of tires. Although a
claim had been received from the lowest bidder, the Bank sent a no-objection telex approving the
selection of a bidder whose price was CFAF 60 million higher (about US$200,000). After review by
its central procurement unit, the Bank sent another telex canceling its approval, but the Borrower
ignored this latter decision and signed the contract with the previously selected supplier, and paid a
first amount from the Special Account. It took years to resolve the issue and to get the Government
to reimburse the disbursed amount to the Special Account.
30.    Bank reporting on the project (aide-memoires, back-to-office and complete supervision
reports) was generally insufficient.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
31.    The Borrower's performance is mnixed. On the financial aspects, the Government fulfilled its
commitment to secure local funding required for project completion far beyond expectations.
However, delays in the release of budget and local fund disbursements resulted in untimely payment
to suppliers and additional costs, and adversely affected the project performance.
32.    The institutional reforms proved difficult to implement. The Government never made a
decision on the reform of DERA and DOM, which the Bank insisted on for years.
33.    The physical components of the project were implemented reasonably well, but this is due to
the technical assistance more than to local staff, who were appointed late or not at all.
34.    In conclusion, the overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory for the preparation
of the project, but unsatisfactory for its implementation and completion.

G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
35.    The main failure of the project was due to the large number of the works to be carried out by
force account (about US$60 million, compared to US$30 million for works under contracts). This
jeopardized sustainability and rendered the institutional development of the road sector difficult to
implement. No attention was given during project preparation to foster and enhance the private
sector role in the provision of road maintenance. This will be a big issue for the Transport Sector
Project now under preparation. The project was clearly designed from a short-term perspective -the
general approach was sound in assessing road network conditions and maintenance needs, and setting
performance targets. But the project failed to meet sustainability conditions from a long-term
perspective. It is therefore not satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
36.    On June 10, 1994, a Transport Sector Technical Assistance Project (Loan 3777-GA) was
approved by the Board for US$5.2 million equivalent. The project is designed to be an integral part
of the Government's overall strategy following the adjustment of the CFA franc. The project
objectives are to: (a) strengthen the institutional management capacity of the Borrowees transport and
urban sectors; (b) establish a transport sector strategy and an investment plan, including the
promotion of improved sector efficiency, increased competition, reduction of transport costs, and a
decrease in subsidies to public enterprises in the transport sector; (c) prepare a transport sector
restructuring plan; (d) establish an urban sector development strategy; and (e) execute an urban
infrastructure improvement program in Libreville using labor-based methods. Effectiveness was
declared on June 23, 1995.
37.    This project will be a useful tool in designing an exhaustive reform of the transport sector
and to prepare the Transport Sector Project, scheduled for presentation to the Board in the first
quarter of 1997. This future project should assist the Government in resolving the institutional issues
wvhich were neglected under the Road Maintenance Project (Loan 3046-GA), specifically the
increased participation of the private sector in road maintenance and the establishment of financial
mechanisms for road capital preservation. In particular, financing should be secured through the
Road Fund, for which studies were carried out under the Road Maintenance Project. This Fund
should be fed by road taxes and budgetary allocations. In particular, the timber industry should
contribute more extensively: (a) to road maintenance financing, because this sector is largely
responsible for road deterioration; and (b) to new investments they request in their area. All
mechanized works should be executed by private contractors and the existing fleet of public works
equipment should be sold to private firms through auctions. Gravel roads in remote areas should be
maintained through labor-intensive methods, under the technical and financial responsibilities of the
local governments.
38.    The Road Network Improvement Project (PARR), financed by many external donors, is
under implementation. These investments should be more selective and meet transport rather than
infrastructure needs. Overall, the Transport Sector Project should be conceived according to a multi-
modal approach combining roads, railway, air and waterways.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
39.    To make the best use of scarce resources devoted to the road subsector, the Government,
donors and the Road Agency should share a common long-term commitment to a road development



10
strategy including construction, paving, rehabilitation, and periodic and routine maintenance. In the
case of the Road Maintenance Project, the project failed to set the foundation for a sustained road
development system because of the lack of such a commitment. Government commitmnent to funding
should not be limited to securing a certain amount of funding, but should also ensure a timely and
dependable flow of funds, in order to allow road agencies to plan and implement their programs
efficiently. This requires an integrated set of financial, fiscal, institutional and legal actions to be
conceived within a broad and unified multi-year financing and budgeting perspective.  The
establishment of a well conceived Road Fund may be considered to achieve the above objectives,
provided the Government is strongly committed.
40.    The local authorities would have to be persuaded of the efficiency of concentrating scarce
resources on properly planned road rehabilitation and maintenance works rather than on new
construction and improvement works. The trade-off between road expenditure options have to be
quantified to make comparisons and choices under funding constraints. Road agencies cannot exceed
their limited financial and technical resources. Taking their capacity limits into consideration, it
appears that the economical and practical choice will be to retain and mnaintain a core road network.
41.    The main lessons are: (a) force account has proved to be an ineffective and inappropriate
method of road maintenance, as has already been demonstrated in similar countries; (b) the
Department of Equipment (DOM) is a heavy financial burden impeding any attempt to improvement;
and (c) training should be viewed within the broader perspective of a long-term human resource
development strategy. All these will require a commitment to a necessary and continuing reformn
process from the Government, road organization and donors.
42.    On the Bank side, it can be assumed that the quality of the project would have been better if
road engineers had been more involved at both preparation and supervision stages. In the future, it is
recommended that sufficient local funding, satisfactory financial mechanisms, sale of equipment and
privatization of maintenance works be conditions of preparation and effectiveness for the next Bank-
financed road project.

REPUBLIQUE GABONAISE
PROJET TREENNAL D'ENTRETIEN ROUTIER. PRET 3046-GA
RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET
Aide-memoire de la mission du 14 au 27 juin 1994
1.    Une mission de supervision du Projet Triennal d'Entretien Routier a ete effectuee par Mr.
Kyriakos, Consultant de la Banque mondiale, du 14 au 27 juin 1994 A Libreville. La mission
remercie Mr. Ebang-Assoumou, Coordonnateur du projet, Mr Nkili-Bengone, Directeur General
des Travaux Publics, et tous leurs collaborateurs pour l'accueil qui lui a et reserve, pour
l'organisation des entretiens et des visites sur le terrain, et pour l'excellente collaboration aux
travaux de la mission.
OBJECTIFS DE LA MISSION
2.    Les objectifs de la mission etaient de: (a) presenter le cadre du Rapport d'Achevement en
cours de preparation par la Banque; (b) discuter la preparation par l'Emprunteur de sa propre
evaluation du Proj et et de sa contribution A l'elaboration du rapport; (c) d'ajouter A la
connaissance livresque du projet les visites et les rencontres avec les acteurs sur le terrain; et (d)
de discuter avec l'Emprunteur son point de vue sur l'execution du projet et les perspectives
d'averur.
3.    Cadre du Rapport d'Achevement du Projet. Le rapport est organise autour de neuf
themes:
(a) adequation des objectifs initiaux du projet aux besoins de l'Emprunteur;
(b) degre de realisation des objectifs du projet;
(c) facteurs qui ont influenc6 l'execution du projet;
(d) perennite du projet;
(e) performance de la Banque;
(f) performance de l'emprunteur;
(g) evaluation des resultats du projet;
(h) operations futures; et
(i) le,ons tirees et application dans des projets futurs.
4.    Evaluation  du Projet par l'Emprunteur et Contribution  de l'Emprunteur A
l'Elaboration du Rapport d'Achevement du Projet. La Banque recQmmande A ses
Emprunteurs de proceder A leur propre evaluation du projet, et de transmettre cette evaluation A
la Banque. Le rapport de l'Emprunteur est ensuite integre sans modification dans le rapport
produit par la Banque. Il pourrait etre organise selon les neuf themes ci-dessus. II ne devrait pas
depasser une dizaine de pages.
5.    Visite et Rencontres avec les Acteurs sur le Terrain. La mission a visite certaines
realisations du PTER dans les Directions Regionales du Nord-Ouest (DRNO) et du Sud-Ouest
(DRSO). Elle a visite les installations de la DRSO, des subdivisions de Fougamou et Ndende, et
l'Ecole de formation de Fougamou. La mission a parcouru un chantier de rechargement effectue

par des forestiers. Outre les personnels de la Direction Generale des Travaux Publics A Libreville,
la mission a rencontre les quatre directeurs regionaux.
6.     Point de Vue de I'Emprunteur et Perspectives d'Avenir. Les themes abordes ont
concerne le besoin d'une programmation multiannuelle de 1'entretien routier; le besoin d'une
strategie globale de developpement du reseau routier; les problemes de ressources humaines, de
formation et le r6le de l'assistance technique; les problemes de gestion du parc de materiel; et le
recours aux entreprises privees. Au-dela de ces themes g6n6raux, les discussions ont evoque les
difficultes de mise en place de la comptabilite analytique et de la banque de donnees routieres.
OBSERVATIONS ET RECOMMANDATIONS.
7.     Les efforts deployes ont conduit A des resultats positifs sur le terrain et une amelioration
sensible des conditions sur le reseau routier par rapport aux conditions initiales tres difficiles. Ces
resultats peuvent etre attribues A:
(a) une direction du projet pleinement engagee dans son execution, maitre de son
deroulement et motivee dans l'atteinte des objectifs,
(b) une assistance technique utilement mise a profit;
(c) la mise en place d'un systeme de suivi efficace associant la sanction, la promotion,
l'incitation et la formation; et
(d) des moyens adequats tant au niveau des financements que des equipements.
8.     Certaines de ces conditions ayant maintenant change (l'assistance technique est partie, le
materiel a vieilli, le financement local est reduit), la reflexion en cours sur les perspectives de
l'entretien routier doit viser A preserver certains acquis et A mettre en place une organisation
perenne moins sensible a l'evolution des conditions d'execution de l'entretien routier.
9.     Programmation  multi-annuelle.  Cette  programmation  devrait accompagner  la
prograrnmation annuelle des travaux mise en place pendant le PTER. Cette derniere methode a
permis de repondre a l'urgence des travaux de reouverture du reseau. Elle s'av&re toutefois
couteuse dans la mesure ou, les capacites ne repondant pas a l'accroissement des besoins,
1'entretien courant ne peut assurer un maintien des conditions acceptables sur l'ensemble du
reseau, et oui il doit etre soutenu par des actions regulieres de rehabilitation pour remettre ces
conditions A niveau. La programmation multi-annuelle devrait permettre de d6terminer comment
utiliser au mieux les capacites en tenant compte des contraintes, notamment financieres.
10.   II faudrait veiller A ce que le consultant qui va realiser l'etude de programmation de
l'entretien routier ne se contente pas d'importer un modele complique, comme cela s'est produit
pour la banque de donnees routieres. Les procedures informatiques devraient etre elabor6es en
collaboration avec les futurs utilisateurs. Les donnees A collecter devraient etre simples sur la base
de schemas d'itineraires manuels et d'indications visuelles associees a des mesures d'uni.

11.   Renforcement des capacites locales de gestion et d'execution de l'entretien routier.
Les efforts devraient etre portes sur cinq axes:
(a) mieux identifier les besoins;
(b) ameliorer les procedures de financement de l'entretien routier et d'utilisation de ces
financements;
(c) ameliorer les procedures de gestion du materiel de travaux publics;
(d) mettre en place des structures plus efficaces; et
(e) renforcer les capacites humaines.
Mieux identifier les besoins.
*     Realiser une campagne de comptages pour disposer de donnees fiables, celles des annees
precedentes ne l'etant pas suffisamment et presentant des inconsistances.
a     Realiser une campagne de mesures d'uni. Les donnees ne sont pas disponibles malgre
l'existance de quatre Bump Integrator.
*     RKaliser une campagne de prospection de nouveaux gites de materiaux fiables.
a     Etablir un catalogue de degradations faisant le lien entre degradations et remedes.
*     Effectuer une campagne d'inspection visuelle des routes.
*     Effectuer une campagne de pesage d'essieux.
*     Entamer une nouvelle reflexion sur les normes d'entretien. Actuellement, elles reposent
theoriquement sur la classe de trafic et l'uni mais en fait l'empirisme du subdivisionnaire prevaut.
Ameoliorer les procedures de financement de l'entretien routier et d'utilisation de ces
financements.
*     Reduire les sujetions et aleas actuels des budgets de fonctionnement et d'investissement en
creant un Fonds Routier. Un projet de texte vient d'etre prepare tenant compte des observations
de la Banque Mondiale. Une etude de mise en place de ce fonds devrait demarre'rrapidement.
*     Recourir A des sources additionnelles de financement. Les travaux importants realises pour
les forestiers se traduisent par de lourdes charges d'investissement, puis ensuite d'entretien. II
serait juste d'exiger leur contribution financiere A ces travaux. De meme, il serait envisageable de
demander une participation aux populations locales beneficiaires de l'ouverture d'une route.
*     Limiter la responsabilit6 de la DGTP A un reseau compatible avec ses moyens financiers.

*     Entreprendre avec l'appui des bailleurs de fonds une action de sensibilisation de l'opinion
et des autorites gouvemementales et locales.
Ameliorer lesprocedures de gestion du materiel de travaux publics.
*     Le texte de reforme de la D.O.M. n'est toujours pas disponible. La structure pyramidale
actuelle est trop rigide. Des economies d'echelle sont possibles en regroupant par exemple des
parcs ateliers pas trop distants les uns des autres. Le bon etat du materiel n'a pas incite A mettre en
place des modes de gestion efficace et rigoureuse de leur entretien. II y a eu trop de lenteurs dans
les decisions. Le choix des hommes n'a pas toujours et heureux.
*      Le parc devrait etre dimensionne selon les capacites de gestion d'une DOM restructuree.
Mettre en place des structures plus efficaces.
*      Le debat Regie-Entreprise devrait etre pense en terme de complementarite et non
d'opposition. L'objectif est d'arriver a une mobilisation efficace et maximale des ressources tant
dans le secteur prive que dans le secteur public.
Le fonctionnement de la regie devrait etre oriente vers l'esprit et la methode de
lentreprise. Le PTER a reussi A inculquer le sens du rendement quantitatif II s'agit de developper
celui de la qualite et du cout.
*      Un plan d'action devrait etre prepare pour developper la complementarite de la regie et de
lentreprise. Un essai a et entrepris pour faire participer les populations locales A l'entretien des
dependances dans le cadre de petites entreprises utilisant des techniques A haute intensite de main
d'oeuvre. Des petites entreprises pourraient aussi etre utilisees pour les travaux de construction et
d'entretien de petits ouvrages.
*      Une cellule de programmation devrait etre cre6e aupres du DGTP pour distinguer la
fonction de programmation de celle d'execution, et pour etre un organe de reflexion permanent
pour le responsable.
Renforcer les capacites humaines.
*     Une strategie A long terme devrait etre elaboree. Pour parer au plus pgrss6, le PTER a
porte l'effort sur la formation intensive des unites de production sur le terrain. Les actions de
formation ont ete limitees au court terme et a l'horizon du projet. Elles se sont arretees
brutalement a I'achevement de celui-ci alors que les besoins restent importants.
*     La strategie A long terme pourrait inclure la preparation dans des ecoles, des instituts
techniques, et une formation post-scolaire avant le recrutement.
*      Un plan d'action devrait etre prepare pour rendre operationnels la comptabilite analytique
et la banque de donnees routieres; soutenir l'action de restructuration de la D.O.M.; selectionner

et former les personnels qui seront responsables de l'execution des campagnes identifiees ci-dessus
pour une meilleure connaissance des besoins d'entretien routier.
*      Une extension de l'assistance technique a long terme de devrait pas etre systematiquement
ecartee a ce stade encore precaire du niveau professionnel.
*      Le plan de carriere qui a ete prepare recemment devrait etre un outil important pour
valoriser et motiver les personnels de l'entretien routier. Ce plan doit encore recevoir l'aval des
autorites politiques. II fonde le recrutement, la promotion, 1'encadrement et la formation sur des
bases objectives de qualification et de merite.
12.    Execution des travaux d'entretien.
*       JUne formation devrait etre assuree aux subdivisionnaires. L'effort de formation de PTER a
ete concentre sur la formation des unites de production sur le terrain et des personnels des
directions regionales. Les subdivisionnaires ont toutefois un r6le important dans 1'encadrement et
l'organisation des chantiers, ce qui suppose une formation adequate.
*      La maintenance de donnees routieres est importante pour conserver la memoire des
travaux realises, de l'evolution des conditions de la route, etc.
*      Les unites de production devraient etre informees du couit des operations et ce facteur
devrait etre integre dans la mesure des performances.
=      Le L.B.T.P.G. devrait etre associe aux travaux d'entretien. II 1'est deja aux travaux neufs a
l'entreprise.
-      lDe maniere a assurer l'objectivite des resultats de l'entretien routier, une unite de controle
devrait etre creee relevant directement du DGTP.
