RURAL WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a water supply project for about 600 rural com-
munities in Tunisia, with a current total population of about 225,000.   The
project would be Tunisia's first comprehensive attempt to rationalize proce-
dures for the installation and operation of public water supply services in
rural areas.  It basically includes the construction of water supply systems
in a number of villages and the setting up of an appropriate network to
operate and maintain these systems.  The proposed works and a related health
education program, which cover a group of villages for which adequate water
supply sources have been identified, are estimated to cost US$104.4 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$50.0 million, and are programmed to be
executed during the years  1984  through  1989.   A Bank  loan to  finance  the
foreign exchange component is proposed.
1.02     The proposed project would be the Bank's  seventh  operation  in the
water supply sector.  While major progress has been accomplished in providing
water supply services in cities and towns where they are practically available
to the whole urban population, less than half of the rural population is now
served by public water supply systems.  Of some 4,500 existing villages, only
a thousand are now equipped with piped water supply systems.  The Government
is committed to change this situation and to invest the large amounts required
for providing the remaining villages with public water supply.  The previous
Bank loans greatly contributed to the current high level of water supply ser-
vices  in the urban sector.   The Government's  expectation  is that  the Bank
would bring similar contribution to the shaping and strengthening of the rural
water supply sector.
1.03     The project concept was first discussed with Tunisian officials  in
Washington in July 1982.  During these discussions and further project prepa-
ration in Tunisia, the sector organization in rural areas was reviewed, with
particular attention to the line of responsibility for the operation of the
rural systems.  Agreement was also reached on a financing plan for the project
and the level of cost recovery in the project area.  A mission composed of
Messrs. Fritz Rodriguez and Nabil Shehadeh appraised the project in April 1983.



II. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
General Features
2.01     Centrally  located on the southern  bank  of  the Mediterranean  Sea,
Tunisia occupies an area of 160,000 km2 which is rather poorly endowed with
natural resources.   The Saharan Atlas that runs from west to east at about
280 kms south from the northern coastline, separates the country into two
distinct regions: to the north of the Atlas it is a semi-arid area where a
majority of the population lives and where most potentially irrigable land is
found; industries and other economic activities are concentrated in the
northern coastal areas.   The mean annual rainfall  in this region does not
exceed 600 mm.  To the south of the Atlas it is an arid land with an average
annual rainfall of less than 100 mm (see Map IBRD No 17436).
2.02     Tunisia is administratively divided into 21 governorates,  136 coun-
ties and 155 communes.   Slightly more than half of the estimated 1983 total
population of 6.9 million, which is growing at an average annual rate of 2.7
percent, is considered urban. About one-third of the urban population resides
in the two largest metropolitan areas of Tunis and Sfax.  Meanwhile, the rural
population is widely dispersed into more than 4,500 locations which are often
isolated from each other and whose low population density to a great extent
impedes rapid implementation of water supply and sanitation systems in these
locations.
Water Resources
2.03     The overall water balance in Tunisia is well known.  The annual total
volume of exploitable water resources amounts to 3 billion cubic meters, of
which 58 percent is already tappied, including 7 percent for potable water.  By
the year 2000, more than 90 percent of the resources will be in use, with 22
percent for potable water.   Most of the fresh surface water resources are,
however, found in the north-west, requiring large impounding reservoirs to
optimize their yield and long transmission mains to convey their water to the
consumption centers.   Groundwater resources  in the north have  limited capa-
city, making them only suitable for potable water supply to small towns.
Generally, surface water is used for the supply of the large cities in Tunisia.
2.04     This situation is further compounded by the fact that the salinity of
some of these resources is so high, that they are unfit for human consumption
or even irrigation,  unless mixed with  fresh water  from other  sources.   In
addition, water demand for urban and agricultural use in the southern part of
the country already exceeds the available water resources in this region and
water must be brought in from the north to meet the demand.   Gradually,  it
would become more and more necessary to resort to desalination and reuse of
wastewaters in this part of the country.
2.05     The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  allocates  water  resources  in  the
country.  An autonomous  public entity, the "Societe Nationale d'Exploitation



- 3 -
et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE), whose operations are supervised by the
Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for the production and distribution of
potable water in urban areas and large villages. A department of the Ministry
of Agriculture, the "Direction du Genie Rural" (DGR) has been responsible for
providing public services, such as water supply, sanitation, road maintenance,
etc. in rural areas and villages with a population of under 500. Water supply
systems in these villages are operated and maintained by offices of the
governorates.
2.06     Conscious of the need to conserve and use effectively scarce water
resources, the Government enacted in 1975 a water code to regulate the collec-
tion and allocation of the water sources, and to establish usage priorities.
As provided in the code, a National Water Committee was set up to assist the
Ministry of Agriculture in the management of the water resources.
2.07     The Government has also prepared three master plans  for long-range
development and use of the water resources in the northern, central and
southern parts of the country.   The construction of the first phase of the
Northern Master Plan, which involves the impounding and transfer of the
Medjeraah River waters,  is  almost  completed.   The Bank  provided  financial
assistance to the Government (Loan 1431-TUN, Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project)
for the execution of this phase.  A second phase is under preparation with
assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany.  The Master Plan for Central
Tunisia has reached the draft stage and is awaiting Government approval.  The
Master Plan for Southern Tunisia has been completed.  Based on this pLan, the
Bank has made a loan (1796-TUN) for the Southern Irrigation Project.  Finally,
the Government is executing a potable water conservation plan which in the
long-run may reduce potable water consumption by 15 percent (para. 3.03).
Population and Service Levels
2.08     An updating of the 1975 population census, based on a sampling of
wards and carried out in 1980, estimated the total population at 6.4 million,
of which 52 percent or 3.3 million lived in urban areas. Of the rural popula-
tion, which in that year reached 3.1 million or 48 percent of the total popu-
lation, nearly two-thirds was agglomerated in villages.   The remaining rural
population was dispersed in isolated scattered locations.  In the last fifteen
years, the percentage of rural population compared to the total population has
steadily decreased from 60 percent in 1966 to 48 percent.   It is anticipated
that  the rural  population would  stay during  the next  ten years  at  about
3 million to represent less than 38 percent of the total population by 1990.
2.09     The total population is projected to grow at an average annual rate
of 2.7 percent through the end of this decade to reach 8.3 million by 1990.
The urban population, however, would grow at a much faster rate (about 3.3
percent per annum), with a substantial part of this growth stemming from rural
migration to urban areas.   The population distribution between urban,  rural
agglomerated and rural dispersed, is likely to continue to move in favor of
the urban population, with the dispersed rural population accounting for less
than 10 percent of the total population by the end of this century.  Based on



the expected population distribution, it appears that priority for the provi-
sion of public services should be accorded to the agglomerated rural popula-
tion, as per the proposed project, since the villages have received little
investment in the past as compared to urban areas and their population is not
projected to decline through the end of the century.
2.10     Using  the  1980  househcld  survey  (para.  2.08),  the  Bank-defined
poverty threshold was estimated at D 120 in 1980 prices in urban areas and
D b6 in rural ones; this threshold is equivalent to US$230 and US$115 respect-
ively in 1983 prices.  The same survey indicated that in both areas, the per-
centage of population living in absolute poverty had decreased since 1975, but
at a much faster rate in urban areas (from 25 to 12 percent) than in rural
ones (from 18 to 14 percent).  More than 80 percent of the urban population is
concentrated in cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants.  Almost half of the
agglomerated rural population lives in villages of less than 500 inhabitants.
Some 70 percent of the rural agglomerations, or about 3,150 villages, have
less than 200 inhabitants.   As the average per capita  investments  in water
supply increase as the number of people per system decreases, it appears that
enormous investments would have to be made by the Government in water works to
reach a substantial percentage of the agglomerated rural population.
2.11     Service levels in Tunisia as of mid-1982 are given in Annex 1.  In
that year about 70 percent of the total population had access to safe piped
water supply. 1/  This included aLmost all the urban population (about 91 per-
cent), 70 percent of which was supplied through private house connections. In
the rural areas only about 46 percent of the population had access to safe
public water supply, and only 15 percent of the rural population was served by
private house connections.
Constraints and Priorities in the Sector
2.12     The major  constraint  to  rapid  expansion  of  public  potable  water
supply in Tunisia is the remote location of fresh water sources from the con-
sumption centers, which requires the construction of long transmission pipe-
lines.  The result is that water is very costly, because of high capital and
operating expenses of the pipelines.  Another constraint is the high salinity
of many water sources which can be used only in conjunction with fresh water
from other sources.   The per capita  investments  in transmission  facilities
tend to become prohibitive as the population per system decreases.
2.13     So far,  the Government has given its  first  priority  to the urban
areas where it has been able to quickly reach a large number of consumers.
Today, almost the entire urban population is served by public water supply
systems.   The Government  is now turning  its attention  to the agglomerated
rural population for which the per capita investments, however, are going to
be much higher and progress slower than in the urban sector, because of the
size and the multitude of rural agglomerations to be served. The Government's
1/   By definition, a dwelling irn urban areas is considered served when a
public piped water source exists at a distance of not greater than
100 meters from the dwelling, or in rural areas at not more than 300
meters.



-5-
objective is to provide the entire agglomerated rural population with public
water supply services  by the end of  this century.   Parallel  to that,  the
Government is programming funds for improving the supply sources of the
scattered rural population which nevertheless is encouraged to settle in the
existing villages.
2.14     To reach the above service levels in the rural areas, it is estimated
that, excluding SONEDE's investments in large villages, the Government would
have to invest D 728 million (US$ 1127 million) (in current prices) by the
year 2000, an amount that the Government might not be able to afford in view
of other priorities and possible budgetary constraints.
Previous Bank Loans and Credits in the Sector
2.15     Since  1968,  the Bank Group has become extensively involved  in the
sector and has assisted in financing six projects of SONEDE (five loans and a
credit). SONEDE itself was set up in 1968 under the first Bank operation.
The first loan (581-TUN) of US$15.0 million, made in January 1969, financed
water  supply  works  in  the  areas  of  Tunis  and  Sousse.   In June  1970  the
International Development Association made a credit (209-TUN) of US$10.5 mil-
lion to assist in the financing of improvement and expansion works in eight
areas of the country.  These first two projects, which were jointly financed
with the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), constituted the
major part of the National Water Supply Program for the 1968-73 period.  They
were successfully implemented, albeit with some delay.  A Project Performance
Audit Report on these two loans, dated February 1978 and prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED), confirmed the successful implementa-
tion of these two projects, attributing their success to the presence of an
efficient autonomous institution, SONEDE, and an equitable tariff policy which
ensured the financial viability of this institution.
2.16     A second loan (989-TUN) of US$23.0 million was made in May 1974 to
help SONEDE finance the construction of water supply systems in the second
largest  city,  Sfax,  and  62  large  rural  centers.   This  project  was  also
successfully implemented, though following some changes in its original
design.   An OED report,  dated May  1982,  on the execution of this  project
concluded that the detailed engineering design of the project should have been
completed prior to its  appraisal.   For  some  time this has  now become  the
practice in the Bank.
2.17     In June  1977,  the Bank  approved  a loan  of US$21.0 million  (Loan
1445-TUN) to finance the construction of production and distribution faci-
lities  in  five  northern  provinces.   The  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic
Development  is co-financing  this  project.   In May  1979,  a sector  loan  of
US$25.0 million (Loan 1702-TUN) to finance water supply works in a number of
villages was approved.   These two latest projects are still under construc-
tion, but are at a very advanced stage of execution.  Loan 1445-TUN would be
closed  at  the  end  of  1984  and  Loan  1702-TUN  at  the  end  of  1983.   More
recently, the Bank has made a sector loan of US$30.5 million (Loan 2134-TUN)2/
to help SONEDE finance water supply works in about 150 large villages and the

cost  of  low-income  customers'  house  connections.   The  execution  of  this
project has just started.
2.18     In addition, the Bank Group assisted in the financing of a tourism
infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN of September 28,
1972), which included water supply works valued at US$18.5 million.  Finally,
the Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project (Loan 1431-TUN), which covers the first
construction phase of the Northern Water Master Plan (para. 2.07), is to meet
domestic and agricultural water ciemand in the northern part of the country.
This project, which is almost ccmpleted, is already providing raw water to
treatment works which supply Greater Tunis.
2.19     SONEDE's performance under the Bank operations has been good, and has
contributed  to major  improvements  in the  sector.   The percentage  of urban
population connected to the systems, which was only 43 percent in 1968, has
now reached 72 percent.  Today, 'SONEDE is a financially viable public entity
managed by experienced and dedicated staff.  In 1982 the Operations Evaluation
Department of the Bank undertook a review of the program of operations of the
Bank Group in the water supply and waste disposal sector in Tunisia. 3/  The
conclusion of this review is that commendable achievements have been accom-
plished in urban localities and large rural settlements, but that much remains
to be done in smaller rural centers.  The objective of the proposed project is
to initiate actions to redress this situation by providing these centers with
adequate public water supply services.
Investment Program in the Sector
2.20     As mentioned earlier, water supply to rural centers with a population
of less than 500, has been planrned and executed by the "Direction du Genie
Rural"  (DGR)  of  the  Ministry  cf Agriculture.   Such  execution  is  usually
integrated and financed under a special development program in rural areas
known as "Rural Development Program" (RDP), which is administered by the
governorates' offices and which covers the provision of basic services in the
country's  rural  areas.   During  the  Fifth  Development  Plan  (1977-81),  few
investments were made in water supply works in rural centers.  In this period
SONEDE invested D 8.2 million (US$12.7 million) (about 5 percent of its total
capital funds) in 144 villages.  Meanwhile,  the DGR invested D 15.0 million
(US$23.2 million) to provide 269 centers with water supply services and to
establish   1,800  water  points   and  equip  900  wells.    Of  this  amount
D 10.6 million (US$16.4 million) was spent under the RDP program.
2.21     These investments have, h-owever, resulted in few improvements in the
rural sector.  A large number of the 4,500 rural locations are still without a
safe water supply source.  The Government intends to change this situation by
boosting  investments  in  the  rural  sector.   There  are,  however,  major
constraints to rapid development of the rural sector, such as the high per
capita investment required, the difficulties to recover costs in small
villages and the absence of efficient operating agencies in the rural areas.
These issues are being addressed in the proposed project.
3/   Report No. 4146,  Sector Operations  Review:   The Water Supply
and Waste Disposal Program in Tunisia, October 20, 1982.



2.22     The Government is currently  implementing its Sixth Development Plan
(1982-86), under which SONEDE is committed to invest a total of D 274 million
(US$ 424.2 million) in the sector, of which D 223.5 million (US$346.0 million)
would be in urban areas, and D 50.5 million (US$78.2 million) in large vil-
lages.  In addition, the Government has allocated D 120 million (US$ 186 mil-
lion) to help speed up the installation of public water supply systems in
smaller villages.  A main objective of the proposed investments in the urban
sector is to increase the proportion of the urban population directly
connected to the systems from the present 72 percent to 80 percent, leaving
only 20 percent of the urban dwellers dependent on public standposts.
2.23     The objective of the proposed investments in the rural sector is to
increase the percentage of the rural population served by public water supply
from its present 46 percent to about 56 by the end of this decade.  Overall,
some 550,000 rural people would benefit from the proposed Government
investments; about half of them would obtain their supply under the proposed
project, and the remainder under a separate project to be executed by the DGR
and possibly to be partly financed by a proposed loan of DM 30 million
(US$12.0 million) from the Federal Republic of Germany (Kreditanstalt fiir
Wiederaufbau - KfW).  The Bank has been in contact with KfW, discussing the
proposed investments in the sector, with a view to coordinating the approaches
of the two projects.  The proposed investments  in rural water would account
for about 7 percent of the Government's capital investments during the Sixth
Plan, reflecting the priority given by the Plan to allocating more funds to
poverty  alleviating projects  in neglected  areas.   About  30 percent  of the
investments in rural water supply would be financed by foreign sources,
including the Bank loan, thus lessening the impact of these investments on the
Government's budget.
2.24     In addition to the proposed KfW loan, the DGR has recently received
two loans, one of DM 25 million (US$ 10.0 million) from the Federal Republic
of Germany (KfW) and another of KD 0.6 million (US$ 2.0 million) from the Arab
Fund  for  Economic  and  Social  Development  for  projects  currently  under
implementation.
2.25     Now that the provision of water supply services in urban agglomera-
tions has reached a satisfactory level, the Government is giving more and more
attention to rural areas.  SONEDE, which reached the objectives set out under
the Fifth Development Plan (1977-1981), is expected again to perform well
under the current plan.  Its investment program during the Sixth Development
Plan was reviewed during the appraisal of the Sixth Water Supply Project (Loan
2134-TUN) and found appropriate for the sector development.
2.26     Annex 2 gives a breakdown of SONEDE's proposed investments during the
Sixth Development  Plan.   About  84  percent  of  them  are  to be  financed  by
SONEDE's  net internal cash generation, customers'  contributions and borrow-
ings.  The balance of 16 percent would be financed by the Government.  Though
the Government would finance a high proportion of the cost of the proposed
project (para. 4.24), overall, its financing of the investments in the sector
would remain relatively low compared to other countries at similar stage of
development.  The Government's financing share is expected to decline further
in the future, as SONEDE would be able to reserve more of its funds for rural
works.

The Sewerage Subsector
2.27     A national authority, the! Office National de l'Assainissement (ONAS),
is responsible for the planning, construction and operation of sewer systems
in the country.   Presently,  about 42 percent  of  the urban population have
their dwellings connected to public sewerage which exists in some 30 cities.
In the rural areas, most houses provided with water connections are equipped
with waste water disposal systems (septic tanks or seepage pits). In general,
there is no sanitation problem in the rural areas, due to the extremely low
population density in these areas.
2.28     The Bank has  also been active  in the  sewerage  subsector  and has
already made three loans for sewerage works.  A first loan of US$28.0 million
to the Government (Loan 1088-TUN, First Urban Sewerage Project, February 1975)
was for the expansion of sewer systems and wastewater  treatment  in Greater
Tunis. 4/ A second loan of US$26.5 million (1675-TUN) to finance sewerage
works in Greater Tunis and Sfax was approved in 1979.  More recently, the Bank
has approved a third loan of US$34.0 million (2255-TUN of June 1983) to
finance sewerage works in a number of medium-size towns.   The Bank-financed
Tourism Infrastructure Project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN of September
1972) also included US$16.6 million for sewerage works.  Finally, on a closely
related subsector, the Bank has recently made a loan of US$25.0 million
(2289-TUN of June 1983) for a flood protection project in Sfax, Tunisia's
second largest city.
III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS 5/
Water Consumption and Sales
3.01     Volumes of potable water consumed in Tunisia have been recorded since
1958.   The records are, however,  considered reliable only from 1966,  after
meters were installed on most of the service lines and a rigid maintenance
program started to be implemented.   The implementation of the metering and
maintenance programs became more systematic following the creation of SONEDE
in 1968.  Around that time less than half of the total population had access
to piped water  supply systems.   In 1968 water  sales  amounted to 63.4 Mm3
while  water  produced  reached  97.5  Mm3,  with  the  result  of more  than  35
percent of the production unaccounted-for.   In that year only 39 percent of
the urban population was connected  to the  systems.   In the ensuing years,
sales  kept  growing  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  6.7  percent,  reaching
152.9 Mm3 in 1982, when 61 percent of the total population had access to
piped water supply.  More than 70 percent of the urban population in 1982 was
served by direct service lines.
4/   This loan was closed on December 15, 1982 and a Project Completion Report
was issued on June 13, 1983.
5/   This analysis has been carried out only for the population segment served
by SONEDE.  The population served by the governorates is very small (less
than  8  percent  of  the  total  population),  and  its  inclusion  in  the
analysis would not substantially affect the results.



- 9 -
3.02     Meanwhile,  water  production  in  that  year  increased  to  218.5  Mm3,
with only 30 percent of this volume unaccounted-for. 6/  Still, the percentage
of unaccounted-for water is considered too high and SONEDE's objective is to
reduce it to not more than 25 percent by 1990.  To this end, SONEDE has been
installing new master meters at the production sources and on some hydrants,
and replacing domestic meters which  are considered  defective.   These  steps
would enable SONEDE to arrive at a better estimation of volumes of water pro-
duction and sales. SONEDE also carries out a permanent leak detection program
to keep losses at a minimum.
3.03     Present overall per capita water consumption differs widely  in the
country.   It varies from a high of 323 liters/day in some areas of Greater
Tunis to a low of 80 liters/day in the Governorate of Mahdia, with a national
average of 146 liters/day. This difference to some extent stems from domestic
consumption which averages 139 lpcd in Tunis, but only 42 lpcd in Mahdia.
Still, the present per capita consumption is considered too high for a country
like Tunisia with so limited water resources.  SONEDE's long-term objective is
to reduce it by about 15 percent.   To achieve that, SONEDE is proposing to
implement its part of the water conservation plan (para. 2.07), which would
include the compulsory use of low water consumption sanitary fixtures in
dwellings, the recirculation of industrial water and reuse of treated
wastewater.    The  per  capita  consumption   in  rural  areas   averages  42
liters/day.  Domestic consumption by people supplied at public taps does not
exceed 20 lcpd.
3.04     The evolution of water sales during the last twelve years is shown in
Annex 3.  As can be seen in column 12 of this table the average use at a ser-
vice line has steadily decreased during the last 12 years, as water supply
services have been provided to increasing percentages of the population.  This
decrease is attributed to reduced usage by low-income families which are
served last by the systems.  As the network is progressively expanded into
lower income and rural areas, the average use at a service line would continue
to decrease.  Meanwhile, the average per capita consumption has increased from
117 lcpd in 1971 to 146 lcpd in 1982, reflecting the increased number of
dwellings connected to the network and improved living standard in Tunisia.
3.05     About 44 percent of the current total production comes from surface
sources and the remainder from groundwater aquifers.  The entire production in
the south is from groundwater; more than 65 percent of the production in the
north is from surface sources.  The quality of water distributed in the north
is good; it is poor in the south.  SONEDE presently exploits about 370 water
production units, 2,850 kms of transmission pipelines and 4,670 kms of distri-
bution pipes.
6/ The percentage of unaccounted-for water as computed by SONEDE is made up
of: (i) water used for fire fighting and street cleaning, which is estima-
ted to account for about 5 percent of the total production; (ii) defective
domestic meter recording which is suspected to be 3 percent below real
sales volumes; (iii) production overestimation, krnown to be important for
old springs and wells and believed to average 10 to 15 percent; and (iv)
leaks in the networks, which are estimated to account for 7 to 10 percent
of the total production.

Growth of House Connections
3.06     The number of service lines which were only 102,000 in 1968 steadily
increased to almost half a million at the end of 1982, a growth of more than
11 percent  per  annum.   However,  during  the  same  period  water  sales  rose
annually by only 6.1 percent,  reflecting the situation of higher population
density and lower consumption in the newly served areas.  The evolution of the
service lines is shown in Annex 3.  The average annual consumption at a con-
nection continued to decline in the last  12 years.   In 1971  it was  about
46m3/month; it decreased to 26 m3 in 1982.  On the other hand,  the average
per capita consumption continuecl to increase from 117 liters/day in 1971 to
146 liters/day in 1982.  It is foreseen that this trend will continue during
the remaining years of this decade, but at a much slower pace.
3.07     In villages equipped wiith public water supply, some 40 percent of the
population is served by house connections. Presently, some 800,000 people are
served by 1,322 public standposts which in general are located every other
block in low-income urban areas,  and in rural locations.   Each urban public
tap serves about 600 people, a service density which is considered adequate.
Public bath and washing facilities are also provided in these areas.
Composition of the Demand
3.08     A breakdown of potable water consumed in 1982 apportions the various
uses as follows:
Domestic (House Connections)          54.0
Domestic (Standposts)                  3.0
Public                                20.5
Commercial and Industrial             14.4
Tourism                                6.4
Other                                  1.7
All Uses                             100.0
Essentially, potable water consumed in Tunisia is for domestic and public
uses 7/  which  account  for  about  77.5  percent  of  total  consumption.   The
commercial and industrial uses represent about 14 percent of all uses,
reflecting the moderate level of industrialization in Tunisia.  Probably, the
present public water usage is on the high side and can be reduced through
better control of leaks in public buildings.
3.09     SONEDE's largest consumers with service pipes of 80 mm in diameter or
more, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total customers, use about 23
percent of the total volumes. The largest users with pipes of 40 mm or more,
7/ They account for less than 60 percent in industrialized countries
where commercial and industrial uses account for more than 35 per-
cent of the demand.



- 11 -
totalling less than 1 percent of all customers, consume about 39 percent of
the total volumes.   The smallest users with pipes of less than 15 mm,  the
majority of which are domestic and which account for more than 92 percent of
all customers, consume only about 44 percent of the volumes.  The above dis-
tribution indicates that a meter maintenance program, and the system operation
in general, should give priority to the largest customers.
Future Water Sales
3.10     A forecast of water consumption up to 1991 is shown in Annex 3 and
illustrated in Annex 4.  The projection of future water sales is based on a
mathematical model relating water demand to the number of service lines.  It
is assumed that the percentage of the total population served and directly
connected to the network would increase to 95 percent by 1991, and to reach
that level SONEDE would execute annually on average 47,500 service lines.
With such an annual increase in the number of service lines, it is foreseen
that water sales would grow at an average annual rate of 4.1 percent to reach
224 Mm3 by 1991.  It is estimated that about 919,000 service lines would be
in operation in 1991. Based on SONEDE's past performance, the projected water
sales and numbers of connections appear attainable.
3.11     Assuming that the percentage of unaccounted-for water would progress-
ively decrease to about 24 percent in 1991, the production in that year would
then reach 295 Mm3 that SONEDE should be able to generate, as the required
production infrastructure already exists or is under construction.  The maxi-
mum day demand is calculated to be 30 percent higher than the yearly average
demand; the maximum hour consumption exceeds the average demand by 70 percent.
3.12     The percentage  of the total  population presently  served by direct
house connections is relatively low (42 percent) and there is still a poten-
tial market available to SONEDE. Various tariff increases have regularly been
implemented  in  the  past,  in  line with  inflation.   But  at  the  same  time
personal income has grown in real terms, thus offsetting any effect that price
increase could have had on demand.   In the end more people have had their
dwellings connected to the systems and the per capita consumption has
increased.   The expectation is that this trend would continue  in the future
and that the projected growth of service lines and water sales would be met.
IV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Project Genesis and Concept
4.01     The proposed  project  originated  from  studies  undertaken by  SONEDE
during the last two years in relation to the provision of public water supply
to the country's rural areas.  Public hearings of the Sixth Development Plan
had revealed that for the rural population piped water supply was in urgent
need and that the original amount allocated in the Plan (D 59.0 million or
US$91.0 million) was totally inadequate to make appreciable progress in
installing  public  water  supply  in  the  rural  areas.   As  a  result,  the
Government decided to increase the share of rural water supply works to



- 12 -
D 120.0 million (US$186.0 million) and to entrust SONEDE with more responsi-
bility in the rural sector.  While until now SONEDE has been providing water
supply to large villages (with more than 500 inhabitants), beginning with this
project SONEDE would start supplying water to rural centers with a population
as  small as  100.   Meanwhile,  the DGR would  continue  to provide  water  to
villages with less than 100 inhabitants and to the dispersed rural population.
4.02     Vested with  this new responsibility,  SONEDE  in 1982 carried out a
feasibility study of alternative water supply sources for villages with
agglomerated population.   For some 800 of them,  the least-cost sources were
identified to be existing water transmission pipelines or groundwater
resources located within the villages' limits.  The per capita investment cost
in each of these villages was also calculated and distributed in accordance
with the population size of the villages.  The required average investment in
different groups of villages is shown in Annex 5.
4.03     On the basis of this study, and parallel to SONEDE's current invest-
ment of D 50.5 million (US$78.1 million) in large villages, the Government is
proposing to invest D 57.4 million (US$88.8 million) in smaller rural agglome-
rations for which water resources have been identified.  Assuming that these
investments would be made in vilLages with the lowest per capita investment
cost, it has been estimated that under the Government's proposal, about 600
villages  would be equipped with water  supply.   The Government  has  further
decided to entrust SONEDE with the execution and operation of the proposed
works.  SONEDE, which is an efficient agency, is well equipped to execute the
program diligently.  To this end it has expanded its organization to include a
special technical unit to promote the installation of rural water supply works
and coordinate the execution of the proposed project (para. 5.05).
Objectives of the Project
4.04     The proposed project has many objectives.  The first one is to pro-
vide a larger share of the rural population with public water supply servi-
ces.  At the moment only 46 percent of this population has access  to such
services, compared to 91 percent in the urban sector.  A second objective is
to assist SONEDE in its efforts to promote adequate operation and maintenance
of the rural systems.  So far, there has not been much progress in the rural
areas  because  of  limited  revenues  in  these  areas  and  the  Governorates'
difficulties in maintaining good operation of the systems.  Under the proposed
project, the operational activities in most of the villages would be carried
out by SONEDE.   For  isolated villages  far  from  the  existing  water  supply
network, SONEDE would promote the establishment of water users' associations
or would enter into management contracts with individuals or existing
organizations for the operation and maintenance of the water supply systems in
those villages.  Participation of these groups to some extent would reduce the
cost to SONEDE of operating and maintaining the systems.
4.05     A  third  objective   would  be  to  assist  SONEDE  in  expanding  its
organization to cover the design, construction and operation of water supply
systems in villages with a population of less than 500.  Until now SONEDE has
built and operated systems in large villages which require not much
cross-subsidy  for  their operations.   In the past,  water  supply  systems  in



- 13 -
smaller villages have been built by the DGR which, however, does not operate
them.  So far, the DGR has constructed more than 450 systems whose operation
is directly supervised and subsidized by the governorates.  These systems are,
however,  inefficient  and poorly maintained.  8/  The proposed  project  would
seek to put in place a viable institutional operational framework in the rural
areas.
Project Description
4.06     The proposed project includes:
(i)   the  installation  of  piped  water  supply  systems  in  about  600
villages with a population varying between 100 and 1,500, and the
recalibration of transmission mains from which the villages would
be supplied with water (paras. 4.07 and 4.08);
(ii)   the installation of house connections and related pipe extensions
in rural areas (paras. 4.07, 4.21-4.23);
(iii)   the provision of drilling and operational equipment (para. 4.09);
(iv)   the research, design and testing of new materials and equipment
for rural water supply projects (para. 4.08);
(v)   the carrying  out of financial and organizational  studies,  with
the objective of formulating an appropriate financial strategy
for the sector development (para. 4.10); and
(vi)   the carrying  out of a public health  education program  in the
villages to be provided with piped water (paras. 4.11 and 4.12).
4.07     Under the proposed project, water supply systems would be installed
in villages located in all the governorates but Tunis.  Most of these systems
would receive their supply from existing transmission mains, which in some
cases would need to be re-sized.  It is estimated that at least 40 percent of
the  villages'  population  would  be  served  by  house  connections,  which  in
general would consist  of standpipes  in the yards.   SONEDE's  policy  is  to
encourage the installation of private service lines, as more public health
benefits are expected to generate from such mode of service.   The necessary
distribution networks,  as well as standposts needed to serve the remaining
population, would be provided under the proposed project.
4.08     The estimated number of subprojects in each governorate is shown in
Annex 8. The estimated cost of the subprojects is based on conventional
8/   SONEDE intends gradually to take over the operation of these systems.



- 14 -
engineering design that SONEDE normally follows for its subprojects.   SONEDE,
however, would try to lower the cost of the subprojects by using cheaper yet
adequate materials and equipment for the conditions prevailing in rural areas,
such as pipes and tanks in polyvinyl chloride,  galvanized  pipes,  etc.   The
research, design and testing of these new materials and equipment would be
carriec out by SONEDE staff who has the required capability to undertake such
task.
4.09     For a majority of villages in Tunisia, groundwater is the only water
supply source.  But most often,  the characteristics of the aquifers are not
known and as a result, project design cannot be carried out for the villages.
The  proposed  project  covers  the  supply  of  drilling  equipment  (including
casings and screens) for constructing exploratory wells in the next group of
villages  to  be  provided  with  piped  water.   The  supply  of  operational
equipment, included in the proje.ct, would basically cover tools and equipment
that SONEDE would need for the execution and operation of the proposed
systems, such as cranes, radio communication systems, vehicles, etc.
4.10     Water tariffs are the same all over Tunisia.  This national tariff
structure allows cross-subsidization of tariffs within the sector, under which
the  provision  of  water  servictes  in  the  medium-size  cities  and  towns  is
subsidized by the operations in the two largest cities, Tunis and Sfax, and in
some  agglomerations  with  local  groundwater  resources.   The  level  of  the
subsidies is not, however, known. And with the proposed expansion of SONEDE's
services to small villages, the subsidies would further increase.  The extent
to which such cross-subsidization is feasible and its upper limits would be
investigated in a study of the cost of providing water supply services to
different  agglomerations  in  the  country.   The  study  would  in  particular
cetermine how the cost in small centers can be reduced through consumers'
participation and direct contributions to capital investments and operating
expenses of the water supply systems.   Terms of reference  for the study are
outlined  in Annex  7.   During  negotiations,  assurances  were  obtained  from
SONEDE that it will carry out the financial and organizational studies in
accordance with agreed upon terms of reference, will initiate them not later
than October 1, 1984, complete them by March 31, 1986 and a month later submit
them  to  the  Government  and  the  Bank.   Following  this  submission  the
Government, by June 30, 1986, will review the findings and conclusions of the
studies with the Bank and SONEDE and agree with them on a plan for the
implementation of approved recommendations.   The Government and SONEDE will
thereafter implement this plan of action.
4.11     The  objective  of  the  health  education  program  is  to  change  the
knowledge, attitude, practices and level of readiness of the rural population
in  relation  to  the  use  of  water  supply,  and  to  make  it  aware  of  the
relationship between waterborne and communicable diseases and unsafe sanitary
practices. The program would be executed by the "Direction des Soins de Sant6
de Base" (DSSB) of the Ministry of Public Health and would be addressed to
both adults and children.  The M4inistry would try to reach the adults through
appropriate mass meetings in the villages, during which specific problems
regarding the collection, transport, storage and use of potable water would be
discussed  with  the  population.   The  current  health  education  program  in
schools would be reinforced by revising the curricula and educational
approaches on health and sanitary awareness to school children, as well as the
revision of the training of teachers with regard to public health education.



- 15 -
4.12     To reach the above objectives,  it is proposed  that  staff of DSSB
visit the villages included in the project to discuss the sanitary practices
in these villages.   It is further recommended  to supply  the equipment  and
materials that would be required to support the proposed activities in the
villages,  such  as vehicles,  audio-visual  aids,  etc.   Technical  assistance
would also be given to residents wishing to improve the plumbing systems in
their houses  and  the disposal  of wastewaters  in  their yards.   A detailed
outline of the public health education program was discussed and approved
during loan negotiations.  Assurances were also obtained that the Government
will opportunely execute the agreed public health education program in all the
villages to be provided with piped water under the project.
Proposed Investments
4.13     The total investments, needed for the work program outlined in para.
4.0b, are estimated at D 67.4 million (US$104.4 million), with a foreign ex-
change component of US$50.0 million or 47.9 percent of the total cost.
Detailed cost estimates of the project are given in Annexes 8 and 9.
Scheduled annual investments in the project are shown in Annex 10.  A summary

4.14     The proposed investments are for about 600 subprojects distributed in
twenty governorates of Tunisia.  They are based on price levels prevailing at
mid-1983 and detailed bills of quantities  of the proposed works.   The base



- 16 -
costs already include customs duties on imported equipment and other taxes on
sales  and  services.   They have  been  further  increased  by  15  percent  for
physical contingencies and 3 percent for construction supervision which would
be carried out by SONEDE staff.  To provide for price escalation during the
execution of the subprojects, the mid-1983 foreign prices are projected to
increase by 4 percent during the second half of 1983, 7.5 percent in 1984,
7 percent in 1985 and 6 percent thereafter; the local prices are foreseen to
increase by 5 percent during tha second half of 1983, 9 percent in 1984 and
8 percent  thereafter.   The estimated price  increases  appear appropriate  for
this type of project in Tunisia and are derived from experience obtained from
ongoing contracts for civil worlks and equipment and materials supply.  Price
escalation would account for about 28 percent of the base costs plus physical
contingencies and construction supervision.
4.15     Annex 11 shows the planned annual investments (in current prices) for
different types of expenditures. A major share of the investments would be in
the supply and installation of pipes, which would account for almost two-
thirds of the total expenditures.   Direct foreign expenditures would be made
for the purchase of ductile iron pipes, equipment for storage tanks and
pumping   stations,   and   operational   equipment.    About   D   12.2   million
(US518.9 million) would be paid for customs duties and other taxes.
Project Execution
4.16     The proposed investments would be made during the years 1984 through
1989.   Detailed design  is available  for about  a hundred  subprojects whose
execution would start once the loan has been approved.  The project execution
would be administered by SONEDE's new rural unit (see paras. 5.05 and 5.06),
which would be made up of staff who have performed similar task under the
Fifth  and  Sixth Water  Supply Projects  (Loans  1702- & 2134-TUN).   SONEDE's
performance under these two projects has been good and is expected to improve
further under the proposed projert.  Separate accounts would be maintained for
expenditures incurred for the project. Further, the project accounts would be
audited by independent auditors who are acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.11).
Assurances that the project accounts will be recorded separately and audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, were obtained during
negotiations.
4.17     The proposed studies,  scheduled to start in October  1984, would be
financed by SONEDE and carried out by its staff who have conducted similar
studies  under  the  Fourth  and  Fifth Water  Supply  Projects  (Loans  1445-  &
1702-TUN) and qualified for this task.
Selection and Review of Subprojects
4.18     Similar  to the arrangements  made under  the Fifth  and  Sixth Water
Supply Projects (Loans 1702- & 2134-TUN), SONEDE would have the responsibility
for selecting the subprojects and appraising them.  SONEDE's performance under
the previous Bank-financed projects has been good and this entity is expected
to make an objective appraisal of the subprojects. The project cost estimates
are based on a package of subprojects with the lowest per capita investment
cost.  SONEDE would continue to use this basic criterion in selecting the sub-



- 17 -
projects, but would also consider other socio-economic aspects of a subpro-
ject, such as the need to improve sanitary conditions in a village and in
particular its water supply source, the potential for rapid development of a
community, the means of communication of a rural village, the state of its
social  infrastructure  (school,  health  facilities,  etc.).   The  per  capita
operating expenses would be about the same for most of the subprojects, since
they would be supplied from existing water transmission mains.  Consequently,
these expenses would not be taken into account in selecting the subprojects.
4.19     The average per capita investment cost of installing piped water sup-
ply works in villages generally is proportional to the population size and
follows a power curve.  The per capita cost in Tunisia has been found to vary
from D 480 (Us$ 743) for 100 people, to D 96 (US$ 149) for a population of
1,500.   In principle,  SONEDE  would  give  priority  to  subprojects  with  the
lowest per capita investment costs based on their population and any
subproject whose per capita cost does not exceed the average cost by more than
two and a half standard deviations would be eligible for financing under the
Bank loan. Any subproject with a higher cost would have to be approved by the
Bank, on the basis of a special justification submitted by SONEDE, before it
can be financed by the loan.  In calculating the per capita cost of works in a
village, contributions by customers, either in capital or labor, towards the
initial investments, would be deducted from the stream of costs.
4.20     Annex  12  (Schedule  2  to  the  draft  Project  Agreement)  gives  a
checklist of data that SONEDE should compile for all the subprojects and
submit to the Bank.  For each subproject SONEDE would indicate how it would
operate and maintain the system.  In case SONEDE would not directly operate a
system, it would propose and discuss with the Bank the type of operational
organization that it intends to put in place in the village considered.  For
subprojects with a per capita cost higher than allowed and requiring the
Bank's approval (para. 4.19), SONEDE would submit, in addition to the above
information,  a special  justification  for  making  the  subprojects.   Once  a
village has been included in the project, SONEDE would inform DSSB of its
selection, so that the latter can plan and implement the proposed health
education program  in the selected village.   The submission  of  a group  of
subprojects and their eventual approval as necessary by the Bank, should
precede bid invitations for the supply of materials and equipment and for
civil  works  for  these  subprojects.   During  negotiations,  assurances  were
obtained that SONEDE will follow the procedures outlined in Annex 12 for the
selection and appraisal of subprojects, and when required, for the review and
approval by the Bank of the selected subprojects.
house Connections
4.21     From mid-1985  through  1989  SONEDE  expects  to  install  a total  of
25,000 house connections in the villages to be served under the project.  As
mentioned in para. 4.07 SONEDE accords credit facilities to low-income
customers to finance the installation cost of their house connections. 9/
9/ Part of the credits to customers in urban and rural areas are financed
under Loan 2134-TUN made to SONEDE in May 1982.  The Loan funds for the
house connection program would be, however, exhausted in early 1985.



- 18 -
These customers are allowed to pay 95 percent of the cost of their house
connections over a period of five years with an interest rate of 11 percent.
Only low-income domestic consumers are eligible to obtain such credit
facilities, which would be extended to all the customers in the project area,
based on their current level of income. House connections are the property of
the customers who pay a fixed fee to SONEDE for the maintenance of the
connections.
4.22     The total cost of the house connection program is estimated at D 7.5
million (US$11.6 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$5.5 million
or 47.5 percent of the total cost.  This component would be financed under the
proposed Bank loan (para. 4.24).  House connections  in Tunisia are normally
executed under force account by SONEDE's own workers or on its behalf.   The
Bank will reimburse SONEDE for 50 percent of the credits accorded to
low-income  customers  in rural  areas.   To  obtain  such  reimbursement  SONEDE
would submit the list of customers to whom credits have been accorded during a
given period, together with the amount of the credits to the customers.
Verification  of  the  credits  would  be  carried  out  by  supervision missions
(para. 4.29).
4.23     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SONEDE will extend
credit facilities to customers in the project area to finance the installation
cost of their house connections, that they will be allowed to repay over a
maximum period of five years at an interest rate of 11 percent.
Project Financing
4.24     A Bank loan of US$50.0 million to finance the foreign exchange cost
of the project,  including a capitalized front-end fee on the Bank loan,  is
proposed.  The loan would be made to the Government and would mature in 17
years including 4 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.  In
addition, new customers in the project area are expected to contribute D 1.9
million (US$2.9 million) towards the project cost.  SONEDE would finance the
remaining  local  cost  of  the  house  connection  program,  the  cost  of  the
financial and organizational studies and of construction supervision of the
project.  On its side the Government is prepared to finance the balance of the
project costs. On this basis the financing plan for the project is as follows:
Requirements:                 D Million    US$ Million            %
Local                            35.1          54.4             52.1
Foreign                          32.2          50.0             47.9
Total                          67.3         104.4            100.0
Financed by;
SONEDE                            4.6            7.2             6.9
Customers                         1.9            2.9             2.8
Government                       28.6          44.3             42.4
Bank                             32.3          50.0             47.9
Total                          67.4         104.4            100.0



- 19 -
4.25     The Government would relend to SONEDE the portion of the Bank loan
(US$5.5 million) for the house connection program, which it will repay over a
period of 13 years after 4 years of grace,  with an interest rate of 10.5
percent.   SONEDE would bear the foreign exchange risk on this part of the
loan.  The remaining part of the Bank loan would be passed to SONEDE as an
equity contribution and serviced by the Government.   To ensure an efficient
operation  and  maintenance  of  the  proposed  systems  and  take  advantage  of
SONEDE's operational experience, the Government in effect has decided to pass
its share of the financing of the works in the villages (including the portion
of its borrowing from the Bank for the works to be executed by SONEDE in the
villages) as a contribution towards SONEDE's equity.  In compensation, SONEDE
would be required to generate funds necessary for future expansion of the
systems.  The Government's equity contribution and lending to SONEDE, as well
as SONEDE's obligation to operate and expand efficiently the systems, would be
recorded in a Project Financing Agreement between the Government and SONEDE.
The execution of this agreement, with terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness.
Procurement
4.26     To speed up the procurement process under the project, pipes and fit-
tings and other related materials, whose supply is projected to cost about
US$31.0 million, would be procured in bulk by SONEDE and put at the disposal
of  civil  works  contractors.   Contracts  for  such  supply  would  be  awarded
following international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank
Group's Guidelines for Procurement.  In evaluating bids for these contracts, a
15 percent margin of preference or the actual customs duties, whichever is
lower, would be allowed  for goods manufactured  in Tunisia.   Items  such as
pumps, motor drives, special valves, etc., which cannot be grouped together
since  they would be designed and purchased  at  different  times  during  the
project execution, would be procured through local competitive bidding, in
accordance with SONEDE's procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank.  They
are estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000 each, with an aggregate value of
not  more  than  US$ 2.0  million.   Materials  and  equipment  for  SONEDE's
operations in the villages to be served under the project and for the public
health education program, costing less than US$ 50,000 each and aggregating to
not more than US$ 800,000, would be procured through quotations from at least
four suppliers in eligible member countries of the Bank.
4.27     The execution proper of the subprojects would be carried out through
a multitude of small civil works contracts for pipe laying and the construc-
tion of reservoirs and pumping stations widely dispersed in the country.
These contracts, whose total value is estimated at US$45.1 million, but which
individually would not exceed US$ 300,000, would not attract international
builders.   Consequently,  for a more speedy project execution,  they would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally and in accord-
ance  with  SONEDE's  procedures  which  are  acceptable  to  the  Bank.   This,
however, is not expected to result in higher cost of the works or in lower
work  quality.   In  any  event,  foreign  contractors  would  be  allowed  to
participate  in the bidding  of the civil works.   Wherever  it  is possible,



- 20 -
SONEDE would try to group the civil works contracts in order to speed up the
procurement process and the project execution.
4.28     It  is  further  anticipated  that  works  in  some  small  and  isolated
villages would not even attract local contractors and that SONEDE would have
to execute them under force accDunt by its own workers or on its behalf.
These works are estimated to amount to US$4.0 million.  Except for the supply
of ductile iron pipes, pumps, motor drives and special valves, local
contractors are expected to win all the contracts.
Disbursements
4.29     Annex  11  shows  the  allocation  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Bank  loan
according  to various  types  of  expenditures.   The  loan would  be  disbursed
against: (i) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
materials for the project; (ii) 60 percent of local expenditures for the
purchase of goods procured locally for the villages' water supply systems and
the public health education program; (iii) 40 percent of total expenditures
for  civil  works  construction  of  the  villages'  water  supply  systems;  and
(iv) 50 percent of credits extended by SONEDE to domestic consumers in rural
areas to cover the installation cost of their house connections. Overall, the
Bank loan would cover 47.9 percent of the total amount of the planned
investments.  Disbursements for wDrks, executed under force account, would be
made against submission by SONEDE of certificates of expenditures, the
accuracy of which would be controlled in the field by supervision missions.
SONEDE has the administrative and accounting capability to prepare and
maintain the records of the certificates, which would also be audited by
SONEDE's independent auditors who are acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.11).
4.30     Estimated quarterly disbursements of the proposed Bank loan and of
Government funds are given in Annex 13.  Disbursement of water supply loans in
the EMENA region on average extends over an eight-year period and in Tunisia
over seven and a half years.  Because the proposed project entails a sector
loan, which would be disbursed faster than specific projects, as evidenced in
the Fifth  and  Sixth Water  Supply  Projects  (Loans  1702-  and  2134-TUN),  a
seven-year disbursement period is foreseen for the Bank loan.
4.31     The closing date of the proposed  loan would be June 30,  1991,  or
eighteen months after the project completion, which is the time required to
monitor the performance of the works and return retention money on the
project's civil works contracts.
V. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
Background
5.01     The  proposed  project  wculd  be  executed  and  later  on  operated  by
SONEDE, the national water supply authority, which was established in 1968 to
replace a Government office, the "Regie de Distribution des Eaux (RDE)", in an
effort to shape up adequately the financial and managerial resources of the
sector.   SONEDE has the status of an autonomous  public  enterprise,  but  is



- 21 -
managed as a commercial undertaking. It is owned by the Government and opera-
tes under the tutelage of the Ministry of Agriculture, SONEDE is the borrower
and beneficiary of previous Bank Group lending to the sector (Loan 581-TUN,
Credit 209-TUN, Loans 989-, 1445-, 1702- and 2134-TUN), as well as the exe-
cuting agency for the water supply component of the Tourism Infrastructure
Project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN) and the Sidi Salem Multipurpose
Project (Loan 1431-TUN).
Past Performance
5.02     So far the Bank Group has made five loans and one credit for a total
amount of US$ 125 million to finance six SONEDE projects.   The first three
projects were successfully executed by SONEDE and are now in operation.  They
were conducive to the rapid expansion of public water supply services, which
has taken place in Tunisia since their completion in 1974.  The  fourth and
fifth projects are near completion and already are considered successful. The
execution of the sixth project has just started.  The setting up of SONEDE has
also been successful and has produced the reforms necessary for improving
water supply operations in the country. At the end of 1982, after 14 years of
operations, SONEDE had more than doubled its water sales (from 63.4 Mm3 in
1968 to 152.9 Mm3 in 1982), and more than quintupled the number of house
connections  (from  102,000  to  514,586).    SONEDE  now  provides  technical
assistance to similar organizations in African countries.
Organization and Management
5.03     Annex 14 shows the current  organizational  structure  of  SONEDE.   A
Board of twelve members, chaired by SONEDE's General Manager, supervises the
company's activities.  Nine Board members are public officials and represent
the Government Ministries and other public agencies involved in the water
resources sector. The remaining three Board members, though appointed by the
Minister of Agriculture, represent the private sector and SONEDE's customers.
The overall control exercised by the Government, beyond the appointment of the
Board members, covers other decision processes such as approval of the com-
pany's investment programs, borrowings and tariff levels.
5.04     The General Manager is appointed by the Minister of Agriculture and
is responsible for the day-to-day operations which are handled by five
departments: production and distribution in Greater Tunis, production and dis-
tribution in the rest of the country, new works, engineering studies, and
administration and finance.   Two divisions  in charge of internal audit and
organization, and operational control assist the General Manager in preparing
long-range planning and policies.  Under the existing agreements for the pre-
vious loans, SONEDE is committed to consult with the Bank before making any
changes in its organization and administrative structure.
5.05     SONEDE's involvement in rural water supply so far has been limited to
large villages and has accounted for a small proportion of its investment
program.   In addition,  its  involvement  has  taken place  in villages  which
already had  an  embryo  of urban development.   Under  the  proposed  project,
SONEDE would execute a large number of small subprojects (about 125 each year)



- 22 -
in villages with a population down to 100.  The nature of these subprojects
would be somewhat different from projects in urban areas, and special atten-
tion would have to be paid to the type of materials and equipment for the sub-
projects, with a view to reducing the cost of the rural systems.  To ensure a
quick and efficient execution of the proposed project, SONEDE has set up a
rural unit, which would be exclusively in charge of the planning and execution
of rural subprojects.
5.06     The rural unit would be attached  to the department of engineering
studies as shown in Annex 14.  In addition to the engineering aspects of the
subprojects, the unit would assist in promoting the installation of piped
water systems in villages and would undertake research and experiments on low
cost technology for rural systems. The organizational structure and functions
of the unit were discussed and approved during negotiations.   In addition,
assurances were obtained that the unit would be maintained during the project
execution.
5.07     At present, SONEDE has; a fairly good, decentralized operating network
in place in the country, which should be able to operate most of the proposed
systems without any major expansion, since the concerned villages are located
close  to SONEDE's  existing  operating  centers.   However,  for  some  isolated
villages SONEDE would need to make special arrangements for the operation of
their systems, like opening and closing of valves, start and shutting off of
pumps.   For  these  villages  SONEDE  intends  to  put  in  place  water  users'
associations or to enter into management contracts with individuals or
existing organizations to carry out the routine operations described above.
Recommendations for the setting up of an appropriate institutional structure
for water supply operations in the country's villages would be made in the
financial and organizational studies included in the project (para. 4.10 and
Annex 7). Meanwhile, the Government should allow SONEDE to take all necessary
actions including increasing its tariffs, to ensure adequate operation and
maintenance of the proposed systems.  Assurances to that effect were obtained
during negotiations.
Staffing
5.08     At the end of 1982, SONEDE's staff numbered 4,200 or an average of
one employee per 1,000 people served.   This ratio is considered adequate for
SONEDE's type of decentralized organization, but should continue to decrease
slowly, as SONEDE is now sufficiently staffed with engineering and adminis-
trative  personnel  to  meet  the  requirements  of  future  expansion  of  its
operations. The creation of t:he rural unit is not expected to result in any
significant increase of staff.   SONEDE's salaries and conditions  of service
are competitive with those of other sectors in Tunisia and are adequate to
recruit and retain qualified personnel.
5.09     Current staff training in SONEDE is considered adequate.  In collabo-
ration with the "Office de l'Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle",
SONEDE maintains a continuous training program for its personnel.   In addi-
tion, a number of short-term seminars covering various aspects of its opera-
tions are arranged  each year  by SONEDE  for  its  staff.   It also regularly
arranges for overseas scholarships for its engineers to specialize in sanitary



- 23 -
engineering and other areas related to water supply.  Since the initiation of
the Fifth Project, which is a sector loan (1702-TUN) for large villages,
SONEDE has also focussed the training of its staff on the planning, financial
and economic evaluation of projects. In the future, the staff will be encour-
aged to continue to follow specialized courses of the Economic Development
Institute of the Bank Group and of other advanced institutions.
Current Practices and Procedures
5.10     SONEDE's accounting system is comprehensive.   Its financial accounts,
billing of water sales, related charges and new connections, inventory control
and payroll, are performed on a computer programmed and operated by its
staff. A cost accounting section monitors the cost effectiveness of each sec-
tion and activity.   SONEDE performs  annual physical  inventory controls  and
recorded levels of inventories are reliable.
5.11     SONEDE's operations are monitored by a Technical  Controller  and a
Financial Controller who are appointed by the Government, and who are advisory
members of the Board of Directors.  In addition, an external audit of SONEDE's
financial statements is carried out annually by independent auditors who are
acceptable to the Bank.  The existing agreements between the Bank and SONEDE
provide for the submission to the Bank of the auditors' annual report within
six months after  the close of each  fiscal year.   In compliance with  this
provision, the audit of SONEDE's 1982 accounts was carried out and submitted
to the Bank. The audit reports, however, have been received with some delays,
because of the time needed by SONEDE to review the reports prior to their
submission to the Bank.  It has now been established that, after the close of
a fiscal year, a period of nine months is needed to finalize and audit the
company's financial statements, before the audit report can be submitted to
the Bank.  Consequently, it was agreed with SONEDE that its annual financial
statements would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of a
fiscal year and the audit report within nine months.   Audit reports for the
health education component would be prepared by the Controller General of
Finance and submitted to the Bank within nine months after the end of a fiscal
year. These assurances were obtained during negotiations.
5.12     SONEDE bills its customers on a rotating basis every three months for
the volume of water consumed and for a fixed charge covering meter rent and
connection maintenance.   Collection from private customers is efficient.   As
of December 31, 1982, accounts receivable stood at about two and a half months
of sales.   Receivables  from municipal  authorities  (6 percent of total bil-
ling), however, are collected at a slower pace than those of the private con-
sumers and Government offices, though this has been improving, following the
implementation of a special collection system from municipalities, which was
adopted in 1981. The existing agreements between the Government and the Bank
commit the former to take all necessary steps to enable SONEDE to receive full
payment for water consumed by all national, regional and municipal entities
within a reasonable period of time after billing.  This has been restated in
the loan agreement for the project.
5.13     SONEDE  carries  insurance  covering motor  vehicles,  fire  damage  to
buildings, third party liability and special coverage for damages caused by



- 24 -
polluted water accidentally distributed by SONEDE, all of which are considered
adequate.  SONEDE is self-insured for workmen's compensation and has set up a
special fund for this purpose.  Projections of the fund requirements indicate
that the current contributions  towards  the fund are sufficient.   All supply
and civil works contracts for the project will be insured by private companies
against loss and damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property damages.
Outlook of SONEDE's Future Operations
5.14     Since its creation in 1968, SONEDE has steadily expanded its services
to larger segments of the population and has continued to build up its
operating efficiency.  As a result, about 91 percent of the urban population
is now fully served by public water supply systems.  But so far, only a small
proportion of the rural population has been provided with such systems.   In
general, the per capita capital investments of water supply increase as the
population size decreases.  Thus, because of the small size of the villages
(between 100 and 1,500 people), the required investments would be high
compared  to those which were  spent  in the urban areas.   In addition,  the
operation of the rural systems would be difficult,  because of their limited
access, the high number of smaLl systems to be maintained, and above all, the
small revenues that would be collected in the villages.
5.15     Now that SONEDE has practically resolved the problem of water supply
in the urban areas, it is focusing its efforts on accomplishing the same in
the rural areas.  It is, however, an expensive proposition which cannot be met
without the Government's financial support, and cross-subsidies from the urban
sector.  To reduce SONEDE's operating expenses in the villages and at the same
time  ensure  an  efficient  maintenance  of  the  systems,   an  imaginative
organization needs  to be put  in place  in  the  rural  areas.   The  proposed
project seeks to lay the ground for this organization (paras. 5.06 and 5.07).
VI. FINANCE
Financial Performance in the Sector
6.01     The major investor and operator in the potable water supply sector in
Tunisia is SONEDE which at present provides water to 91 percent of the urban
population and 29 percent of lhe rural population.  An additional 17 percent
of the rural population is served by the governorates.  The DGR, which is a
department of the Ministry of Agriculture, also invests in rural water supply
works.  Its investment program, however, is small compared to SONEDE's (D 15.0
million vs D 173.0 million during the years 1977 through 1981).  The systems
built by the DGR are operated and maintained by offices of the governorates.
A national tariff structure is applied by SONEDE, with a view to maintaining
affordable  services  in  small  communities.   Tariffs  are  not  levied  in the
villages  served  by  the  governorates.   In  some  instances  the  villages'
communities provide  funds  for their  systems'  operations,  which however  are
inadequate.
6.02     Most of SONEDE's  initial equity was provided by the Government by
transferring the ownership of fixed assets (less related debts) of the "Regie
de Distribution des Eaux"  (RDE) to SONEDE  (see para.  5.01).   In the years



- 25 -
following its creation, SONEDE's equity has increased considerably through
retained earnings and customers and Government contributions, reaching D 156.5
million (US$242.3 million)  in 1982.  Of this total, consumers have provided
about 55 percent and the Government the remainder.
6.03     SONEDE's capital structure is satisfactory.   In 1982 its debt/equity
ratio was  39:61  and  its operating  ratio  81  percent.   Results  of  SONEDE's
operations in 1982 (Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Balance Sheet
in Annexes 15 through 17) indicate that SONEDE's performance was satisfactory
in that year.
6.04     As previously mentioned,  the Government  is currently executing  its
Sixth Development Plan (1982-86) and as part of the plan SONEDE is planning to
invest about D 274.0 million (US$ 424.0 million)  in water supply works.  Of
this amount, D 50.5 million (US$78.2 million) or 18.4 percent would be in
rural areas.  Under the current financing plan, SONEDE is expected to finance
about 20 percent of its capital requirements by internal cash generation, and
64 percent by customers'  contributions  and borrowings.   The balance of  16
percent would be covered by a Government equity which would amount to less
than taxes and custom duties to be paid by SONEDE to the Government during the
same period.   This  financial plan was  set  out  in the  loan agreement with
SONEDE for a sixth water supply project 10/ (Loan 2134-TUN) and highlights the
sector's strong financial performance.
6.05     In fact,  SONEDE's  financial performance would have been even much
better, had its foreign debt service not grown so dramatically recently, due
to the devaluation of the Tunisian Dinar vis-a-vis the US Dollar 11/. Because
of the exchange rate increase, the 1980 level of SONEDE's foreign debt service
has increased by about 75 percent in 1982 dinars.
6.06     By the end of the Sixth Development Plan in 1986, SONEDE expects to
serve the entire urban population and thus to be able to direct more financial
resources to rural areas where water supply services presently lag.  Enormous
investments are, however, required to reach an appreciable percentage of the
rural population with public water supply services, and the current
investments of SONEDE are not expected to increase the service levels very
much by 1986.  In view of that and because of SONEDE's current high financial
commitment, the Government has decided to finance additional works in the
rural areas and to pass the assets as equity to SONEDE, as the Government did
for the urban facilities  at the time of SONEDE's creation  in 1968.  While
SONEDE would continue to finance about 84 percent of its capital investments
with its own resources, it would finance less than 7 percent of the works
included in the proposed project, as these investments in the rural sector
would be made directly by the Government (para. 4.24).  Nevertheless,  SONEDE
would  be  in charge  of  the  operation  of  the  villages'  systems  and  would
generate the funds necessary for their maintenance and expansion.

- 26 -
Revenues in the Project Area
6.07     SONEDE presently applies a progressive tariff structure which takes
into account both the level of consumption and the type of usage.  The first
level corresponds  to a maximum domestic  consumption of 20 m3 per household
per quarter, which is charged at D 0.080/m3 (US$0.47/1,000 gallons).  A flat
rate  of  D 0.180/m3  (US$1.05/1,000 gallons)  is  applied  for  consumption  at
standposts, which is usually paid by local authorities.  These two rates would
be applied in the project area, as consumption would not exceed 20 m3 per
household per quarter in the dwellings or would take place at standposts.  It
is estimated that 65 percent of the total consumption in the project area
would be at private house connections and the balance at standposts, resulting
in an average revenue of D 0.115/m3 (US$0.67/1,000 gallons) in 1983 prices.
The   consolidated   national   average   revenue   is   currently   D   0.223/m3
(US$1.31/1,000 gallons).
6.08     Annex 18 shows forecast income statements in the project area during
the years  1986  through  1991.   Revenues  in  the  area  are  projected  to  be
sufficient to meet operating and maintenance expenses, with a small surplus to
cover  part  of depreciation.   The balance  of depreciation  would  be met  by
SONEDE's nationwide revenues.   The depreciation allowances would be used to
expand and renew the proposed systems as necessary.   This financial strategy
for the rural sector appears adequate to ensure the proper maintenance and
expansion of the villages' systems. The possibility of further expanding
cross-subsidization from the urban sector to the villages to cover part of the
investments in the villages, wouLd be investigated under the financial and
organizational studies included in the proposed project (para. 4.10).
SONEDE's Future Finance
6.09     SONEDE's  forecast  financial  statements  from  1983  through  1991  are
shown  in Annexes  15 through  17.   The assumptions  made  in preparing  these
statements  are  detailed  in  Annex  19.   The  project  facilities  would  be
incorporated in SONEDE's fixed assets, as they come into operation from 1986
onwards.   Government  equity in SONEDE's capital would  increase accordingly.
The costs of operating and maintaining the works included in the proposed
project and the impact of these costs on SONEDE's revenues requirements were
taken  into  account  in  preparing  the  financial  statements.   Tariffs  are
projected to increase in the future to enable SONEDE to meet its objective of
financing 20 percent of its capital investments with its net internal cash
generation (Loan Agreement 2134-TUN, Section 5.05), though this percentage
would fall to 16 and 18 percent in 1983 and 1984 respectively, due to
exceptional working capital requirements during those years.
6.10     SONEDE has increased its average tariff by 20 percent in 1983 and is
expected to increase it again by about 20 percent in 1984.  Further increases
would not be justified as they would only be required to cover exceptional
increases in working capital related to the advancement of investments
included in the Sixth Development Plan.   SONEDE's record with regard to the
implementation of tariff increases is outstanding (about 86 percent since
1982).  Furthermore, the shortfall, in cash generation in 1983 and 1984 would
be compensated by higher percentages of self-financing in later years.



- 27 -
6.11     During negotiations  agreement was  reached with  the Government  and
SONEDE to restate the financial covenant of Loan 2134-TUN in the agreements
for the proposed project, namely that SONEDE would generate during each fiscal
year  revenues   sufficient   to  cover   its  operating  expenses   (excluding
depreciation), debt service requirement, any increase in working capital other
than cash, and not less than 20 percent of the annual average of its estimated
capital expenditures in the year considered and the two following years.  To
ensure that the above revenue requirement would be met, it was agreed that
SONEDE, before November 30 of each year, would review with the Bank the
adequacy of its tariffs and thereafter take the necessary measures to generate
adequate revenues during the ensuing year.
6.12     Also,  the  understanding  reached  under  under  Loan  2134-TUN,  that
SONEDE would finance at least 40 percent of its capital expenditures with its
revenues and customer contributions during the period 1982-86 and subsequent
periods agreed between the Bank and SONEDE, was repeated in the agreements for
the proposed project.
6.13     The  projections  show  that  SONEDE's  financial  performance  would
continue to improve in the future.   Its debt:equity ratio would fluctuate on
the   average   around   33:67,   reaching   27:73   in   1991.    The   current
assets/liabilities ratio, excluding short-term maturities of long-term debts,
would  improve  through  the  period  to reach  about  1.4  in  1991.   Over  the
projection period,  the operating ratio would be about 70 percent.   Internal
cash generation would cover debt service adequately, as debt service coverage
is projected to fluctuate around 1.8 during the projection period.  Under the
existing  loan  agreements  with  SONEDE,  it  is  committed  not  to  incur  any
long-term debt (except for the projects covered by the agreements) without the
Bank Group's concurrence, unless its projected internal cash generation for
each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be incurred would be at least
1.5 times its projected debt service in each such year on all its debt
including  the  debt  to be  incurred.   This  commitment  was  restated  in  the
agreement for the proposed project.
Monitoring System
6.14     Annex 20 shows the technical and financial indicators which would be
monitored  during  the project  execution.   This Annex also gives  the values
forecast for these indicators in the years 1983 through 1991.   These values
were  discussed  and  agreed  upon  during  negotiations.   Agreement  was  also
reached with SONEDE that it will: (i) report the evolution of the indicators
to the Bank on a quarterly basis during the project execution, and on an
annual basis for five years after the project completion; and, (ii) carry out
any reasonable remedial action suggested by the Bank, aiming at meeting the
target values of the indicators.
6.15     At negotiations, assurances were also secured that SONEDE, within six
months following the closing of the loan, will prepare and submit to the Bank
a completion report on the execution and initial operation of the subprojects,
their  costs  and  the  benefits  derived  and  to  be  derived  from  them,  the
performance and fulfillment by the Government, the Bank and SONEDE of their
respective obligations under the Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement, and
the accomplishment of the objectives of the Bank loan.  The Government would
prepare a similar report for the health education component.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
7.01     Throughout this report em[phasis has been laid upon the current low
level of public water supply services in the rural areas and the need to
improve the operation and maintenance of water supply works in the villages.
At present, only about 46 percent of the rural population is served by public
water systems.  And even in the villages where systems already exist, services
are rather  sporadic  and  unsatisfactory.   The  Government's objective  is  to
increase the percentage to 56 percent by 1990, and to pursue the execution of
the program during the next decade, so as to reach about 80 percent of the
rural population by the end of the century. Under the proposed project, water
supply networks would be installed in about 600 villages to serve an estimated
future population of 350,000 by  the year  2005.   About  40 percent  of  this
population would have their dwellings connected to the networks; the remainder
would be served at public taps.
7.02     SONEDE, which is an experienced operator and which already possesses
a large operating network in the country, would be in charge of the operation
and maintenance  of  the water  supply  systems  in  the  villages.   A  further
advantage of having SONEDE own the villages' systems would be to allow
cross-subsidization between the urban and rural sectors.  SONEDE in effect is
expected in the future to finance the system expansion in the villages with
its own funds, which would be generated mainly in urban areas.
7.03     Water is essential for sustaining life and potable water supply is a
basic service that Government must make available in cities and villages.
Many benefits would derive from the proposed project.  First, there are those
which individual consumers would derive from the water supply that would
become available to them and which would translate in water sales by SONEDE.
These sales would, however, represent a minimum measure of the direct benefits
of the project.  More importantly, there would be many benefits to society at
large from the provision of safe water in the villages.   The many health and
environment benefits that the proposed project would generate, such as reduced
expenses   for  health   care,   lower   infant   mortality,   workers'   higher
productivity, improved learning by children who would have to devote less time
for carrying water, housewives' higher productivity, should produce a high
economic return on the proposed investments.   These kinds  of benefits are,
however, difficult to quantify and a meaningful economic rate return cannot be
calculated.
Least-Cost Solution
7.04     For each subproject SONEDE would  submit  an economic  comparison  of
feasible alternatives to show the least-cost solution.   In addition,  as the
study on special materials and equipment for rural systems progresses (para.
4.08), SONEDE would investigate the possibility of reducing the cost of the
subprojects by  introducing  the use of  these materials  and equipment.   The
calculation of the per-capita cost of a subproject and the determination of



- 29 -
its eligibility for financing under the Bank loan would be made for the
least-cost alternative.   The design criteria to be used for the subprojects
were reviewed and found acceptable.
Economic Efficiency in the Sector
7.05     A uniform tariff structure and  level  is applied all over Tunisia,
thereby providing cross-subsidization from larger to smaller agglomerations.
Therefore, to estimate the economic efficiency of a project, the use of the
tariffs as a proxy for benefits is not appropriate.  This is particularly true
for the proposed project which is undertaken upon the premises that part of
future  capital  investments  would  be  supported  by  revenues  in  the  urban
sector.   An economic  judgment  can be  passed  only  on  the whole  investment
program in the sector.
7.06     The  economic  justification  of  the  investments  in  the  sector  is
clearly implied by the fact that about 40 percent of SONEDE's water production
(i.e., that portion consumed by industry, tourism and the upper income
brackets and therefore not to be subsidized) is sold at a current tariff of
D 0.310, which is equal to the long-run average incremental cost of water
supply in the country,  based  on an 8 percent  discount  rate.   Thus,  these
consumers have shown their willingness to pay for the cost of providing
additional water and for expanding water services to larger segments of the
population.
Affordability
7.07     There is a marked difference in the development levels among regions
in Tunisia and between urban and rural areas.  In this respect, a Government
objective  is  to  promote  a  better  balanced  regional  development  and  a
redistribution of income.  The proposed project would meet both parts of this
objective.   It would allow a substantial consumption increase in the rura'
areas and a redistribution of income from the urban sector into the villages.
7.08     The national tariff structure would be applied in the project area.
The lowest income households there, served by house connections, are not
expected to consume more than 20 m3 per quarter and would pay about D 2 (in
1982 prices) for such consumption.  This would account for less than 3 percent
of  their  income,  which  is within  generally  accepted  norms.   The  cost  of
providing water supply services in the rural areas is much higher than the
applicable national tariff and would be prohibitive for most of the consumers
in the villages.   Water consumption at standpipes  is paid by  the counties
administrations.
Environmental Aspects
7.09     The proposed project is not expected to have any adverse effect on
the environment.   Population  density  in the villages  is extremely  low and
there will not be any major difficulties in evacuating the small quantity of
wastewater resulting from the proposed water supply.  Most of the dwellings
are at present equipped with dry pits which are isolated and present no health
hazards.  The DGR provides technical assistance to residents who wish to build



- 30 -
septic tanks and seepage pits.  The proposed project includes a public health
education program in the concerned villages.  Additional public health needs
would be covered under the Bank's First Health and Population Project (Loan
2005-TUN). A second project is currently under preparation.
Institution Building
7.10     The accelerated development of the sector started in 1968 with the
creation of SONEDE whose first priority in the last 15 years was to provide
water to cities and towns.  With the Bank's assistance,  it has succeeded in
this task and is now aiming at accomplishing similar work in the villages.
The proposed project is conceived to assist SONEDE in its efforts to expand
its services to smaller communities in the country.
7.11     The establishment of SONEDE as an effective national authority with
the capability of efficiently managing the sector should remain the Bank's
main objective for the sector.  Tc this end, the project includes the setting
up of a rural unit in SONEDE, a review of the cost of providing water to
different classes of consumers and in various locations, and of the design and
testing of low-cost materials for rural projects.
Risks
7.12     As  for  any  rural  water  supply  project,  there  are  some  risks
associated  with  the  execution  cf  the  proposed  project.   A  multitude  of
subprojects is involved and procurement for them may be tedious and lengthy.
lhe execution proper of the works also may be difficult because of the lack of
facilities  and easy access  to the villages.   There  is also  the risk  that
SONEDE may face high operating costs in the project area and difficulties in
keeping adequate maintenance of the proposed facilities.
7.13     The measures  proposed  to be  taken  in  the  course  of  the  project
execution,  such  as  the  establishment  of  a  special  rural  unit  in  SONEDE
(para. 5.05), the bulk purchase of materials and equipment (para. 4.26) and
local bidding for civil works construction should, however, minimize the risks
involved under the proposed project.  To some extent SONEDE should be able to
reduce its operating expenses in isolated villages through the creation of
water users' associations or management contracts for the operation of these
villages'  systems.   Finally,  the Government is fully committed to improving
the situation in the rural areas, thereby to the success of this project, and
is ready to assist SONEDE in surmounting the anticipated difficulties.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     Agreement having been reached on the issues outlined in Chapters IV
through  VI,  and  subject  to  the  condition  of  effectiveness  set  forth  in
para. 4.25, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$50.0 million
to the Government of Tunisia for a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace.

RURAL WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Financial and Organizational Studies
Scope of the Study
1.       The objective of the studies is to design an appropriate financial
and organizational strategy for the sector, that would allow to provide the
whole country with public water supply services, say by the year 2010. A high
percentage of the urban population (91 percent) has now access to piped water
supply.  The situation is, however,  quite different in the rural areas where
only 46 percent of the population is now served by public water supply
systems.  The current high service level in the urban areas is the result of
large  investments  which have been made  in the  sector  during  the  last  15
years. Additional investments are currently being made, with the objective of
reaching the remaining urban population by the end of 1986.
2.       Meanwhile,  the Government of Tunisia and the national water supply
authority, SONEDE, have embarked on a special program to accelerate the
installation of piped water networks in the rural areas in order to increase
the level of service in the rural sector.  The implementation of this program
is, however, projected to be costly (compared to the investments which have
been made in the urban sector), and the operation and maintenance of water
supply systems in isolated villages to be difficult.  So far, SONEDE has been
financing more than 80 percent of its investments through cash generation,
customers'  contributions  and  loans.   However,  the  continuation  of  such  a
financial scheme in the rural areas appears difficult, in view of the high
capital and operating costs, and the low revenues expected in these areas.
3.       SONEDE has also operated and maintained the systems it has built in
the country using revenues in larger agglomerations to cross-subsidize
services in small centers.  But so far SONEDE has limited its activities to
villages with a population over 500.  Systems in smaller villages, which are
planned and executed by the "Direction du Genie Rural" of the Ministry of
Agriculture, are operated and maintained by offices of the governorates.  At
present, while SONEDE's operating performance is considered satisfactory, the
operation and maintenance of the systems served by the governorates are
inadequate.  To improve such operation and maintenance,  an alternative would
be to put SONEDE in charge of all operations in the sector.  But this would
entail high operating expenses and a large expansion of SONEDE's present
organization.

4.       It  is evident  that  the  investments  and operating expenses  in the
sector would have to some extent to be supported by the larger revenues
generated in the urban areas.  But cross-subsidization of the tariffs already
exist in the urban sector, and higher subsidies may render the cost of water
supply services in the urban areas unaffordable to low and medium income
people.  The extent to which such cross-subsidization may be afforded by the
urban population and its effects on the financial viability of SONEDE, should
be first investigated in the way to define an appropriate financial strategy
for the sector development.   Following such investigation,  an organizational
framework to assure adequate operation and maintenance of the proposed works
would be presented.
Methodology
5.       The proposed study includes a complete  evaluation of:  (i) progress
accomplished  in providing water  supply  services  in  the  country;  (ii)  the
current levels of services in the rural sector; (iii) the existing operating
organizations; and (iv) what remains to be accomplished to serve a certain
optimum level of the rural population.   The study would cover both  (a) the
technical and operational aspects in the sector, such as the per capita
consumption, the conditions of the water supply facilities and the quality of
the services; and (b) the financial aspects, such as the cost of providing the
services, the levels and affordability of the tariffs, and the financial
performance  of  SONEDE.   Following  this  evaluation,  an  analysis  of  the
financial options available to SONEDE in order to reach the service level
objective by a target date would be carried out.
Data Collection
6.       During this first phase of the study, the following elements of the
sector would be updated:
(i)    the   percentage   of   urban   population,   agglomerated   rural
population and dispersed rural population already served;
(ii)    the  number  and  size  of  cities  and  rural  villages  already
provided with water services, the geographical repartition of
these cities and villages and the distribution of the total
population in these locations;
(iii)    evaluation  of  the  capacity  of  the  existing  systems,  water
production,   conditions   of   the   production   facilities   and
distribution networks and quality of the services; and
(iv)    water consumed for different types of usage,  per capita water
consumption and unaccounted-for water.

Sector Goals
7.       Based on the above data and the evolution of the service levels in
the last ten years, SONEDE in agreement with the Government would set out a
realistic goal for the service levels to be reached by the year 2000.   In
establishing the goal, consideration should be given to the limitation of the
country's construction industry and water resources, and consequently to
appropriate levels and convenient means to supply different strata of the
population.   The  required  investments  to meet  the  goal,  together  with  a
scheduling of the investments will be determined.
Tariff Studies
8.       Once  the sector goal has been  set out,  a review of  the national
tariff structure would be carried out.  A major objective of the review is to
determine the cost that different consumer groups should be charged for the
services provided to them. Four main groups are to be considered: domestic,
public, industrial and commercial, and tourism. The required water demand and
pressure for each of these groups should be evaluated to determine their
special  requirements  together  with  their  costs  for  SONEDE.   Within  the
domestic group, additional investments and operating expenses, required to
meet above-average demand, would be calculated to estimate their effect upon
the tariffs.
9.       The average cost per m3 of water supplied to each group would then
be calculated  and  compared  to the existing  rates.   The  tariffs  should  be
examined and evaluated for:
(a)    their economic efficiency,  in terms of their reflection of the
estimated long-run marginal costs of the services;
(b)    their  effect  (if any)  on  the  forecast  water  sales,  and  the
adequacy of the resultant total revenues to cover costs;
(c)    whether  the  levels  of  charges  are  within  the  reasonable
ability-to-pay of the consumer groups, and whether a case exists
on these or any other grounds for concessionary rates to be
applied to particular domestic consumer groups or levels of
consumption; and
(d)    their effectiveness in discouraging waste and inessential use of
water.
Financial Mechanism
10.      In  this  third  phase  of  the  study,  an  evaluation  of  appropriate
financial policies in the sector would be carried out.  Based on the proposed

investments in the sector (para. 7) and the current and projected tariffs, the
financial performance in the sector would then be evaluated.   In particular
the following should be thoroughly examined:
(i)    the extent to which internally generated funds would cover the
operating expenses including debt service (interest and loan
amortization);
(ii)    the extent to which internally generated funds, after payment of
debt service, would finance capital expenditures in the rural
areas;
(iii)    the means of recovering the cost of supplies delivered free, if
any; and
(iv)    the extent of cost recovery from the beneficiaries as measured
by;
(a)   the internal financial return comparing the revenues to be
derived to t:he investment costs; and
(b)   the annual  financial  rate  of return which  SONEDE  would
realize comparing its net operating income before interest
to the average net revalued fixed assets.
Cross-Subsidization
11.      The costs of providing water to different  locations with different
population sizes would be compared to determine the systems with excess funds
and those whose operations are subsidized by SONEDE.   The current  level of
cross-subsidization would be calculated and a projection of this level should
be made assuming that water supply services should be extended to small rural
agglomerations.   Consideration should be given to various  levels of cross-
subsidization.
Organizational Aspects
12.      A study of possible organizations that could be put in place in small
and isolated villages in order to lower SONEDE's operating expenses would be
carried out.  This could be accomplished through the involvement of the rural
population in the operation and maintenance of the systems. To this end water
users' associations could be set up in the villages.   Another way might be
through management contracts with individuals or existing organizations for
the operation of the systems.   After careful consideration of the different
possibilities, SONEDE would make specific recommendations concerning the type
of  organization  that  should  be  set  up  in  the  villages,  including  legal
procedures to be followed in est:ablishing the proposed organizations.

Financing Plan for the Sector
13.      After an acceptable level of cross-subsidization has been set out,
and based on the proposed organizations for operations in the villages, a
financing plan for the proposed investments in the sector would be
established. On the basis of forecasts of operating costs, future investments
and replacement of obsolete assets, and revenues available from the proposed
tariffs, projections would be made of the resultant cash flows from
operations. The need and conditions of funds to be provided to SONEDE by the
Government, in addition to loans to be contracted by SONEDE, would be
specified in the financing plan.
14.      At  the  conclusion  of  the  review,  an  analysis  of  the  financial
policies in the sector would be carried out.  Recommendation would be made of
the measures and policies to be adopted by SONEDE to ensure the continuing
development and self-financing of the sector.

RURAL WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SELECTION AND REVIEW OF SUBPROJECTS
1.       Consideration would be given to installing a water distribution net-
work in a village to the extent that the village is located close to an
existing water transmission pipeline or has its own water resources.  In both
cases, the water source considered must represent the least cost alternative
supply to the village. Under the proposed project, water supply systems would
be installed in villages with a 1983 population varying between 100 and 1500.
In principle, priority would be given to the most populated villages, since
the per capita investment cost decreases as the population increases.
However, SONEDE would also take into account the sanitary conditions
prevailing in a village, part:icularly with respect to the existing water
supply sources.
2.       For each subproject,  SONEDE would  prepare  an appraisal note which
would cover the following aspects:
- The physical and economic characteristics of the village where the
subproject will be executed, the population recorded by past cen-
suses and the forecast of future population.
- Forecast of future water consumption and number of service lines,
evaluation of the pesrcentage of population served.
- Feasible alternatives to supply the village with water.
- Calculation of the estimated costs of feasible alternatives, and
economic comparison of these alternatives.
- Selection and justification of the proposed scheme, preparation of
detailed cost estimates and programmation of the proposed works.
- Forecast of water sales and other revenues.
-  Type of organization that SONEDE would put in place to operate and
maintain the water supply system in the village considered.

ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 3
-  Calculation  of  future  operating  expenses,  evaluation  of  staff
needs, management system and relations with SONEDE's regional
offices and headquarters.
-  Calculation of the per capita investment cost.
-  Conclusions and recommendations.
3.       The per capita investment cost (C) would be expressed in terms of the
1983 prices and is the relation between the proposed investments in 1983 pri-
ces and the mid-1983 population of a village.   Any subproject with a 1983
population (P) and a cost (C) lower than or equal to the calculated average
cost plus two and a half standard errors of estimate, as shown in the attached
table, would be automatically eligible for financing under the proposed Bank
loan.
4.       A subproject with a cost (C) higher than the limit stated above, but
for which SONEDE wishes to have the Bank financing, would have to be approved
by the Bank.  To this end,  SONEDE would submit to the Bank a justification
note outlining the reasons for proposing the subproject, its special characte-
ristics, the particular conditions of the subproject, and a socio-economic
study of the village.   This note would accompany  SONEDE's appraisal of the

TUNISIA
RURAL WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
Income Statements
1.   Internal Inflation  -  The following inflation rates were used:
1983                 10%
1984                  9%
1985/1987             8%
1988 and thereafter  7%
2.   Operating Revenues
(i)  Projections of Water Sales and House Connections
Future water sales were estimated on the basis of a
mathematical model relating sales to numbers of house
connections.   Water consumption is projected to increase by
5.5 percent in 1984, diminishing afterwards to reach 3.0
percent in 1991.  Sales in rural areas to be serviced under
the project are added to the projected sales. To achieve the
projected sales, SONEDE should execute an average of 47,450
house connections annually during the projection period.
(ii)  Water Sales Revenues
Tariffs are projected on the basis of the requirement of
SONEDE's   financial  objectives.    The  average  tariff  is
projected to increase from its 1983 level of D 0.223/m3 in
two or three year increments to reach a level of about
D 0.350/m3 by the year 1991.

ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 5
(iii) Meter Rental and Maintenance
Included hereunder are meter rental and maintenance charges
levied on all connections. The average fee which included
D 3.89 for meter rental and D 2.92 for maintenance till
mid-1983 was increased thereafter to a total of D 13.62 plus
a service tax of 8.7 percent.  Revenues are calculated on the
mid-year average number of connections.
(iv) New Connections
Connections  are  the  property  of  the  customers.   They  are
installed  by  SONEDE  and  their  cost  is  billed  to  the
customers.  The 198.2 average cost of a connection of D 106.0
includes overhead expenses amounting to 15 percent of the
total cost.  A service tax of 7.52 percent is levied on the
labor and overhead expenses.
(v) Miscellaneous
Includes other revenues and interest on loans made to
customers to finance their house connections.   The loans are
repaid in five years, with an interest rate of 11 percent per
annum.
3.       Operating Expenses
(a)  Personnel:  Personnel expenses are projected to increase by
an annual average of 13 percent to cover expected increases
in staffing, norrnal salary increases and adjustments for
inflation.
(b) Fuel: Vehicle fuel is projected to increase in quantity by
3 percent per year, and power consumption for pumping by 6
percent on average per year over the 1982 levels.
(c)  Chemicals;   Based  on  the  forecast  production,  they  are
projected to increase annually by about 6 percent.

ANNEX 19
Page 3 of 5
(d)  Materials;   Their  quantities  are  based  on  the  estimated
number of new connections during the year, the total length
of main extensions (450 km/year) and current maintenance
programs.   The average cost (in 1982 prices)  of materials
for a house connection is estimated to be D 47.6 and for an
extension D 6.86 per meter.
(e)  Taxes:  Calculated according to their nature:  a tax of 4.3
percent is levied on water sales, 7.52 percent on services
rendered and 1.5 percent on salaries.
(f)  Capital Expenses:   This represents the cost of extensions
(material, labor, overhead and taxes) included in the
foregoing items which are constructed by SONEDE for itself
and transferred to its assets.
(g)  Depreciation:   Calculated at straight-line rates based on
the estimated service lives of major asset components. The
annual average depreciation rate approximates 3 percent
through the projection period.
CASH FLOW STATEMENTS AND BALANCE SHEETS
Fixed Assets
4.       Project  facilities  are  incorporated  in  SONEDE's  fixed  assets'
accounts as follows:
Year                   Amount
(DT Million)
1986                    11.83
1987                    11.83
1988                    17.75
1989                    17.75
Government contributions are increased accordingly.
Customers' Contributions
5.       Include a fixed fee of D 1.5 per meter of property frontage of up to
100 meters per extension and the estimated cost of the extension required
beyond the first 100 meters.   The projections are based on average frontage

Page 4 of 5
fee to be paid by each new customer and on the past average for an extension
(diameter, length and labor) adjusted for inflation.
Long-term Advances
6.       These mainly represent loans made to low-income customers for house
connections and related cost of extension.  At least five percent of the cost
of a connection and extension must be paid in cash; the remainder can be paid
in five years with interest charged currently at 11 percent per annum.
Accounts Receivable
7.       Receivables for water consumption are assumed to be 45 days of sales
for private customers, and i-our months of sales for public and municipal
customers.   Other  receivables  are  projected  to  vary  slightly  over  the
projection period.  Bad debts are projected to be around 0.8 percent of total
revenues.
Inventories
8.       In 1982 inventories represented about six months of consumption of
materials,  fuel and chemicals.  As from 1983 onwards they are projected  to
remain at an average of five months.
Accounts Payable
9.       Accounts payable are projected as follows:
(i)  Suppliers - two months of total capital expenditures and
purchase of materials.
(ii)  Retention Money - 6.75 percent of annual investments.
(iii)  Customers' Deposits - D 7.2 per new customer in 1983 and
thereafter adjusted in accordance with projected tariff
increases in the following years.
Long- and Medium-Term Loans
10.            Borrowings include:
(a)  Existing   Bank   loans   and   borrowing   from   other
international  lenders.   The  loans were calculated on
the  basis  of  expected  disbursements  and  terms  of
repayment.

(b) The portion of the Bank loan onlent to SONEDE for financing
house connections.   It is repayable over a period of 17 years
including a four-year grace period at an interest rate of 10.5
percent per annum.
(c) Expected borrowings from unidentified sources for projects which
will start after 1984. It is assumed that these borrowings will
be charged at interest rates between 4 and 8 percent per annum,
with an average repayment period of 18 years including a
four-year grace period.
(d) Medium-term borrowings, to repay SONEDE's existing short-term
debt in 1983 would be repaid over a period of seven years at an
annual interest rate of 9.75 percent.
