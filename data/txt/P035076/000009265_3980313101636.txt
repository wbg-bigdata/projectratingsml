Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The Project's overall objective is to support the Borrower's aim of enhancing the ability of Zambia's electricity supply industry to
provide electricity at least cost and in an efficient, sustainable manner to stimulate more and inclusive growth in the Zambian
economy (see section 5). To assist GRZ in realizing this objective, the Project will support:
(a) the Borrower's policy of establishing an institutional and regulatory framework conducive to sustainable efficiency and private
participation in the power sector,
(b) improving the efficiency of ZESCO, the national electricity utility, through capacity-building measures and a commercialization
plan based on corporate autonomy and management accountability which will enhance the Company's resource mobilization and
include such actions as separating the accounting for generation, transmission and distribution;
(c) improving technical efficiency and the quality and reliability of supply in ZESCO's physical system through rehabilitation of, and
loss reduction in, the existing generation, transmission and distribution systems; and
(d) implementing a Rehabilitation and Development Program for the Gwembe-Tonga, a group who were unsuccessfully resettled
during the construction of the Kariba Dam project.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

3. Benefits and target population:
The project benefits derive from: (a) Facilitating power sector reform aimed at putting the power sector on a least cost and
financially sustainable path, to be achieved by support for: (i) setting tariffs on a cost-recovery basis, (ii) commercializing ZESCO,
(iii) operationalizing the Energy Regulation Board (ERB), and (iv) attracting private sector financing for new generation and
transmission projects; (b) Improving the quality and reliability of supply of electricity, primarily for the industrial and commercial
consumers, which account for more than 80 percent of ZESCO's sales; and (c) support for the improvement of the socio-
economic/environmental conditions of the Gwembe-Tonga who were displaced by the Kariba dam.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: S years
Executing agencies: MEWD and ZESCO
Project coordination: (a) ZESCO has created a project implementation management unit (PIU) headed by a Project Director
reporting directly to ZESCO's Managing Director. The Project Director will be assisted by project managers appointed to carry out
generation rehabilitation, transmission system rehabilitation and distribution network rehabilitation works (See Section 16b). The
Environmental and Social Affairs Unit (ESU) of ZESCO will execute the environmental aspects of the project, except for the
Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation Development Program (see (b) below). A steering comunittee headed by the Managing Director will
maintain coordination with ZESCO management. The steering committee will also facilitate transferringvarious project
components to the relevant ZESCO directorates after their completion.
(b) For the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development Program, ZESCO will set up a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the
field, in Siavonga. The PMU will report to a steering committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the MEWD. To provide
continuity and transparency for the project, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee would be a distinguished Tonga (eminent person)
from the Gwembe valley. In addition, the steering committee will include representatives of the other involved ministries (e.g.
agriculture, health, transport), local government, and will have a strong representation from within the community. The PMU
Manager (from ZESCO) will be assisted by technical specialists, skilled in the areas of road construction, water resources
development, land use, rural electrification and health services and an international advisor.
(c) The Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) will coordinate the Kariba Dam Safety program.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ), through its Ministry of Energy and
Water Development (MEWD) as well as ZESCO's Board.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: ZESCO's accounts, including financial statements, special accounts
and statements of expenditures will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. For the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation
and Development component as well as the implementation of the Zambia Hydropower Development Policy (HPP) component,
MEWD has been requested to open a project account. MEWD's project account, special account and statement of expenditures will
be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
(a) AU physical components of the project will be undertaken by competent contractors under the supervision of qualified
consultants. All project components, (except the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development component) will be overseen by a
ZESCO Project Implementation Unit (PIM), headed by a Director, reporting directly to the Managing Director. The PIU will be
assisted by an Advisor with international experience in project management. For the Gwembe-Tonga component, this will be
overseen by a ZESCO PMU, reporting directly to the Permanent Secretary of MEWD. The PMU will be assisted by an international
advisor, skilled in implementing rural development projects. In addition, the ESU will regularly monitor and report on all the
environment aspects of the project; and
(b) Regular IDA and other Donor missions at least every six months.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project  The Zambia CAS report 15761-ZA, dated June 25, 1996 was discussed by the
Board on July 18, 1996.
The project supports the GRZ and CAS objective to promote private sector development and greater public sector efficiency to
stimulate more and inclusive growth. The Power Rehabilitation Project is included in the lending program of the most recently
discussed CAS. The project supports the objective of fostering growth through the rehabilitation of the existing grid and thereby
providing reliable power for Zambia's development and particularly for the copper industry which accounts for some 80 percent of
Zambia's export earnings. The Project also promotes private sector development through: (a) facilitating the operationalization of
the Energy Regulation Board and (b) supporting the preparation of and promulgation by GRZ of a Hydropower Development and
Transmission Policy to attract private sector financing of all new major generation and transmission projects. Finally, the project
supports public sector efficiency through emphasizing the paramount importance of putting the power sector on a sound financial
footing including ZESCO's commercialization.
6. Main sector issues and Government Strategy:
Main Sector Issues:.
The main issues in Zambia's power sector relate to its efficiency, commercialization, financing and coverage.
Efficiency performance is mixed, with transmission performance being good and performance on generation and distribution being
low, due to low generator availability and high distribution losses respectively.
Commercial performance has been extremely poor. ZESCO's rate-of-return (ROR) on revalued assets was unsatisfactory over the
last five years for which audited accounts were available; in three of these years the ROR was negative. ZESCO was unable to settle
its debts satisfactorily due to very low tariffs for both the mining and non-mining sectors, poor cost controls and high debt volume.
In addition, there is evidence of overstaffing in ZESCO.
Financing of new investments in the power sector has been difficult because of ZESCO's very weak financial position and because of
the many other priorities on the Government's budget.
Coverage is low and varies markedly by province. According to the 1990 census, around 14 percent of households use electricity for
lighting. ZESCO added about 20,000 consumers during the period 1990/91-1994/95.
Government Strategy:
GRZ's strategy for realizing its goal of optimal development of Zambia's electricity supply industry is to establish an institutional
and regulatory environment to enable private sector participation. In the short-term, the aim is to improve sector performance by
commercializing ZESCO in order to enhance resource mobilization. The instruments of the strategy include GRZ's promulgation of
its National Energy Policy (1994), a new Electricity Act which permits private investment (1995) and the Energy Regulation Act
(1995) under which an Energy Regulation Board (ERB) was established in 1997. In 1996, the GRZ signed a Performance Contract
with ZESCO which emphasized commercial operation and efficient technical supply. The Performance Contract has proved to be a
useful tool for setting and monitoring performance targets in Zambia's power sector. In relation to increasing electricity coverage,
GRZ created a Rural Electrification Fund (REF) through a 10 percent levy on electricity sales. Guidelines on the selection of rural
electrification projects for financing by this Fund were promulgated in January 1995.
To develop a sector restructuring plan, the GRZ, under the preparation of this Project, sponsored a study (undertaken by London
Economics) to advise on the restructuring of the Zambian power sector and submit an action plan for consideration. In addition,
with assistance provided under preparation of this project, GRZ initiated the formulation of a Hydropower Development and
Transmission Policy aimed towards inducing private sector development of major hydroelectric and transmission projects.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Sector Issues
The principal sector issues addressed by the project include efficiency; commercialization; and financing.
(a) The Project will support regulatory and institutional reform through the following activities:
(i) Support the efficient operation of the ERB and assist in its capacity building; and
(ii) Support the preparation and promulgation of a Hydropower Development and Transmission Policy to promote the private
sector,
(1) The Project will support the commercialization of ZESCO through supporting:
(iii) Sound tariff policy, including adequate sales arrangements with the mining sector,
(iv) Separation of accounts for the generation, transmission and distribution functions; and
(v) Capacity building in ZESCO; and
(c) The Project will support the least-cost development of the power sector, through focusing on efficiency improvements, loss
reduction, and the rehabilitation of ZESCO's generation, transmission and distribution systems.
Strategic Choices
Section 8 below discusses the key strategic choices made in addressing sectoral issues under the proposed Project.
4



8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatives were evaluated for the sectoral reform and restructuring components; for the physical components of the proposed
Project (economic analysis); and the possible inclusion of a rural electrification (RE) component.
(a) The issue of private vs. public participation in the proposed Project was considered in the preparation of the sector restructuring
component and was addressed by the London Economics Study "Re-structuring Zambia's Power Sector." The finding was that
private sector participation will develop once the sector is profitable and it is clear how the sector will be regulated. Therefore,
Project actions in this regard will aim at strengthening sector operations and developing an enabling regulatory framework for
private participation (see Section 7a). In the medium-term, the distribution sub-sector may provide an entry for the private sector
through a competitively-bid operations contract.
(b) Economic Evaluation of Alternatives. The economic analysis verifies that the Project meets the aimed objectives better than the
alternatives (alternative expansion plans, different technical specifications, scales and timing). See Section 13 and Annex 4.
(c) Rural electrification. The Project does not include a rural electrification component because the GRZ is raising funds for rural
electrification through its REF (section 6). However, there are some problems with the management of these funds, particularly the
collection and release of funds to ZESCO so that the company can efficiently implement the Rural Electrification program. GRZ has
agreed to prepare an action plan to speed up the collections and release of Rual Electrification funds and ensure efficient
management of the Fund.
(d) The project team also considered including a demand-side management component in the project. However, it was decided not
to include this component (except for limited training/TA for some exceptional cases) because of the poor prospects for success,
given the financial state of many of the potential industry beneficiaries and their imminent transition to private ownership.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other dcv elopment agencies (completed, ongoing and planned):
The Bank has a long-standing relationship with the Government going back to pre-independence times. Altogether, the Bank has
had 10 operations (loanstcredits) in the energy sector of which five were in the power sector, four in the petroleum sector and one in
the coal mining sector. Over the last twelve years, the Bank approved only one operation in the energy sector: the Petroleum Sector
Rehabilitation Project (Credit No. 2621). Two years elapsed between Board Presentation and effectiveness of this project. This was
partly due to the fact that it took a long time to sign a contract with a consortium of international oil marketing companies to
manage the oil products terminal in Ndola. No power operation has been prepared for more than twenty years. Under the two
Privatization and Industrial Reform Credits (PIRCs), (Credit Nos. 2405 and 2523) and the PIRCTA Credit, IDA has supported the
initiation of power sector reform including the dissolution of Zambia Industry and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO); the preparation of
a Performance Contract between the GRZ and ZESCO, that sets out agreed expectations and obligations relating to the performance
of Zambia's power sector; and a detailed training program for, inter alia, stakeholders on issues relating to the institutionalization of
the Energy Regulation Board.
Several donors including AfDB, CIDA, DANIDA, EIB, FINNIDA, NORAD, SIDA, and the Governmuent of Ireland have provided
or are providing financial project support to ZESCO and MEWD.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design: The major lesson learned from the projects in section 9 is the need to
address sectoral, regulatory, tariff, institutional as well as project policies/issues prior to project approval. (See the Conditions of
Effectiveness set out in Section 23.) The key issue in implementing the physical components relates to the need to minimize start-up
delays. Project design addresses this by initiating procurement as early as possible in project preparation. Accordingly, submittal of
draft bidding documents for all the major project components (except for the rehabilitation of the Victoria Falls Power Station) was
made a condition of Negotiations.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
This project has been prepared at the specific request of the Government. Specific actions demonstrate GRZJZESCO commitment to
the project and its objectives. First, though project preparation costs were substantial - reaching approximately US$7 million (See
Annex 7 for more detail) -- GRZtZESCO picked up a considerable amount of these costs (estimated at US$1.5 million) when some
donors found it difficult to support project preparation because of concerns about governance issues. Second, ZESCO increased
tariffs by approximately 5 percent, in USS terms, for sales to Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines' Power Division (ZCCM/PD)
(effective 1/1/1997) and by approximately 30 percent for all other consumers in Zambia (effective 2/1/1997). ZESCO implemented a
second substantial tariff increase of approximately 40 percent for all consumers (except ZCCM) in Zambia on 7/1/1997 and another
increase will become effective from January 1998. As of 12/1/97, ZESCO has implemented a tariff increase of approximately 50
percent in US$ terms for sales to the new owners of ZCCM/PD.

12. Value added of Bank support:
The Zambian power sector has suffered over the years from unsatisfactory performance primarily caused by tariffs below costs and
the lack of financial resources for maintaining and expanding the system. Bank involvement in this project is based on the
attainment of financial viability as the overriding goal for the power sector. The Bank is acting as a catalyst for reforming the
power sector through bringing to bear 'best practice' experience on the reform process as well as building consensus amongst the
various stakeholders on the reform agenda, including greater involvement of the private sector and capacity building. In addition,
since the Project is a sectoral investment operation, the Bank is facilitating the mobilization of resources for the largest power project
in Zambia in more than twenty years. In this context, the Bank has financed part of the project preparation under the PPF, and
mobilized/facilitated resources from 7 donors (DANIDA, EIEB, NORAD, SIDA, the Governments of Belgium, Ireland and Japan) to
prepare the rest of the project. Finally, the detailed project-related discussions with the Bank missions over the last two years have
lead to noticeable improvements in Govermnent and ZESCO's understanding of various factors relating to project preparation and
implementation particularly in the areas of accounting/finance, engineering/procurement and environmental management.

The proposed project will have significant economic benefits for Zambia because of the avoidance of an electricity demand deficit,
savings from the improved efficiency of the power systems, and the improvement of service reliability to final electricity users. The
project will also have substantive financial benefits for ZESCO from the operational cost and loss savings, and the increase in sales
revenue. For purposes of the cost benefit analysis, the project has been separated into 7 economically independent rehabilitation
components:' (1) Kariba North Bank power station; (2) Kafue Gorge power station; (3) Victoria Falls power station; (4) the
transmission system; (5) distribution system in Lusaka; (6) distribution system in the Copperbelt (Ndola); and (7) the distribution
system in the Copperbelt (Kitwe). The loss reduction project was not analyzed given its low cost and large expected benefits. The
economic analysis was conducted to: (a) define the best options to achieve each component at least cost; (b) verify that the benefits
were enough to justify the commitment of resources to the project; (c) examine the risks and uncertainties that may impair the
project's expected outcomes; (d) test the sensitivity of the investment project to changes in its costs and benefit flows; and (e)
compute the percentage of the net benefits going to lower income groups (distributional coefficient) and to the GRZ's budget (fiscal
coefficient).
For generation, the least cost options were determined by simulating the alternative interconnected system expansion plans with the
WASP IH computer model. In all cases, the discounted system costs with the hydro rehabilitation components were cheaper than its
alternatives by 5 to 10 percent on average.
The cost benefit analysis of the total rehabilitation project shows a reasonable economic rate of return (ERR) of 29 percent, with a
net present value of USS160 million at 1997 prices with a 12 percent discount rate. This result is compatible with other
rehabilitation projects, which usually have ERRs in the range of 20 percent or higher. For generation, the ERR for Kariba North
hydro station stands out at 50.1 percent. This significant ERR is explained by the poor condition of the plant and the large amount
of secondary energy made possible immediately after rehabilitation. The ERR of Victoria Falls is 31.5 percent, while for Kafue
Gorge 36.9 percent. The ERR for the transmission component is estimated at 19.4 percent, while those for the distribution
components of Lusaka, Ndola and Kitwe stand at 28.1 percent, 36.5 percent, and 20.1 percent, respectively. Table 1 below
summarizes the main results of the economic appraisal, while Annex 4 presents the details of the analysis.
'An independent project is defined as that component, which if excluded from the investment program, leaves the NPV of the
remaining projects unchanged. This is distinguished from mutually exclusive projects (or project design options) for which
accepting one necessarily excludes accepting another.

Risk and Sensitivity Analysis: Projects in Zambia face a considerable degree of risk. Several of the risks are associated with the
macroeconomic and political uncertainties facing all developing countries. Others, however, are specific to the nature of the
components, including the uncertainties related to the effects of the proposed components on the existing generation, transmission
and distribution systems. A risk analysis was performed to estimate the probability associated with each component outcome. As
Table 1 above indicates, the proposed components are robust and have a small likelihood of being uneconomic. The results suggest
that the probability of achieving the overall project ERR of 29 percent is at least 38 percent. If this probability of achievement is
considered too low, the analysis estimated the ERR of 27.5 percent with a certainty of 75 percent. The assumptions, rationale and
results of the risk analysis for each component are described in more detail in Annex 4.
A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the ERRs of each project component to changes in key cost and benefit
variables which are subject to risk and uncertainty. The results also confirm that the proposed investments have attractive and robust
economic indicators, as only with very large increases in costs or substantial decreases in benefits, would the ERRs fall below the
opportunity cost of capital of about 12 percent. For instance, the investment costs for the Victoria Falls component would have to
increase by more than 40 percent, for its ERR to drop below 12 percent. Tariffs are the single most important variable affecting the
economics of the project. If tariffs decline more than 25 percent in real terms, the ERRs of several components would suffer.
Therefore, it is critical that the agreed tariff implementation schedule is maintained with as little deviation as possible. A summary
of the changes in the cost and benefit streams of each component that would be required for the ERRs to fall below the 12 percent
benchmark rate is presented in Annex 4.

Financial Analysis: The financial analysis of the components also shows that they have financial rates of return (FRR) higher
than the benchmark 10 percent financial rate. The overall FRR of the project is 21.8 percent, with a net present value of US$105
million. The FRRs in generation are: Kariba North hydro station, 29.3 percent; Victoria Falls, 13 percent; and Kafue Gorge, 14.3
percent. The FRR for the transmission component is 15.1 percent. The FRRs for the distribution components for Lusaka, Ndola
and Kitwe are 26.6 percent, 33.2 percent, and 18.4 percent, respectively.
The risk analysis of the financial outcomes also confirms that the components profiles are robust against the risks that may affect
their implementation and operation. As Table 1 above shows, with a 75 percent certainty, all the FRRs of the project components
are higher than the 10 percent financial benchmark rate. Annex 4 provides the results for the other components.
Distribution Analysis: The distribution analysis of the project flows shows that the income and fiscal distributional impacts of the
overall project are positive. The distribution coefficient of the project (net benefits to unskilled labor and poor residential users as a
proportion of the project's net benefits) amounts to 9 percent, while the fiscal coefficient (net fiscal revenue as a proportion of
project's total net benefits) is 35 percent. The risk analysis suggests that with a 75 percent certainty, the likely distribution
coefficients would decline to 7 percent and 26 percent, respectively.

ZESCO incurred losses in every year but one during that period. Moreover, these losses are understated as depreciation was based
on the historical cost of assets and the expenditure on maintenance in these years was limited by the availability of funds. The major
causes of ZESCO's poor financial performance were: (a) Government control of tariffs, set at levels which did not cover costs (see
below); (b) devaluation of the Kwacha, and as ZESCO's foreign debt and 80 percent of its operating costs are dollar based, this
had a substantial impact; (c) high levels of arrears (see below); and (d) revaluation of Assets led to considerably higher
depreciation charge in FY96. (However, this has also had positive effects on capital structure, as discusssed below.) GRZ and
ZESCO have recently made several important changes that have already begun to improve ZESCO's financial performance in
certain areas, and if maintained will impact well upon ZESCO's future financial position. Changes in tariff setting process
accompanied by appropriate tariff adjustments will have a tremendous impact. In May 1996, a Performance Contract was signed
between the Govermment and ZESCO. The latter has also introduced operational efficiencies, including the rationalization of its
labor force. Despite these positive changes, in 1996/7 due to a higher depreciation charge on account of revalued assets, ZESCO
failed to cover its operating costs -- recording an operating loss of US$16.3 million, and a total loss of US$29.01 million before tax.
On the positive side, stabilization in exchange rates resulted in much lower foreign exchange losses than in previous years (1996/7,
US$7 million as compared to 1995/6, US$25 million). The revaluation of fixed assets added US$1,150 million to equity as a
revaluation reserve, strengthening ZESCO's equity base and capital structure -- in 1996/7, the debt to equity ratio was only 6
percent The 1992 decision to have the ZCCM tariff quoted and paid in US dollars resulted in increased revenues during the period
of major devaluation froml991/2 to 1995/6. As a result of real tariff increases, sales revenues increased during the period 1994/5-
1996/97 by 23 percent in dollar terms, from US$103 million to $127 million, an average annual increase of 11.5 percent.

ZESCO's Tariff. Before 1991, ZESCO was required to obtain government approval for all tariff increases: it developed tariff
recomnmendations and the Government generally approved less than applied for after a lengthy process. Consequently tariffs did
not cover costs, and tariff increases were below the rate of inflation. In 1991, ZESCO was given the autonomy to review tariffs as
needed. Domestic tariffs increased in dollar terms from USc 1.7/kWh in 1994/5 to USc 2.21/kWh in 1996/7, an average annual
increase of 10 percent. The ZCCM tariff increased from USc 1.067/KWh in 1994/5 to USc 1.4/KWh in 1996/7. Negotiations for
tariff increases with ZCCM have always posed a problem as also its late settlement of debt causing significant negative impact on
ZESCO's cashflow. As a part of the tariff restructuring process, ZESCO has commissioned a Tariff Study, financed by the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) which will be used as the basis for establishing an appropriate tariff structure. ZESCO
has agreed to implement the reconunendations of the Tariff Study with regards to tariff structure by April 1, 1998. The levels of
tariff increase required to achieve the financial objectives are provided in Annex 5.

Main Issues.
(a) ZESCO remains exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation, and will need to manage these variables to avoid
negative results on its financial performance. An agreement has been reached that ZESCO would apply an automatic tariff
adjustment mechanism to take account of movements in both local and international exchange rates and inflation. The adjustment
will be premised on tracking the impact of the above variables on ZESCO's operating costs, and subsequently translating these into
an adjustment factor for tariffs. The adjustment would occur quarterly and will not require Ministry approval. Agreement was also
reached that the ZCCM tariff would continue to be quoted in US dollars.
(b) Arrears. Cashflow was ZESCO's critical problem during the period 1994/5 to 1996/7. Both the current and quick ratios were
below one. Collections from ZCCM, Government and other parastatals was a major problem. The position worsened in 1996/7
with 218 days of debt outstanding. As a result during this period, ZESCO's overdraft increased from US$1.4 million to US$15
million. Strong efforts need to be made for recovery of arrears, and disconnection policy needs to be enforced vigorously. An
agreement has been reached between the Ministry of Finance and ZESCO that a clearing house mechanism would be established to
clear outstanding arrears among parastatals and government departments, and ensure that dues owing to ZESCO will not exceed
two months' billing. It was also agreed that ZESCO would submit semi-annual reports on December 1 and June 1 of each year on
its billings and collections. ZESCO would reduce its outstanding balance of electricity sales debts equivalent to 120 days in
1998/99, 90 days in 1999/2000, and 60 days thereafter. As of April 1, 1998, ZESCO will levy a late payment charge of 10 percent
on bills unpaid on the due date. ZESCO agreed to enforce its disconnection policy which includes disconnecting customers with
bills outstanding for 60 days after the due date. Under the project, agreement was reached that ZESCO would maintain a quick
ratio of one, and a current ratio of 1.5.
(c) Demand and Sales. Of ZESCO's three main customer categories, ZCCM, domestic and exports, ZCCM is the most significant,
constituting 54 percent of its energy sales and 46 percent of its revenue in 1996/. ZCCM's relative importance to sales revenue
(which increased from 43 percent in 1994/5 to 46 percent in 1996/7) is larger than its importance in volume of sales which have
stabilized around 4,100 GWh per annum. As a percentage of ZESCO's sales, ZCCM's share increased modestly from 53 percent
in 1994/5 to 54 percent in 1996/7. Although domestic sales increased by 3 percent per annum from 1994/5 to 1996/7 and ZCCM
sales stabilized, overall sales decreased from 7717 GWh in 1994/5 to 7707 GWh in 1996/7 due to the loss of about half of the export
market (to Zimbabwe). Exports decreased from 1,397 GWh in 1995/6 to 860 GWh in 1996/7, and it is expected that the whole
export market will be lost in 1997/8 for a few years. The financial projections are sensitive to demand and ZESCO's ability to
expand its domestic market.
(d) Privatization of ZCCM. GRZ is in the process of privatizing ZCCM. A fifteen year bulk sales agreement (BSA) between the
new owner of ZCCM's Power Division (Copperbelt Energy Consortium) and ZESCO has been reached.

Financial Objectives. In order to improve its financial position, ZESCO has set itself the following financial objectives: (i) For
the Financial Year commencing in 1997, generate revenues sufficient to cover its full operating expenses (including depreciation on
a revalued asset basis); (ii) for the Financial Years commencing in 1998 and 1999, generate revenues to cover: full operating
expenses, increase in net working capital other than cash, debt service, the equivalent of not less than 5 percent of its average
investment; (iii) for the Financial Years commencing in 2000 and 2001, generate revenues to cover: full operating expenses,
increase in net working capital other than cash, debt service, the equivalent of not less than 10 percent of its average investment;
(iv) for the Financial Years commencing in 2002 and beyond generate revenues to cover: full operating expenses, increase in net
working capital other than cash, debt service, and the equivalent of not less than 15 percent of its average investment; and (v) from
Financial Year commencing in 2001, earn an annual return on fixed assets of not less than 1 percent.
The Government and ZESCO have further agreed to carry out not later than December 1 of each year (commencing in 1998), an
annual review of the Performance Contract, and where targets have not been achieved, ZESCO shall prepare an action plan to be
implemented to achieve the targets.
ZESCO's Financial Performance Projections. The results of the financial analysis confirm the viability of implementing the

ZESCO's capital structure will remain sound, with a debt equity ratio of 20 percent or below. The forecasts, which are in line with
ZESCO's financial objectives, indicate a remarkable improvement and strengthening of ZESCO's finances after 1997/8. Electricity
sales are expected to grow by 4 percent per annum for both domestic and ZCCM market, and from 2001/2, the export market is
expected to increase to an annual 750 GWh from 26 GWh. The exports will be primarily to Namibia-- an interconnector between
the two countries is being built. From 1997/8 to 2002/3, sales revenues are expected to grow by 57 percent in dollar terms, an
average annual increase of 9.5 percent due to increases in volume and real tariff increases on domestic customers. The operating
margin is expected to improve from negative (-12.49) percent in 1996/7 to 16.1 percent in 2002/3, and the net profit from negative
(-22.1) percent in 1996/7 to 3.6 percent in 2002/3. Due to a higher capital base resulting from revaluation of fixed assets, return on
equity reaches 0.8 percent by 2002/3 (improvement interrupted by higher interest, debt service and depreciation on the new assets.)
ZESCO's cashflow position improves due to better debt management policies and a low capital investment program. The self
financing ratio improves from 77.8 percent in 1998/9 to 126.5 percent in 2002/3, the current ratio and quick ratio improving to
above 2 by FY03.
Sensitivity. A number of sensitivity tests (Annex 5, Table 5) were performed to analyze the impact of less than favorable events on
ZESCO's financial soundness. Analysis showed that the most critical variables affecting ZESCO's financial performance were
delays in implementing tariff increases and demand. If the ZCCM tariff is not increased to US cents 2. 1/kWh, and only to US cents
1.7/kWh, ZESCO would be in a loss-making position in all but two years during the proejct period: profit would be before service
debt on new loans and the charge of depreciation on new assets. If tariff increases beyond 1999/2000 are only linked to the rate of
international inflation, the profit margin declines from 4% in 2000 to a negative 15% in FY2003. Under scenarios of non-
compliance with the agreed financial objectives, ZESCO's ability to meet the financial covenants becomes limited.

15. Technical Assessment:
The Zambia Power Rehabilitation Project includes a number of physical sub-components which can be grouped into three
categories:
(a) Hydropower plant rehabilitation;
(b) Transmission system rehabilitation; and
(c) Distribution network rehabilitation.
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance, the almost four-decade-old Zambian power system requires extensive rehabilitation work
to ensure its satisfactory operation. The requirements have been defined through the various studies conducted by the consultants.
During the studies, these consultants visited Kariba North Power Station, Victoria Falls Power Station, and Kafue Gorge
Hydropower Station and carried out detailed inspections of the equipment and the civil structures. Similarly, a majority of the
transmission substations and towers were also physically inspected. Physical verification of the condition of the distribution
network in Lusaka and Coppeibelt region was also conducted to identify the required rehabilitation works. In addition, in accord
with the Bank's funding requirements for the rehabilitation of hydroelectric dams of more than l5m height, safety assessments
were undertaken for the Kafue Gorge and Kariba dams.
The seven consultant companies conducting these studies prepared detailed cost estimates, discussed with ZESCO and the
consultants during the Bank's appraisal mission. The total project cost is estimated at US$203.59 million including physical and
price contingencies but excluding taxes and interest during construction. The cost estimates and the assumptions on which they are
based, were considered to be reasonable by the Bank's mission. The physical contingency allowances were found to be adequate.
IDA intends to finance the rehabilitation works on Kafue Gorge hydroelectric plant and part of the transmission and distribution
systems rehabilitation work. IDA will also finance measures required for Kariba Dam Safety Program. IDA also intends to provide
technical assistance for ZESCO's institutional strengthening, the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development program and for
implementation of Zambia's Hydropower and Transmission Policy.
EIB and DBSA have recently completed their appraisals for financing of the Victoria Falls Hydroelectric Station Rehabilitation,
and Kariba North Bank hydroelectric plant. NORAD has expressed interest in financing a part of the transmission system
rehabilitation work. SIDA has expressed interest in financing the supervision of the Kafue Gorge rehabilitation scheme. Other
donors, including CFD, FINNIDA and NDF, have also expressed interest in supporting the project.
The implementation schedules for the various project components were reviewed during the World Bank appraisal mission of
July/August 1997 and found to be reasonable.
A Donors Meeting was held in Lusaka on September 17, 1997 to firm up the packaging and procurements arrangements of the
project's generation, transmission and distribution rehabilitation components. The meeting also provided an opportunity for the
Government to set out in detail its reform agenda for the power sector.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a Executing agencies:
(i) The principal project executing agency will be ZESCO, a wholly owned Government corporation, that was
established under the Zambia Electricity Supply Act (1970). ZESCO is the national utility of Zambia and will be responsible for
executing all aspects of the project, except for the Gwembe-Tonga component. ZESCO manages a network consisting of 1608 MW
of hydroelectric plant and associated transmission and distribution facilities as well as 16.5 MW of isolated capacity. (Its principal
customer, ZCCM/PD, manages a smaller network in the Copperbelt that transmits/distributes power to the copper mines and their
townships. This system is being privatized as part of the overall ZCCM privatization.) ZESCO has been undergoing an upgrading
of its management and staff on its own initiative since new management was appointed after the change in Government in 1991.
This has included extensive training for management and up to 700 staff. This program was augmented by the ZESCO Human
Resources and Capacity Building Study which was carried out in conjunction with project preparation. This study has lead to
recommendations for the institutional strengthening of ZESCO, which will be implemented under the project (See Annex 2). While
ZESCO has managed large rehabilitation projects in the past, it has not managed a project of this complexity, involving multiple
components and many donors. Suitable arrangements are being put in place to manage the project and minimize project
implementation risks. Further information on project management are provided below, while project risks are dealt with in Section
21:
(ii) ZESCO has set up a Project Management Unit (PMU) to implement the Gwembe-Tonga project component at the request of
MEWD, the designated Executing Agency. Further details on those arrangements are given in Section 4 (b); and
(iii) Implementation of technical assistance to support implementation of Zambia's Hydropower Development and Transmission
Line Policy will be undertaken by the Private Power Development Cell which will be set upon issuance by GRZ of that Policy.
11



b. Project management: Because of the Project's complexity and magnitude, it has been agreed with ZESCO that it should be
implemented under a special Project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a Project Director (PD) reporting directly to the
Managing Director (MD). A group of engineers will assist the PD to: (i) monitor the cost and schedule of the project components;
(ii) handle procurement and contractual matters; and (iii) advise the PD, in a timely manner, on any cost or schedule overruns. The
PD will implement the project through Project Managers (PMs), who will manage the project on a day-to-day basis with the
assistance of engineering/management consultants, as appropriate. One consultant will be appointed to supervise each project
component. Each PM will have a project engineer, stationed in the field, and be required to maintain an appropriate level of
coordination during project implementation. A Steering Committee, chaired by the MD, will be established to ensure coordination
among the various ZESCO Directorates and the orderly transfer of the completed project components to the appropriate ZESCO
Directorate. An expatriate advisor will be appointed to assist the PD in project implementation. ZESCO has prepared a Project
Implementation Plan (PIP).
17. Social Assessment:
The social component of the Project aims to improve the conditions of people unsuccessfully resettled in the first Kariba project.
The Bank and the University of Zambia's Institute of Economic and Social Research (INESOR) signed the contract for a study and
action plan for rehabilitation of Kariba-affected peoples in January 1997. That study, "The Rehabilitation and Development
Strategy for the Peoples Affected by the Construction of the Kariba Dam (Gwembe-Tonga)," produced a report (September 1997),
incorprating a Rehabilitation and Development program and cost estimate (see Annex 12). The current cost estimate for the
Rehabilitation and Development Program is US$15.13 million of which ongoing IDA projects, DBSA funding and the RE Fund
(Section 8) will be tapped to assure that all the project sub-components are fully financed.
The Rehabilitation and Development Program includes inter alia: (a) the rehabilitation of 365 km of a key road ("the Bottom
Road") that connects the three districts that have received the resettled people; (b) water resources development combining
improved water supply and improving cropping patterns along the margins of the reservoir that are timed to coincide with the
patterns of reservoir drawdown and refilling; (c) improvement of land use through strengthened agricultural extension facilities,
including a pilot agriculture scheme. In addition, a fund is to be created to support micro-projects dealing with land use; (d)
Upgrading of health facilities and services; and (e) electrification of three of the large villages (Chipepo, CGwembe Boma and
Sinazeze), as well as the area around the reservoir.
Strengthening the Social Affairs professional staff in ZESCO's recently formed Environment and Social Affairs Unit (ESU) is also
included in the proposed Project (Section 18).
18 Environmental Assessment:
A Sectoral Environmental Scoping study for Zambia's power sector, including the proposed Project, was completed in 1995. The
major recommendations of the Study were to: (a) establish an Environmental and Social Affairs Unit (ESU) in ZESCO; (b)
develop a rehabilitation plan for the Kariba Gwembe-Tonga (see Section 17); (c) develop a waste management plan, including for
PCBs; (d) undertake sub-basin-wide environmental and social assessments for upcoming hydropower projects; and (e) encourage
commitment to the ESU by ZESCO's Board and senior management. These recommendations will be addressed under the proposed
project.
The major environmental issue identified in project preparation was the treatment of wastes and harmful substances in some of the
existing hydropower plants and transmission lines. An assessment of waste was included in each of the separate rehabilitation
components of the Project and their management will be addressed during implementation. A study financed by CIDA will develop
a comprehensive program for management/disposal of PCBs, and will be coordinated with the Enviromnental Council of Zambia
(ECZ) and ZESCO. ZESCO has agreed to implement the study's recommendations.
Strengthening the recently formed ESU, which is responsible for planning and implementation of enviromnental and socio-
economic programs associated with ZESCO projects, is a key component in the Project, as is ESU completion of initial training and
work programs. In addition, the ESU will initiate a monitoring and audit program, with monthly reporting requirements. The
program will track project progress in relation to the implementation of environmental and socio-economic activities.
Victoria Falls Hydro Station Rehabilitation Environmental Assessment (EA). The EA on Victoria Falls, a World Heritage site due
to its unique geology, was completed in March 1997 in conjunction with the preparation of the rehabilitation study of the Victoria
Falls hydro station. The EA found no additional impacts associated with the Project. However, the EA found that operation of the
station has had negative impacts, including land degradation, PCB contamination, water management issues and associated
degeneration of tourism and aesthetic loss. To address these issues, the proposed Project includes environmental component for
Victoria Falls which will enhance the ecology and aesthetic value of the site (see section 22). Zambia is a riparian on the Zambezi
river. While the proposed Victoria Falls Rehabilitation component does not alter the flow regime of the Zambezi and does not
require notification, GRZ has agreed to notify the Government of Zimbabwe at the request of EIB.

Watershed Studies in the context of upcoming projects. The focus will be on Kafue in the near-term and the Zambezi River in the
longer-term. In the Letter of Sector Policy, GRZ has indicated its intention to require ZESCO to undertake or cause to undertake
basin-wide environmental and socio-economic studies for new projects on the Kafue river and other important river basins in
Zambia.

Project Preparation. A collaborative participatory approach was used in project preparation by MEWD/ZESCO that involved the
affected community groups, academic institutions (primarily INESOR), nine other donors and, to a lesser extent, intermediary
NGOs and local government (See Annex 13 for further details). This included:
(a) The recommendations of the Power Sector Environmental Scoping Study which were based on an extensive consultation and
information sharing process;
lb) Public consultation that was carried out by ZESCO in the context of the Victoria Falls EA; and
(c) The Gwembe-Tonga study which involved extensive consultation with the people affected by the Kariba project. This study was
conducted by INESOR
In addition, IDA shared information and organized joint missions, where feasible, with other collaborating donors including CFD,
DBSA, EIB, FINNIDA, NDF, NORAD and SIDA. Also, IDA missions visited most of the European donors to consult on project
preparation.
Project Implementation. The approach to information sharing and consultation used during project preparation will be continued
during project implementation and operation.
Sustainability:
20. Key factors for project sustainability include: (a) restructuring of the electricity supply industry, specifically (i) agreement and
implementation of an action plan to follow up on the London Economics report ZAMBIA: Power Sector Reform Studv. The GRZ
has set out its action plan in the Letter of Sector Policy submitted to IDA, and (ii) have a fully staffed and functioning Energy
Regulation Board; (b) raising and maintaining tariffs on cost-recovery levels through an independent incentive-based mechanism
for setting electricity prices; and (c) formalizing an economically and financially sound power sales agreement between the new
owners of ZCCM/PD and ZESCO, which should consider efficiency tariffs without cross subsidies.

compliance with financial and institutional covenants.
22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Some Zambian tour operators would like to see Victoria Falls Power Station closed, as they believe it negatively alters the dry
season flow of the Falls lowering the aesthetic/tourist value of the Falls. However, the diversion of water in the dry season to the
Zimbabwe side of the Falls is largely due to geologic conditions. During the EA done to evaluate the problem there was extensive
consultation with tour operators. Based on this consultation, the EA identified a series of actions to reduce any negative impact of
the power station and its operation on the environment and aesthetics and, further, to take actions to enhance the Falls aesthetic and
tourist appeal. These actions, which are part of the proposed Project under the rehabilitation of Victoria Falls, include: (i)
developing a waste management and site restoration program to mitigate ZESCO's historic impact on the National Park area; (ii)
relocating the majority of staff housing from the Falls to Livingstone and convert the Falls housing to tourist accommodation; (iii)
relocating the intake siphon discharge and reconstruct the original steps to the Falls base; (iv) developing the 1938 power station
into a museum and interpretive center, (v) developing and implementing a water management plan which optimizes power
generation, aesthetic beauty for Victoria Falls and public safety; and (vi) initiating a monitoring and audit program to track project
progress and implementation.

ZAMBIA POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project comprises the following components:
*  Victoria Falls hydropower station rehabilitation;
*  Kafue Gorge hydropower station rehabilitation;
*  Kariba North hydropower station rehabilitation;
*  Kariba Dam Safety;
*  Transmission system rehabilitation;
*  Lusaka distribution network rehabilitation;
*  Copperbelt distribution network rehabilitation;
*  Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development Program;
*  Institutional strengthening of ZESCO including its Environmental and Social
Affairs Unit; and
*  Hydropower Development and Transmission Line Policies.
The following paragraphs provide detailed descriptions of the project components:
VICTORIA FALLS HYDROPOWER STATION REHABILITATION
The Victoria Falls power complex consists of three stations: Station A with an installed
capacity of 8 MW, Station B with 60 MW and Station C with 40 MW. The objective of
the rehabilitation works is to ensure long-term operation of the power system through its
complete new life cycle. The inspection and subsequent identification of the
rehabilitation requirements of all three stations revealed that the rehabilitation of Station
A was economically not feasible, while that of Station B and C proved to be feasible.
Overall, the civil structures are found to be in satisfactory condition and therefore will be
subjected to maintenance work only. In Station B and C the refurbishment of turbines
and valves and generators will be carried out. All the transformers of Station B will be
replaced and in Station C the draft tube will be modified. This will result in the gain in
power output from Station C by generating 100 percent production against the present 70
percent level, and by making all the units in Station B and C operational, which is not the
case at present. This would mean a guaranteed generation of 700 GWh a year from both
the stations.
20



Annex 2
Page 2 of 9
This component also includes an environmental mitigation plan (below), that partly
reflects the location of the power plant in the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park and adjacent
to Victoria Falls - a UNESCO World Heritage Site:
(a)   development and implementation of a waste management (including
PCBs) and site restoration program;
(b)   non-essential staff relocation, the majority of whom will be located in
Livingstone and conversion of on-site housing to medium-class tourist
accommodation;
(c)   relocation of the 48 MW intake scour siphon discharge and reconstruction
of the original step to the Falls base;
(d)   development of Station A into a Power Station Museum and Interpretive
Center;
(e)   development and implementation of a water management plan which
optimizes power generation and aesthetic beauty of viewing the Falls;
(f)   construction of a tourist trolley; and
(g)   technical assistance for project supervision.
KAFUE GORGE HYDROPOWER STATION REHABILITATION
This 900 MW plant with six units of 150 MW each was developed in two stages. The
first stage was commissioned in 1971-72 with the operation of four units, the second
stage added two units in 1976-77. Although normally a station of this age does not
require major refurbishment for at least another 10 years, the March 1989 fire and lack of
adequate maintenance has reduced the energy production far below its designed level.
The average annual production of energy is around 5,000 GWh whereas the designed
generation is calculated to be around 7800 GWh. The present rehabilitation work will
increase the plant availability.
The civil rehabilitation work will include:
*  Removal of aquatic weeds;
*  Stabilization of hillsides by grouting and rock bolts;
*  Corrosion protection painting of the spillway gates;
*  Repair of tunnels, shafts in the power house;
*  Rehabilitation of the cylinder gates;
*  Upgrading of the weed boom matrix;
*  Replacement of a floating boom; and
21

*  Replacement of four single phase transformers;
*  Overhaul of the 330 kV switchgear;
* Replacement of the 17.5 kV switching station;
*  330 kV busbar protection system installation; and
*  Rehabilitation of the relay protection system.
To ensure the safety of plants and personnel, the following rehabilitation works will
be executed:
* Installation of safe escape routes;
* Noise reduction measures;
* Installation of effective ventilation system; and
* Refurbishment of fire cell partitioning.
Technical assistance:
* Technical assistance for project supervision.
KARIBA NORTH HYDROPOWER STATION REHABILITATION
The project component is limited to the refurbishment of the tunnel and the power station
located in the northern bank of the Zambezi River (Zambian side). The Kariba dam
safety program will be handled separately by the Zambezi River Authority.
Based on the detailed inspection of the power plant including the diagnostic testing of all
the 150 MW four units and on the basis of technical audit carried out in February 1996,
the consultant has identified the essential elements of the plant rehabilitation. The
rehabilitation is aimed at increasing the availability of units as per original design and
extending the economic life of the plant.
The civil rehabilitation work will include:
*  Repair of the intake deck and machine hall;
*  Repair of concrete erosion of the penstock and tailrace tunnels;
*  Repair of the penstock drainage gallery and the penstock concrete;
*  Mitigating the effects of the water leakage near the busbars; and
*  Replacement of duct.

*  Repair of the power station lift.
Technical assistance:
* .Technical assistance for project supervision.
KARIBA DAM SAFETY
T'he rehabilitation works required in connection with dam safety are:
*  Constructing and strengthening the concrete mat downstream and adjacent to
the arch dam with deep anchoring, grouting and concrete toe;
*  Providing a developed plunge pool downstream;
*  Replacing hydromechanical and electrical systems; and
*  Rehabilitating of stop logs guides.
*  Technical assistance will also be provided for project supervision as well as
for the preparation of an emergency preparedness plan (EPP). In addition, a
panel of experts (POE) will oversee the safety aspects of the work on the
Kariba and Kafue Gorge dams.
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM REHABILITATION
The rehabilitdtion work covers a large area of the ZESCO transmission system. The total
330 (220 kV) line coverage is 2,500 km and 66/132 kV coverage is 3,500 km.
Substations in the South, Central, Lusaka and Copperbelt regions will be rehabilitated.
The rehabilitation work in telecommunications will be carried to improve system
23



Annex 2
Page 5 of 9
operation. All the proposed protection measures will be compatible with the supervising
monitoring systems.
The general rehabilitation work to be carried out with respect to the high voltage lines
and towers will include:
*  Re-establishment of the earthing system;
*  Replacement of the missing members of the towers;
*  Replacement of the damaged insulated discs;
*  Repair of the deteriorating concrete in tower foundation; and
*  Application of a protection paint coating on the towers.
The substations age varies from 15 to 20 years. Therefore, either overhaul or replacement
of various equipment in substations such as circuit breakers, battery system, compressors
will be taken up. Construction of oil pits will be also carried out. The control and
protection equipment in Kabwe, Kafue, Kitwe, Leopard's Hill, Luano and Pensulo
substations will be rehabilitated. In the 132 kV system, the control and relay protection
system in Coventry Street, Leopard's Hill and Roma substations will be refurbished.
Similar rehabilitation works will also be carried out in the 88 kV and 66 kV systems.
Rehabilitation of the transmission system will increase reliability through reduction in
outages and unserved energy. Some loss reduction in transmission is also anticipated.
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance will be provided for project supervision.
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK REHABILITATION
The lack of reliability in supply along with capacity deficits affect the major distribution
system of ZESCO, which includes the Lusaka region and Copperbelt areas of Kitwe and
Ndola. The former results in numerous unplanned outages while the latter causes
voltage fluctuations. Rehabilitation of the distribution system in these areas is aimed at
improving the voltage levels and reducing the unplanned outages and thereby improving
the quality of supply.
Lusaka distribution system rehabilitation:
Almost 45 percent of switchgear in the substations of this area will be replaced and 43
percent of power transmissions will be reinforced. The SCADA system will be
refurbished. Five new 33/11 kV substations will be constructed and reinforcement work
in cables and lines will be carried out. Distribution transformers will be procured to
replace/add in the substations. The reduction in technical losses from 132 kV to the
24



Annex 2
Page 6 of 9
consumer level is expected to decrease by 2 percent over project life. Technical
assistance for project supervision will be provided.
Kitwe (Copperbelt) distribution system rehabilitation:
The rehabilitation of the distribution system of this industrial area will include the
replacement of all obsolete switchgear, reinforcement of the 33 kV network, replacement
of defective 11 kV cables and construction of the new primary substation to feed the
airport and the growing surrounding industries. The work will include:
* Replacement of about 120 switchgears;
*  Construction of a new 66/11 kV primary substation;
*  Elimination of overloading the 33 kV system; and
*  Replacement of faulty and overloaded lines.
The rehabilitation work will also enable the system to supply power to new consumers,
expected to increase by 3 percentper annum during the project life. Technical losses are
expected to decrease by 1.5 percent over the project life.
Ndola (Copperbelt) distribution system rehabilitation
The Ndola area is expected to face significant growth in the next few years. This growth
in demand will be addressed by the construction of new primary substation at Mushili
and by the reinforcement of the cable and lines rehabilitation. All the faulty 11 kV
underground cable will be replaced.
The rehabilitation work will result in the:
*  Replacement of 47 switchgears and 8 ring main units;
*  Replacement of 2.5 km of 11 kV cable and 68 km of LV line;
*  Construction of the Mushili substation, including 40 km of 33 kV line, 3 km
of 11 kV cable, and 30 km of 1 1 kV line; and
*  Establishment of a SCADA system including a control center on Depot Road
conmected to the Skyways, Pamodzi, Depot Road and Mushili substations.
The rehabilitation work will also enable the system to meet the increasing demand, which
is expected to increase by 2 percent per annum. The reduction in technical losses is
assumed to be 1 percent due to the project.
Technical assistance for the supervision of the two Copperbelt rehabilitation (Kitwe and
Ndola) projects will be provided under one contract.
25



Annex 2
Page 7 of 9
Loss reduction in the Lusaka area:
The network reinforcement program will have a significant effect on the technical losses.
The reduction in the commercial losses will be obtained:
*  By the installation of prepaid or standard meters for unmetered household
consumers;
*  From the replacement of unreliable meters; and
*  From the installation of maximum load and power factor indicators for large
consumers.
It is expected that the metering program will also affect the energy consumption, which,
at present, is quite significant. An appropriate education program on energy conservation
will also be launched. About 30,000 domestic meters will be installed. Technical
assistance will be provided for project supervision.
GWEMBE-TONGA REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM:
The construction of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi river between then Northern and
Southern Rhodesia in 1958 required the resettlement of 57,000 Gwembe-Tonga peoples;
34,000 of these were resettled on the north bank -- now Zambian side. In retrospect, it is
clear that the resettlement was not sufficiently well planned or well implemented.
Consequently, the socio-economic and local environmental conditions of the resettlees
and resident hosts have deteriorated to the point where a rehabilitation of the lands and
social structures will be undertaken by Zambia. This component of the project aims at
improving the life of affected people living in Gwembe valley and its activities are based
on a consultative survey and study of the region prepared by the Institute of Social and
Economic Research (INESOR) of the University of Zambia. The component will balance
infrastructure needs with food production activities.
*  Roads: rehabilitation of the "bottom road" that connects the three
resettlement districts (365 km);
*  Water resources development: water quality survey; supply improvement
measures including tubewells and small dams; and a pilot program for low
cost treatment of water;
*  Land use: development of recession agriculture in Kariba lake drawdown
areas; a pilot rain harvesting project; and agricultural extension activities
regarding cropping patterns, grazing, small-scale irrigation, pest control and
storage of food grains -- a fund will be created to support micro-projects
dealing with land use;
*  Health: Construction and renovation of health clinics, programs for malaria,
bilharzia, cholera and HIV/AIDS; and
26



Annex 2
Page 8 of 9
* Rural electrification: Provision of service to three of the large villages
(Chipepo, Gwembe Boma and Sinazeze) as well as the area around the lake
shore.
ZESCO INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
Based on the studies commissioned to identify. the major areas where actions are needed
to strengthen ZESCO, the following activities will be undertaken under this component of
the project:
* Implementation of a company-change-process project which will result in
development of new company standards, implementation of a corporate
safety platform, introduction of job guarantee mechanism thereby introducing
creativity, innovation, accountability and risk taking by the staff;
* Establishment of a training center in Ndola including the construction of a
new building, supply of equipment (including the setting up of a sub-station
for training purposes) and the setting up of a Technical Library;
* Introduction of recruitment and assignment plans;
* Implementation of manpower planning;
* Implementation of Performance Appraisal Scheme;
* Implementation of changes to the organization structure;
* Preparation/revision ofjob descriptions;
* Outsourcing of non-core ZESCO activities, including construction and
transport;
* Implementation of project management training and core skill training;
* Implementation of health awareness program and life insurance scheme;
* Strengthening of capacity of ZESCO's Environmental and Social Affairs
Unit through the provision of training and technical advisory services;
* Training in dam safety monitoring; and
* Carrying out a feasibility study, by ZESCO engineers (with expatriate
support used on an as and when necessary basis), to enhance the hydropower
engineering capability of ZESCO.
The ZESCO Institutional Strengthening Program will be anchored in the Directorate of
Human Resources who will be supported by an advisor, located in Lusaka for three years.
In addition, an advisor will be hired, for two years, to assist in the establishment of the
Ndola Training Center.
In view of the diverse nature and number of project components, a project management
expert will be hired to assist the Project Director implement the project effectively. In
addition, the project well support the hiring of a Financial Advisor by the Finance
Directorate. The Gwembe-Tonga project will be facilitated by a establishing a Project
Management Unit (PMU) located in that region. The Unit will be supported by an
27

advisor to the PMU manager as well as technical experts in roads, water, land/agriculture,
health and electrification.
ZAMBIA'S HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSMISSION LINE POLICIES
The goal of this technical assistance component is to encourage and facilitate private
sector participation in Zambia's power sector, through developing a "one window"
process, an efficient procurement process and enabling framework. To this end, GRZ
recently developed its Hydropower Development and Transmission Line Policies. The
activities undertaken in this component of the PRP will support the effective
implementation of the Policies and are listed below:
*  Develop the integrated environmental assessment for the Kafue basin, in the
context of developing Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL);
*  Create the organizational framework and procedures for an effective one-
window process;
-  Develop standard legal documentation necessary for projects pursuant to the
Policies;,
-  Develop documentation for Request for Proposal packages for a specific
hydropower facility (KGL) and transmission line (Tanzania-Zambia
Interconnector);
*  Organize and present Zambia's policies and project proposals to prospective
private developers and investors;
*  Provide technical assistance to: a) develop an enabling legal framework for
the implementation and operation of the Hydropower and Transmission
Policies and b) Zambia's recently formed Energy Regulation Board (ERB) to
meet immediate regulatory needs and to effectively implement the Policies in
those matters where ERB action is involved; and
*  Develop the proposed regime for the granting and protection of water rights
necessary to support the Hydropower Policy, including legislative and
administrative amendments of water rights regime insofar as necessary.

A. Overview: The economic analysis was conducted to verify that the Project meets its
objectives better than its alternatives, and that the benefits justify the costs. The Project comprises
generation, transmission, and distribution rehabilitation components.
Cost-benefit analysis was applied sequentially, starting with a simple analysis using
border prices and conversion factors (CF). We assumed a conservative shadow wage rate of 0.50
of the ongoing wage rate for unskilled labor, and a standard conversion factor of 0.875. The
purpose of the analysis was to produce the project's economic indicators, i.e., ERR and the net
present value (NPV) of the project. For the NPV calculation, the social opportunity cost of capital
in Zambia, estimated at 12%, was used.
B. Economic Analysis: In what follows we explain first the background of the economic
analysis for the generation rehabilitation subprojects, then for the transmission and last for the
distribution components.
Generation: These components have three basic objectives: (a) to increase supply to meet in the
most economical manner the forecast increment in demand by increasing the plant's life and
availability; (b) to improve efficiency by increasing operational performance; and (c) to improve
reliability of supply. The rehabilitation thus delays new expansion projects, saves operating costs,
and improves quality of supply. The economic analysis first verified that rehabilitation is the least
cost option by comparing the costs of the alternatives to each generation component: (a) Kariba
North Bank power station; (b) Kafue Gorge power station; and (c) Victoria Falls power station.
Second, once the least cost options were determined, the economic analysis verified that there
were enough benefits to justify the commitment of resources to each component.
The market analysis and forecasts were conducted by ZESCO/EKONO. The demand
forecasts are based on the most likely evolution of the main explanatory variables: income and
outputs, electricity tariffs, number of connections, etc. For the analysis, the high growth scenario
in ZESCO's twenty year master plan has been used for our base case. Under this scenario,
electricity requirements grow at 4.4 percent per annum. This is consistent with IDA's high/base
case projections for Zambia's GDP growth (4%-5% per annum over the period 1996-2006) as
set out in the CAS,, dated June 25,1996.

The least cost option was determined by simulating the alternative expansion plans
within the interconnected system with the WASP model. For each subproject, alternative
technical specifications, scales and timings were appraised. The least cost analysis indicated that
in all three cases, the proposed subprojects were cheaper than their alternatives by a margin of 5
to 10 percent.
Based on the WASP results, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted for each least cost
option. On the cost side, are the investment costs and the operation and maintenance
expenditures. On the benefit side, are the following: (i) willingness to pay (WTP) for the
additional supply (i.e., sales plus consumer surplus associated with the net addition to supply
made possible by each subproject); (ii) the system operation and maintenance costs without the
subproject, which correspond to the resources saved by increasing the availability, operating
efficiency and life of existing assets; and (iii) the improvement in the quality of supply for
existing consumers. Table 4-2 below present a summary of the discounted cost and benefit flows
for each subproject.

Note: Discounted at 12% to mid-1997.
Transmission: The benefits for the "transmission rehabilitation component" are: first, to
increase reliability, through a reduction in outages and unserved energy; second, to increase
capacity and thus prevent supply shortages; and, third, to reduce transmission losses. The
estimates of unserved energy were provided by ZESCO and NorConsult. The expected values of
unserved energy are US 98 per kWh for industry and mining, US 25 per kWh for residential
and agriculture users, and US 49 for services. The increase in net electricity supply was
estimated from the consumers' willingness to pay. The elasticities for each customer class were
assumed based on international experience and the work done by SwedPower. The reduction in
transmission losses was valued at the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) estimated by SwedPower
in their revised case (LRMC2). Table 4-3 presents these parameters, while Table 4-4 shows a
summary of the discounted cost and benefit flows of the transmission component.

Distribution: The distribution rehabilitation components intend to increase net capacity, reduce
losses and improve reliability in the main urban centers of Lusaka, Kitwe and Ndola. According
to census figures, these cities account for about 50 percent of the urban population of Zambia,
Lusaka accounting for 23%, Kitwe and Ndola with 12% each. The additional capacity provided
by the project will enable to meet the increased demand by consumers, which was valued at their
WTP. The reduction in losses was valued at the LRMC. The improvement in reliability was also
valued at the expected unserved energy and their values per user class as stated above. Table 4-5
shows a summary of the discounted cost and benefit flows of the transmission component.

C. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis: A risk and sensitivity analysis was undertaken, first, to
estimate the probability of occurrence of each project indicator, and, second, to evaluate the
impact on the ERR to changes in the key factors affecting the cost and benefit flows. The results
indicate that the proposed investments have attractive and robust economic indicators. For
example, the probability of getting at least (or higher) 31.5 percent ERR for Victoria Falls is 47
percent. Since this probability might not be acceptable to all investors, we thus estimated the
ERR that would be obtained with a certainty of 75 percent, which for Victoria Falls is 25.7
percent. Similarly, as Figure 4.1 below shows for Victoria Falls, we can state with a 90 percent
certainty that the ERR is in the range between 18.5 percent to 42.2 percent.

percent.
Transmission Sensitivity Analysis: Figure 4.3 details the sensitivity results for the transmission
subproject, the largest cost component within our project. The point where the curves intersect
along the X axis corresponds to the 19.4 percent ERR calculated for this component. The ERR
would not drop below our hurdle rate of 12% unless: (a) investment costs increase more than
75%; (b) system costs associated with the net increase in supply/demand increase more than
70%; (c) the tariff declines more than 55%; or (d) the value of unserved energy declines more
than 50%. The benefits regarding loss reduction are negligible.

E. Distribution Analysis: Table 4-7 summarizes the results of the distribution analysis. The
analysis shows that the income and fiscal distributional impacts of the overall project are positive.
The distribution coefficient (net benefits to unskilled labor and poor residential users as a
proportion of the project's net benefits) amounts to 9 percent, while the fiscal coefficient (net
fiscal revenue as a proportion of project's total net benefits) is 35 percent. The risk analysis
suggests that with a 75 percent certainty, the likely distribution coefficients would decline to 7
percent and 26 percent, respectively.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
1.    Over the past six years, as a government entity, ZESCO lacked the autonomy to make
commercial decisions resulting in poor financial performance due to, among other things, low
tariffs which did not cover costs, exacerbated by high inflation and major devaluation of the
kwacha. The reliance on one major customer, the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM),
which accounted for over 50 percent of energy sales, and over 40 percent of revenue, made
ZESCO vulnerable to ZCCM's ability to pay, and the levels of tariffs negotiated. With cashflow a
major constraint due to poor collection and billing systems, ZESCO had to rely on Government
for debt service and on creditors for working capital. The lack of adequate financial management
and accounting systems resulted in qualified audit opinions and lack of accurate and timely
management information for decision making.
2.    During the last two years, in line with the Government of Zambia's policy of
commercialization and privatization of public enterprises, ZESCO has enjoyed increasing degrees
of autonomy over its financial affairs and progress has been made to make ZESCO financially
viable. The Government and ZESCO signed a Performance Contract in May 1996 that sets out
stringent financial and efficiency objectives for ZESCO over the next five years, and grants
ZESCO autonomy in the financial and operational management of the utility. Other areas
addressed include implementation of tariff increases, changing of accounting policies in line with
generally accepted accounting practice, development of a new financial management and
accounting system, the revaluation of fixed assets, implementation of a Customer Information
and Billing system, improved metering and the development of a financial planning computer
model.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS
3.    ZESCO suffers from the lack of up to date financial information due to outdated
accounting systems and understaffing in key areas of treasury management, financial
planning/budgeting, financial accounting and credit control. The result has been qualified
financial statements and the auditors noting concerns over the lack of internal controls, accuracy
of financial data and the lack of financial information flows including monthly management
accounts.
4.    A computerized accounting system which would address ZESCO's information and
internal control weaknesses is under implementation and scheduled to be fully operational in
April 1998. The selection of consultants for the stock and materials management system is in
progress. At Appraisal, it was agreed that the appointment of consultants for the stock and
materials system would be a condition for negotiations.
5.    ZESCO has filled the key managerial positions in the Finance Department, but support is
needed for the managers and the Finance Director to implement the new accounting and financial
management systems and to strengthen the organization skills of finance directorate. ZESCO has
approached SIDA for support through periodical technical assistance for the managers in
treasury, financial planning, financial accounting and credit control. The IDA project will fund an

Revenues and Profitability
8.      As the above summary table indicates, ZESCO's financial performance during the period
1991/2-1996/7 was unsatisfactory. ZESCO incurred losses in all but one year since 1991/2.
Although the operating profit margin was positive, indicating that ZESCO was generating enough
revenues to cover its operating costs, these operating costs are understated as depreciation was
based on the historical cost of assets, and the maintenance costs charged to the profit and loss
account were limited by the availability of funds. ZESCO's financial performance also suffered
from an unsatisfactory tariff policy and the impact of the devaluation of the kwacha on ZESCO's
debt service and its operating costs, 80 percent of which are dollar based.
9.      Salient features of ZESCO's historical financial performance are as follows:
*   ZCCM  market share. Of ZESCO's three main customer categories, export, ZCCM, and
domestic (including commercial, residential, industrial, and services), ZCCM is the most
significant, in 1996/7 contributing 54 percent of ZESCO's energy sales and 46 percent of its
revenue. ZCCM's relative importance has increased more in relation to revenue where its
contribution to ZESCO's sales revenue has increased from 34 percent in 1991/2 to 46 percent
in 1996/7, than in volume of sales which have stabilized around 4,100 GWh per annum, and
as a percentage of ZESCO sales, have increased modestly from 49 percent in 1991/2 to 54
percent in 1996/7 (Annex 5a(2)). The decision to have the ZCCM tariff quoted and paid in
United States dollars resulted in increased revenues during the period of major devaluation
from 1991/2 to 1995/6.
*  ZCCM  tariff. The ZCCM tariff increased from USc 0.359 in 1991/2 to 1.4 cents in 1996/7.
ZESCO's accounting records do not permit an analysis of costs according to customer
categories. An attempt was made to arrive at the costs of supplying energy to ZCCM based on
an allocation of total operating and finance costs, and an arbitrary 8 percent return on assets.
The results indicated the cost coverage ratio to be less than 1 in all but one year, although these
costs are understated (para 8). The cost coverage ratios -re therefore much lower than
41



Annex 5
reflected. ZESCO was not recovering costs on a significant part of its sales. Negotiations with
ZCCM for tariff increases have always posed a problem to ZESCO. ZCCM's failure to mnake
timely payment for services has also had a significant impact on ZESCO's cashflow. The
following tariff increases in dollar terns were implemented in the period 1991/2-1996/7:
1993/4, 70 percent; 1995/6, 15 percent and 1996/7, 5 percent.
*  ZCCM privatization. The Government of Zambia is in the process of privatizing ZCCM. A
fifteen year Bulk Sales Agreement (BSA) between the new owner of ZCCM's Power Division
and ZESCO has recently been finalized. The results of these negotiations will have a
significant impact on ZESCO's future financial performance (see paras 16-18 below).
*  Growth in demand. ZESCO's electricity sales were adversely affected by the drought in
1992/3, which resulted in a 20 percent reduction in sales from 8472GWh in 1991/2 to
6744GWh in 1992/3. Sales steadily increased since then, and in 1995/6 were at 98 percent of
the pre-drought levels. Apart from exports, which increased up to 1995/6, the other two
markets, ZCCM and domestic, have generally stabilized, or shown marginal growth in the
period. This trend illustrates the vulnerability of ZESCO to the loss of the export market,
which occurred in 1996/.
*  Revenue growth. Sales revenues increased by 198 percent in dollar terms, from US$43
million in 1991/2 to US$126.6 million in 1996/7 as a result of real tariff increases and increase
in the volume of domestic sales. In dollar terms, from 1991/2 to 1996/7, the ZCCM tariff
increased by 290 percent from UScO.359 to UScl .4, the domestic tariff by 244 percent from
UScO.642 to USc2.21; and the export tariff by 142 percent from UScO.694 to USc1.68.
*  Costs of different markets. As the losses incurred by ZESCO illustrate, ZESCO's tariff did
not cover the cost of supplying electricity to its customers which also included some
inefficiencies, which ZESCO is now in the process of addressing. Even on the basis of the
understated historical costs, the average cost coverage ratio is less than 1. The lowest cost
coverage was on the domestic market, where the ratio was below 0.5 for the major part of the
review period (Annex 5a(2)).
*  Overall ZESCO costs. ZESCO's major costs were the Kariba North costs and salaries; from
1996/7, depreciation is the most significant cost. ZESCO leases the Kariba North Bank Power
station from the Kariba North Bank Company (KNBC) and pays a rental, which covers
maintenance and debt service. The devaluation of the kwacha resulted in major foreign
exchange losses on inputs, 80 percent of which are dollar based, as well as the exposure on
foreign currency loans. Overall from 1994/5, expenditure has been increasing below the rate of
inflation due to liquidity constraints.
*  Profitability. ZESCO covered its operating costs (including depreciation) up to 1995/6, when
due to realistic depreciation values based on revalued assets, the operating margin was
negative. Finance charges, particularly foreign exchange losses, put ZESCO in a net loss
position. ZESCO made profit in only one out of six years, giving a negative net return on
equity. The losses are understated by the underprovision of depreciation and operations and
maintenance costs. In terms of markets, cost coverage was highest on the export tariff, and the
domestic market tariff cost coverage was the lowest. ZESCO will need to adjust its tariffs to
move towards full cost recovery on all its markets.
42



Annex 5
*  Tariff Policy. Before 1991, ZESCO  was required to develop its electricity tariff
recommendations for Government approval, a lengthy process with approvals less than applied
for. Consequently tariffs did not cover costs, and increases were below the rate of inflation. In
199 1, ZESCO was given the autonomy to review tariffs as needed. There were two major tariff
increases on domestic customers in 1992 (500 percent) and 1993 (220 percent) in kwacha
terms, against inflation of 191 percent and 176 percent respectively, and devaluation of about
900% between 1991/2 and 1996/7. Other tariff increases have been as follows: July 1994-25%
against 59% inflation; July 1995 - 15% against 46% inflation; January and May 1996- 20%
and 55% respectively, against inflation of 35%. Only in FY 96 do the tariffs increase in real
terms, above the rate of inflation.

*  Revaluation of Fixed Assets: ZESCO had its fixed assets professionally revalued by Techpro
of Kent, England, in 1995/6 on a depreciated replacement cost basis, considered most
appropriate given the nature of the assets. The impact has been an increased but realistic
depreciation charge in the profit and loss account, and a more accurate reflection of the net
worth of ZESCO. To ensure current carrying values of assets, during Appraisal, agreement
was reached on the method ZESCO would use for the annual adjustment to its fixed assets to
reflect the higher replacement costs due to movements in macro economic indicators. Fixed
assets would be carried in US dollars and translated to kwacha using the closing exchange rate.
This would link assets to movements in exchange rates.
* Cashflow and Liquidity: ZESCO's critical problem during the period 1991/2 to 1996/7 was
cashflow. Both the current and quick ratios were below 1. ZESCO's cash was tied up in
43



Annex 5
debtors. Collection of the ZCCM, Government and parastatal debt was a major problem. The
aged debtors listing showed old debts some of which are not recoverable, still carried in the
books. Only small amounts of debts were written off in the profit and loss account, and no bad
debt provision was created in the financial statements. The outstanding balance of electricity
arrears as at the end of 1995/6 was US$46 million or about 155 days equivalent of its annual
sales revenue. The position worsened in 1996/7 with 218 debtor days. During the same period,
ZESCO's overdraft increased from US$1.4 million to US$15 million. Strong efforts need to be
made for recovery of arrears, and disconnection policy enforced vigorously.
Capital Structure: While historical financial statements showed ZESCO  to  be
undercapitalized, this was due to failure to accurately reflect the value of assets. Before the
revaluation of fixed assets in 1995/6, the financial statements reflected a negative net equity
position as a result of negative revenue reserves due to accumulated losses, the low share
capital base, and deferred exchange losses. The debt equity ratio was over 100%. The
revaluation of fixed assets added US$1,150 million to equity as a revaluation reserve. This has
strengthened ZESCO's equity base and its capital structure. In 1996/7, the debt to equity ratio
was only 6%, indicating ZESCO's ability to absorb more debt. ZESCO's capitalization at the
end of 1996/7 was as follows:
US $ (million)
Total Fixed Assets                       1154.0
Current Assets                            121.00
Current Liabilities                       104.00
Total Capital Employed                   1171.00
Financed by:
Equity                                     (37.00)
Revaluation reserve                       1151.00
Long Term Debt                             46.00
Capital Contributions                       7.00
Long Term Liabilities                       4.0
Total Financing                          1171.00
Historical Financing Plan
10.   ZESCO financed its fixed assets, debt service and working capital requirements through
internal cash generation and long term loans. It is estimated that ZESCO's accumulated cashflow
from operations provided 57% of its accumulated cashflow requirements during 1991/2-1996/7.
The accumulated cash generation from operations during 1991/2-1996/7 amounted to $100.16
million compared to accumulated fund requirements of some US$174.97 million during the period.
The rest of the requirements were met by long term loans of U'.$ 63.21 million (366%), and grants
and contributions of US$11.34 million (6%), sale of assets, US$.25 million. As noted in
paragraph 9, point 7, the level of expenditure was limited by the availability of cash resources.

Annex 5
PRESENT FINANCIAL CONDITION
11.   In May 1996, GRZ and ZESCO signed a Performance Contract (PC) setting out financial
and efficiency objectives for ZESCO and obligations for the Government to provide an
environment which would allow ZESCO to achieve its objectives. In the first year of the PC,
ZESCO failed to meet the PC targets due to less than budgeted sales (loss of industrial customers
and export market), and tariff increases which were below the rate of inflation.
*  Export Market: A significant feature of the 1996/7 financial performance is the loss of about
half of the export market, with the other half to cease in 1997/8. The commissioning of the
interconnector between Zimbabwe and South Africa has resulted in the loss of the Zimbabwe
market. Export sales declined from 1,397 GWh in 1995/6 to 842Gwh in 1996/7, and the figure
is expected to decline to 26 GWh in 1997/8. Total sales declined from 8,111 in 1995/6 to
7,450Gwh in 1996/7. In line with the trends in other years, only a modest increase was
recorded for ZCCM, and domestic sales increased by 3%. The domestic market is assuming
greater importance in terms of both sales and revenues. Domestic sales represented 54% of
total sales revenue, up from 36% in 1995/6. In spite of the reduction in export sales, revenue
increased by 16% in dollar terms from increases in both the ZCCM and domestic tariff. The
financial performance of ZESCO is sensitive to sales volume. To be viable, ZESCO will need
to raise the lost revenue through higher tariffs from its remaining market, the domestic market
and ZCCM.
*  Operating costs: Due to charging realistic levels of depreciation based on revalued assets
(19996/7 - $54 million; 1995/6 - 2 million), ZESCO failed to cover its operating costs,
recording an operating loss of US$16.3 million. A stabilization in exchange rates resulted in
much lower foreign exchange losses than in previous years. A net loss of $29.1 million was
made after taking account of finance charges. ZESCO has introduced operational efficiencies,
including the rationalization of its labor force. Salary levels reflect the changes in skills mix.
ZESCO however remains exposed to foreign exchange movements and inflation, and will need
to cushion its financial performance from these variables. During Appraisal agreement was
reached that ZESCO would apply an automatic tariff adjustment formula quarterly, without
the need for Board and Ministry approval, to take account of movements in both local and
international exchange rates and inflation. The adjustment is premised on tracking the impact
of the above variables on ZESCO's operating costs, and subsequently this is translated into a
factor to adjust tariffs. Agreement was reached that the ZCCM tariff would continue to be
quoted in US dollars.
*  Operating Ratio: Apart from required increases in operations and maintenance costs,
ZESCO's costs in 1996/7 reflect the true cost of operations. The operating ratio is 116%. The
average tariff was UScl.70/KWh, against average costs UScl.99/KWh. Cost coverage was
only 85%. With the provision of adequate operations and maintenance costs, the cost coverage
ratio will be much lower. ZESCO will need to make adjustments to its tariffs to ensure full
cost recovery.
*  Debtors and Liquidity: Debtors outstanding of $76 million represent 218 days sales, up from
155 days in 1996n7. Domestic debtors are becoming a major component of the debtors due to
increasing tariffs. To reduce its debtor figure, ZESCO is requesting netting off Government
and parastatal debt against the amount ZESCO owes Government for debt service currently
45



Annex 5
$42 million. During appraisal, agreement was reached between the Ministry of Finance and
ZESCO that a clearing house mechanism would be established to clear Government and
parastatal debt every two months. The Ministry of Finance would withhold the amounts due to
Ministries for electricity. Every two months, the bills would be netted off the amount ZESCO
owes the Government, and when this amount is repaid, Ministry of Finance would pay ZESCO
the amounts due. ZESCO would submit semi-annual reports on March 31 and September 30
of each year on its billings and collections, and ZESCO would be required to maintain the
outstanding balance of electricity sales debts equivalent to 160 days in 1997/8, 120 days in
1998/9, 90 days in 1999/00, and 60 days thereafter. Starting from November 1, 1997, ZESCO
will levy a late payment charge of 10% on bills unpaid on the due date. ZESCO agreed to
enforce its disconnection policy which includes disconnecting customers with bills outstanding
for 60 days after the due date. Under the project agreement was reached that ZESCO would
maintain a quick ratio of 1, and a current ratio of 1.5.
Rural Electrification
12.   The Government levies a 10% surcharge on domestic electricity bills towards Rural
Electrification, which is collected by ZESCO through its bills. The funds are paid over to the
Ministry of Finance for the financing of rural electrification projects. When ZESCO undertakes a
rural electrification project, the project is supposed to be funded out of the funds at the Ministry of
Finance. ZESCO's financial position has been strained by the financing of Rural Electrification
projects on behalf of the Goverrnent where the release of funds from Govermnent has lagged
behind the project financing needs. To ensure that these projects are not prefinanced by ZESCO,
agreement was reached that GRZ would provide ZESCO with funds in advance out of the Rural
Electrification Fund for any investments for rural electrification to be carried out by ZESCO.
Insurance and Risk Management
13.   ZESCO has commissioned ESBI of Ireland to carryout an insurance and risk management
study in order to assess a)the adequacy of insurance cover and b)the adequacy of rislk management
provisions. The study was submitted to ZESCO in July 1997, and ZESCO is in the process of
implementing the recommendations of the study.
Financial Objectives
14.   In order to improve its financial viability, ZESCO has set itself the following financial
objectives:
*  take any action necessary to ensure that it wili generate revenues sufficient to cover its
full operating expenses (including depreciation on a revalued asset basis) in 1997/8;
*  during 1998/9 and 1999/0 generate revenues to cover full operating expenses
(including depreciation on a revalued asset basis), net working capital increases other
than cash, debt service and the equivalent of not less than 5% of the average of its
investment;
*  during 2000/1 and 2001/2, generate revenues to cover full operating expenses
(including depreciation on a revalued asset basis), net working capital increases other
than cash, debt service and the equivalent of not less than 10% of the average of its
investment;
46



Annex 5
* during 2002/3, generate revenues to cover full operating expenses (including
depreciation on a revalued asset basis), net working capital increases other than cash,
debt service and the equivalent of not less than 15% of the average of its investment;
* from 2000/01 and thereafter, earn a return on assets of not less than 1%.
15.   ZESCO has further agreed to (i) before December of each year on the basis of reasonable
forecasts, undertake a detailed review of the adequacy of its revenues and provide IDA with a copy
of such review; and (ii) implement the adjustments as shall be necessary to achieve the agreed
financial objectives. As a part of the tariff restructuring process, ZESCO had commissioned a
Tariff study, financed by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) which would be
used as the basis for establishing an appropriate tariff structure. ZESCO agreed by April 1, 1998
to implement recommendations of the Tariff Study with regards to the structure.
Negotiation of a Satisfactory Bulk Sales Agreement (BSA) with ZCCM
16.   The negotiation of a satisfactory BSA, based on a tariff that covers full costs and a return
on equity is critical to the long term viability of ZESCO. As the BSA is a fifteen year contract, it
was necessary to carry out projections over the same period to review the adequacy of current
tariff proposal of USc2. 1/KWh to be linked to inflation thereafter. The ZESCO historical tariff has
not covered costs, and if the trend continues, to achieve its stated financial objectives, ZESCO
would have to recover its costs through the domestic customers, effectively subsidizing the copper
mnines.
17.   An analysis of the average cost of supplying energy to ZCCM was done based on the
Tariff Study by SwedePower. The analysis calculated the average cost for supply at 220kV in the
330/330kV substations. The costs include the existing and the new generation plants and all main
(220 and 330kV) transmission lines and 330kV equipment and 330/220kV transforners in main
substations of ZESCO. The average costs included in the computation are the operating costs, and
a retumn on book value for generation and transmission. Two alternatives were considered, one
including cost for new generation plants at Itezhi-Tezhi and Kafue Gorge Lower, and the other
excluding capital costs, but including costs of electricity purchases at USc1.5/KWh. The results of
the analysis show the average costs, at 15 per cent return on revalued assets, increasing to
USc2.33/KWh by 2011/2. A 15 per cent return was considered to show cost coverage at a return
which would be acceptable rate to private investors. According to the SwedePower Tariff Study,
the long run marginal cost (LRMC) including existing system and new expansions is calculated at
USc2.3/KWh at 12% discount rate which corresponds well with the average cost. The average cost
is taken as the cost of supplying power to ZCCM. The ZCCM tariff would increase to
USc2.8/KWh, thus covering costs. Detailed tables are attached. The cost of USc2.1/KWh
compares favorably with other bulk supply agreements in the region. The ZESA/ZESCO
agreement is at UScl.5/KWh, and the ZESCO/SNEL agreement at UScl.46/KWh. Details of the
long term financial performance of ZESCO on the basis of the negotiated price are attached as
Annex 5d.
18.   The signing of a satisfactory bulk sales agreement covering costs, satisfactory to IDA, was
a condition of Board Presentation.

Base Case Scenario
20.         The base case scenario assumes the following: (i) a negotiated price under the BSA of
USc2. I/KWh, to be adjusted for international intlation thereafter; (ii) that ZES CO will be able to
effect tariff increases to meet specified financial objectives; (iii) that ZESCO will achieve miliimum
targets for loss reduction and bill collection efficiency, that is system losses reducing from thie
48



Annex 5
current level of 18% to 14% and bill collection efficiency improving from 85% to 90%. The
signing of the Performance Contract between the Govermment and ZESCO, and the consequent
measures taken with the Customer Information and Billing system, installation of new meters,
rehabilitation of the system, improved financial management system and the technical assistants to
build capacity in ZESCO provide grounds for this assumption. A sensitivity analysis of the
robustness of ZESCO's present financial situation and projected financial performance under
various levels of operating conditions and performance improvements has been carried out and is
described in para 31 below.
21.   Growth in demand is based on ZESCO's twenty year Power System Development Plan for
Zambia, June 1996, which forecasts annual demand growth of 3.6% in line with forecast national
economic growth. The demand which would result from new customers and increased consumption
by the current consumers would be met from ZESCO's own production and imports.
22.   The results of the financial analysis confirm the viability of implementing the proposed
project of US$ 223 million, for which the envisaged funding mix will be adequate, with
indebtedness remaining very low as a percentage of equity. The forecasts which are in line with the
financial objectives indicate a remarkable improvement and strengthening of ZESCO's finances
after 1997/8. Salient features of ZESCO's forecast financial performance are as follows:
=   The electricity sales are affected by the reduction in exports (loss of the Zimbabwe market),
and after a dip in 1998/9, are estimated to gradually increase from 6,999 GWh in 1998/9 to
8,375 GWh in 2002/3 on the basis of a 3.6% projected growth in demand. ZCCM continues
to be the major customer, contributing over 50% of sales. Exports of 724GWh per annum to
Namibia are expected to commence in 2001/2 on the commissioning of an interconnector
between the two countries in the same year.
-   Of significance is the declining contribution of ZCCM to revenue. ZCCM's contribution to
sales declines from 54% of total sales in 1997/8 to only 44% in 2002/3, although its
consumption is still about 54% of ZESCO's energy. By the end of the project period, the
domestic market is the most significant as ihe domestic tariff increases in dollar terms, and
improves its cost coverage ratio.
*   To achieve the financial objectives, which aim towards a tariff which covers costs, the
average tariff is estimated to increase from US cents USc2.15/KWh in 1997/8 to
USc3.08/KWh in 2002/3. The increases per consumer category are as follows: domestic tariff
from USc2.98/KWh to USc4.40/KWh, ZCCM from USc1.75/KWh to USc2.34/KWh, and
the export tariff from UScl.75/KWh to USc2.00/KWh. For the individual consumer groups,
ZCCM cost coverage (at 15% return on revalued assets) ratio moves from 111 % in 1997/8 to
124% in 2002/3. The domestic tariff cost coverage ratio moves from 47% in 1997/8 to 76%
in 2002/3.
*   It is assumed new demand will be met from imports at the Power Pool Price of about USc
2.0/KWh. Electricity purchases will commence in 2001/2.
*   Financial performance from 2001/2 is affected by the interest on new loans which are charged
to the profit and loss account, rather than capitalized, and from 2002/3, by the depreciation on
new assets commissioned.
49



Annex 5
*   Both operating margin and profit after tax improve due to the improved tariff policy, and the
assumed growth in sales volume, and by 1998/9, ZESCO is in a net profit position. The
operating margin is expected to improve from a negative of 12.49% in 1996/7 to 16.1% in
2002/3, and the net profit percentage from a negative of 22.1% in 1996/7 to 18% in 2000/1,
but then declines to 3.6% in 2002/3 due to the resumption of payments of loan interest. Due to
the revaluation of fixed assets which has increased the equity base, return on assets reaches
3% by 2001/2 (fluctuations in returns on equity in 2001/2 and 2002/3 result of depreciation
and interest on new assets). It was assumed that although ZESCO has to move towards an
acceptable rate of return on equity to attract private investors, the market would not be able to
bear the tariff increases which would be necessary should return on equity drive tariffs in the
early years. Tariff increases have therefore been phased.
* Debt service coverage, profitability and liquidity are expected to improve significantly,
indicating the financial strengthening of ZESCO. Financial strengthening is a result of
improvements in areas of debt management, tariff policy, and loss reduction, and operational
efficiencies.
* ZESCO's capital structure will remain sound. The revaluation of fixed assets improves
ZESCO's capacity for more debt. The modest capital investment program, determined by
ZESCO's absorptive capacity, does not significantly affect the capital structure which
remains with a ratio of long term loans to total liabilities and equity of less than 20%
throughout the 1997/8 to 2002/3.
* A significant feature of ZESCO's financial performance in this period is the improvement in
cashflow. ZESCO will meet target ratio of internally generated cash to annual capital
investment program and working capital throughout the period. The self financing ratio is
96% in 1997/8 due to the low capital investment program, then reduces to 78% in 1998/9 as
the PRP comes on stream, but improves again to over 100% by 2001/2. The high cash
generation percentage is in part accounted for by the modest capital investment program
during the forecast period in comparison to other utilities of similar size, and the low figure of
debt repayments (ZESCO's new debt has a grace period of five years, and the debt currently
carried on ZCCM was offered at concessionary terms over long period, at low interest rates
and long repayment periods).
*  ZESCO will gradually improve its debtor and creditor policies. It is assumed that debtor days
would remain high in the first two years of the project due to the impact of high tariffs, and
new systems. Beyond that period, ZESCO would reduce its debtor days to 60 by 2000/1.
*   Provided ZESCO is able to effect the needed tariff adjustments in dollar terms, the main
financial ratios are expected to remain within satisfactoty ranges throughout the forecast
period.
Tariff Action
23.   To achieve the financial objectives mentioned in para 14, agreement was reached with
ZESCO that:
50



Annex 5
* ZESCO would maintain tariffs at such levels as would provide revenues necessary to
meet the objectives in para 14.
* ZESCO will be permitted to automatically adjust its tariff to take account of changes
in the rates of exchange of the kwacha to the US$, and any other input costs;
* ZESCO would make a semi annual report on the adequacy of tariffs to meet the
objectives in para and submit the reports to by March 31, and September 30 of each
year to the Government and IDA.
24.   To achieve the 1997/8 objectives, ZESCO would need an average increase of about 35%
in dollar terms on domestic customers. Management has already implemented a tariff increase on
domestic of about 40% nominal, effective July 1, 1997, with another 30% nominal increase to be
implemented in January 1998. It was assumed the ZCCM tariff would be USc2.1I/KWh effective
December 1, 1997, with the average ZCCM tariff for the year at UScl.75/KWh.
ZESCO's Capital Investment Program
25.   ZESCO's capital investment program assumes no new investment in generation. It is
assumed that in 2001/2 when demand exceeds supply, the gap would be met through purchases
either from independent power producers or from imports. The investment program, both the PRP
and ZESCO's own program would be rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. The resources
required to implement ZESCO's 1997/8-2002/3 investment program total US $406.42 including
interest during construction and contingencies. Generation represents the largest share of the
investment program with of total investment (388%), followed by distribution with 22%. Other
investments include transmission.

26.   To allow IDA to continue to assist in the process of power system investment planning and
help identify least cost solutions, ZESCO has agreed that it will continue to consult annually with
Government and IDA on its power investment program. Following these consultations, ZESCO has
agreed to adopt an investment program satisfactory to the Government and IDA and not to
implement any power investment project costing in excess of US$5 million not agreed in the
investment program without prior consultation with IDA.
51



Annex 5
Project Financing Plan
27.    The financing plan for the project is presented in Table 4. The proposed IDA loan of US$
75 million represents 35% of total project cost. The balance would be financed by other external
borrowings under proposed arrangements with development agencies, a few yet to be confirmed.
ZESCO would provide the rest of the funding from its internal cash generation, which is expected
to be sufficient.

Financial Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
28.   In order to minimize the financial risk and to ensure that ZESCO's financial recovery
continues, it is essential that the financial objectives as agreed are met each year by ZESCO. In
addition to the monitoring of the physical performance targets, the Bank would also monitor the
financial targets. Capacity building in the Finance Department, to be supported under the project,
would ensure effective implementation of financial management systems for timely information,
and effective debtor and creditor management. These measures should ensure that ZESCO's
financial condition will improve over the project implementation period.
29.   The analysis has assumed that the BSA with ZCCM would be agreed at USc2.1/KWh.
Any reduction in this price would result in an extremely high domestic tariff to enable ZESCO to
meet the financial objectives, unless ZESCO is refunded for the loss it makes on supplying power
to the mines. The signing of a BSA in line with ZESCO's financial objectives of full cost recovery
under efficient conditions is completed.
30.    A key variable to which ZESCO is exposed, is devaluation of the kwacha. To mitigate
against this risk, under the project, it was agreed that ZESCO would implement an automatic price
adjustment mechanism, linked to movements in exchange rates and other key inputs to ZESCO's
operations.
31.    A number of sensitivity tests were performed to analyze the impact of less than favorable
events on ZESCO's financial soundness. The most critical variables to ZESCO's financial
52



Annex 5
performance are the delay in implementing tariff increases, and demand. If ZESCO does not
implement a tariff increase in October 1997, its profit margin would worsen from a negative of 2%
to a negative of 10.1% in FY97/98. If the ZCCM  tariff is not increased to USc2.1/KWh, and only
to about UScl.7/KWh, ZESCO would be in a loss making position in all but three years during the
project period (profit would be in years before ZESCO starts servicing debt on new loans and the
depreciation on new assets). Where tariff increases beyond 1999/0 are only linked to the rate of
international inflation, the profit margin declines to a negative 3% in 2002/3, against a positive of
3.6% under the base case scenario. Details of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Table 5. Under
scenarios of non-compliance with the agreed financial objectives, ZESCO's ability to meet the
financial covenants becomes lirnited.

Accounts and Audit
32.   ZESCO has over the last few years made a major effort to change its accounting policies
in line with generally accepted accounting principles. For the first time in 1996/7, ZESCO's audit
report was unqualified. The computerized accounting and financial management and the stock and
materials management system under implementation would ensure the provision of timely and
accurate financial infornation, and the strengthening of intemal control systems. Under the project,
ZESCO has agreed to have accounts, including those of the Special Account and Statement of
Expenditure, audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank, and audited reports sent to the Bank
within six months of the close of each fiscal year.

Annex 5b
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.    GENERAL
1.    Base Case Scenario: The financial analysis of ZESCO perfornance over the next six
years has been carried out on the basis that a satisfactory fifteen year Bulk Sales Agreement
(BSA), covering the cost of supplying energy to ZCCM and providing a return on capital
ernployed, is signed between ZESCO and the mining companies. Although negotiations between
ZCCM and ZESCO are yet to be finalized, the proposal for a price of USc2.1/KWh has been
tabled. The base case scenario assumes the following: (i) a negotiated price under the BSA of
USc2.I/KWh, to be adjusted for international inflation thereafter; (ii) that ZESCO will be able to
effect tariff increases to meet specified financial objectives; (iii) that ZESCO will achieve minimum
targets for loss reduction and bill collection efficiency, that is system losses reducing from the
current level of 18% to 14% and bill collection efficiency improving from 85% to 90%. The
signing of the Performance Contract between the Government and ZESCO, and the consequent
measures taken with the Customer Information and Billing system, installation of new meters,
rehabilitation of the system, improved financial management system and the technical assistants to
build capacity in ZESCO provide grounds for this assumption.
2.    The tariff increases assumed to be effected under the base case scenario are sufficient to
enable ZESCO to meet the covenanted cash requirements and rates of return on equity. The
financial objectives are as follows: (i) take any action necessary to ensure that ZESCO will
generate revenues sufficient to cover cash operating expenses (including taxes), net working capital
increases other than cash, and debt service in 1997/8; (ii) during 1998/9, generate revenues to
cover full operating expenses (including depreciation on a revalued asset basis); (iii) in 1999/2000
generate revenues to cover full operating expenses (including depreciation on a revalued asset
basis), net working capital increases other than cash, debt service and the equivalent of not less
than 5% of the average of its investment; (iv) during 2000/1 and 2001/2 generate revenues to
cover full operating expenses (including depreciation on a revalued asset basis), net working
capital increases other than cash, debt service and the equivalent of not less than 10% of the
average of its investment; and (v) during 2002/3, generate revenues to cover full operating
expenses (including depreciation on a revalued asset basis), net working capital increases other
than cash, debt service and the equivalent of not less than 15% of the average of its investment.
3.    Inflation Rates. Projections of income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows were
prepared in US dollars and are inflation adjusted. The following international inflation rates were
used, based on the Bank's Guidelines on Expected Price Increases issued in March 1997.
1995  1996/  1997/  1998/ 1 1999/  2000/  2001/  2002/

4.    Growth: Growth in demand is based on the ZESCO twenty year Power System
Development Plan for Zambia, June 1996, which forecasts growth of 3.6% in line with forecast

Annex 5b
national economic growth. Growth is expected fromn both new connections and increased
consumption by current consumers.
Estimates of exports (transmission and distribution) provided by ZESCO as follows:-
GWh            1997/8    1998/9    1999/0   2000/01   2001/02   2002/3

ZESCO's investment program includes an interconnecter between Namibia and Zambia. Exports
to Namibia will conmmence in 2000/1 upon the commissioning of the interconnector.
5.    Revenue: Based on current discussions between ZESCO and ZCCM, it was assumed that
the ZCCM tariff would be USc2. 1/KWh effective October 1, 1997, and would increase by
international inflation thereafter. The ZCCM tariff at USc2.1/KWh is comparable to other bulk
supply agreements in the region including the current contract between Zanbia and Zimbabwe at
1.5 cents, although the later is negotiated annually. It is assumed the export tariff would be linked
to the Power Pool price of about USc2/KWh. The retail tariff would be adjusted to meet the
financial objectives in para 2 above. Under the base case scenario, the domestic tariff would
increase from USc 2.98/KWh in 1997/8 to USc4.40/KWh in 2002/3, an annual average increase in
dollar terms of 9.5%.
6.    System Losses: It is assumed revenue would be increased due to a reduction in system
losses. Losses are low as 50% of sales are bulk supply at 330Kv with losses of only about 3%.
Losses are assumed to reduce as follows: 1997/8 -13%, 1998/9- 12%, 1999/0 - 11%, 2000/1 -
10%, 2001/2 - 9%; and 2002/3 - 8%.
7.    Other Income includes the sale of unproductive assets. It has been assumed to increase at
the rate of inflation.
8.    Interest Income: It is assumed interest will be received on surplus cash balances at 2%
per annum.
9.    Operating Expenses:
(a)    Disel: It is assumed the cost of diesel will increase by inflation
(b)    Salaries: Salaries will increase by the rate of inflation. ZESCO rationalized its
work force in 1995/6, and it is anticipated the current salary levels would not
change significantly.
(c)    Operations and Maintenance: Estimated at 2% of gross revalued fixed assets
at the end of each period
(d)    Administration: Increase at the rate of inflation

Annex 5b
(e)    Bad Debts: ZESCO is implementing measures to increase its billing and
collection procedures. The provision for bad debts has been assumed as a
percentage of domestic sales as follows: 1997/8 10%; 1998/9 10%; 1999/0 9%;
2000/1 8%; 2001/2 and thereafter 6%. It is assumed that bad debts will increase
during the first two years of the project due to higher tariffs, and the introduction
of new systems which would have initial tart up problems. Thereafter bad debts
would reduce as the improvements starting having a positive effect.
No bad debts were assumed on ZCCM and export sales. The BSA provides for
disconnection of supply 45 days after the due date, and as a private company
supplying the mines, it was assumed payment would be prompt. ZESCO has not
experienced bad debts on its exports to Zimbabwe, and does not anticipate any
bad debts from namibia, which has a financially sound electicity utility.
(f)    Electricity Purchases: It is assumed ZESCO will purchase electricity to meet
both its domestic demand and export commitments. It is assumed electricity will
be purchased at the pool price of USc2.0/KWh. Purchases will commence in
2001/2, and would be 700GWh, and in 2002/3, 795GWh.
(g)    Depreciation: On existing assets, based on revaluation, and the estirnated
remaining useful life as follows:
Asset Class              Useful Life        Estimated  Remaining
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  | L ife

Others                   10                 5
Depreciation on new assets was provided at an average rate of 4.4% per annum
on the value of the assets.
(g)    Provision for Drought: A provision for drought of US$2 million per annum was
provided. This would meet the cost of importing electricity in cases of drought.
It is assumed a serious drought would occur every ten years.
(h)    Transport costs are assumed to increase at the rate of inflation.
(i)    Corporation tax is calculated at 35% of taxable income.
C.    Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements
10.   Fixed Assets: Technical assets were revalued in 1995/6 and 1996/7 and the results of the
revaluation were incorporated in ZESCO financial statements. Non-technical asset revaluation
done by ZESCO management - market value used as a basis for all buildings/property.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement for Project Preparation. Twelve major consultancies were
undertaken to prepare this project with the support of the following donors: the
Governments of Belgium, Ireland and Japan (under a Japanese PHRD Grant), DANIDA,
EEB, NORAD, IDA (using PPF resources) and SIDA; in addition, ZESCO contributed
considerable resources to finance the studies when it became clear that a donor was unable
to continue supporting project preparation because of governance concerns. Seven of the
consultancies defined the technical project scope for the rehailitation of the Kafue, Kariba
and Victoria Falls hydroelectric stations; the ZESCO transmission grid and the distribution
systems in the Copperbelt (Kitwe and Ndola) and Lusaka. In addition, a study was
undertaken to define appropriate safety measures for the Kariba dam. A study was also
undertaken to identify a Rehabilitation and Development Plan for the Gwembe-Tonga
people who were resettled as a result of the construction of Kariba Dam. Three
policy/institutional strengthening studies were undertaken: to define the reform agenda for
Zambia's power sector; to assist in developing Zambia's Hydropower and Transmission
Policy (aimed at developing a strategy for facilitating private sector financing of major
hydropower and transmission schemes); and the development of a capacity building
strategy for ZESCO. The consultants for the rehabilitation studies of Kariba and the
Lusaka Distribution System were selected on a competitive basis in accord with IDA
guidelines. Other project preparation work was contracted following IDA guidelines for
the use of consultants. The summary of proposed procurement arrangements are presented
at Table A.
Procurement under the Project. Total value of IDA-supported consulting
assignments will be US$6.1 million. These assignments mainly comprise policy analysis,
plamning and design work, specific studies, and design and construction supervision. The
largest assignment will be for the supervision of the Cooperbelt (Kitwe and Ndola)
distribution project. Consultants would be hired in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Selection and Employment of Consultants (January 1997). Most consultant selection
will be addressed through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the
selection will be based on Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the
quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of the services to be provided. Short
lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 may be comprised entirely of national
consultants if a sufficient number of qualified (at least three) are available at competitive
costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be excluded. In
addition, US$2.7 million will be spent on technical assistance (TA), mainly in the form of
hiring of individual long and short-term consultants. For contracts larger than US$0.25
million, consultants will be hired on the basis of short lists. Because of the critical nature
of these assignments, selection will be on the basis of quality. In addition, TA will be
provided for the preparation of an emergency preparedness plan (EPP), which because of
the specialized nature of the work, consultant selection will be quality based. Training
75



Annex 6
Page 2 of 4
(total value US$0.23m) will comprise hiring short-term consultants and support for
taining programs.
Larger works contracts (individual contract value - local costs and IDA support -
US$0.7 million and above) will be awarded on the basis of ICB for an aggregate value
equivalent of approximately US$7.3 million (foreign exchange cost of approximately
US$5.1 million). This comprises contracts for the rehabilitation of the Kafue Gorge and
Victoria Falls hydroelectric stations; the Kariba Dam; the Copperbelt (Kitwe) distribution
system and the Ndola Training Centre. Two smaller-value works contracts (individual
value less than US$0.7 million equivalent) will be awarded on the basis of NCB for an
aggregate value of US$ 1.2 million equivalent (of which foreign exchange cost will be
US$0.72 million). It has been agreed that procedures for NCB to be used by ZESCO will
be the same as IBRD procedures; and the tender documents used are based on the
Standard Bid Documents of IBRD. Contracts for the procurement of goods supported by
IDA (individual value US$250,000 equivalent and above) will be awarded on the basis of
ICB, for an aggregate value of US$58.08 million equivalent (of which foreign exchange
cost will be US$49.34 million). Smaller value goods procurement contracts (individual
value less than US$250,000 equivalent) will be awarded on the basis of NCB for an
aggregate value of US$3.5 million and less tha $50,000 each by internataional shopping
(1.02 million).
The General Procurement Notice will be published in the Development Business
Forum at least 60 days prior to the issue of bid documents and for preparation of short
lists. In addition, specific Procurement Notices will be issued before preparation of
shortlists in respect of consulting contracts above US$200,000. The Procurement
Planning Schedules for consultancies, goods and works are included in the Project
Implementation Plan (PIP).
Implementation Arrangements. The project implementation arrangements are
set out in Section 16 of the PAD. Except for the Gwembe-Tonga and Hydropower Policy
project components, all procurement for the project will be undertaken by ZESCO's
Project Implementation Unit (PIU). In these tasks, the PIU will be assisted by the various
consultants, who are responsible for preparing the various components through contract
award. During project preparation, much "on the job" technical assistance was provided
to ZESCO in project management and procurement. Training in project management and
procurement will be provided to PIU staff under the project; in addition an expatriate
advisor will be appointed to assist the PIU in project implementation/procurement. Similar
arrangements will be put in place for the implementation of the Gwembe-Tonga
component.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
For procurement of works and goods, all cases valued at US$250,000 or more will
require prior review by IDA. The Bank will review the selection process for the hiring of
consultants proposed by the borrower for those consultancy contracts to be awarded to
firms. Contracts worth US$100,000 and above will be subject to IDA prior review; for
individual consultants the prior review threshold will be US$ 50,000. However, the
exception to IDA prior review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts,
regardless of value, to single-source hiring, or assignments of a critical nature as
76



Annex 6
Page 3 of 4
determined by IDA or to amendments of contracts raising the contact value above the prior
review thresholds. All contracts during the first year of the project, and selective contracts
thereafter, will be subject to post-review.
Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against:
(a)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures on civil
works contracts;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for vehicles,
goods and materials (procured outside of the currently proposed works and supply
and install contracts); and
(c)    100% of expenditures for studies, other Consultancy and advisory
services and training.
As projected by Bank's standard disbursement profiles, disbursement would be completed
by four months after project closure. Disbursement would be made against standard IDA
documentation.
Disbursement categories and projected disbursements are indicated in Annex
Attachment C and Section 1 respectively. Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are
detailed in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements are
subject to the conditions of the Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the
Disbursement Letter. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit account will
be fully documented, except for: (1) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of
US$250,000 each or less for works, goods, materials; (ii) US$100,000 or less for
consulting firms; (ii) US$50,000 or less for individual consultants and training which may
be claimed on the basis of Certified Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation
supporting expenditures claimed against SOE's would be retained at ZESCO and MEWD
and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision mission and project
auditors.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursement would be made on the basis of statement of expenditure (SOE) for contracts
and purchase orders with an individual value less than those requiring IDA's prior review.
Special accounts:
To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures. GRZ would open two separate special
accounts (SA) in a commercial bank to cover local and foreign currencies of IDA's share
of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation for special account A (ZESCO) would
be US$3,000,000 and special account B (MEWD) for US$100,000 covering an estimated
four months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. Upon loan effectiveness or as
needed, amounts of US$1,500,000 and US$50,000 respectively would be deposited in the
special accounts. Subsequent deposits may be requested as needed not exceeding the total
authorized amount of US$3,000,000 and US$100,000 respectively. Replenishment
77



Annex 6
Page 4 of4
applications should be submitted regularly, preferably monthly, after monthly bank
statmnmts are recived and reconciled, with appropriate supportng documents for local
and foreign expenditures as required. To the extent possible, all of IDA's share of eligible
expenditures should be paid through the special accounts.
Project Account:
In order to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds, it is proposed that both the
Govenmunt and ZESCO establish Project Accounts at commercial Banks acceptable to IDA, with
initial balances sufficient for the first quarter by project effectiveness. The Govenmnent and ZESCO
will replenish the Project Account at intervals of not less than 3 months, with sufficient fuids to meet
heir shares of expenditures under this project for the ensuing 3 months, and the funds would be applied
only for this purpose. During negotations, agreement was reached regarding the arrangements for
establishig and operafing the Project Accounts.

UNMED STATES OF AMERIA
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
RE: LETTER OF POWER SECTOR POLICY
This letter summazises the policy measures which the Government of the
Rcpublic of Zambia (GRZ) will pursue to support implcmcntation of its Power
Rehabilitation Project during the period 1997 - 2002. The Govcrnment's overall
objective is to enhance the ability of 7ambia's electricity supply industry to provide
electricity in an efftcient and sustainable manner to stimulate more and inclusive growth
in the Zambian economy. Government's strategy to achieve these objectives includes
the promotion of private investment in the power sector. The goals for the power sector
are consistent with Zambia's Medium Term Financial Framework (1996-1998) under
which priority spending focuses on those sectors that support stable economic growth,
such as electric power.
Energy Sector Policy Frmework and Power Sector Objectives
2.    The Government's strategy for realising its goal of optimal development of
Zambia's power sector is to establish an institutional and rcgulatory environment to
enable private sector participation, and in the short-term, improve sector performance via
the commercialisation of Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) in order to
enhancc rcsource mobilisation, corporate autonomy and managcmcnt accountability. The
instruments of the strategy include; (a) the Oovcrnmcnt's promulgation of a National
Energy Policy (NEP, 1994) and an Energy Regulation Act (1995) under which the
Fncrgy Regulation Board (F.RB) was established, and; (b) a ncw F.lectricity Act (1995)
which permits private investment in the power sector. Restructuring the electricity
industry is an important component ot the NE1P and comprises: transparent legislation
and regtilation; liberalisation of entry of other comnpanies in the power sector and
ccnmmeroialiuation of ZIFSCO operations.

Page 2 of 5
3.    In 1996, the Government signed a Performnance Contract (PC) with ZESCO which
emphasiscd cfficient commercial and technical operations. An inipoitait objeutive of the
PC is to increase access to electricity, espccially to low income consumers in township
arcas.  Regarding rural clecrification, a Rural Flectrification Funid (REF) fiuiaiced
through a lcvy on cicetricity consumption was established in 1994. In 1995 GR17 issucd
Guidelines for selection of rural clcctrification projects undcr the program. The actual
selection of projects and general administration of the RFF is overseen by an inter-
institutional Committee chaired by the Ministry of Encrgy and Water Development.
4     GRZ requcsted a study to examine the options for restructuring Zambia's Power
Sector, which was complctcd in January 1997, The Government and the study
consultants agreed on the following objectivcs for thc powcr sector in Zambia: coverage
- to increase the population with access to electricity; efriciency - to increase the
efficiency of the industry; commercialisation - to make ZESCO rinancially viuble, and
flnancc - to mobilise finance for new investment. ZESCO's perfomnance in these areas is
weak, and the study identificd actions to strcngthen near-term perfomance and place
ZiESCO in a position to be financially viable in the medium term. The study also imude
recommendations on industTy and market structure involving the separation of
Distribution from Generation and Transmission. The separation of Distribution which is
amenable to management contracting should provide a test for eventual privatization. The
G,overnment has already embarked on a reform program for the power sector (paras. 2, 3
,5). The key Government objectives and associated strategy instruments, remaining
issues and measures to address them are discussed below.
Covemae
5.    To increase the proportion of the population with access to electricity, the
irnvernment; (a) established the Rural Electrification Fund, with associated guidclincs to
scicct such projects, and; (b) obligated ZriSCO, under its Performance Contract, to
connect 100,000 new consumers in townships by March 31, 2000. However, ZF.SCO
will undertakc only financially viable connections with its own ffinds. An issue that
needs to be addressed in this context is the cumbersome process in transfcrring thc
collected levies from 7F.SCO to the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), to Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development (MOFET)), followed by re-transfer of the funds to
Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD).
6.    Actions and time markers for impcmcnstation. To addrcss the cumbersome
process involved in transferring the collected levies from ZESCO to the Rural
Electrification Fund, GRZ is working out a mechanism  that will involvc 7ZTSCO
deposting the ftnds directly into the established REF account and report to MOF. This
arrangement will eliminate the long process of transfers between ZESCO, ZRA,
MOFF.n and MF.Wn and at the same time ensure accountability for use or the funds. In
addition, the Govcrnmcnt will conduct a review of this program each January, to include
plans for the upcoming year. Township electrification will he implemented in accordance
with the PC signed between GRZ and ZESCO.

Affidency
7.    Government's objective is to increase the efficiency of the electricity supply
industry.  Important tools in this regard are the regulatory framework and industry
structure established by the Energy Regulation and Flctricity Laws of 1995 as wcll as
the use of cost-recovery tariffs. In the short-term, the PC is designed to improvc the
pcrformnance of ZFSCO through management, financial and technical efficiency targets.
Thc recent award to the private sector of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) Power Division and on-going negotiations for the sale of the ZCCM Mita and
Mulungushi powerstations (with combined capacity of 38 MW) is expectcd to contribute
to thc cfficiency of the power sector's operations in the Copperbelt and in setting
benchmarks for irnprovcd pcrformance in the rcst of the country.
8.    Actions and time markers for implementation. A tariff study is underway and
ils recommendations on the structurc and the level of the tariff will be taken into account
in the design of the next tariff increase. To ameliorate the impact of the tariffs on low
income consumers, the tarifr structure will include a lifelinc rate. Regarding the
peromanec Contract, not later than February 1 of each year, Government and ZESCO
will review ZESCO's performance and agree on updated targets for the following year;
where targets have not been achieved Government and 7ZESCO shall prepare an action
plan to achieve the targets.
ZESCO Co nserieiiatioe
9.    Trhe program to commercialise ZESCO is aimed al making the Company efficient
and financially viablc. A key component of making ZLSCO financially viable will be a
sound tariff policy that will provide for the setting of economic tariffs which will ensure
full cost recovcry as enshrined in the National Energy Policy. This includes arrangements
with the mining sector through power sales agreements. A related issue will be to reduce
ZESCO's high levels of accounts receivable.
10.   Actions and time markers for implementation.  ZESCO will employ an
automatic tariff adjustiment mechanism which will rcflcct key variables. ZESCO will be
required to mcet a series of specific ffnancial benchmarks each year. Ry July 1, 1998,
ZESCO will have separate accounts for generation, transmission and distribution.
Fiuanwe
11.   The Government's objective is to mobilise finance for new investment in the
power sector, with all major new investment in generation and transmission to be
financed by the private sector. A Hydropower Developmcnt Policy and Transmission
Line Policy will be promulgated by the end of 1997 to promote private sector investment
through clear rules and incentives.

12.   An Environmental Scoping Study for Zambia's Power sector was undertaken as
part of the preparation of this project. GRZ reviewed and agreed with the major
recommendations of the study: (a) to establish an environmental and Social Atfairs Unit
(ESU) in ZESCO; (b) develop a rehabilitation program for the Owembe-Tonga people
who were unsuccessfully resettled during the Kariba Hydroelectric Project, and; (c)

develop a hazardous waste management program to redress environmental impacis
associated with past power projects. It is also acknowledged that any fiiture development
of hydropower stations will be carried out on the basis of basin wide and integrated
environmncntal and social impacts assessments to he implemented within the confines of
the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act (Enviro,nmental Impact
A=ssmen) Rcgulations, 1997 contained in Statutory Instrumcnt No. 28 of 1997. In the
case of Victoria Falls, ZESCO will implement an environmental program which enhances
the sitc's ecological and acsthetic value in conjunction with the rchabilitation of the plant
under this Project.
13.   Action and time markers for implementation. ZESCO has established an
Environmcntal and Social Affairs Unit in its Engineering Directorate, which is currently
receiving technical assistance ror capacity building. ZESCO will put in place guidelines
for environmcntal review of projects and deterninc the types of projects which require
ESU approval or clcarance by July 30, 1998. T'he draft final report on the study and
action plan for the rehabilitation of the Gwembe-Tonga people was submitted on
September 1, 1997. A comprehensive assessment of toxic wastes in existing power
plants and lines and an action plan for their management and disposal will be undertaken,
in courdination with the Environmental Council of Zambia. ZESCO shall implcment the
agreed recommcndations of this study, including the execution of interim protective
measures by June 30, 1998.
Reviewing Implementation
14.   Since the Power Rehabilitation Project has a large number of components, and
includes important policy reforms, the Government intends to review the program with
the Bank and other donors on an annual basis. At the mid-point of the planned
implemcntation pcriod, the Government will also undcrtake a more detailed review of
progress with the Bank and other donors.

ZAMBIA: POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Zambia Power Rehabilitation Project will not include new facilities and has been
given a Category B rating. Category B projects do not require a full ELA, but may require
a more limited analysis if the project could have specific environmental impacts. The
specific environmental problems in this case are associated with existing plants and lines
and will be rectified under the Project. The Project will also support building ZESCO's
capacity in environmental management, through ZESCO's recently established
Environmental and Social Affairs Unit (ESU) as well as an environmental management
plan for the Victoria Falls Power Station to be managed by the ESU. Lastly, the Project
will support the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development Program, a package of
socio-economic and environmental mitigation measures to redress the consequences of
the unsuccessful resettlement program associated with the construction of the Kariba
Dam.
A.   INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS
1.    The initiating study on environmental issues in the power sector was the Sectoral
Environmental Assessment Scoping and Reconnaissance study done by Komex
International of Calgary in 1995. The study involved Dr. Thayer Scudder, a leading
anthropologist who has been conducting a tracking study of the oustees (Gwembe-Tonga)
of the Kariba Dam Project for the past 40 years. The study recommended an action plan
which included three priority actions:
(a)   To establish and strengthen an Environmental and Social Affairs Unit
(ESU) in ZESCO to build capacity in the environment area;
(b)   To develop in ZESCO a participatory consultation process to ensure
involvement of all project-affected peoples and NGOs.
(c)   To complete environmental and social evaluation of major watershed
where existing and proposed projects are located (i.e., the Kafue and
Zambezi) to determine environmental and social costs for project
planning; and
94



Annex 12
Page 2 of 9
(d)   To address continuing issues associated with past power developments:
(i)   An Environmental Assessment and Management Plan for Victoria
Falls Power Station Rehabilitation;
(ii)   Gwembe-Tonga study to rehabilitate Kariba-affected peoples; and
(iii)  Waste Management, including handling of PCBs.
2.   In addition, inventories of PCBs in ZESCO's system were carried-out separately
under the studies for the rehabilitation of: the Kafue Gorge Hydropower Station
(Swedpower); the Kariba North Hydroelectric Station (Swedpower and Gibb-
Merz/McLellan); the ZESCO Transmission System (Norconsult); and the Victoria Falls
Power Station (Komex). PCBs were found at Kariba North, in the transmission system at
the Kitwe and Luano substations and Victoria Falls and each Consultant has made
recommendations on the handling of PCBs, except for Kafue Gorge where no PCBs were
found. PCBs are highly toxic and must be handled with great care. To ensure a
throughout approach to PCB management, a PCB handling and management plan will be
developed under a study to be managed and coordinated jointly with the national
Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) and ZESCO..
3.    Kafue Gorge Power Station Rehabilitation (KGRP). Swedpower performed a
preliminary assessment which they recommend should be used as an input to further
investigation by ZESCO's ESU. The assessment did not identify any new environmental
problems associated with the rehabilitation. Existing environmental problems are
primarily related to treatment of wastes, harmful substances and occupational health.
Swedpower identified eight environmentally dangerous emissions and waste and
suggested mitigation measures for ESU to consider in developing a comprehensive
management plan.
B.   ACTIONS TAKEN
4.    ESU formation and strengthening. ZESCO has established its Environmental and
Social Affairs Unit (ESU) with support from SIDA. ESU has a core group of six persons
and the following responsibilities: a) performing environmental and socio-economic
assessment of all ZESCO projects; b) developing environmental management plans for
existing ZESCO facilities and operations; c) ensuring ZESCO compliance with all
applicable legislation and regulations; d) monitoring and reporting on all environmental
aspects of ZESCO projects and operations; e) communicating within ZESCO the
responsibilities for corporate environmental management; and f) interacting with other
agencies to ensure that ZESCO programs are understood and integrated into national and
local programs. The Victoria Falls Rehabilitation Report (see below) recommends: that
ZESCO provide ESU with support of the ZESCO Board and senior management to
95



Annex 12
Page 3 of 9
ensure that environmental programs are taken seriously; that ZESCO mandate that ESU
approval be required for all ZESCO projects; that ESU is adequately staffed and has
resources to contract personnel to undertake required tasks; that ESU have adequate
budget and internal support; training and TA to enhance ESU capabilities; and ensuring
that ESU is provided technical support in the form of experienced professionals and
equipment.
5.    Consultation. ZESCO plans to undertake or facilitate, with private investment,
the development of several new hydroelectric projects and undertake an expanded
township electrification program. This will require extensive consultation. The recently
created ESU has hired a social scientist; training and TA under the proposed Project will
enhance the Unit's capacity to carry out consultation with project-affected peoples,
government agencies, NGOs, the private sector and donors.
6.    The Victoria Falls Power Station Rehabilitation Environmental Assessment and
Management Program was completed by Komex in March 1997. The Rehabilitation
Project will refurbish and replace most of the existing facilities and equipment of the
Victoria Falls power station complex (3 power stations, with a combined capacity of 108
MW). An enviromnental management plan was considered important because the
Victoria Falls Power Station is located on the north bank of the Zambezi in Mosi-Oa-
Tunya National Park and the Victoria Falls UNESCO World Heritage Site.
7.    The environmental assessment reviews existing operations, environmental and
socio-economic data, proposed refurbishment designs, public consultation inputs and
develops an environmental management plan for the facility. Review of the planned
refurbishment program indicates no additional impacts (direct) associated with the work.
Review of data indicates that the Station's operation has resulted in negative impacts of
the Falls area: water management, land degradation, PCB-contaminated transformer oil,
degeneration of tourism experience, and aesthetic loss.
Proposed Action Plan includes:

(a)   Strengthen ZESCO's new Environmental and Social Affairs Unit (ESU);
(b)   Develop and implement of a waste management and site restoration
program to mitigate ZESCO's historic impact on the National Park area;
(c)   Non-essential staff relocation, relocate the majority of staff to housing in
Livingstone and convert on-site housing to medium-class tourist
accommodation (ZESCO);

(d)   Relocate the 48 MW intake scour siphon discharge and reconstruction of
the original steps to the Falls base (being done as part of the Rehabilitation
Engineering);
(e)   Develop Station 'A into a Power Station Museum and Interpretive Center;
and
(f)   Develop and implement a Water Management Plan which optimizes
power generation and aesthetic beauty of viewing the Falls (ESU); .
9.    The Rehabilitation and Development Strategy for the Peoples Affected by the
construction of the Kariba Dam (Gwembe Tonga) Study is nearly complete. The Project
Implementation Plan (PIP) will be finalized by mid-September by the Institute of
Economic and Social Research of the University of Zambia- INESOR with the assistance
of ZESCO which has already prepared a Project Implementation Plan for the rest of the
project. The INESOR report outlines the following projects and implementation strategy.
Proposed Projects
10.   The proposed projects includes:
(a)   Roads. The major effort would be the rehabilitation of the key road that
connects the three districts which have received the resettled people. This
road, known as the "bottom road," is approximately 365 km long and
roughly follows the curvature of Lake Kariba. The expected sequence of
construction would begin with the Siavonga section, that which in the
worst condition.
(b)    Water Resources Development. In common with many areas in the
region, water supplies are unreliable both as to quality and quantity. The
major expenditures included here along with other investments currently
under way by bilaterals and NGOs, would bring the supply of water
services up to internationally accepted standards (UNICEF guidelines). A
key component of the water development activities is a major effort to
establish and manage improved cropping patterns along the margins of the
reservoir that are timed to coincide with the patterns of lake drawdown and
refilling. This effort would make a major contribution to food security as
well as cash incomes.
(c)    Health Facilities And Services. Health care facilities in the area are not
adequate and not properly distributed to reach the population. Malaria,
bilharzia, and other waterborne diseases are major health threats in the
area. Child mortality rates are higher in Zambia than in Botswana or
Zimbabwe and are now at about the same level as in 1970. Long travel
distances now seriously affect the ability of the population to obtain
needed services. Construction of one new facility in Sulwegonde, the
97



Annex 12
Page 5 of 9
renovation of two existing facilities in Siameja and Chabbobboma and the
completion of the health post which has been begun by the community
itself in Sinafala will make basic levels of health services more accessible
to the population. In addition, a baseline study and awareness program
dealing with HIV/AIDS is included in the workplan.
(d)   Land Use. Agriculture extension activities directed at changes in cropping
patterns, improved grazing, small-scale irrigation, and improved storage of
food grains represent the majority of the agriculture projects proposed. In
addition, a fund is to be created to support micro-projects dealing with
land use.
(e)   Rural Electrification. The area inhabited by the affected peoples has
limited electrical service at its periphery, but in general there is no power
available in the project area. Under this program, service would be
provided to three of the larger villages (Chipepo, Gwembe Boma, and
Sinazeze) as well as the area around the lakeshore.
Proposed Implementation Plan
11.   Based on the INESOR Report and past experience, an Implementation Plan for
the program to address resettlement impacts has been proposed. The plan itself is
designed to contribute to the achievement of the programmatic goal of rehabilitation of
not only the lands but the social structures of the affected people as well. One
consequence of this goal is the need for the rehabilitation processes and actions
themselves to foster the confidence of the community and to create a high level of
participation in the problem definition, solution development, and implementation of
projects undertaken. Importantly, it is intended that many of these small-scale
infrastructure projects will feature community contributions, either in-kind or in cash.
12.   Key features of the proposal are:
(a)   A Steering Committee co-chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Energy and Water Development and a nationally prominent
Valley Tonga (eminent person). In addition, the Steering Committee will
include representatives of the other involved ministries (e. g., agriculture,
health, transport), local government and should also have strong
representation from within the community.
(b)   A Project Management Unit (PMU) that is located in the field, probably in
Siavonga because of its relatively good telecommunications facilities and
good road access to the major cities in the country will be established. It
will have its own set of technical advisers including a group of engineers,
technical specialists, and an adviser. Except for overseeing the rural
electrification, it is anticipated that all the other project components will
be undertaken under the umbrella involvement of the concerned
98



Annex 12
Page 6 of 9
Government Ministry. It is anticipated that the PMU will play the role of
a program facilitator rather than being responsible for project
implementation.
(c)   Project Liaison offices will be located in each of the three districts
involved.
(d)   The PMU will handle all liaison activities in Siavonga district and oversee
the liaison activities in the other districts.
A proposed project implementation structure is set out on page 9.
Cost Estimate
13.   The road rehabilitation costs, including the division between foreign and domestic
components, is based on guidelines in the existing World Bank Road SIP. The roads
would be rehabilitated as gravel roads. The total for the roads component is
US$2,408,020. The water supply improvements in the Water Resource Development
component are based on costs taken from existing projects and from the Water
Development Board. The total cost of the Water Resource Development component is $
2,337,000. For the health care facilities, the figures are taken from the on-going World
Bank financed project. . The cost of the Health Facilities and Services component is
$470,810. The Land Use/Agriculture activity costs are based on past agriculture
extension and other programmatic initiatives in other regions. The Land Use component
totals $1,430,000. Community Participation costs are based on experience gained in
conducting the field work for INESOR Study and other such experience and totals
$202,210. All Rural Electrification costs are from ZESCO, all but the Lakeshore area
electrification have been costed in detail using their normal techniques. The Lakeshore
area estimate represents the expert opinion from within ZESCO. Rural electrification
totals to $4,309,947. The Technical Assistance and Equipment components are based on
World Bank experience in providing assistance to Zambia and other countries. The grand
total for the project, including contingencies is $15,129,189
Financing of the Project
14.   The Zambia: Power Rehabilitation Project (PRP) has allocated US$ 5.0 million to
the Gwembe-Tonga Rehabilitation and Development Program of which a preliminary
financing plan has allocated US $4.5 million to the DBSA and US$ 0.5 million to IDA.
This funding is to be considered "seed money" for the Gwembe-Tonga project. Other
resources will need to be tapped to assure that all the proposed components are fully
financed. For example, the Rural Electrification levy is expected to be used to finance
the Rural Electrification component. In addition, DBSA has expressed interest in
allocating more resources beyond the US $4.5 million already allocated to undertake this
project.

C.   CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION
15.   The recommendations of the Sectoral Environmental Scoping Study were based
on an extensive consultation process with national agencies, national and international
NGOs and donors.
16.   Public consultation was carried out by ZESCO in context of the Victoria Falls
Power Station Rehabilitation. A consultation meeting was hosted by ZESCO in July
1996, where national, local and traditional officials addressed meeting. Attendees
included hospitality industry representatives, conservation groups, ZRA, traditional ruler,
Chief Mukuni led the discussion and represented the general public. In addition, a 2-day
Victoria Falls User survey of tourists was conducted to assess impacts on tourism of
current and planned operations at the power station. Lastly, the Report states that after
the Report's recommendations are discussed with ECZ, meetings will be held with the
following stakeholders: National Parks and Wildlife Service; National Heritage
Conservation Commission; Hotel and Tour Operator Associations; Livingstone
Administration; and Chief Mukuni.
17.   The extensive public consultation in the Gwembe-Tonga Study will be continued.
18.   Costs of all environment-related actions to date total approximately US$475,000.
D.   ENviRONMENTAL ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN UNDER THE POWER REHABILITATION
PROJECT:
19.   ESU will continue to be strengthened through TA and training. A consultation
communication strategy will be developed. Estimated budget: US$590,000.
20.   To ensure ESU's input is obtained and used by ZESCO, during negotiations,
ZESCO will put in place guidelines for environmental review of projects and determine
the types of projects which require ESU approval or clearance.
21.   Watershed Studies in the context of Upcoming Projects. In a letter of Sectoral
Policy from GRZ to ZESCO, GRZ will require ZESCO to do environmental and socio-
economic studies for new projects on the Kafue and Zambezi rivers, this will also require
data aquistion.
22.   A Victoria Falls Mitigation Plan will be implemented.
(a)   Site Restoration program to mitigate ZESCO's historic impact on the
National Park area (US$50,000);
(b)   Non-essential staff relocation, relocate the majority of staff to housing in
Livingstone and convert on-site housing to medium-class tourist
accommodation (ZESCO's normal; budget);
100



Annex 12

(c)   Relocate the 48 MW intake scour siphon discharge and reconstruction of
the original steps to the Falls base (being done as part of the Rehabilitation
Engineering);
(d)   Develop the circa 1938, 8 MW power station into a Power Station
Museum and Interpretive Center (US$400,000);
(e)   Develop and implement a Water Management Plan which optimizes
power generation and aesthetic beauty of viewing the Falls (ESU will
begin by executing a hydrology study of the Falls area); and
(f)   During negotiations, an understanding will be reached with ZESCO in
regard to the Victoria Falls Power Station Museum and visitors Center,
that a certain percentage of net revenues from these activities would be put
toward conservation efforts in the Victoria Falls area. Estimated Cost:
US$450,000.
23.   A study will be undertaken to develop a comprehensive program for
management/disposal of PCBs, as part of the ECZ Study on PCBs. During negotiations
an understanding will be reached regarding implementation of the agreed
recommendations of the Study, and interim protective measures.
24.   The Gwembe-Tonga action plan agreed during negotiations and implemented
under the Project.
25.   Monitoring and Auditing Program will be initiated by the ESU, with monthly
reporting requirements. The monitoring and audit program will track project progress and
implementation of environmental and socio-economic activities.

ZAMBIA POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
DAM SAFETY ASPECTS
In accordance with revised World Bank Darn Safety Guidelines (OPABP 4.37 dated
September 1996), when the Bank finances a project which will rely on the performance of
an existing large dam, a review and evaluation is required of: (a) the safety status of the
existing dams (b) the owner's operation and maintenance procedures and (c) the necessity
or otherwise of additional dan safety measures, including a review by an independent
panel of experts (POE). The project also provides assistance, if necessary, for: (a) the
identified additional dan safety measures, (b) a dan safety training and monitoring
program and (c) an emergency preparedness plan (EPP). There are three large existing
dams associated with the proposed Power Rehabilitation Project area.
(1)   Kariba Dam
(2)   Kafue Gorge Dam
(3)   Itezhi-Tezhi Dam
A.   Performance of Existing Dams
1 .    Kariba Dam. The 128m high Kariba double-curvature arch dam, built between
1955-1959 on the Zanbezi River, is on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The
dam creates one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, 250 km long, with 181 kmn
storage at normal water level. These waters supply two power stations with a total
capacity of 1266 MW, one on the Zambezi north bank in Zambia and the other on the
south bank in Zimbabwe. Six flood sluices in the central section of the arch, with
downstream Caterpillar gates, having their sill level 33m below the crest, can discharge
9500 m'/sec at maximum water level. Water jets are thrown down to a distance more than
100m downstream where, over the years, they have progressively scoured a deep, steep-
sided plunge pool in the axis of the river bed.
2.    The dam is predominantly founded on hard, competent sound gneiss rock, after
removal of surface weathered rock, the upper part of right abutment being highly jointed.
The general behavior of the works is influenced by the complex geological conditions on
the right (south) bank, slow long term dirvementional changes in the concrete and variable
hydrological conditions. Comprehensive instrumentation (comprising strainmeters,
jointmeters, ceramic targets, thermometers, pendulums, etc.) for dam safety monitoring
had been installed, during construction of the dam, which has further been supplemented
between 1986-1989. The overall safety of the dam and associated structures has duly
been monitored by annual inspections by Coyne et Bellier (France), and Gibb engineers
(UK) over the years, under the supervision of the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), the
Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO), and the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority (ZESA). The dam has been well maintained by undertaking requisite safety
measures as and when necessary, including providing drainage, anchoring and grouting for
the Bank stability; repairing and strengthening the eroded zones (caverns, seams,
overhangs) at the plunge pool, by combined diving, anchoring and grouting; and
103



Annex 13
Page 2 of 8
rehabilitating the spillway gates guides alignment and protection against Aggregate Alkali
Reaction (AAR).
3.    Lake-induced seismicity has been recorded since 1962 but the level of seismic
activity is too low to have any consequences on the dam structures.
4.    Kafue Gorge Dam. The dam is an earth-and-rockflll dam with an upstream
sloping core of impervious soil, (50m high), with a live storage capacity of only 700
million m3, and a total power generation of 900 MW. The reservoir is being fed by
additional re-regulated releases from the upstream Itezhi-Tezhi dam. A large number of
pore water pressure gauges were placed in the dam at the time of construction. Most of
the gauges are no longer working due to being damaged, blocked or broken.
5.    The dam, completed in 1972, though apparently with limited quality of
construction, is based on sound rock foundation, and appears to be well maintained. The
spillway with four gates, and discharge capacity of 4,250 m3/sec, though founded on rock,
the left hill rock beddings abutting the left abutment of the spillway, dip towards the
spillway, thus bringing pressure on the left abutment.
The intake structure for the head race tunnel for the powerhouse penstocks is
provided with structural floating boom which has been repaired and/or replaced as and
when necessary.
6.    The Kafue Gorge Reservoir is shallow and the evaporation losses are quite large.
The re-regulated releases from Itezhi-Tezhi and joint operation with Kafue Gorge is thus
very important. The principle of operation is to keep the Kafue Gorge Reservoir elevation
at the lowest level possible during August-November, but in the Kafue reservoir should
have adequate storage to meet the variation in power generation from day-to-day, week-
to-week and month-to-month. However, the relation between evaporation losses and
storage is very unfavorable for Kafue Gorge Reservoir. The percentage lossesper unit
volume for different reservoir elevations, storages and months were estimated during
1977, as:
104

September   1.07% 1.15% 1.23%       23%   42.7% 73.6%
October     1.6%  1.7%  1.8%         28%   51.6% 88.0%
Nov.        1.35% 1.43% 1.53%        19.6% 36.4% 61.6%
7.    The Kafue Gorge reservoir has an aquatic weeds problem (primarily water
hyacinth), with free floating plant growths forming large continuous floating mats. Such
weed growth-problem in reservoirs is understood to almost double the evaporation losses,
thus, necessitating special attention to get rid of the development of this continuous
floating mats.
8.   Itezhi-Tezhi Dam. The main dam is an earth-and-rockfill dam (65m high)
founded partly on mudstone and partly on granite, with a slightly sloping central core of
inpervious earthfill and supporting zones of rockfill. Upstream and downstream booms
which incorporate the coffer dams have been provided in the area where the dam
foundation consists of mudstone. An impervious blanket extends from the core of the
dam to the upstream toe on parts of the left hill slope. A cut off trench beneath the core,
down to rock is provided along with extensive grouting from the bottom of cut off. The
spillway with three Radial Gates, and discharge capacity of 4200m3/sec is founded on
fairly undisturbed rock. The settlements at the dam and in spillway are very low, with
apparently no visible cracks. The dam appears to have been constructed with high quality
control.
9.    A series of inspection wells are arranged along the downstream toe of the dam,
with open drainage holes drilled in the rock for release of pressure. An extensive array of
relief wells have been provided at the downstream berm within the left flood plain and
river channel sections. Extensive instrumentation (piezometers, pore pressure gauges,
settlement monuments, inclinometers etc.) was provided at the time of construction for
dam safety monitoring. The piezometers comprise standpipes, automatic recorders,
(ground pressure recorders and groundwater level recorders), and pore pressure gauges
(Gloetzl-pneumatic type and Maihak- the electrical type).
10.   The dam, (1800m long) completed in 1975, with a live storage capacity of 5000
million m3, appears to have been well maintained. Most of the instrumentation is presently
not working as it is either blocked, broken, damaged, plugged or inaccessible. There are
two rectangular tunnels, one (right) for future power generation and the other (left) for
releases downstream to Kafue Gorge dam. There appears some developing AAR problem
in concrete at left tunnel and a sticking Gate problem.
105



Annex 13
Page 4 of 8
11.   An elaborate seismic network consisting of four observatories equipped with
micro-earthquake recorders and two strong motion Accelerographs are installed to
monitor the post-impoundment seismicity. Seismicity has been very low, with insignificant
magnitudes.
B.   Recent Studies, Identifying Additional Dam Safety Measures.
12.   Kariba Dam. Coyne et Bellier, who were the original designers for the dam and
the associated structures, have also been monitoring Kariba dam safety over the years.
They recently completed a study on the safety assessment of Kariba dam (Inception
Report, July 1997) based on: (a) updating the hydrology, (b) operation of the reservoir,
(c) safe operation of the spillway gates, (d) analysis of the plunge pool development, (e)
analysis of the developing AAR problem in the dam concrete and jamming of the stop-logs
problem, (f) the required replacement of the hydro-mechanical and electrical systems for
assured and dependable operation of the spillway gates stop beams, and the sluices, and
(g) the detailed dam safety inspection. The following additional dam safety measures have
been identified.
(a)   Necessity of (i) constructing and strengthening the concrete mat
downstream and adjacent to the arch dam with deep anchoring, grouting, and
concrete toe, and (ii) providing developed plunge pool downstream, in order to
provide protection against damage by the spilling nappe, and against further
uncontrolled development of the pool, and/or other means of stabilization
supplemented by modeling studies;
(b)   Necessity of rehabilitating the stop logs guides and the adjacent concrete in
the dam as a protection against the developing AAR and the jamming of the stop
beams problem;
(c)   Necessity of replacing the identified hydro-mechanical and electrical
systems for assured and dependable operation of the spillway gates, stop beams,
and the sluices; and
(d)   Necessity of training local engineering professionals for dam safety and
instrumentation monitoring, thus building and strengthening ZESCO's own
capacity for dam safety monitoring.
13.   The estimated costs for the required additional dam safety measures for Kariba
dam, including the engineering services as provided under the Project are as below:
(a)   Downstream protective measures, and modeling for the
(for the plunge pool)                        (US$)
(Estimated Cost)                            3,650,000
(b)   Rehabilitation of stopbeams and adjacent
106



Annex 13
Page 5 of 8
concrete (u/s face of dam) and other
needed spare parts. (Estimated Cost)         350,000
(c)   Replacement of the identified hydro-
mechanical and electrical systems
and spare parts.                            880,000
(d)   Consultancy Services will be financed
under the project for design, construction,
and supervision of above items, and for
further investigations on the AAR problem.
(Estimated Cost)                              320,000
(e)   Dam safety training of local personnel is
covered separately under the overall Dam
Safety Training Program for ZESCO
Total 5.300.000
14.   Kafue Gorge Dam  SwedPower recently completed (May 1997) its study on the
assessment of dam safety aspects for Kafue Gorge dam, identifying the following dam
safety problems for Kafue Gorge dam and necessity of the remedial dam safety measures.
(a)   Stability problem of the left abutment of the spillway due to the abutting
hill rock beddings dipping towards the spillway. This has caused extensive
pressures on the abutment resulting in cracking of the spillway left abutment as
well as the rock in the gallery. These findings are supplemented by:
-     movement surveys, 1993 and 1995 (SwedPower);
-     structural inspection, 1995   (SwedPower);
-     visual inspection of structure, 1996 (SwedPower); and
-     geological/geotechnical work on Kafue Gorge dam, Dec. 1996.
(University of Zambia).
The proposed protective measures comprise of providing deep rock anchors,
extensive drainage, grouting, and other remedial measures, to stabilize the
abutment and the adjacent rock mass.
(b)   Necessity of the floating Boom replacement at the intake structure of the
Head Pace Tunnel for the Power house.
(c)   Necessity of getting rid of the ever developing Aquatic weeds (primarily
water hyacinth).
(d)   Necessity of surveys of the sediment delta deposits in the Kafue Gorge
reservoir.
107



Annex 13
Page 6 of 8
15.   The aquatic weeds have been developing very extensively in Kafue Lake, covering
almost 80-85% of the lake area, resulting in the following dam safety implications:
(a)   Weeds jamming against spillway Gates, having impact on
(i) the spillway capacity
(ii) pressure on the Gates, seals, and Guides
(b)   Weeds jamming against the Boom, having impact on
(i) Boom safety
(ii) likely entry of weeds through the intake structure down to
the penstocks, runners, and the turbine blades.
(c)   Extensive loss of water due to evapo-transporation.
16.   The estimated costs for the required additional dam safety measures for Kafue
Gorge Dam, as provided under the project are as below:
US$
(a)   Stabilization of spillway left abutment            850,000
and the adjacent rock mass and  (estimated cost)
replacement of Bridge Bearings.
(b)   Replacement of Boom (estimated cost)               170,000
(c)   Contract removal of the aquatic weeds (estimated cost)    380,000
(d)   Sediment surveys to be done by ZESCO
Total       1,400,000
17.  Itezhi-Tezhi Dam: A serious AAR problem appears to be developing at the left
outlet tunnel resulting in jamming of the Gate. As such, releases from Itezhi-Tezhi to
Kafue Gorge could not be re-regulated or coordinated. At present uncontrolled water is
running through the tunnel as the gate could not operated. It is essential to immediately
explore the causes ofjamming and rehabilitate the gate, guides, and the adjacent concrete
as necessary, work to be undertaken by ZESCO as a priority.
C.   Independent Panel of Experts
18.   As required, a two-member independent Panel of Experts comprising one arch
dams expert (including rock anchoring and AAR) and an engineering geologist (including
108



Annex 13
Page 7 of 8
expertise in rock mechanics) is being established for review of the Consultants proposals
for:
(a)   Kariba dam proposals for strengthening and protective measures
downstream for safety against the developing stop beams jamming,
AAR, and the proposed replacement of the hydromechanical
equipment and electrical systems.
(b)   Kafue Gorge proposals for stabilization of spillway left abutment
and adjacent rock mass, and replacement of Boom.
(Estimated Cost for 2 trips)          60,000
including proposals and final designs.
D.    Training in Dam Safety Monitoring
19.   With the existence and operation of such large and major dams in Zambia as
Kariba, Kafue Gorge and Itezhi-Tezhi, it is most essential to have the local engineering
professional trained in Dam Safety and instrumentation Monitoring; for overall safety of
these structures. The project will provide financing for overseas training (2 to 3 months)
of four selected engineering personnel from ZESCO to build inhouse dam safety
monitoring expertise. The trained professionals will be responsible for:
(a)   Safety monitoring of the existing dams in Zambia, and the future
oncoming projects.
(b)   transferring technology and training the other local personnel for
dam safety monitoring
(estimated cost):    $120,000
E.    Emergency Preparedness Plan
20.   The project will also provide for preparing Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP)
for Itezhi-Tezhi and Kafue Gorge and to develop a comprehensive program for
management.
(estimated cost):    $85,000
F.    Proposed Action Plan
21.   The following activities will be undertaken in chronological order as necessitated
with the dam safety aspects of Kariba, Kafue Gorge, and Itezhi-Tezhi dams:
