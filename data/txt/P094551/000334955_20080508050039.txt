Borrower                 Governmentof the Arab Republicof Egypt
ImplementingAgencies     Central Bank of Egypt and Ministry of Investment
Amount                   US$ 500 million
Terms                    Commitment linked, Fixed-Spread Loan (FSL) of US$500 million equivalent. A
                         capitalized front-end fee of US$1,250,000 equivalent. The loan repayment period
                         will be 30 years, including a five-year grace period. Interest and other charges will
                         be payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The final
                         reimbursementdate is December 1, 2037.
Tranching                The proposed loan is a single tranche, Development Policy Loan to be disbursed
                         upon World Bank Board approval, once a specific set of conditions is met. The
                         loan supports the second phase of the government's Financial Sector Reform
                         Program(2005-2008).

Description              The main development objective of the government's Financial Sector Reform
                         Program (2005-2008), which was supported by a DPL in 2006, and will be
                         supported by this proposed second DPL, is to build a more competitive financial
                         system, with sound banking and non-banking financial institutions, led by the
                         private sector, and able in the medium-term to provide efficient financial services.
                         This second operation would assist Egypt to strengthen the enabling environment
                         for financial intermediation, resource mobilization and risk management, and
                         increase private participationin the provisionof financial services. Specifically, the
                         operationwould support policy reforms in the following areas: (i)reductionof state
                         ownership in the banking system; (ii)continuing the financial and operational
                         restructuring of state-owned commercial banks and specialized banks; (iii)
                         strengtheningthe regulatory and supervisory framework for the bankingsector; (iv)
                         restructuring the state-owned insurance companies; (v) strengthening further the
                         regulatory and supervisory framework for insurance and pensions; (vi) improving
                         the efficiency of capital markets; and (vii) strengthening financial sector
                         institutional infrastructure, including the credit information system, the payments
                         system,judicial procedures, and microfinance.

Benefits                 A much more efficient and diversified financial system, led by private institutions
                         and operating within a stronger regulatory environment would contribute to
                         improved intermediation, expanded access to finance and sustained growth of the
                         Egyptian economy.

Risks                    The main risks could be a slowdown of the reform momentum. This relates
                         particularly to the government's commitment to and decisiveness in restructuring
                         the remainingstate-owned banks and insurancecompanies-and until such time as
                         their capital can be open to private sector entry, instilling the governance, culture
                         and incentives that would weed out past business practices-the           government
                         capacity to manage the related fiscal implications, and the ability to build an
                         independentand credible regulatoryapparatus.

                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1.     The reformist cabinet that took office. in July 2004 set a major agenda o f
macroeconomic and structural reforms (see Box 1). An integral component o f this
comprehensive reform program was a Financial Sector Reform Program that was endorsed by
the President inSeptember 2004 for implementation over 2005-2008. This program addresses
financial sector weaknesses in order to increase private sector participation, promote
diversification o f intermediaries and instruments, and strengthenthe environment for resource
mobilization, financial intermediation and risk management. It represents the most far
reaching, substantive and comprehensive drive toward financial sector strengthening so far in
Egypt.

2.      The Bank has been supporting the government inimplementingthis ambitious reform
program. The main pillars o f the program were largely based on the recommendations put
forward in the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Strong partnership was
established through effective policy dialogue and technical assistance through various
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) initiatives. In 2005, a Financial Sector
Development Policy Loan (DPL) was prepared in response to the government's request, to
support the implementation o f Phase Io f the reforh program, covering the period July 2004-
June 2006. The reforms supported under this DPL as well as those affecting the investment
climate have put Egypt on the map as a serious reformer. The Doing Business 2008 report
rated Egypt top reformer across 178 countries. The 2007 FSAP Update and the 2007 Access to
Finance and Economic Growth in Egypt document the substantial progress in the Financial
Sector Reform Program since the launch in 2004, including implementation o f most o f the
recommendations o f the 2002 FSAP and the fulfillment o f the performance indicators
established under DPL I.

3.     The government's achievements underDPL Iare sufficiently encouraging for the Bank
to prepare a follow-up operation in response to the government's request o f December 2,
2006. In this context, the second DPL o f US$500 million would support the authorities'
implementation and partial funding o f the costs of the second phase o f the reform program.
Reforms envisioned include strengtheningthe domestic banking system inter-alia by further
reducing public ownership through divesting public sector shares in joint venture banks,
privatizing state-owned commercial banks, continuing the institutional, operational, and
financial restructuring o f state-owned banks, settling the remaining non-performing loans
(NPLs) o f the state enterprises and the private sector, encouraging further consolidation and
merger o f small and weak private banks through stronger capital requirements, and adequate
provisioning.

4.     Phase I1o f the reform program would also include a comprehensive agenda for the
development o f non-bank financial institutions and securities markets, with the objective o f
building a more diversified and balanced financial system, capable o f providing the broader

                                              - 2 -

 range o f financial services to a wide range o f clients while managing risks effectively. This
 would include the restructuring o f the insurance industry, the promotion o f investment and
 pension funds, the strengthening o f securities regulation, and improvements o f the
 institutional infrastructure for the financial sector, focusing on information infrastructure
 (credit bureau, and credit registry), payments system, and the establishment of specialized
 commercial courts, as well as setting the legal and regulatory framework for microlending
through non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to enhance access to finance.

 5.      Supporting the government in completing Phase I1 will provide major benefits to
 Egypt and ensure irreversibility and sustainability o f the comprehensive reform program. The
proposed operation i s aligned with the Bank Group's 2007 Strategyfor the Financial Sector,
which emphasizes the use o f Bank policy-based lending in support o f market reform and
 strengtheningand the expansion o f access.

                                 11.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

         A. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

6.       The Government has implemented over the last three years much-needed reforms
including trade liberalization, a complete overhaul o f the tax system as well as financial sector
reforms and privatization (see Box.1). This ledto a friendlier investmentclimate which inturn
yielded a strong private-sector supply response. Real GDP growth increased from an average
3.5 percent during FYO1-FY04 to around 7 percent in FY06 and FY07; a record over the
previous twenty year period (See Table 1).

7.       The strong supply response i s driven largely by an expansion o f private investment.
Total investmentincreased from an average o f 17.6 percent o f GDP over FYO1-FY04,to 21.2
percent in FY07. Private investment increased from an average o f 8 percent o f GDP inFYO1-
FY04, to 13.1percent inFY07. Moreover, foreign direct investment (FDI) increased from an
average o f 0.6 percent o f GDP during FYO1-FY04,to 8.6 percent inFY07.

8.       A favorable external environment and increased regional liquidity have further
contributed to a strong economic performance. Solid global and regional growth, along with
the floatation o f the Egyptian pound (LE) inJanuary 2003 and its subsequent depreciation, led
to increased Egyptian goods and service exports including transit traffic through Suez Canal
andtourism. Higher oil prices and Suez revenues raisedgovernment revenues, while increased
regional liquidity contributed to increased FDI.     '




9.       The recent economic growth is broad-based with non-oil manufacturing and wholesale
and retail trade contributing one third o f the overall growth in FY07. The fastest growing
sectors have been construction, the Suez Canal, communications, and tourism. An important
implication o f the recent growth i s the resultingjob creation, leading to a reduction in the
unemployment rate from an average o f 10percent inFY03-FY05to 9.1 percent inFY07.

10.     With surpluses in both the current and the capital accounts since FY05, the overall
balance o f payments recorded large surpluses, standing at 4.1 percent o f GDP in FY07. Gross
international reserves were US$28.6 billion at end-June 2007, equivalent to almost 7.6
months o f imports o f goods and non-factor services. The real effective exchange rate i s fairly

close to its long-termestimatedequilibriumlevel (IMF, 2007). Moreover, internationalrating
agencies have improved Egypt's rating and the Ministry of Finance successfully issued a
US$l.O5 billion equivalent 5-year local currency bond yielding 8.875 percent in July 2007,
whichwas oversubscribed2.5 times, underscoringincreasedconfidenceinEgypt's prospects.

11.           The budget deficit and domestic debt continue to be high, though both declined in
FY07. The overall general government' budget deficit declined from 9.2 percent of GDP in
FY06 to 7.7 percent in FY07, and the cash deficit from 7.7 to 5.2 percent of GDP over the
same period2.This was due to a substantial cut in public expenditures, particularly oil
subsidies (downby 1.3 percent of GDP) in September 2006. On the revenue side, and despite
' The   general governmentprovidesthe broadest available definition for Egypt'spublic sector in Egypt. It includesthe budget
sector (the central government, localadministrationunits and service authorities), the NationalBank of Investment(NIB) and
the Social InsuranceFunds (SIFs).
  The difference between the cash balance and the overall balance is the net acquisitionof financial assets. Since these are
difficult to projectbecause of their highvolatility, Table 1 shows only the cash balance figures.

                                                                  - 4 -

the 2005 reduction incorporate and personaltax rates to 20 percent, the broadeningof the tax
base and subsequent improvements in administration kept tax revenues relatively unchanged
 inFY07(15.5 percent) from their FY06level (15.8 percent ofGDP).

 12.       While total external debt has beendeclining for severalyears, reaching 23.3 percent of
 GDP at end-FY073,the general governmentnet domestic debt increasedcontinuously between
FY02 (44.6 percent of GDP) and FY06 (53.8 percent of GDP), but declinedto 50.5 percent of
 GDP at end-FY07.4 Implementation of a better public debt management policy has had the
following effects: (i)         lengthenedthe maturity of tradable public debt from approximately 165
 days in 2003 to two years to reduce refinancing risk, (ii)                            activated trading in Treasury bills
with more participation from the private sector and foreign investors, (iii)                                     created a liquid
yield curve for Egyptian Pound-denominated debt issued on the international market, and
 (iv) introducedmore-developedinstruments to the financial market.

 13.       The stabilization of the exchange rate, as a result of eliminating the black market and
restoring confidence in the foreign exchange market, and tightening of interest rates in 2004
 led to a fall in inflation for most of FY06 (averaging 4.2 percent). However, CPI inflation
reached double-digit figures, peaking at 12.8 percent in March-07, driven largely by stronger
domestic demand, supply-side shocks from soaring global commodity prices, the outbreak of
the avian flu, and partial adjustments of fuel subsidies. Monetary policy was tightened again
and inflation had declined until December 2007, reaching 6.9 percent. Nonetheless, inflation
jumped in early 2008 (to 10.5 and 12.1 percent in January and February, respectively) driven
by soaringinternational food prices andbuoyant domestic demand.

           B. MACROECONOMIC                  OUTLOOK

 14.       Despite many of favorable macroeconomic developments in the Egyptian economy,
the Government faces the challenge of managing a large fiscal deficits and a sizeable public
debt stock. This section examines the medium-term economic prospects using the standard
Bank model and the sustainability of Egypt's debts using a model that is particularly well
suited to consider the effects of siegniorage. As noted in a recent WorldBank's Development
Policy Review (2008), Egypt has large currency holdings (around 12 percent of GDP),
representinginterest free borrowings and considerable ~eigniorage.~

 15.       Real GDP growth is expectedto remainhigh because of expected continued economic
reform at the impressive pace of the last few years, the prosperity inthe region that generates
considerable shipping through the canal, tourism, and Egypt's rising production of gas. Yet
economic growth is expected to diminish slightly to 6.5 percent by FY116, in part to reflect
the impact of the projected decline in OECD growth. Sustained confidence in the economic


  This figure is taken from the CBE.
  The Ministry of Finance started in March 2006 to publish a new series for domestic debt. Figures are different from the
CentralBank's publishedones. The annual series was calculatedback to FYOl but quarterlydata go back only to Ql-FY07.
  Van Wijnbergenet al (1989) developeda hework that explicitly takes account of seignorage along with new borrowingand other
debt creatingfactors. Inaddition, the modelallowsthe centralbankto beconsolidatedwiththe governmentaccounts, allowingfor amore
appropriate Sustainabilityassessment as it reflects appropriately limited risks of a destabilizingdebt spiral. Hence, this approach links
inflation,monetaryandfiscalpolicyas well as debtmanagement ensuringlongrunpolicyconsistency.
  These expectedgrowth rates are somewhat conservativecomparedto the Government forecast of ambitiousgrowth rates in
the 8-9 percent range over the next five years.

                                               - 5 -

management would support the increase in investment to 25.5 percent o f GDP by FY11,
which i s comparable with other high growth countries and Egypt's own historical record
(around 30 percent between 1978 and 1990), sustaining highgrowth rates.

 16.    In spite of the recent surge in inflation, World Bank staff expect inflation rate to
remain below double digit, yet above 7.0 percent for most o f the projection period. This i s
based on the assumption that the Central Bank o f Egypt (CBE) i s expected to adopt a tighter
monetary policy stance, aiming at containing inflationary pressures. The recent increases o f
the CBE policy interest rates (the overnight deposit and lendingrates) inFebruary and March
2008 are seen as the start o f a tighteningcycle inface o f the persistent increase ininternational
food prices and growing domestic demand. Also, the announced plan o f the Ministry o f
Finance to cut the budget deficit by one percent o f GDP per annum will help restrain inflation.
The CBE faces a difficult trade-off betweenaccommodating the continued capital inflows and
fueling inflation or sterilizing the inflows. Therefore, our expectations are strongly based on
the assumption that the authorities will continue to tightenmonetary policy and exercise fiscal
restraint.

 17.    Projections point to a decline inthe cash deficit o f the general government, during the
FY08-FY11 period. Projections show a slight decline in tax revenues to close to 15 percent,
and a bit higher decline in public spending (driven by slight declines in the ratios to GDP o f
subsidies and investment), moving the primary cash balance o f the general government from a
balance in FY07 to a surplus o f 1.0 percent o f GDP in FYll. This i s in line with the
Government plans to reduce the budget deficit by one percent o f GDP per year over a five-
year period. The Government has already succeeded in this effort in FY07. The 3-7 year
phase-out plan o f energy subsidies to the large industrial sector already announced by the
Minister of Industry and Trade in July 2007 is an important step in ensuring further deficit
reduction. Additional efforts are also underway to broaden the tax base and improve tax
buoyancy, by transforming the General Sales Tax (GST) into a unified Value Added Tax
(VAT) with a single rate and streamlining o f property and stamp taxes and strengtheningthe
Treasury Single Account (TSA) to help improve cash management and increase control over
off-budget resources kept by budget entities in the banking system. Although these efforts
support the credibility o f the Government plan for deficit reduction, more fiscal consolidation
i s needed. Yet, the task o f achieving continued fiscal consolidation while keepinginflationary
pressures under control i s a serious challenge facing the Government.

18.     The performance o f the external accounts is expected to remain strong, though with
smaller surpluses in the current account and in the balance o f payments. The nominal
exchange rate i s assumed to remain LE5.5 per dollar but the currency will appreciate in real
terms. Merchandise exports will remain around 17 percent o f GDP (reflecting around 13
percent growth per annum) while imports rise slightly as a share to GDP, resulting in a
widening trade deficit. The balance of payments will continue to post surpluses, though
declining from 4.1 percent o f GDP inFY07 to 2.2 percent by FY11. Net international reserves
will consequently increase in volume but decline slightly in terms o f months o f imports o f
goods and non-factor services, yet remaining fully able to cover any potential short-term
foreign currency drainage. The level of the foreign debt i s projected to decline in terms o f
volume and as a share to GDP.

 *Projections



            C. DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

20.         Egypt's debt outlook remains robust under various bound tests. Similar to the IMF
projection, the World Bank model shows a significant decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. This
i s not surprising when real growth rates exceed real interest rate by a wide margin, and the
primary budget i s now near balance. As shown in Figure 1, under the baseline scenario net
overall public debt declines to under 40 percent o f GDP inFY13. Moreover, the ratios to GDP
o f this debt decline over time under all standardized bound tests that include a two standard
deviation shock to real interest rates, real output growth, and the primary balance for the first
two projection years as well as a combination o f these three shocks with the average historical
values reduced by one standard deviation.

21.        Egypt's debt dynamics become vulnerable in case of a combination o f negative and
severe shocks, as illustrated in the so-called "alternative scenario" in Figure 1. The extreme
scenario assumes in the first year that growth declines 6 percentage points in response to a
shock affecting either tourism or canal traffic or both, the currency depreciates by 30 percent
while inflation rises to 20 percent. Underthese combined circumstances, the net overall public
debt-to-GDP ratio increases to over 120 percent of GDP.

                                                        - 7 -

22.     Available information indicates that the proposed operation will not significantly
affect these projections. As announced by the Government in 2004, the cost o f restructuring
state-owned banks was LE 50 billion (equivalent to US$9 billion), o f which LE 26 billion
were non-performing loans (NPLs) o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs). By December 2006,
the SOE's NPLswas reduced to LE 10billionand are expected to be fully settled by end 2008
(See the settlement details o f the non-SOE's NPLs in paragraphs 65-70). As to the private
sector NPLs, the settlement agreements between January 2004 and December 2007
represented 80 percent o f these NPLs with cash collection o f 33 percent (See the details in
paragraphs 65-70). Borrowing from the World Bank and the African Development Bank
(DPL-I and the proposed DPL-11) helps finance 16.5 percent o f the total cost o f restructuring
public banks. The remaining o f this cost has been (and will continue to be) financed from
privatization proceeds, assets sales, and capital gains realized by the banks upon the sale o f
non-core investments, including shares injoint-venture banks. Given that the grace period o f
the Bank's loans is 5 years, the fiscal implications of the financial sector reform over the
projection period (FYO8-FYI 1) will be just an increase in interest payments o f DPL Iloan
(0.5 billion from the Bank and another US$0.5 billion form AfDB that were disbursedinMay
2007) and the proposed loan (US$0.5 billion, expected to be disbursed in FY09). The total
amount o f these interest payments over the projection period i s 0.1 percent of GDP only. As to
principal payments7, they will add to the annual public spending about LE 0.25 billion in
FY15 and 0.75 billion starting FY16, which i s relatively very small to have any substantial
impact on the projected debt dynamics.

      111.      THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMPROGRAM

          A. OVERVIEW OFTHE FINANCIAL                   SECTOR PRIOR TO THE REFORMS

23.       Egypt's financial system was dominated by the banking sector, with the state
playing a large role in banks and the non-bank sector. At the start o f the reform program in
2004, the state owned the four largest commercial banks (National Bank of Egypt, Banque
Misr, Banque du Caire, and Bank o f Alexandria) and the three specialized banks (Egyptian
Arab LandBank, Industrial Development Bank o fEgypt, andPrincipal Bank for Development
and Agricultural Credit). In addition, the state also owned substantial shares in 23 joint-


over the following 11 years given with the new changes inthe WB loans.

                                                             - 9 -

 venture banks that account for around 20 percent o f the system's deposits and assetsS8
 Although bank assets and deposits were large (over 100 percent o f GDP), large public sector
 deficits and debt, pervasive state ownership o f financial institutions, heavy intervention in
 money markets, weak creditor rights, a flawed regulatory framework, and weak supervision
 resulted in relatively low and unproductive credit, negligible competition and innovation, the
 emergence o f a large stock o f NPLs (an estimated 24 percent o f total loans and 12 percent o f
 GDP) and severe price distortions.

 24.      Egypt's non-bank sector was very small. The insurance sector's assets accounted for
 less than three percent o f GDP in 2004. The sector was opened to foreign competition in
 1998, but inthe absence o f appropriate regulation and necessary capacity building, this reform
 yielded limited benefits. The private pension sector was also small, with assets o f less than 3
 percent o f GDP. Pension funds were primarily occupational schemes operating on a defined
 benefit (DB) basis with a weak institutional basis. Mortgage markets were limited in scope
 and activity, due to highfees and inefficient procedures for land registration, weak regulatory
 authority and poor access to long-term credit. Finally, investment fund assets were negligible.
 The limited size o fthese non-bank intermediaries contributed to the lack of long-term savings
 and the limiteddevelopment o f the capital market.

 25.      Egypt's capital market was thin. There were 1,000 companies listed in the stock
 exchange but half o f these companies were not traded, market capitalization amounted to 35
percent o f GDP, and the turnover ratio was very low at 10 percent. The share o f government
 debt issued at market prices and traded was very small. The average maturity o f traded
government debt was very short and the long term government bond market was very small
and illiquid. Private fixed-income instrumentswere negligible.

26.        The legal and information infrastructure for the financial system was deficient.
Collateral enforcement and loan recovery were hindered by the weakness o f the legal and
judicial system inthese areas. The lack o f good credit information systems, and transparency
incorporate accounting and auditing standards made lendingand investmentdecisions highly
risky.

27.       But there were some important reforms prior to 2004, including a new Mortgage
Law in 2001 and the Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law in 2003. The
Mortgage Law o f 2001 provided the legal foundations for market-based housing finance, and
the Banking Law of 2003 introduced several critical improvements, including complete
independence o f the central bank, stronger prudential regulations and enforcement powers,
higher minimum capital, and principles for loan settlements and workouts. It also
discontinued the special treatment o f state-owned banks to enhance competition, and asserted
the right o f private sector parties to own shares in public banks. Nonetheless, these reforms


'Joint  venture companies in the banking and corporate sectors were established over the past three decades under the
provisions of Law 43 of 1974-allowing       financial and non-financial institutions to operate as private sector concerns
irrespective of the share of public ownership therein. Twenty threejoint venture banks were registeredunder this law, with
assets ranging each from less than one to over four percent of banking system assets. Public sector shares in these joint-
venture banks were held by public sector financial institutions-mainly banks (with shares in 17 of the largest entities), but
also insurance companies and the National Investment Bank (NIB), whose ownership of equity represented a passive
investment.

                                              - 10-

were insufficient to address the effects of pervasive State ownership and extensive
intervention infinancial markets.


         B. THEFINANCIALSECTORREFORM            PROGRAM    (2005-2008)

28.      Following its appointment in 2004, the new government launched a far-reaching
and comprehensive reform of thefinancial sector. The financial sector reform is one of the
central components of a broader reform program. Its objective is to foster the emergence of a
sound, efficient, and diversified financial system, increasingly private sector-led, that can
contribute more effectively to Egypt's growth performance and provide access to financial
services to a much broader segment of the population. The newly-established Ministry of
Investment was given oversight for all non-bank financial institutions, and named new
management in Egyptian Insurance Supervisory Authority (EISA), Capital Market Authority
(CMA), Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA), and Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange
(CASE). Inparallel, a new Governor and Deputy Governor were appointed at the CBE. These
measures lent credence to the authorities' determination to carry out reforms.

29.      This comprehensivefinancial sector reform program was endorsed by the President
of Egypt in September 2004, to be implemented over 2005-2008.             The reform program
comprises banks, non-banks, the regulatory and supervisory framework, and the institutional
infrastructure, as outlined in the Government's Letter of Development Policy (attached in
Annex 1). The program can be conceptually divided into two phases: Phase I,from July 2004
to June 2006 and Phase 2, from July 2006 to June 2008. It represents the most far-reaching,
substantive and comprehensiveset of reforms to have ever beenlaunched inEgypt.

30.      In the banking sector, the reform program sought to significantly reduce public
ownership and management of banks by privatizing one of the four state-owned commercial
banks, and divesting public banks' shares injoint-venture banks. The remaining state-owned
commercial and specialized banks would undergo a financial, institutional and operational
restructuring. The existing NPLs would be cleaned up by paying off the NPLs of state-owned
enterprises, reaching settlements on other bad debts, and selling assets and privatization. An
in-depth program of improvement in information technology, procedures, risk management,
governance, and staff skills would allow them to operate on a commercially viable basis in
increasingly open and competitive markets, without running the risk of incurring new NPLs.
Inaddition, the program aimedat consolidation byreducing substantially the numberof small
and weak institutions in an over-banked (yet under-branched) domestic market by enforcing
stricter prudential regulations.

31.     I n the non-banking sector, the reform program entailed the comprehensive
restructuring of the insurance sector (including reducing public ownership and overhauling the
legal and regulatory framework), establishing a new mortgage finance system, beginning
reforms of private pensions, and deepeningand strengtheningthe efficiency of capital markets
and institutions. In addition, the program included developing a strategy for microlending
throughNBFIsto enhance access to finance and achieve a more inclusive financial system.

32.      Underpinning the whole program was a major effort aimed at strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory apparatus and the financial infrastructure. By 2004, it had

                                                         - 11 -

 become apparent that the legal reforms needed to be accompanied by major efforts to build
 supervisory capacity in all sectors and strengthen the legal and institutional infrastructure,
 including credit information systems, the collateral and insolvency regimes, and payments,
 clearing, and settlement systems.

 33.      Strengtheningthefinancial sector institutional infrastructure was a keypillar in the
 reform program.            This included the establishment o f the first private credit bureau,
 developing the payments system, setting the legal and institutional framework for specialized
 economic courts, and developing a strategy for microlending.

 i.       PhaseI(July 20044une 2006)

 34.      Progress under Phase I of the Financial Sector Reform Program was significant.
 By June 2006, all policy measures envisioned under Phase Io f the government's financial
 sector reform program and supported through DPL-Ihad beentaken.

 35.      Key achievementsin the bankingsector included: (i)                    Preparation o f the fourth largest
 state-owned bank, Bank o f Alexandria, for privatization and selection o f an international sales
 advisor; (ii)    divestiture o f state-owned bank shares in 12 o f the 17 joint venture banks; (iii)
 consolidation of the banking sector-the               enforcement o f stricter prudential rules resulted in
the exit of small and weak banks through mergers, acquisitions, and closure of foreign bank
branches, and reduced the overall number o f banks from 57 in 2004 to 43 in 2006; (iv)
completion o f independent full financial due diligence o f all state-owned commercial banks in
line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), showing the poor quality o f the
state-owned commercial bank portfolio; (v) development o f a strategy for the resolution o f
NPLs o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs) vis-a-vis state-owned commercial banks, with
defined resources from privatization proceeds; in this context, all o f Bank o f Alexandria
public enterprise NPLs, in an amount o f US$1.2 billion equivalent were settled in cash in
February 2006; (vi) settlement agreements from January 2004 to December 2007 representing
80 percent o f the non-SOE's NPLs in state-owned banks with total collection accounting for
35percent o f those NPLs; (vii) inception o f the operational restructuring o f the state-owned
commercial banks inthree critical areas (human resource development, risk management, and
information technology);' and (viii) adoption o f a detailed program for capacity building in
banking regulation and supervision. However, credit to GDP declined in this period-from
68 percent in 2003 to 52 percent in 2006, as banks settled NPLs, contained new lendingand
increased their holdings o f government securities, but this i s a typical development ina period
o f large-scale restructuring and privatization.lo

36.       Main achievements in the non-banking sector included: (i)completion of
preliminary steps required for the restructuring o f the state-owned insurance companies; (ii)
preparation o f a development plan to enhance the supervisory capacity of insurance and
private pensions in transition to a risk-based supervisory regime at the EISA with funding


   As part of the medium-term framework of institutional and operational reforms a fund was established and used to hire
internationally qualified management and expert staff and international advisors were used in developing the strategy for
improvementsin all three areas.
lo The ratio of credit to GDP also declined sharply in most Central Europeancountries during the 1990s, a period of large
scale restructuring and privatization. Credit growth only resumed in the early 2000s, when these programs had been
concluded.

from USAID; (iii)        preparation of the legal and institutional framework for developing a well-
functioning mortgage market; (iv) establishment of the Institute of Directors to develop and
train middle and upper level managers in adopting and implementing corporate governance
procedures and rules; (v) establishment of the Insurance Protection Fund to cover investors
against non-commercial risk; (vi) strengthening of the government debt market, through
increases inthe share of tradable debt, publication of quarterly borrowing plans for t-bills and
bonds, introduction of a new system of primary dealers intreasury bonds, and lengthening of
the average debt maturity; and (vii) amendment of various laws and executive regulations,
related to creditors' rights, payments system, and stamp duties to improve the institutional
infrastructure of the financial sector.

37.       There was progress in developing capital markets.                          Non-banking institutions
(insurance companies, pension funds, and investment funds) remained small, with combined
assets of only 7 percent of GDP, and little financing of the corporate sector but there was
significant progress in developing capital markets, especially the equity market. As shown in
Table 3, equity market capitalization and turnover ratios have grown significantly in recent
years, and the investor base has expanded significantly, with foreign investors increasing their
equity holdings from 7 to 10 percent of GDP. There was also an expansion of the retail
domestic investor base from 0.5 million to 1.6 million people through initial public offerings
(IPOs). Secondarymarket indicators compare well with those of other emerging countries, as
shown inTable 4.

38.       The government debt market has also developed, as indicated by the increase in
tradable debt from 20 to 36 percent of total debt, and the increase in average maturity from
120 days to 2.1 years. These improvements reflect efforts to improve the institutional
framework and market infrastructure. The debt management unit created in2001 has followed
a strategy that entails an increase inthe share of tradable debt and increasesindebt maturities,
has published an auction calendar and has conducted its issues through the primary dealer

39.     Finally, during this period the CBE ledefforts to create a modernized payments system
infrastructure covering system operations, policies, regulations, and oversight. The new,
automated interbank payments system has already improved arrangements, and processing
times for interbank payments has beenreduced.

ii. PhaseI1(July2006June2008)
40.     Phase 11is aimed at completing the implementation of the reform program. In the
banking sector, it focuses on reducing state ownership by completing the privatization o f the
Bank o fAlexandria, implementingthe financial and operational restructuringofthe remaining
state-owned commercial banks, completing the financial due diligence o f the state-owned
specialized banks and initiating their restructuring programs, fwther divesting the small and
remaining state-owned banks' shares in joint-venture banks, completing the settlements o f
NPLs o f SOEs instate-owned banks, completing the workout arrangements for private NPLs,
and continuing the ongoing program to strengthenbank regulation and supervision, including
further strengthening of off-site supervision, and improving banks' risk management and
governance.

41.     In the non-banking sectors, the program includes a comprehensive program of
restructuring o f the insurance sector, strengthening the regulatory framework for insurance,
developing the actuarial profession, addressing the under-funding problem o f the existing
defined-benefit pension schemes, removing the regulatory obstacles to the growth o f
investmentfunds, further deepening and improving the efficiency of capital markets by, inter-
diu, strengtheningaccounting and auditing practices, improving capital adequacy standards of
intermediaries, simplifying listing schedules, and establishing a stock exchange for small and
medium firms. Finally, Phase I1 aims to improve the institutional framework through
improvements in the financial sector institutional infrastructure including the credit
information system, auditing, judicial procedures, and the payments system.

42.     Section V examines in more detail the critical elements o f Phase I1 o f the reform
program which will be supported by the proposed operation. Annex I1contains a schematic
presentation o f the program's main individual intermediate outcomes.


             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

        A. LINKS   TO THE CAS

43.     The proposed DPL-I1 addresses a key strategic objective o f the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), namely to redefine new objectives and role for the state, and enhance the
capacity o f the financial system to facilitate private sector development. The CAS envisages
support to the financial sector reform program through two DPLs. The first, DPL-I, was
approved by the Board in June 2006, successfully completed, and rated satisfactory by QAG.
The proposed second operation intends to support the consolidation o f the financial reform
and ensure the achievement o f the strategic objectives o f the CAS. A major outcome o f the
operation would be increased private sector ownership o f financial institutions, which i s
associated with increased access.

                                                            - 14-

 44.       Triggers for the highcase scenario under the CAS have beenmet.These triggers were:
 (a) clear signs o f implementation o f substantive financial sector reforms, including significant
 restructuring o f public sector banks, and movement towards the privatization o f the Bank o f
 Alexandria; and (b) adoption o f a financing plan under which at least 10 percent o f the
 financing needs o f the financial sector restructuring program i s to be met from non-debt
 creating sources. Such sources may include grants from donors and proceeds from
 privatization (CAS-Assistance             Program Scenario, para.106). In this regard, revenues from
 public enterprise privatization amount to US$3.2 billion since 2004, exceeding already the 10
 percent threshold (when related to banking sector restructuring costs estimated at LE 50
 billion, equivalent to approximately US$9 billion).

           B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

 45.       To carry out the program, the authorities have also sought financial and technical
 support from the IMF, the US, the European Union (EU), and the African Development Bank
 (AfDB)." At the request of the government, the Bank is also playing a coordination role
 among donors inthe financial sector through a Financial Sector Donors Group that it chairs in
 the field. There is also good collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF inEgypt in
 the financial sector, through thejoint FSAP program and coordination o ftechnical assistance.

 46.      Among the bilateral donors, USAID has provided technical assistance in many areas,
 including debt and financial management, credit bureau regulation and data management, and
the payments system (the latter in coordination with the EU and the Bank). USAID also
provides technical assistance to Egyptian Insuranee Supervisory Authority (EISA), focusing
on transforming supervision from compliance based to risk-based. In addition, there i s on-
going working with the Ministry o f Finance on pension reform. USAID i s also funding a
project supporting the development o f the mortgage market through advisory services for
strengtheningthe supervisory authority, securitization, andproperty registration.

47.       The EUhas also beenactively involved inthe financial sector over the past few years,
supporting analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector. The European
Central Bank (ECB) has been providing technical 'support in the area o f banking supervision.
Several US regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the
Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller o f the Currency (OCC) have been
providing training in this field as well. The first phase o f the ECB's large assistance and
training program for banking supervision has been completed, and it i s expected that the
cooperation with the CBE will continue. The AfDB, which provided parallel financing to
DPL-I, i s ready to co-finance the proposedDPL-11.



   Support providedby USAID for the FinancialSector ReformProgram, includes:(i)financial sector reform-MOU (US$1.2
billion) in the form of budget support; (ii)reform of the commercial law (US$25 million); (iii)banking sector reform
(US$IOOmillion);(iv) capital market reforms (US$37 million); (v) mortgage finance (US$40 million); and (vi) insurance
sector (US50 million). EU support for the financial sector reform program is providedthroughthe FISC financial program
that was launched late 2004 covering the period from 2005 to end of 2008, with a budget of Euro 15 million covering the
payment system (Euro 2 million), banking supervision(Euro 2.4 million), public bank restructuring (Euro 8 million), and
capitalmarkets (Euro 2.6 million). EU is currently finalizing a follow-up programto support the implementationof Phase I1
of the Financial Sector Reform Program, focusing on the area of banking supervision through the Eurosystem. A new
Programis expected to be launchedduring the first quarter o f 2008.

        c. RELATIONSHIPTO        OTHERBANKACTIVITIES

48.      The World Bank Group's work in Egypt'sfinancial sector has been exemplary in
the sense that support has been provided through a continuum of instruments, from
analytical work (including successive FSAPs), and technical assistance including advisory
services from the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), and International Finance
Corporation (IFC) investments to lending from International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). The synergies between these various instruments have proven critical
to the success of the overall engagement.

Analytical underpinnings

49.     Several Bank studies provide strong analytical underpinning to the design of the
proposed DPL, including the 2002 FSAP, the 2005 and 2006 Investment Climate
Assessments, the 2007 report on Access to Finance, the 2007 FSAP Update, the fee-based
Technical Assistance on Governance, Anti-corruption, and Regulatory Reforms; an SOE
Corporate Governance Study, and an Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) Update. The Bank is also carrying out an update of the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) to assess the current fiduciary risk
based on the recent implementation of the PFM action plan developed two years ago. In
addition to basic analytical work, there have been four FIRST-financed technical assistance
projects that have enhanced staff knowledge of the critical issues and challenges inkey areas,
includingbank supervision, credit information systems, and the payments system.

50.     IBRD lending. The proposed operation i s closely linked to the first DPL, which
focused on supporting the government under Phase Iof the Financial Sector Reform Program
discussed above. It is also linked to the Mortgage Finance Project that aims to: (i)       establish a
mortgage finance liquidity facility; (ii)strengthen the regulatory framework for mortgage
lending; and (iii) modernize property rights registration. This project and the proposed DPL
are mutually reinforcing as the triggers identified under this operation are addressing
impediments to the development of the mortgage market, and several of the measures
supportedunder the mortgage project would reinforce the objectives of the proposedfinancial
sector operation inbuilding aresilient financial system.

5 1.    CGAP support. CGAP has provided analysis and recommendations with respect to
Egypt's access to finance efforts. CGAP has provided support to the government in the
creation of a microlending non-bank financial institution category of companies aimed at
building a sustainable and robust microcredit sector. In addition, CGAP has promoted the
exploration of opportunities for greater penetration of financial services to the low-income
population through branchlessbanking.l2

52.    IFC investments. IFC has assisted several banks through its Banking Advisory
Services. For example, IFC assisted Banque Misr in setting up a pilot microfinance operation
in 18 branches and is assisting local banks in the development of their SME and retail
operations. IFC has also collaborated with the World Bank to set-up the Egyptian Mortgage

''CGAPhas  hosted representativesof the Ministry of Investment and CBE at branchless banking educational
seminars.

Refinance Company (EMRC) and has taken an equity position inthe company. Finally, IFC
also provided advisory assistance to help start-up iscore, the first private credit bureau in
Egypt.

        D. LESSONSLEARNED

53.     The proposed operation is a stand-alone financial sector DPL supporting the second
major stage o f the reform program, and only submittedto the Board after implementation o f
the key reform measures. This design is consistent with the findings and recommendations of
the 2005 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) review. IEG notes that outcomes o f loans
classified under the Financial Sector Board (FSB) were significantly better than outcomes o f
financial sector components o f multi-sector loans.l3The IEG analysis also highlightsthe risk
inherent in the financial and operational restructuring o f state-owned financial institutions
without the authorities' firm commitment to privatization.

54.     The operation also benefited from the experience of previous World Bank
interventions in Egypt. Indeed, the 1991 Structural Adjustment Loan did not receive
satisfactory ratings as many o f the structural reforms aiming to reduce the role of the state and
strengthen the private sector fell short o f expectations. The Technical Assistance Project for
Privatization, Enterprise, and Banking Sector Reform, approved in 1992 and cancelled in
 1996 also received poor ratings, with less than US$0.5 million disbursedout o f US$9 million
and meager progress on the component to design and implement a comprehensive banking
sector reform.

55.     Against this background, one key element o f the World Bank discussions with the
authorities has been to agree on clear and up-front policy actions, including an important
element o f restructuringo f financial institutions inthe reform program. Moreover, the risk o f
further NPLs to SOEs has been reduced by the privatization or closure o f many state non-
financial enterprises, also an important element o f the broader reform program. Finally, the
proposed engagement o f the Bank over an adequate period o f time duringthe implementation
o f the government program aims at ensuring that the medium-termcomponents of the reform
package are implemented.

        A. OBJECTIVEAND RATIONALE OFTHE PROPOSEDOPERATION

1.      Objectiveof the Operation

56.     The main objective o f the operation is to support the Government's efforts to build up
a sound, efficient, and diversified financial sector, capable of contributing to Egypt's growth
performance and providing access to a broad segment o f Egypt's population. By supporting
the second phase o f the reform program, the proposed operation contributes to the

sustainability and irreversibility o f the reforms and, therefore, to the fulfillment o f its final
objectives. The indicative policy measures are outlined in the Operational Policy Matrix
attached in Annex 2-and       an agreement on an action plan satisfactory to the World Bank
would be reached before Boardpresentation.

ii. RationaleforBank'sInvolvement

57.     There is evidence of a strong and causal relationship betweenthe depth and efficiency
o f the financial system, and economic growth. Beyond its contribution to economic growth,
there i s also a growing understanding o f the importance o f access to financial services to the
reduction o f poverty and inequality. The Bank Group's 2007 Strutegyfor the Financial
Sector emphasizes the use o f Bank policy-based lending in support o f market reform and
strengtheningandthe expansion o f access.

58.     The proposed operation is crucial for supporting the continuation and deepeningo fthe
financial sector reforms that were supported by DPL I.It i s part o f a comprehensive assistance
which includes analytical work and technical assistance. The Egyptian government has
repeatedly indicated its appreciation o f the Bank's integrated delivery o f assistance, and has
requested the operation as a means to improve program design and to enhance discipline in
reform implementation. The perception that the Bank i s prepared to remain engaged in the
reform effort makes the institution a privileged partner. Moreover, the operation provides an
effective vehicle for the Bank to continue playing a leading coordination role.

        B. OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

59.     The proposed operation would support Phase I1of the government's financial sector
reform program and follows up DPL I.This operation's main elements are: (i)further and
significant reduction o f state ownership in the banking system; (ii)    continuing the financial
restructuring of state-owned commercial banks by reducing the outstanding NPLs o f the
SOEs, settling the private NPLs, and substantially improving the provisioning o f the state-
owned commercial banks, (iii)continuing the progress on the operational and institutional
restructuring o f the state-owned commercial banks and beginning the restructuring o f state-
owned specialized banks; (iv) restructuring the state-owned insurance companies; (v)
strengtheningfurther the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for banking, insurance,
pensions, and capital markets; and (vi) improving the financial sector institutional
infrastructure including the credit information system, judicial procedures, the payments
system, and microlending. These and related elements are explained below and in Annex 2.
DPL I1would support:

i.      Reduction of Public Ownership and Control of Banks and Consolidation of the
        BankingSector

60.     Completingthe Privatization of Bank of Alexandria. DPL I1is expected to wrap up
the privatization of Bank of Alexandria that started under DPL I.On October 17, 2006, 80
percent o f Bank o f Alexandria, the fourth largest state-owned commercial bank, accounting
for 6 percent o f deposits and holding 188 branches across the country, was sold to San Paolo

 IMI(an Italianbank) for US$1.6bi1li0n.l~Transferofownershiptook placeonDecember 12,
 2006, and the bank is now operatingunder the newprivate ownership. The government i s now
 preparing for the divesture of its 20 percent holding in Bank of Alexandria through IPOs (15
 percent) on the CASE and distribution of the remaining 5 percent to the employees of Bank of
 Alexandria. A local investment bank has been selected to manage and execute the offering.

 61.       Completion of divesture of more than 95 percent of the portfolio of state-owned
 banks shares in joint-venture banks. Steps taken to date for divesting the state-owned bank
 shares ofjoint venture banks have had a broad impact on the banking sector. To carry out the
 divestiture program, the authorities have secured advisory assistance for due diligence and
 pre-sale preparations.DPL I1will support the divestiture of state shares infive additional joint
 venture banks (in addition to the 12 divestiture operations supported by DPL I)"-two                                         of
 which have already beenachieved.I6This divesture gives the former joint venture banks much
 more freedom to compete with the state-owned banks, for example through branches and
 development of new products inEgypt.

 62.       Completing the consolidation of the banking system. The operation will support
 further consolidation of the banking system through a strict implementation of the higher
 minimum capital requirement;progress on on-going mergers; and entry of new foreign banks
 through their acquisition of shares injoint venture banks. The number of banks has already
 declinedfrom 57 in2004 to 40 in2007.

 l4Citigroup was retained as the privatization advisor. The privatization transaction was done in a very professional and
transparent manner.Out of the 12 European and Arab interested banks (Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
Italy, UK, Greece, and France), a short list of six banks placed their final bids on October 16, 2006 to acquire 80 percent of
Bank of Alexandria. According to San Paolo IMI's bid, the total value of Bank of Alexandria is US$2.016 billion which
translates into a price to book value multiple of over 6 times; the highest multiple realized in recent privatization transaction
inthe Middle EastandNorthAfrica (MENA) region.
   State-owned bank shares injoint venture banks were sold to private interests in 12 banks, namely: the Egyptian American
Bank (33.8% public ownership), National Societe Generale Barik (18.7%), Cairo Barclays Bank (40%), Misr America
International Bank (48.9%), Misr Romania Bank (33.3%), Egyptian Commercial Bank (9.8%), Suez Canal Bank (So/),              and
Misr International Bank (25.9%), Commercial International Bank (CIB) (1 8.9%), Misr IranDevelopment Bank (30%), Delta
International Bank (10.2%), and Cairo Far East Bank (19.6%). The sale processof state-owned bank shares is underway in 5
joint-venture banks, namely: the Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank (5.3%),            Egyptian Workers Bank (9.8%), Alexandria
Commercial & Maritime Bank (5%), Cairo BNP Paribas Le Caire (4.8%), and Export DevelopmentBank of Egypt (34.5%).
l6 The state-owned insurance company small equity holdings in some joint venture banks are not slated for sale, being
considered mere portfolio investments creatingno conflicts of interest.

                                                          - 19-

 63.      Reducing the share of state-ownedbanks in total bank assets,from about 60percent
 in June 2006 to less than 50 percent is one of the main outcomes of the reform program
 and the proposed operation. This will be accomplished through the sale o f state-owned
 commercial banks17, along with the divestiture o f state-owned banks shares injoint venture
banks. Market-driven consolidation has continued and the competition in the Egyptian
banking system i s evolving-a               positive byproduct o f the Financial Sector Reform Program
 (see Table 5).

 ii.       Financialand OperationalRestructuringof RemainingState-Owned
           CommercialBanksand SpecializedBanks'*

 64.      Substantial progress in implementing the program of financial restructuring and
recapitalization of state-owned banks is one o f the main actions supported by the proposed
operation. All the state-owned commercial banks were submitted to independent financial due
diligences as a prerequisite for financial restructuring-one                    o f the main triggers under DPL I.
These due diligences focused on bank portfolio quality and the analysis of distressed assets on
a stand alone and consolidated basis. The assessment of the loan portfolio in the three state-
owned banks showed NPLs o f LE 73.3 billions in FY 2005, the equivalent o f 23 percent o f
the total loans ofthe banking sector and 12percent o fGDP.

65.       The financial restructuring program will ensure full compliance o f state-owned
commercial banks with prudential requirements. Restoring the value o f banks' net assets
would entail: the resolution o f SOEs NPLs, the settlement o f other NPLs, and whatever
additional government finding is needed from asset sales to replace part o f the non-
recoverable loans to the private sector (after considering provisions, market value o f
collateral, and potential for rescheduling selected loans). The government i s well aware o f the
need to balance the objective o f compliance with regulations and the risks o f recapitalizing
banks where operational and risk management processes are still beingimproved.

66.       One key element in the financial restructuring o f the state-owned commercial banks
has been the program to settle SOEs' NPLs. To address the problem, the authorities have
opted for a time-bound cash settlement o f these NPLs to be largely funded from privatization
proceeds o f public enterprises, as well as capital gains realized by the banks upon the sale o f
non-core assets, including shares injoint-venture banks. The Government's intention, stated
inthe letter of development policy, is to complete the settlement process by December 2008.
This solution has played an important role in preparing Bank of Alexandria for privatization
and is beingimplementedfor the other state-owned commercial banks.

67.       To prevent the reoccurrence o f NPLs, lending transactions will be monitored and
conducted on an arm's length basis, and the SOEs are being submitted to restructuring


"FollowingathoroughanalysisofBanqueduCaire,theGovernmentannouncedinJanuary2007theacquisitionbyBanque
Misr of 100 percent of Banque du Caire's capital. Managementof Banque du Caire was taken over by Banque Misr, with
Banque du Caire operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary. This was a step towards the sale of Banque du Caire-the      third
largest state-owned commercial bank, with the transfer to Banque Misr of Banque du Caire's remaining NPLs (that will be
cleaned up through various asset sales and settlements of past due loans). In July 2007, the government announced that
about 67 percent of Banque du Caire will be sold to a strategic investor and in October 2007 selected JP Morgan as a sales
advisor. The invitation to interested parties was published in November 2007 in the international and domestic press, bids
were made and the government is now considering them.

 programs. The World Bank team's review o f bank loans to SOEs indicates that over the past 4
 years, state-owned banks have hardly extended any new financing to defaulting SOEs.I9Thus,
  SOE loans on the books o f state-owned banks appear to be largely a stock o f aged loans rather
 than new ones. It i s also important to stress that the financial situation o f these SOEs has been
  improving, as the Ministry o f Investment i s leading, along a diligent timetable, a program o f
 "Assets Management" of state-owned enterprises that includes privatization and operational
 and financial restructuring.

  68.      The authorities are also addressing the NPLs o f the private sector. To facilitate
  settlements with private borrowers at state banks, the CBE has encouraged out-of-court
  settlements, including a London-type approach, and an arbitration-based mechanism at the
 CBE. These mechanisms encourage banks and private borrowers to reach extra-judiciary
  settlements for NPLs and streamline the process o f rescheduling NPLs, loan recovery and
 repossession o f collateral. The settlement agreements (excluding public enterprise debt) from
 January 2004 up to December 2007 represented80percent o fNPLs with a collection rate of 35
 percent, o f which cash collection represented85 percent.

 69.       Build up o f provision levels and resolution o f NPLs is inprogress. Full financial due
 diligence recommendations regarding build-up inprovision levels in state-owned commercial
 banks are being implemented. Provisioning levels o f the state-owned commercial banks have
 increased significantly over the past three years, as the banks have started to apply the more
 rigorous asset classification and provisioning criteria, and are provisioning for previousNPLs.

 70.       The operation will also supportfurther progress in implementing the institutional
 and operationalrestructuringof the remaining state-ownedbanks, with theparticipation of
 reputable internationalfirms. The National Bank o f Egypt and Banque Misr are undergoing
 comprehensive restructuring programs which focus on three critical areas: (i)risk
 management functions, including NPL management; (ii)human resource functions, and
 alignment o f organization and general management functions; and (iii)information
technology and management information systems. The implementation of the plan has
 involved a grant from the EU to finance resident advisors from ING-Bearing and ABN
AMRO who work alongside the two boards and management. The EU-fundedprojects also
 include capacity building o f staff in critical areas.' In May 2006, the National Bank o f Egypt
 selected McKinsey & Company to draw up a strategic plan; while Banque Misr selected
Loyds. Adherence to the restructuring and business plan will be supervisedby the CBE on
behalf o f the owner throughout the restructuringperiod, after which the CBE would returnto a
standard supervisory role. The institutional restructuringprocess o f these banks will take time,
which i s expected given the complex and difficult human resource and business processes
issues involved in modernizing financial institutions. The recapitalization by the owner will
be moving concurrently with the implementation af the restructuring plan. The framework for
the institutional andoperational restructuringis outlined inAnnex 4.

71.       The authoritieshave also started addressing the currentproblems andfuture role of
the three state-owned specialized banks. The process o f restructuring the state-owned


l 9Indeed: (i) term loansto SOEs show current maturitiesrangingfrom 5 to 10 years, havingbeen largelycommittedbetween
1996 and 2001; while (ii)overdraft facilities show no meaningfultransactions in terms of withdrawals and reimbursements
over the 4-year period.

 specialized banks has started under Phase I1o f the reform program. Financial and operational
 reviews by KPMG and Rabo Bank were conducted for the Principal Bank for Development
 and Agricultural Credit in 2007. Terms o f reference have been completed for financial due
 diligence and operational reviews o f the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural
 Credit, the Industrial Bank, and the Arab Land Bank, and these reviews will begin soon. In
 contrast with previous practices, these banks are now managed by experienced professionals
with the mandate to restructure them. The Principal Bank for Development & Agricultural
 Credit i s planning for the separation o f its commercial banking activities from those involving
 subsidized credit lines for the poor farmers and agricultural services (provision o f fertilizers
 and insecticides).

iii. StrengtheningtheRegulatoryandSupervisoryFrameworkoftheBankingSector

72.      The strengtheningo fthe regulatory and supervisory framework inthe banking sector is
a critical part o f the financial reform program. A credible, independent regulator i s the
necessary anchor o f an effective and resilient financial system, especially in an environment
where state ownership of financial institutions i s expected to remain significant inthe medium
term. The proposed operation would continue to support the strengthening o f the banking
supervision department at CBE, as outlined inAnnex 5, as per the agreed ECB program.

73.      The banking supervision department has embarked on a comprehensive two-year
program of capacity building covering extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory
functions, as it is seeking to move from compliance to risk-based supervision. The
Eurosystem2' provided assistance to the CBE from end 2005 to November 2007. A needs
assessment report has outlined a two-year program o f capacity building. During the first
phase o f this two year program (December 2005-May                              2006), the CBE conducted a
comprehensive review o f its on-site and off-site processes and carried out an organizational
restructuring o f the banking supervision function. After its re-organization, the banking
supervision department has five divisions: the on-site inspection, off-site supervision,
licensing, central credit registry, and macro-prudential analysis. In addition, a regulation unit
has also been set up.

74.      The second phase of capacity building for a strengthened supervisory framework,
which started in June 2006,focused inter-alia on developingand implementingappropriate
supervisory tools and methodologies.As a result, the banking supervision inEgypt is moving
from compliance to a more proactive and modem risk-based supervision. Once this new
framework is inplace, the CBE needs to build a strong track record o f successful enforcement
o f the new regulations (namely in the loan classification, provisioning and internal control)
and further strengthenits capabilities to perform an effective risk-based supervision.

75.      The on-site inspection isfocusing on risks. Increased attention has been directed to
credit organization and policy, concentration o f credit, risk management system, IT system
and internal controls. New manuals for on-site supervision with a risk focus are beingusedto
drive on site inspections. Credit registry and off-site supervisory information are feeding the
preparation o f on site examinations and the relationship manager in charge of the off site
supervision for the examined bank i s part o f the on site team An internal CAMEL rating i s


2o"Eurosystem" refers to the European Central Bank and national central banks members of the Euro-zone.

                                               - 22 -

assigned at the end o f the on-site exam to reflect the overall financial standing o f the bank.
The on site team assess also risks beyond the financial performance o f the bank like
operational, reputation, and IT risks with a specific rating for each family o f risk and an
overall composite rating . The EUprogram aimed also at providing the inspectors with new IT
tools giving them access to off site supervision and Central Credit Registry databases. As a
feedback inspection teams will now have to update theses databases with the data collected in
the field. Once in effect, this type o f feedback will help strengthenand improve the off site
supervision reports credit institutions along a CAMEL (Capital Assets Management Earnings
Liquidity) based approach. Finally, a closer cooperation betweenOn-Site Inspection and Off
Site Supervision has been taking place, especially regarding the elaboration o f corrective
actions.

76.      The off-site supervision has developed new tools to helpfocus on critical issuesfor
an enhanced decision making process. A draft risk-oriented report regarding the strategy,
management and the overall performance o f a credit institution i s at its final stage o f design.
This report, produced on annual basis, will cover all risks inherent in the bank's activities,
including both quantitative and qualitative information and constitute a comprehensive review
o f the banks. In a nutshell, this annual report i s designed to convey the banks' overall risk
profile. The off-site supervision new framework could, inthe long run, help the CBE develop
an early warning system enabling an adequate, proactive framework to deal with problem
banks. Inparticular, it should help the CBE in determiningthe levels o f capital ratios as well
as best suited remedial measures to address particular events or risk profile of credit
institutions.

77.      A macro-prudential unit has been set up. An annual banking sector review will
deliver a comprehensive analysis o f the banking sector. In addition, in the medium term a
banking stability report will address the key developments, risks and vulnerabilities, as well as
the assessmenton the resilience o fthe Egyptianbanking sector. This initiative, inlinewiththe
Basel best practices aims at enhancing market discipline.

78.      The regulatory framework needs to be improved however, notably regarding
internal control system and market risk management. As the BSD cannot rely only on the
external auditors since the quality o f their report i s uneven, internal control system regulation
appears to be critical. More over, it would prepare the banks in their progress towards the
Basel I1 framework. The CBE would help support the banking sector by issuing specific
guidelines spelling out what is an accurate and comprehensive internal control system based
on risk management. As to the market risk, CBE is preparing a regulation that would address
this risingrisk inEgypt.

iv.      RestructuringState-ownedInsuranceCompanies

79.      The proposed loan would also support the government's on-going, comprehensive
restructuring of the insurance sector, including a merger of three state-owned insurance
companies..The first major step involved the creation of the Insurance Holding Company in
October 2006 to take over ownership o f the state-owned insurance companies. The second
major step was taken in August 2007, when the board o f the holding company approved the
merger of the two stronger state-owned direct insurance companies (Misr Insurance Company
and AI Chark Insurance Company) and the state-owned Egyptian Reinsurance Company, with

                                                       -23 -

the merger legally completed in early December 2007. These steps have done much to
stabilize the sector and limit the value destruction that has characterized the state-owned
sector over the last decade. In addition, all business will be managed on Misr's superior
information systems. A real estate asset management company has also been established to
manage the real estate portfolios o f the state owned insurers, and has started an asset
realization program. The National Insurance Company, which i s seriously under reserved, will
be retained in public hands and will hold all the 'Classified Group' business, which arises
from certain public sector entities.

80.       The government's restructuring advisor (BNP Paribas) has completed a full due
diligence of the state owned insurers and submitted restructuring options to the Ministry of
Investment, working with the Insurance Holding Company and the World Bank. Under any
strategy adopted the government will remain the ,single largest shareholder and no strategic
partners are envisaged. However the proposed approach should be sufficient to change the
status o f the merged Misr Insurance Company from a state owned enterprise to a standard
public company, thus removing the implicit government guarantee, improving corporate
governance and enhancing managerial and strategic options. Under a new government
contract, BNP Paribas i s drafting a prospectus. Inthe interimthe merged Misr insurance has
begunto realize some shareholdings with substantial scope for capital gains and to rationalize
its branch structure.

v.        Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework in Insurance and
          Pensions

81.       The proposed loan would support a significant improvement of the insurance
regulatory and supervisory framework.                  Substantial challenges still face the insurance
supervisory authority in moving from a role involving control o f a state-owned sector to a
risk-based supervisory role ina market environment. The follow up FSAP carried out in2007
pointed to the need to hold and attract capable staff, move on from an approval and
compliance based supervisory model, remove conflicts o f interest within the insurance and
private pension supervisor (EISA) and properly assess the funding levels and governance o f
the private pensionplans (see Annex 7).

82.      The senior management o f EISA has been strengthenedover the 20061 2007 period
with the appointment o f a new Chairman and an Assistant Chairman covering the private
pension sector. In addition, 18 people have accepted early retirement to date, although the
agency continues to be overstaffed. USAID has been working with EISA to develop a new
organization structure that will support a risk based approach, and ideally get the right people

                                                            - 24 -

into key positions. It i s intended that the new structure will eliminate conflicts o f interest
withinEISA, arising from the fact that employedactuaries have beenholdingboth supervisory
and Board roles within EISA and acting as consultants (or even directors) o f entities
supervised by EISA (which in turn may have limited the scope for information flows within
EISA).

83.        On site inspections have begun of private sector insurers, using a risk based
modality. Strong international insurers were chosen as the initial targets inorder to train staff
and develop the relevant documentation and manuals. The supporting supervisory database
and information system i s being upgraded so that all relevant data and risk analytics will be
available for a given company in one place. In addition a number o f staff has been sent for
training with the National Association o f Insurance Commissioners inthe US.

84.        As part ofthe DPL Ipreparation the World Bank was able to facilitate the allocationof
FIRST Initiative moneys for a specialized motor third party liability (MTPL) reserving and
rate setting project to support non life insurance technical development within EISA. This
demonstrated that premiums have been at approximately 20% o f the required level for some
time and pointed to a deficit in MTPL claims provisions of approximately LE 1.9 billion. A
numbero fpolitically difficult but necessaryreforms have beenintroducedsince the diagnostic
was carried out. These include increasing premiums to cover well over half o f the shortfall
and making up much o f the balance through passage o f a new law capping pay out levels.
While the result i s probably still somewhat short o f required premiums rates it i s likely that
the MTPL class of insurance will be an economic proposition for insurerswithin 1to 2 years.
A major consumer education plan is beingprepared to explainthe needfor premium increases
and to explain the nature o f insurance. The submission o f applications to enter this business
by 12 insurers is an indication ofthe success ofthis reform.

85.        Life insurance reserving and associated solvency requirements in the state owned
insurers has to date, not fully allowed for the excessively generous returns being offered by
the state insurers on savings contracts relative to the returnsavailable inthe capital markets2'.
Minimum life reserving standards need to be established by the supervisor possibly
supplementedby a reviewofthe current relatively weak life solvency standard and caps on the
returns being offered under traditional savings contracts. Ideally steps should also be taken to
                                                                           .
ensure that actuaries certifying life mathematical reserves and long tail non life claims
provisions have at least the relevant specialist subjects in the Institute o f Actuaries
examinations, or the equivalent under the American system.22 A similar and perhaps more
urgent requirements exist for actuaries carrying out funding level examinations o f defined
benefit pension funds given the current mismatch between needs and resources and the
numerous law suits beingbrought by plan members. A plan will be produced by March 2008
to develop a program to produce certified pension actuaries, probably involving a ramping up
o fthe current arrangements with the UK actuarial training facilities.




2'The mergerof Misr andAI Chark should helpthe marketreturnto a healthierequilibriumin this regard.
2z At present local actuaries are certified once they obtainUK Instituteof US Society Associate status. These qualifications
are facilitated through courses arranged through Cairo University and American University respectively, although different
mechanismsare involved.

                                             - 25 -

86.      The operationsupports the authorities in improving the sector's legalframework. A
major development in this regard was the enactment o f the Stamp Law o f 2006, with stamp
duty dropping overall by 50 percent and being removed altogether for life insurance.
Corporate brokers have been on the agenda for some time and needto be introducedthrough a
redrafting o f Insurance Law 10, given that Egypt does not have a separate agents and brokers
law. This, along with a number o f other reforms needed inthe short term, including increasing
minimum capital and splitting all life and non life activities, has been included in amending
law which has beencleared by the President o f Egypt. O f critical importance i s an amendment
that will enable EISA to become financially independent, a basic requirement under the IAIS
insurance core principles and a major step forward. The draft amending law will be submitted
to parliament in April 2008. A major overhaul of the insurance law i s planned for 2009, by
which time Solvency I1and other international developments such as the insurance contracts
accounting standard should have beenagreed and formalized.

87.     A project of law has also been prepared by EISA to address the problems of the
currently small and largely unfunded private pensions market. Infact, although 628 funds
operated in 2006, managing assets in the order o f LE 18.6 billion, the existing plans are
largely unfunded and do not provide lifetime old age income protection to the circa nine
million workers covered. Under the new law, insurance companies and specialized fund
managers will be allowed to offer a wider variety o f pension plans under the supervision o f
EISA. The reform of the legal framework is an important initial condition, although the
possibilities o f a substantial market expansion will need a close complementarity with
ongoing public pensions and capital market reforms.

88.     The Egyptian Insurance Federation i s beginning to take on an outreach role although
there appears to still be some misunderstanding o f how an industry association should operate.
The Federation represents the industry and its role should be limitedto educational activities,
advocacy on behalf o f the industry and preparation o f general non binding advisory material.
Its traditional tariff and control role needs to be reconsidered and its charter will need to
reflect this.

vi.     Improvingthe Efficiency of Capital Markets

89.     The Government has an ambitious agendafor developing capital markets and has
been able to achievepositive outcomes in recentyears. The set o f measures since July 2006
and supported by DPL-I1 (the second phase o f the reform) includes measures to improve
further the equity market, create a sound basis for securitizations, build a solid institutional
investor base through separate reforms inthe areas o f insurance, investment funds and pension
funds, and strengthenfurther the supervisory framework.

90.     The proposed operation would assist the authorities in developing the equity
markets further.     The regulatory and institutional measures supported by the loan would
include: (i)introduction in 2007 o f IFRS standards for listed firms and securities companies,
(ii)introductionofinternationalauditingstandardsin2009;(iii)establishment in2007 ofa
registry for external auditors at the CMA, to be followed by the issue o f stricter rules on
external auditor qualifications; (iv) issue o f a regulation in 2007 with further additions in
2008, strengtheningcapital adequacy and risk management standards for securities firms, (v)
submission to Parliament o f a C M L amendment, simplifying the fragmented CASE listing

                                                          - 26 -

 schedules and abolishing the special treatment of SOEs; (vi) issue of a decree in 2008 on
takeovers and public tender offers; and (vii) establishing a stock exchange for listing and
trading SMEs.

91.     The government is building a solid institutional investor base, and has specijic
agendasfor the insurance sector, the private pension sector, and investmentfunds. The
insurance reforms were described above. Regarding the pension sector, the government i s
preparing a systemic pension reform which is out of the scope of this operation.23However,
the proposed loan would support ongoing efforts by EISA to addresses the mainweaknesses
inthe existing occupational schemes, through the formation of specialized pension actuaries
and the actuarial assessment of all definedbenefitpensions schemes, as a step to eliminate the
problems of under-funding. The loan would also support the completion of draft legislation
that would revamp the private pension sector by inter alia, licensing and supervising newly
defined collective pension funds and pension companies that would provide professional
management and offer newvoluntary pension accounts.

92.     The issuance of a new regulation that would revamp the regulatory framework for
investmentfunds andfacilitate their soundgrowth-an area supportedby the proposedloan.
The new executive regulations clarifies: (i)the legal structure of investment funds; (ii)                            the
roles and obligations of sponsors and related parties; (iii)              improve the computation of net asset
values, sales and redemption procedures; (iv) improve further the quality of disclosure to
investors; and (v) reduce minimum paid-up capital for fund general partner to two percent of
assets under management. These improvements are complementedby the creation of a regime
to governthe issue of exchange traded funds on CASE.

vii.    Strengtheningthe SupervisoryFrameworkfor CapitalMarkets

93.     Under Phase II, the authorities will ensure substantial progress in the
implementation of the institutional and operational restructuring of CMA asper the agreed
framework. On the legal front, the tools to combat market manipulation and insider trading
will be enhancedby the addition of Chapter 11to the CML's Executive Regulations. Having
recently established a supervisory department, with staff assigned and trained, CMA will
continue to improve its supervision and market surveillance, while transitioning from
compliance-basedto risk-based supervision inconformancewith IOSCO principles.

viii.   Strengtheningthe FinancialSector InstitutionalInfrastructure

94.     The establishment of a private credit bureau in 2007 is a major accomplishment
that is supported by theproposed loan. The bureaubecame operational inMarch 2008 with
credit information from two million borrowers (both individuals and SMEs). It is building its
credit-information database from several sources ,including the public credit registry, banks
and non-bank financial institutions, and in a second phase mobile phone operators. Credit
reports will be updated on a monthly basis and will include both positive and negative credit
information. The bureau has been supported by IFC experts and is expected to provide
comprehensive and reliable credit information services by 2009. The amount and quality of


23The HD network is leading the policy dialogue in this area and providing technical assistanceto the Government under an
RTA agreement.

                                               - 27 -

 information on clients' creditworthiness at the public credit registry will be significantly
 improved. It will identify the manner of payment, the length o f the outstanding loans, the
history of loan balances and repayments, and any changes in the terms of the loan. This will
helpidentify cases ofrescheduling and rollingover o floans.

95.      The CBEhas signed a contract with aprivate vendorZ4to develop a Real Time Gross
Settlement (RTGS) system. The RTGS system should be introduced by early 2009. In
addition, CBE i s developing the regulations o f an Automatic Clearing House (ACH) to reduce
total processing time o f checks inside CBE from 25 days to 2-3 days. Regarding the retail
payments system, CBE i s promoting the use o f plastic cards, and the use o f ATM, and
EFTPOS, and aiming at a substantial increase o f ATM machines and improvements in the
quality o f service.

96.      Developing a strategy for the introduction o f microlending through NBFI in order to
increase access to microcredit among lower-income segments o f the Egyptian population i s
one o f the main components o f the proposed operations. The Ministry o f Investment, in
consultation with the CBE and other relevant parties, has been working on developing a new
NBFIcategory, which is expected to be authorized in late 2008. The Ministry of Investment
has also prepared related regulations and a supervisory framework intended to streamline
microlending NBFI registration and licensing, outline the process o f supervision and provide
guidelines for microfinance operations based on international best practices.

         c.   PROGRAM FEATURE LOAN AND         AMOUNT

97.      The proposed DPL would be a single tranche loan in an amount of US$500 million
equivalent. Disbursement would occur upon Board approval o f the loan, following the
realization o f up-front specific actions below, and inthe Operational Policy Matrix.

98,      The government reform program represents a consistent and self-reinforcing package
implementedover the medium term. The proposed single tranche DPL aims at locking in a
set o f irreversible policy measures under the program second phase and at supporting the
reform momentum, while hrther World Bank assistance through follow-up operations would
be decided in light o f government actions (outlined in an operational policy matrix provided
in Annex 2), which require more time to implement, and which will further consolidate the
structural changes in banking and insurance, and capital markets over the 2008 medium-term
framework o f the reform agenda. The government position and vision for the sector are laid
out and detailed ina letter o f development policy addressed to the World Bank (Annex I).

99.     The proposed operation and its presentation for World Bank Board approval would be
conditional upon maintenance o f a sound macro-economic framework consistent with the
objectives o f the financial sector reform program, and completion o f the Government's reform
actions outlined inAnnex 2. These are:

     i. Reductionofpublicownershipandcontrolofbankstolessthan50percentoftotal
           banking sector assets, through: completion o f privatization o f Bank o f Alexandria,

     joint-venture banks, as well as further consolidation o f the banking system to 40
     banks through mergersand acquisitions.
ii. Financialand operational restructuringofthe commercial state-owned banks-
     adoption o f a viable, time-bound, operational scheme for the settlement o f SOEs'
     NPLs whereby outstanding NPLsas o fJune 2004 will drop by at least 60 percent by
     May 2008, progress in provisioning for NPLs o f state-owned commercial banks;
     substantial progress in the implementation o f the operational and institutional
     restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks (Annex 3); and finalizing the
     TORS o f the financial due diligence o f the three state-owned specialized banks
     (Annex 4).
iii. Strengtheningthe legal, regulatory and supervisory framework of the banking
     system via satisfactory implementation of the program for capacity building in
     banking regulation and supervision, including new on-site inspection reports and
     associated training program, preparation for CAMEL based off-site reporting and
     operational macro prudential unit (Annex 5).
iv.  Restructuringthe state-owned insurance companies. Completion o fthe legal merger
     o f the three state-owned insurance companies into Misr Insurance Company;
     appointment o f an investment bank to advise on the operational restructuring o f the
     newly merged state-owned insurance company (terms o f reference attached in
     Annex 6).
v.   Strengthening legal regulatory and supervisory framework in insurance and
     pensions. Adoption o f new organizational structure o f EISA consistent with an
     appropriate risk based supervisory model. Enactment o f new MTPL Law and
     Executive Regulations, beginning to raise premiums to actuarially required levels;
     and update MTPL claims provision, as well as submission to Parliament o f key
     amendments to Insurance Law 10, including: (i)      increase in minimum capital; (ii)
     corporatization o f insurance brokers; (iii)independent funding for EISA; and (iv)
     Separation of life and non-life insurance business. Inaddition to the completion o f a
     draft law overhauling the regulatory framework for private pension funds (Annex
     7).
vi.  Improving the ability o f capital markets to provide financing and capital
     market/corporate governance discipline through the adoption and implementationo f
     IFRS requirements for listed companies and securities firms; establishment of a
     registry for auditors at the CMA; enhanced capital adequacy regulations and risk
     management for financial intermediaries; and establishment o f listing requirements
     and regulatory framework for the new SME stock exchange (NILEX), as well as
     better disclosure, legal and pricing clarifications, and reduced capital burdens for
     the sponsors of investment funds (Annex 8).
vii. Strengtheningthe financial sector institutional infrastructure, through improvingthe
     quality and credibility o f the credit-information system, requires developing the
    public credit registry and operationalizing the newprivate credit bureau; continuing
    the modernization o f the payments system at CBE; and setting the legal framework
     for specialized economic courts to address problems o f bankruptcy, foreclosure, and
     cumbersome judicial system, as well as regulatory framework for microfinance.

                                              - 29 -

100.     In sum, DPL I1 supports the second phase of the government reform program which
has a medium-termimplementation frame. Follow-up support from the World Bank, beyond
the proposed loan, could be envisaged in line with the progress o f structural reforms and
satisfactory implementation o f agreed restructuring and capacity building programs.
Moreover, while financial and operational restructuring o f the state-owned banks i s a critical
part o f banking sector reform and strengthening, full success could also depend on the
corporate restructuring o f delinquent borrowers, and for which a solid corporate restructuring
strategy i s requiredThe development o f such a strategy may also be part o f follow-up support
from the World Bank.

         D. EXPECTED    OUTCOMES OFTHE OPERATION

 101.    The positive developments that took place should ultimately contribute to better
resource allocation and long-run growth performance. These reforms are building a more
resilient, effective, well-capitalized, and competitive financial system led by private sector
banks and operating under a much improved regulatory framework. One o f the main outcomes
o f the proposed operation i s decreasing the public ownership in financial institutions. Such
outcome will be measured by indicators such as the sales o f shares in state-owned banks,
joint-venture banks, and the mergedpublic sector insurance company. By addressing the high
level o f NPLs in public financial institutions-with       its deleterious effect on the banking
system as a whole-together      with the necessary and parallel strengthening o f the regulatory
environment, the operation would help alleviate one o f the impediments to a more efficient
functioning o f the financial system, and its ability, in the medium-term, to improve financial
intermediation insupport o f real sector growth.

102.     The full implementation of the bank reforms should result in a well-capitalized and
competitive banking system led by private sector banks and operating under a much improved
regulatory framework. Bank credits are beginningto recover and should expand further inthe
next few years, after several years o f decline relative to GDP and bank assets (a normal
outcome in periods o f restructuring and regulatory reform). Moreover, the private banks are
preparing themselves for lending to under-servedsectors, such as housing and SMEs. These
are positive developments, which should ultimately contribute to better resource allocation
and long-run growth performance.

103.     The creation of a new category of non-deposit taking microcredit NBFIwill facilitate
the development o f a vibrant microlending NBFI sector providing access to microcredit and
providing related economic benefits for low-income and rural populations inEgypt. This new
category o f microlending NBFI, in making microfinance a viable and robust sector, will help
Egyptianauthorities meetthe dual challenges ofreducingunemployment andpoverty.

104.     All this is expected to improve access to finance, particularly for SMEs, as well as
facilitate the development o f independent leasing and mortgage finance companies. A more
supportive institutional framework, through operationalizing the private credit bureau,
establishing the specialized economic courts, and modernizing the payments system, will
enhance the extension o f credit and encourage the development o f non-bank financial
institutions, which will ultimately facilitate access to financial services, and decrease the
overall costs o f intermediation. Progress inthe implementationo f the Financial Sector Reform

                                                 - 30 -

Program will be monitored, and its output, outcomes, and impact will be assessed and
measured through various indicators for each sector (Annex 9). These reforms are creating the
conditions for a much more resilient and effective financial sector, capable o f contributing
positively to Egypt's growth inthe remainder o fthe decade and beyond.


                           VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

        A. POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS

 105.   There is a large body o f research findings within and outside the World Bank showing
that financial sector reforms are demonstrably linked to growth and poverty reduction. They
are fundamental to reforms in other sectors, including private sector development,
infrastructure, housing and social policies. Strengthening financial infrastructures acts as a
steady promoter o f growth and reduces the frequency and cost o f financial crises. Prevention
o f financial crises i s essential to poverty reduction. For these reasons, buildingsound, efficient
and inclusive financial systems that work for all members of society and that are not prone to
abuse or corruption is central to the growth and poverty reduction agenda. The operation
objectives to improve the efficiency o f the financial sector will have a direct and positive
impact on growth. Through this operation, a more efficient financial sector i s expected to
improve savings mobilization and access to finance by private enterprises-key           drivers o f
investment and growth-so          they may invest and create the necessary jobs that raise living
standards.

106.    Bank restructuring would normally be associated in the short-term with staff
redeployment resultingfrom optimization o f labor input and skill upgrading. To mitigate thus
the potential social impact of the restructuring process at Bank of Alexandria and the other
state-owned commercial banks, voluntary severance packages have been offered to employees
who wish to avail themselves o f early retirement schemes. Training programs are also offered
to staff whose positions at their level o f expertise may be eliminated. The proposed operation
concerns broad strategic reform decisions and would therefore not include a social protection
component. Moreover the proposed operation would have no meaningful impact on clients or
social groups that might be foregoing benefits currently accruing to them from state-owned
banking activities. Indeed, state-owned commercial banks had already parted with
government-directed lending policies, and were no longer extending credit to public
enterprises unable to service debt. The preparation o f the proposed operation has entailed
broad discussions with market participants from all pillars o f the financial sector.

        B. IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGEVALUATION    AND

107.    The Bank will monitor the overall status ofthe government's Financial Sector Reform
Program to ensure that the program i s well on track. Regular Bank missions will interact
closely with staff of the Ministry o f Investment and CBE, the two entities responsible for
overall implementation o f the reform program, and for reporting progress and coordinating
actions among other concerned agencies. Bank staff will also interact with the different
regulatory and supervisory bodies-MFA,           EISA, and CASE, given their responsibility for
supervising non-bank financial institutions. Bank staff will also continue the policy dialogue

                                                          - 3 1 -

 from the field with the institutions involved inthe implementation o f the operation, as well as
 coordinate effectively with donors. Bank missions will review government progress in the
 implementationo f Phase I1o f the reform program, monitor actions, ensuringthat the expected
 project outputs, outcomes and impact materializes.

 i.         ContinuingBankDialoguewith the EgyptianAuthorities

  108.      The Bank will continue the policy dialogue with the Egyptian authority on the
 financial sector reforms. The financial sector dialogue conducted in Egypt over the past few
 years has allowed for differences betweenthe authorities and the World Bank to be narrowed
 down, and for a common view to emerge on a number o f sector policy issues embodied inthe
 Financial Sector Reform Program, such as retaining public ownership, and governance o f
 state-owned financial institutions. There has been a broad agreement on the substance and
 design o f the operation components, the scope o f World Bank assistance, and the need to
 proceed diligently with the reform program. Actions on these components are, overall,
 progressing satisfactorily. There i s also a shared understanding among development partners
 actively involved inthe financial sector reforms, inparticular USAID, EU, and AfDB that are
 supporting the objectives o f the proposed operation andhave indicated their intent to continue
 their financial and technical assistance to the authorities in the financial sector, all of which
 would ensure effective completion o f the reform program. In that context, the Bank will
 ensure the deployment o f staff and consultants able to advise the government in all o f the
 policy and technical areas pertaining to the reforms.

 ii. MonitoringOutput,OutcomesandImpactoftheOperation

 109.       Monitorable indicators have been developed to assess progress in the implementation
o f the operation, supporting the Financial Sector Reform Program. Output i s defined as a
decrease in government ownership o f financial intermediaries, and stronger regulatory and
 supervisory frameworks. Outcomes are defined as market structure measured by concentration
rates; contestability and competition measured by ease o f entry and absence o f restrictions on
activities; efficiency measured by interest rates spreads; and health of the financial institutions
measured by capital adequacy, quality o f assets, and NPLs. Finally, the impacts are defined as
financial sector depth in banking, as measured by deposits as a percentage o f GDP; credit to
the private sector as percentage of GDP25;and size and efficiency of capital markets, as
measured by listings, issues and turnover. Annex 9 contains details on the specific indicators
for each sector.

 110.       Bank system. Three aspects o f bank performance would be closely scrutinized:
solvency and sustainable profitability. Indicators usedto assess bank solvency include, NPLs-
to-total loans ratios and provisions-to-NPLs; while those to assess bank profitability include
operating expenses-to-gross operating income, earnings per employee, and profitability ratios,
include return-on-assets and return-on-equity. Indicators used to measure the change in the
financial intermediation capacity o f the banking system and degree o f financial depthinclude,
credit-to-GDP ratio; rate o f growth of private sector credit, rate o f growth o f credit to SOEs,
and loans-to-deposits ratio.


25Credit to the private sector (as a percent of GDP) may decline hrther in the final stage of restructuring, as a result of the
final settling ofNPLs and provisioning, beforerecovering on a sustained basis.

                                             - 32 -

 111.   Insurance. Aspects o f insurer performance that will be considered include: premium
penetration, real asset growth, solvency, and overall operating performance. Indicators usedto
assess insurer solvency are solvency margin and quality o f reinsurance. Overall performance
i s measured by combined ratios which measure the ratio o f claims plus expenses to premiums.

 112.   Capitalmarkets. Measures to be used include market performance, investor base, and
financial products. Indicators for market performance, include new issues, volume o f trading,
and market concentration. Investors' base will be assessed through indicators such as retail
investors, institutional, and foreign investors; and on financial products, developments o f
mutual funds, IPOs, secondary public offerings, and securitizations will be monitored.

 113.   Prudential regulations and supervision. Improving prudential regulations to be
consistent with international norms, and strengtheningthe supervisory authorities o f bank and
non-bank financial institutions to adhere more closely to international principles, are
important components o f the reform program, and one o f the main objectives o f the proposed
loan. According to a recent IEG report, this i s one o f the key reforms that would insure
sustainability and preventsthe reoccurrence o f problems o f the past.

 114.   Accordingly, the Bank has agreed with the authorities on numerous indicators by
which the output, outcome and the impact o f the operation, as well as the effective
implementation o f the Financial Sector Reform Program will be measured. Thus, the Bank
will ensure effective and periodic monitoring of the overall status o f the Government's
program to determine whether country conditions and the specific conditions o f the proposed
operation have been met, as well as the outputs, outcomes, and impact o f the reforms have
materialized.

        C. FIDUCIARY     ASPECTS

i.      PublicFinancialManagement(PFM)

115.    As stated in OP 8.60-Development      Policy Lending "Drawing on relevant analysis o f
the country's PFM, the Bank determines whether the operation should include measures to
address identified fiduciary weaknesses". The 2003 CFAA concluded that the Egyptian PFM
system constituted a significant fiduciary risk due'to the perceived weaknesses in accounting
and reporting process and oversight functions whether through internal audit, external audit or
the Parliament. The new Minister of Finance is particularly keenon getting an assessment of
the development risk inherent inthe massive PFM reforms, whether launched or planned, and
inthe sequencing ofthose reforms.

116.   The Bank launched a CFAA update in 2007 and some significant improvements were
noted. Highlights include a major increase in transparency, including making public the
2004/05 budget; the extension o f the 2005/06 budget to include quasi-fiscal activities for
payments to state enterprises and consumers and to bring into the TSA approximately 5000
special revenue accounts o f ministries, departments and agencies. The passage o f revisions to
the Law on Accounting gave authority for the creation o f the TSA and the introduction of a
GFS-2001-compliant chart o f accounts with an 8 chapter classification structure. The
government signed the IMF's Special data Dissemination Standard and prepares a monthly

                                               - 33 -

Financial Bulletin and a quarterly Economic Monitor. Ministry of Finance is continuing its
work to establish a well-trained macro-fiscal unit to prepare a multi-year fiscal and
expenditure framework to guide future budget preparation activities and has issued a policy
forbidding state guarantees for state enterprises.

117.     Work on other key reforms continues, however, further improvements could be
achieved through the implementation of the budget process modernization plan for budget
preparation, execution and reporting through: (i)   revised budget legislation drafted; (ii)
                                                                                           launch
the process of restructuring the Ministry of Finance, including development of the internal
audit function; (iii) finalize the implementation of the TSA process; and (iv) develop a plan
for the implementation ofthe integratedinformation system.

ii. CorporateFinancialReporting(CFR)

118.     Ministry of Investment is leading the reform in the area of CFR through many
initiatives that are either locally funded or through donors. During the past three years, Egypt
had made significant efforts to align CFR requirementswith the international standards and to
close the "compliance gap" inboth accounting and auditing practices. The Bank launched an
Accounting & Auditing ROSC update in 2007 and some significant improvements were
noted. Highlights include (i)a new Accounting Practice Law has been drafted and reviewed
by the Bank, though not yet beenratified; (ii)   translation of IFRS into Arabic and developing
the needed arrangements to update on annual basis; (iii) quality control standards as a
                                                            issued
listing requirement; and (iv) working on translating ISA. Further improvements could be
achieved by the following actions: (i)   issuing a decree creating the Audit Oversight Board at
the CMA; (ii)   developing a plan to enhance the capacity of the CMA inmonitoring CFR; and
(iii) adecreetoadoptthenewlytranslatedIFRS(Le., EgyptianAccountingStandards).

         D. DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                              AND

119.     The proposed operation will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for DPLs.
The amount will be disbursed in one tranche in the full amount of the loan, against
Government agreement on the medium-termframework of policy and institutional reforms as
summarizedinthe letter of developmentpolicy.

 121.    The Bank will request the auditors o f CBE to conduct a special audit o f the dedicated
account established there. The audit will cover the accuracy o f the summary o f transactions o f
the dedicated account, including accuracy ofexchange rate conversions; the dedicated account
was used only for the purposes o f the operation where no other amounts have been deposited
into the account, including obtaining confirmations from corresponding bank(s) involved in
the funds flow. The audit should be conducted six months after the funds in the dedicated
account have been fully utilized. The time period for submission o f the audit report to the
Bank i s three months.

         E. ENVIRONMENTAL       ASPECTS

 122.    Since this proposed operation i s a Development Policy Lending (or DPL) it falls under
the recently approved OPBP 8.60. As the operation is not expected to have significant
environmental effect, according to OPBP 8.60, safeguard policies (such as OP4.01
Environmental Impact Assessment) do not apply to development policy lending, and an
Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) i s not needed. The financial sector policies supported
by the proposed adjustment loan are not likely to have any significant direct effects on the
environment and natural resources. In addition, the indirect impacts that the DPL i s likely to
have on the environment are difficult to predict but are expected to be marginal.

         F. RISKSAND RISKSMITIGATION

123.     Potential risks associated with the Financial Sector Reform Program and the proposed
operation, include: (i)  political risk and stakeholders' opposition; (ii) risk; (iii)fiscal
                                                                           social
sustainability; (iv) governance risk-restructuring     and recapitalizing state-owned banks; and
(v) sustainability and irreversibility risk.Measures to mitigate such riskshave beenconsidered
under the reform program. Means of mitigation have also beendiscussed and agreed on with
the Bank. Nevertheless, the risks, uncertainties and challenges that may affect the
implementation o f the reform program are non-trivial and must be acknowledged.

i.       PoliticalRisk and Stakeholders' Opposition

124.    At the global level, one risk could be that political and stakeholder opposition would
weaken government resolve to pursue the needed macroeconomic policy and structural
reforms. A vocal media opposition has developed against the privatization program, and
especially the selling o f public assets to foreign investors. Several privatization transaction o f
SOEs and those o f state-owned banks were met by attach from parliamentarians. The
government officials are communicating regularly with the public on the objectives o f the
reforms, and expected outcomes, to narrow differences and to reach a common view on a
number of policy issues. There has also been better communications o f the government's
Financial Sector Reform Program to the various stakeholders-parliamentarians,          media, and
political parties. Accordingly, the political risk accompanying public opinion is moderate, as
the government is showingclear commitment and persistence inpursuingthe implementation
o f the reform program, even when they are o f unpopular nature, conscious that gains from
such reforms would be evident inthe long-term.

                                              - 35 -

ii. SocialRisk

125.    Although the Egyptian authorities are moving forward with their reform agenda, and
growth rates have increased significantly, there have been concerns of deteriorating social
conditions, and the emergence of a less inclusive economy. The impact of the reform
measures are not evident to the public, especially the disadvantaged, and that there has been
signs of unevendistribution inthe gains from reforms. This has beenaccentuatedwith the rise
in international prices. In addition, restructuring state-owned financial institutions is often
associated with the laying-off of redundant workers. The reform program in Egypt centered
more on changes inthe regulatory and supervisory framework, and did not require large staff
layoffs. Where labor redeployment is envisaged, contingency financing in terms of voluntary
early retirement and compensation schemes has been planned to alleviate the resulting social
burden, accordingly social risk i s moderate. Indeed, voluntary and attractive retirement
packageshave beenoffered to employees of state-ownedbanks. As a result ofthe scheme and
natural attrition, the state-ownedbanks labor force was reducedby over 25 percent since the
launch of the program in later 2004 compared to the 3-year pre-privatization period. The
funding dedicated to this first wave of departure was fully spent under Phase Iof the reform
program. Such schemes for voluntary retirement have been coupled with staff training and
skills upgrading for employees whose current profile may not readily fit in the organization
chart ofthe restructured and merged institutions.

iii. FiscalSustainability

126.    The fiscal costs of the financial sector reform program will be moderate. Although the
Government i s borrowing from international institutions to finance part of the restructuring,
this amount to a modest share of the financing package (see paragraph 22). The largest
sources of financing consist of the sales of state shares inbanks and non-banking companies,
and the sales of undervalued assets in the banks (investments and real estate). Moreover, it
must be stressed that the Government's program recognizes losses that exist already, and
includemeasures that will stop further losses.

127.    Specifically, the potential fiscal costs of a financial sector restructuring are
traditionally associated with settlement of NPLs, tax settlement, and labor downsizing, which
inthe current phase offinancial sector restructuring do not imply a significant fiscal burden:
        .   The Government estimated the financial sector restructuring cost related to NPLs
            at approximately LE 50 billion (US$9 billion equivalent). It is using the following
            resources to defray these costs (i)sale proceeds from Bank of Alexandria
            (LE 9.1 billion from the strategic investor plus the planned IPO of the remaining
            15 percent) to partially settle SOEs' NPLs owed to National Bank of Egypt, Bank
            Misr and Banque du Caire; (ii) loans from the IBRD (DPL I)and the AfDB
                                              the
            (totaling US$ 1billion); (iii) sales proceeds o f IPOs by SOEs (e.g., Telecom
                                          partial
            Egypt ), (iv) sales proceeds from the divesture of public bank equity in joint
            venture companies includingjoint venture banks, (v) proceeds from settlements o f
            private NPLs, (vi) banks'profit from operations, and (vii) the loan from the IBRD
            (DPL II), amounting to US$500million.

                                                - 36 -

            The operation i s not expected to have other costs related to labor separation or tax
            settlement. The cost o f separation packages, if any, i s expected to be borne by the
            banks themselves. In the privatization o f Bank o f Alexandria, voluntary early
            retirement packages were offered but very few were taken. The transaction also
            included a condition on the strategic, investor not to fire employees after the
            privatization. Also, there i s no tax settlements cost to the budget.

128.    As examined inmore detail in Sections 1I.B and ILC, although the Government faces
the challenge o f managing a large fiscal deficit and a sizable public sector debt, the debt
remains manageable under various reasonable scenarios. Moreover, the debt projections will
be not be significantly affected by the borrowing undertaken as part o fthe proposed operation
and the reforms baragraphs 21 and 22).

iv.     Governance Risk-State-owned           Bank Restructuring and Recapitalization
        without Privatization

129.    The challenges associated with restructuringstate-owned financial institutions are well
documented. Therefore, the risk o f suboptimal use o f funds to shore up their balance sheet
structure should not be underestimated. The financial restructuring of state-owned banks in
which the state has not declared its intention to divest its shareholding entails risks that the
restructured institution and the government may not depart from old lending practices that
were at the root o f current problems. The history o f state-owned bank restructuring is full o f
cases o f bank recapitalization that has gone awry and ledto instances o f financial support that
failed to shore up the bank's position on a sustained basis.

130.    To reduce this risk, the operation depends first on the commitment o f the government
to banking and financial sector reform, demonstrated by the substantial reform efforts that
have already taken place in both the financial sector and the state owned enterprises, and in
strengthening the central bank regulatory and supervisory role. Second, the risk will be
mitigated through the restructuring and privatization o f SOEs, to ensure that previous
problems will not recur. Third, the financial restructuring and recapitalization plan is being
implementedby new, commercially oriented management and reputable international firms.
These programs seek a strengtheningo f bank governance and an overhaul o f lendingand risk
control practices. Full implementation o f the institutional and operational restructuringplan i s
thus a critical part, and a specific focus of the government and central bank's banking sector
reform program, and for which important finding has been earmarked to secure expert
assistance from leading international banks. As some financial institutions will remain in
public hands, it will be crucial to ensure good governance structure and close monitoring o f
the restructuringplans by the CBE (acting on the owner's behalf) throughout the restructuring
period.

131.    Moreover, the risk o f retaining financial institutions in public hands would be
mitigated through building credible and independent regulatory authorities. Strengtheningthe
regulatory and supervisory framework 'is essential for ensuring nonoccurrence of previous
problems and sustainability. It i s crucial to continue the ongoing program to strengthen the
bank regulation and supervision framework,              including further strengthening off-site
supervision, improving banks' provisioning, risk management and governance. The credibility
and independence o f the regulator i s the base upon which a resilient financial system may

                                           - 37 -

emerge. The risks associatedwith this componentrelate to the authorities' ability, within the
programtimeframe, to strengthenthe regulatory and supervisoryframework. These risks will
be mitigated by supporting, inter-alia through resident external expertise, the banking and
insurance supervisors' on-goingefforts to implementthe programsthat have beendevised.

v.     Sustainability and Irreversibility

132.   The past four years have proven that the government is committed to the full
implementation of the reform program, and in many cases to delivering more than was
envisioned. The successful completion of Phase Iof the reform program and the strong
dialogueto date and requestsfor technicalassistanceto implementthe reformsleavethe Bank
confident about the executionofPhase 11.

                             IACTTER OF DEVELOPMENT    POLICY



DearMr.Zoelfick,

        With the appointment of a new cabinet in July 2004, the Egyptian Government has
embarkedon a comprehensive programof macroeconomicand structuraIreforms.A keypillar
of this comprehensive &Tort is the "Financial Sector Reform Program (2#5-2008)".This
program aims at creating a sound and diversified financial sector, capable of contributingto
Egypt's growth perFormance and providing access to financial services to a much broader
segment of the Egyptian population. The main components of this program include the
empowerment of the private sector in the provisionof financial services, the development of
effectivebank and non-bank institutionsprovidinga wide rangeof financial services, and the
strengthening offinancial infrwtroctureandthe regulatoryand supervisoryframework.

        Due to the scale and complexity of the program, we initially focused our efforts in
addressing the problems in the banking sector, although in this period we also initiated
refoms designed to develop insurancc and other nan-bank intermediaries and strengthen
capital markets. This first stage of the reform program was supported by the World Bank
through the First Development Policy Loan (DPL, I)approved by the World Bank Board in
                                                 -
June 2006.

                                              - 11.. -

        Since the approval of DPL-I, we have been deepening further the bank reforms,
creatingthe legaland institutionalframework for mortgage finance, andhavemade substantial
progress in the agenda for the non-bankingsectors, especially the insurance sector and capital
markets. We have also made substantialprogress in improvingthe financial infrastructureand
the overall regulatory framework for financial activities. We would like to stress our
commitment to the complete and prudent implementationof these reforms, which are fully
consistent with the recommendations of the recent World Bank-IMF Financial Sector
Assessment ProgramUpdate(FSAP Update). We seek continuedWorld Banksupport to this
secondstage ofour reformprogramthrougha SecondDevelopmentPolicy Loan@PL 10.             -
        We would like to start this letter by emphasizing our commitment to macroeconomic
stability, as this is a pre-condition for the successful implementationof the financial sector
reform program. We will then explain our progrcss to date in implementing the 'financial
reform program and the policyactionsalready taken to meet the targets and objectivesset by
the programby end-2008


1..     THEMACROECONOMICFRAMEWORK

        The boldefforts of the EgyptianGovernment to improvemacroeconomicperformance
and induce structural reforms act?reflected in the key macroeconomic indicators. The major
componentsof the economic reform agenda includedmeasuresto liberalizethe economy and
strengthen the roleofthe privatesector inleadinggrowthand creatingjobs. These effortshave
strengthened the confidence in the Egyptian economy and contributed to an impressive
improvement in growth performance, as indicated by the GDP growth rate of 7.1% during
fiscal year 2006/2007. This was the outcome of a series of economic policiesthat included:

    Onthe monetary side, the initiationofadollar inter-bank system together with an inflation
    targetingmechanismthat have stabilized the foreign exchange marketand contributd to a
    significant increase in international reserves to WSD 31.5 billion by end of November
    2007.
    Trade reforms that have lowered average tariff rates and mduced the number of tariff
    bands during September 2004 and 2005, complementad by the setting up of qualified
    industrialzones and a free trade ajpement with Turkey and Russia. These measureshave
    contributed to an impressive growth of exports, from USD 10.4 billion in 20032003 to
    USD22 billion in2005/2007.
    Fiscal refons that entailedcuttingcorporate andpersonal incometax ratesby almost 50%
    inJune2005 andreducingtax holidays. This was accompaniedbyan expansionofthe tax
    base from 1.2 million people to 2.4 million in the first year and 3.1 million in the second
    year, resulting in an increase in tax revenues by 17% in the first year, and 40% in the
    secondyear. These measureswere accompanied by furtherrestructuringof the government
   budget and reductions of the energy subsidies thraugh revisions in the pricesof diesel and
   other fuel prices in July 2006, contributingto the reductionof the budget deficit from 8.2
   %ofGDP in2005/2006to 7.5% ofODP in 2006/2007.


                                               2

    Legal and regulatoryreforms to streamline investment procedures, accompanied by a new
    management of the General Authority of Investment and Free Zones. These measures
    contributedto the doubling of private investment figures in 2006/2007 to L.E. 96 billion,
    or the equivalent of 14% of GDP. Foreigndirect investment also increased substantially
    from 6.5% of GDP in200512006to 9%ofGDP in2006/2007.

         The aforementionedshows the Government's strong commitmentto cconornic reform
and macroeconomic stabiIization. In addition, we would also like to point that the
Government is also implementing a comprehensive social safety net program that would
smooththe impactofthe structurnlreforms.


11.      CHARACTERISTICSOFTHEFINANCIAL SECTOR

         The financial sector in Egyptisdominated by the banking sector, which accounts for
more than 125% of GDP and 95% of the assets of financial institutions. Until recently, the
bankingsector was characterizedby largepublicownership with four state-ownedcommercial
banks (NationalBank of Egypt, RanqueMisr, Banquedu Caire, and Bank of Alexandria), and
three specialized banks (Egyptian Arab Land Bank, Industrial DevelopmentBank of Egypt,
and PrincipalBank for Developmentand Agricultural Credit) and severaljoint venture banks
with directand indirectstate participation.

         The Government is aware that compared to their private counterparts, state-owned
banks lag in efficiency and generally in perfomance, They have ken undercapitalizedand
overstaffed, with poor asset quality, low profit margins, high operatingcosts, and inadequate
risk managementsystems, andhavebeenslow to modernizeand innovate.The poorqualityof
their portfolio has oficiaily been acknowledgedand asscssed through in-depthspecial audits.
Reflecting this awareness the Government has implemented reforms &at have reduced
significantlythe role of the state in the banking sector, and that are submittingthe remaining
state banksto restructuringprograms and stricter governance arrangements, as noted in more
detail ~Iow.

Non-banking financial institutions (insurance companies, pension hnds, and investment
funds) have remained small, accounting for only 7% of GDP and 5% of assets of financial
institutions.The insurance sector accounts for only 3% of CiDP, althoughthe penetration rate
has increased from 0.8% of GDP in 2006 to 1% in 2007, The four largest insurers remain
stateswnedand account for about 60 percent of premiums. The privatepensionfund sector
consists of about 600 small occupationalpension funds accountingfor less than 3% of GDP,
and its regulatory framework has not been updated for more than 20 years. Finally,
investment funds have also remained extremely smalf, as indicated by assets of only 1% of
GDP.



                                               3

                                             - iv -

        In contrast with the weak growth of non-banking institutions, the capital market has
 gmwn significantly, as indicated by the increase in equity market capitalizationfrom about
 40% of GDP in 2004 to more than 90% of GDP recently, as well as the sharp increase in the
 turnover ratio from 20% to 500? in the Same period. The retail investor base has also
expanded significantly, due primarilyto large public iPOs, and today more than 1.5 million
Egyptiansown shares of listed companies. We ate encouraged by these indicators, although
we are aIsoaware that muchremainsto bedoneto buildasotid anddiversifiedcapitalmarket.

        Moreover, the housing finance market witnessed significantprogress in various fronts
relatingto registrationfees, eRciency of proceduresfor landregistration,propertyvaluation,
BCCW    to long-term credit and cost of funding, Fivemortgage finan& companies in addition
to more than 10 banks now operate in the market and around EGP 1.9 billion have b m
extendedasmortgagefinance loans as at September2007,

HI. OVERVIEWOFTMEGOVERNMENT'SFINANCIAL                  SECTORREFORMPROGRAM

        As indicated in our development policy letter for DPL-1, the main components of the
FinancialSector Reform Program initiatedin2005 arethe following:

(i)consolidatingthebankingsectorthroughregulatoryandsupervisoryactionsleadingtothe
exit of small and weak banks; (ii)Fully divesting state-owned banks shares in joint-venture
banks; (Eii)privatizing Bank of Alexandria, one of the four state-awned commercial banks;
(iv) restructuringfinancialfy and operationallythe remaining state-ownedbanks, (v) resolving
the non-performing loan (NPL) problem in the banking sector; (vi) upgrading bank
supervision by the CBE (vii) reforming and developingthe non-bank financial institutions;
and (viii) enhancingfinancial inhsbucture and the overall legaland regulatoryframework for
financial activities.

        When DPL-Iwas approved inJune 2006, we had already made significantprogress in
implementingour FinancialSector Reform Program.The independence and autonomy of the
Central Bank of Egypt was enhanced, while the government strengthened the authority and
resources of the agencies supervising non-bank financial institutions. There was also
significant progress in consolidatingthe bankingsector, divestingstate-owned bank shares in
the joint venture banks, and preparing one of the four state-owned commercial banks for
privatizittion. During this period, we also made progress in restructuringthe state-owned
banksand resolvingthe problemaf NYLs, Finally,the government hadalso laidthe regulatory
conditions for the mortgage finanm, initiatedthe reform of the insurance sector, introduced
several improvements in capilalmarkets, and strengthenedthe legal and regulatoryframework
ofthe financialsector, includingthe conditionsfor the introductionofa privatecredit bureau.

       After the approval of DPL-I, we have made further and substantial progress in
implementingthe Financial Sector Reform Program. The main policy actions in this second

                                            - v -

stage of the program have included the fbrther consolidation of the banking system, the
concfusjon of the privatization of one major state-owned bank, and substantialprogress in
resolvingthe NPLproblemand restructuringthe remainingstate-ownedbanks. Inthe areaOF
housingfinance, significantprogress hasbeenachievedinaddressingvariousissues, including
registration fees, procedures for land registration, pmperty valuation, access to long-term
credit and cost of hding. Five mortgage finance companies in addition to more than 10
banksnow operate inthe market.

        In this second stage of the program we have made substantial progress in
implementingthe agenda for developing the non-banking sectors, especially the insurance
sector. The maructuringofthe insurance sector is very advanced, includingthe creationofa
holdingcompany, the merger of 3 out ofthe 4 state-ownedcompanies, and the preparationof
the merged company for privatization. The legal framework for insurance has been
substantialty improvedthrough severai critical amendmentsto the insurance law. In the case
ofthe pensionsector, we are creatingthe regulatoryand institutionalconditionsfor addressing
the actuarial imbalances of existing defined benefit schemes, and have drafted a law that
would change signidcourtly the structure of this sector. In the case of investment funds, we
hitve issued regulations clarifying their legal structure wid strengthening valuation and
disclosurerules.

        Them have hen several improvementsin the regulatoryand institutional framework
for capital markets. Among other measures, we have adopted International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) For all listed firms and securities companies and plan to adopt
International Standards of Auditing (EA) during 2008.        Capital adequacy stmdards for
intermediaries have been strengthened, listing schedules simplified and a new SME stock
exchange introduced. The Government is currently considering the merge of non bank
financial regulators into an effectiveregulator. These effortswere made in close cooperation
with the WorldBank andother development partners.
Iv.     IMPLEMENTATIONOFTHE GOVERNMENT'S           FINANCIALSECTORREFORMPROGRAM

        We would like to provideadditionaldetailsabout the implementationof our Financial
Sector Reform Program, and highlightthe measuresthat are beingimplementedin the second
stage ofthe program, that would be supported by the proposedDPGII. Before that, however,
we would like to stress that we havecontinued to implementa major piece of legislationthat
was enacted at the start of the program, namefy, the. Central Rank, Banking System, and
Money Law 88 of 2003. This law has allowed for: (i) enhancing the independence of the
central bank; (ii)enforcing bank corporate governance rules; (iii)strengthening prudential
regulations, developing a mechanism to monitor compliance, and revising penalties in line
with international norms; (iv) raising substantially bank minimum paid up capital, (v)
eliminating barriers to bank operational flexibility (sueh as the distinction between
specialized, business, and commercialbanks); (vi) discontinuingthe special treatment ofstate-
owned banks to enhance competition; (vii) assertingthe right of private sector parties to own

 shares in state-owned banks; and (viii) establishing principles for loan settlements and
 workouts.



           The public financial institutionrestructuringexercise, currently under way, is now the
 centerpiece of government efforts to enhance the sustainability and eflciency of the Egyptian
 financial sector. Important measures have been adopted by the government to improve the
 sector's legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework. Against that backdrop, the
 government's programofaction is supportedbythe following pillars:

          A. Consolidationof the BankingSector
          The policy of consolidation seeks to create entit`ieswith the necessary economic scale
 able to expand the range of financial services and bank network. Thraugk a series of
 acquisitions, mergers, and revokingof licenses of non-compliantbanks, the number of banks
 and branches of foreign banks was reduced fkom 57 in 2004 to the current number of 40. A
 total of six weak banks have been merged into larger stronger entities, another seven entiies
 were acquiredby other localplayers and subsequently mergedwhile licensesof four branches
 offoreignbankswere revokedfor failureto abide by the minimumcapital requirement.

        B. Divestitureofthe PublicSectorSharesin the Joint Venture Banks
         An important component of the reform program, which had a broader impact on the
ownership and governance structure of the banking sector, is related to the divestiture of
public ownership in joint venture banks where state-owned banks hold shares, and which
account for more than 20 percent of the banking system's total deposits. This structure of
ownership had often led to unwelcome governance and conflict of interest issues although
joint venture banks were, in principle, not subject to centralized management control. Full
divestiture of the stateowned bank shares in the joint venture banks has been considered
essential in altering the ownership landscape and governance ofthe domestic banking system
inamanner thatwould spur increasedcompetition.                            -
                                                 6

                                          - vii -

       The divesture program was very successful and progressed ahead of schedule with
more than 94% of the total portfolio of Joint Venture holdings divested by early 2006,
including the four largest holdings namely, MSGB, MIBank, EAB and CIB. The remaining
four holdings, which areexpected to bedivestedby 2008, are minor interms ofthe percentage
shareholding of state owned banksandor the market share of each bank (collectivclyaround
3% deposit market share). The divestment strategy was geared towards attracting foreign and
regionalstrategic investorsand resultedinthe consolidationofthe positionof several existing
players (e.g. Barclay's. NSGB, Credit Agricole) and the entry of new players (e.g. Pireaus
Group, Blom oflebanon, NationalUnionofDubai)


       C.Privatizationof one ofthe PublicCdmrnerciaf Banks
       The Government of Egypt has successfully completed the privatizationof one ,ofthe
four stateawned commercial banks, namely Bank of Alexandria (BQA)through strategic8
sale ofan 80% stake to the Italianbankinggroup San Pa010 (which later mergedwith Intesato
form Intesa San Paolo) in October 2006. This landmark transaction is expected to bring
enhanced management practices, new technologies, and additional capital to the financial
system throughhigherlevelsofstrategicprivate foreignparticipation.

       BankofAlexandria, ranksas' the fourth largest commercialbank basedontotal assets
and deposits. It offers a wide range of corporate and retail financing products and services
through a network of over 180 branchesand outlets,Major pre-salepreparationsincluded, the
cash settlement of all Public Enterprisenonperformingloans in February 2006, sale of Some
non-core assets duringthe period&om January 2006 to Februw 2006, an audit of the banks
financial statements inaccordance with IFRS, and a complete legal and financial vendor's due
diligence exercise. These actions enhanced the capital structure of the bank and contributed
among other factars   -                                                                     -
                       in the high multipfe paid by the acquirer namely over 6 times book
value. The sales proceeds amounting to US$ 1.6 billion were directed to the settlement of a
large part of the Public Enterprisenon performing loans owed to the remaining three state-
ownedbanksas partoftheir financialrestructuringprogram.

      D, Res4ructuringofState-owned&Inks
       (0 Operationaland InstiiLctiottalrestructuring
       The government views the financial restructuringand rewp,Aization o he remaining
state owned commercialbanks as conditionaluponawell defined institutionaland operational
strengtheningplanwhich would providethe government as owner with the confidence that, in
increasingly open and competitive markets, the restructured institution would be able to
operate on a commerciallysound basis within an adequate governance and incentivestructure.
The government as owner hrrs already launched the process of operational and institutional
restructuring, as well as financial restructuringof public sector financial institutions,although
indepthreforms inthis domainwill take time to implementand complete. The restructuring
plan for the two state owned cornmerciolf banks (National Bank of Egypt, and Banque Misr)
through an in-depth capacity building program is being implemented, and the government
remains fully mobilized for the restructuring process of the specialized banks, namely the
Egyptian Arab h d Bank, Industrial Development Bank of Egypt, and Principal Bank for
DevelopmentandAgricultural Credit. To that end:

    N  The CBE's Banking Reform Unit (BRU) had prepared a` restructuring plan to
       implement a complete structural and financial zeform of the state owned banks to
       create strongand efficient banks that are able to sustain future domestic growth. The
       plan, which ends by 2008 end, was presented to stateowned banks' senior
    .  managementinJanuary 2005 and is beingmonitoredon an ongoingbasis by BRU.

       In consultation with the World Bank, BRU has developeda derailed comprehensive
       firme for the institutional and operational restructuring of crucial areas in National
       Bank of Egypt @RE) & Banque Misr (BM). Consequently, in October 2005,
       in&ernational consultants, funded by the EU(ABNAmro for BMand MG Bearingsfor
       NBE), havestartedworkingon conductinga diagnostic reviewQ implementationplan
       over a period of three years for the two banks covering3 backbone areas namely HR,
       Risk Management, IT& M1S;and the projectis currentlyat the implementationphase.
       Accordingly, these two banks are currently going through a process aimed at
       redefining their strategy, addressing the problem of non-performing portfolio,
       upgrading management information and IT systems, and strengthening their risk
       management system. The restructuring of the two state owned banks will be
    .  substantiallyadvanced byDecember2008.

       Establisheda specialized hnd in November 2005 for the reform and upgradingofthe
       state owned banks to fund the hiringof qualified management staff and experts. The
       fund has supported numerousnew hires inNationalBankof Egypt& Banque Misr.

       In that respect, the authoritiesare filly committedto ensuring that state owned banks
       operate on a level playing field with priv-    sector counteqiarts. State owned banks
       should not bc subject to privileges and at the same time should not be exposed to

       directed lending, especially to non-viable public enterprises. We have improvedthe
       framework for corporate debt workouts, and have clarified the prudentialtreatment of
       restructured debt. This in our view has restoredmarket confidenceand ensured non-
       reoccumnceofthese problemsinthe future.

The financial situation of the specialized banks remains diflcult. An overalf restructuring
programwill takeplace, focusingaswell on institutional,operational, and financial. aspects.
   .   Although the financial positions of several specialized banks remain weak; the
       government will ensure that any new public capital contributions needed to restore
       conformity with prudentialratios is done in conjunctionwith this overall restructuring
       program*

Inorder to complement improvedfinancialdisclosure, the rolesand functionsofthe Boardsof
Directorscontinues to be strengthened.

       pi) Fipzrrnciuirestruclluring
   8   The government, in pursuingthe financial rcstructuring*ofthe state-owned M k s , has
       commissioned special in-depth audits accordingto IFRS to assess the bank's portfolio
       quality accordingto terms of referencedevelop4 by CBE's BRUin consultationwith
       the World Bank, and carried out by renowned internationalauditing firms. Rank of
       Alexandria's audit has been finalizedinFebruary2006prior to itsprivatization. As for
       the remaining three commercial stateswned banks (National Bank o f Egypt, Bank
       Misr, gi Banque du Cake) a full FinancialDue Diligenceby internationalaudit firms
       accordingto IFRS was completed in 2006. The main focus was on assessing internal
       control, asset quality and identificationof the provisioninggap. Only on the basis of
       suchduediligencecan a reliabteenvelop for bank restructuringcosts beestimated.

   Addressing the problem of non-pelgroming loans of public enterprises was an essential
cornerstone in the restructuringprocess.The mechanismto deal with public enterprises' non-
performing loans to the state-owned banks was a matter of priority for the authoritiesand is
beingfinalized, while the programofcorporate restructuringofthese state-ownedenterprises,
and their access to Finance is of substantial importance and is being separately addressed by
the Ministry of Investment, IRthat respect, a number of important steps taken recently
demonstratethe government's commitmentto addressingthe issue, inparticular:

      The totat outstandingdebt of public enterprise amountingto ECP 6.9 Bln to Bank of
      Alexandriawas scttlcd incash in February2006.

   8  The authorities are fully committed to a time-bound, clear and transparent process for
      resolving the non-performing loans of public enterprises in the National Bank of
      Egypt, Banque Misr and Banque du Cake, and for which specific sources have been
      emmarked (in line with the Bank of Alexandria schcmc). To this effcct, a cash

                                             - x -

        settlement was effected in December 2006 amounting to EGP 9,l Billion as a partial
        settlement of Non-Performing Public Enterprises' debt in National Bank of Egypt,
        Banque Misr, & Banque du Caire. The remainingbalance which amounts to around
        EGP 10 Bln will be settled from the privatization procecds bcforc year end 2008.
        Accordingly, the non-performingloans of public enterprisesto state owned banks will
        be fully resolved within the 2005-2008 time frame of the "Financial Sector Reform
    -   Program" of September2004.

        Initial steps have been taken b change the logal and regulatory framework for
        corporate restructuring, including the treatment of restructured debt, classification
        criteria, and tax treatments,

        E.AddressingNoh-PerformingLoansinthe BankingSector
        In order to tacklethis issuea non-performingloans (NPL) managementunit under the
umbrella of the BRU within the CBE       WEIS established with the responsibilityof setting an
overall strategy for dealing with NPLs. To thatend;
         The unitcreatedan WL databaseto monitormovery efforts onmonthlybasis..
      0  Managethe stateownedEnterprisesNPLssettlements to state owned tianks.
          Introduced a conciliation and arbitration mechanism in the market to expedite NPL
         settlements.
         In March 2007 CBE has announced a four months amnesty program ended in June
         2007 for smallbusinessnon-performingloansthat are lessthan EGPlMM inNational
         Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque due Caire, & IndustrialDevelopmentBank of
         Egypt; whereby, debts amountingupto EGP500 M, & fiom morethanECP 500Mup
         to EGP I MM will only pay 25% & 30% respectively. The program contributed in
         solvingaround7600cases within the criteria ofthe program.

       In addition, the financial restructuring and recapitalization of state-owned banks in
      which the state has not declared its intention to divest its shareholding would be
      conditionaluponacredible institutionaland operational strengtheningplanwhich would
      provide a safeguard that, in increasingly open and competitive markets, the restructured
      institution, within an adequate governance and incentive structure, would be able to
      operate on a commerciallysound basis.

        Interms ofsafeguarding, and to ensureno reoccumnct:of the problemofNPLs, loans
to defaultingand non-viablestate owned enterpriseshave beenstopped since 2001 be it in the
form of term loans or ovcrdrafi facilities. Loans of public sector enterprises on stak-owned
bank books, which has been reduced a5 previously mentioned in the "Fhancial
restructuring" section of this letter, are a stock of aged loans rather than an issue of flows.
Moreover, the Ministry of Investment is leading, along a diligent timetable, the program of
"assets management'' o f state-owned cnterprises including privatization and corporate
restructuringwhich covers in particular the issue of distressed SO&financing. We would like
to confirm that the measures taken by the Government of Egypt [GOE) to deaf with NPL`s is
                                           -

under effective implementation as outlined in the GOE's financial sector reform program and
consistent with the main piliars and benchmarks outlined in the MOU between The
Governments of Egyptand The United States. Futurerelationships of state-owned bankswith
state-owned enterprises, especially those liable for the large NPLs, will bc closely monitored
and scrutinized to ensure that lending transactions are conducted on an ann's length basis
along exacting credit standards applicable equally to ail prospective private or public
borrowers.

        F.DevelopingMortgageFinance
        The Ministry of Investment is keen on developing a new system of mortgage finance
for a more sustainable housing finance market. We seek to crate a more active, competitive
and sustainable mortgage market with Egypt making strides in recent years towards the
development and `emergence of a new system of mortgage finance. To this end, mortgagc
market reforms undertaken recently aimed at strengthening the market legal and institutional
framework. This is reflected in the capacity building of the MFA through bringing in new
leadership in August 2005, developing the technicai and managerial skills, cstablishing in
December 2005 new departments (consumer affairs, research, and industry monitoring);
establishing a computer networkand the IT infrastructure in January 2006; and formulatinga
business plan for the period (2005-2008). The authorities we also developing the MFA
regulataty role to ensure market eficiency and protect its customers, in terms of developing
and ensuring the usage of standardized mortgage agreements in January 2006; setting new
regulations for portfalio acquisition from the developers, issuing new regulations governing
providing mortgage finance to foreigners, and establishing regulations and controls for the
GSF cash subsidy to ensure it is properlyallocatedto low-incomecitizens in December 2005;
anddeveloping acode ofethics for appraisersinFebruary2006

        The government is committed to improving housing affordability, and reducing
lending and funding risks for fenders and investors in mortgage securities, (inter-alia in
establishing an umbrella insurance among several insurance companies to provide better
comprehensive market coverage to borrowers). The government is keen on establishing a
transparent system to protect property rights in streamtining real estate registration. On that
front, the government has launchedthe NationalProject for title registrationin2005, property
registrationfees have hen reduccd to a flat fee oFa maximum EGP 2000 in August 2006, in
additionto the facilitation of foreclosure procedures. Mortgage finance agreements have also
been exempted fFom the proportional stamp duty in February 2006, and the government is
committed to building an information system on real estate and mortgage finance in
cooperation with Ministry of Housing, Thwe is also development interms of securitizingthe
portfolio of performing housing loans to create liquidity that would help finance additional
housingunits.

        The Government is committed to establishing a fiquidity facility to support the
development of a secondary market io providetong-term finance for mortgagecompanies and
banks. On that front various developments have taken place, including: (i>     forming a task

                                           - xii -

 force responsible for establishment of the liquidity facility in December 2005; and (ii)
 finalizing the company's charter inDecember 2005, as well as the businessand financial plm,
and investmentmemo in February2006. The company was legally establishedas ajoint stock
Egyptian company with 24 shareholders in June 2006. its board and senior managcment has
been appointed. Its credit guidelines have been approved. ALM policy, Human Resources
Manual,OperationsManualFinancialManagementPolicyall havebeendrafted. TheEgyptian
Mortgage Refinance Company (EMRC) is currently working on concluding its first two
refinancingloans ofEEP 170million bythe end of2007.

        G,RestructuringandDevelopingNon-Bank FinancialInstitutions
         As mentioned before, in the second stage of the reform we have made substantial
progress inimplementingthe agenda for developingnon-bankfinancial institutions, especially
the agenda'forthe insurance sector. Allow us to explainour progress inmoredetail.

         (i) The insuranceseciur is undergoinga comprehensivereformprogramthat includes
institutionaland regulzEtorymeasures and that will change radicallythe structureof the sector.
The restructuring of the state-owned insurance companies is very advanced, with the recent
merger of three state-owncd insurance companies (Misr Tn'surance Company, AI Chark
Insurance Company and &EgyptReinsurance Company).             This will produce a healthier
industrial structure, add value to the state owned insurers, and prepare the ground for
privatization. The fourth company - the Nationaj Insurance Company of Egypt (NICE) will
remain state-owned but substantially rduced in size. We expect this reform to leadto a much
momcompetitive, dynamic, and innovativeinsurancesector.

         In order to ensure the sound growth of a restructured insurance sectar, we are also
implementing several critical improvements to the legal and regulatory framework. The
government revisedlower the stamp duties o f insuranceproductsto halfof its level, aimingto
increaseinsurancespendingper capita. Moreover, the new law on MotorThird PartyLiability
(MPTL) insurance and its executiveregulationshave been issuedand are beingimplemented
together with new prices since August 2007, Also importantly, we have submitted to the
Prime Minister and the Economic Committee of the Parliament critical amendments to the
lnsurance Law (Law lo), including increases in minimum capital, the corporatization of
insurancebrokers, and the separationof life and non-lifebusiness,

         The supervisory framework for the insurancesector is also beingstrengthened through
amendments to the insurance law that provide independent funding for the insurance
supervisor (EISA) and that provide EISA's Board with the same human resource powers as
the CBE Board. Finally, the build up of EISA's supervisory capacity is proceeding with
assistancefrom USAID.

         (io PrivatePemh Funds
         The Government's agenda in the pension area includes measures to address the
actuarial imbsianeas and operational ineficiencies of the existing defined benefit pension
                           -

                                             12

                                             - Xlll... -

schemes, and a moreambitiousagendato change the structure ofthe sector. We have starzed
addressing the chronic deficiency of pension actuaries through the completion o f a plan
creating a special class of pensionactuaries and intend to certify ut least 3 actuaries during
2008. We have also designed a programto ensure the full actuarialassessment of all pension
schemesand will assessa large number ofpensionfunds representingat least halfofthe assets
ofthe sector in the coning 12months, This would enable us to address the problemof under-
funding oftheseplans. This processwould be overseen by a more effectivesupervisionofthe
sector, enabledby the recent creationofanew division for privatepensionfunds within EISA.

        With the support of the World Bank, we have also drafted legislation that would
change the structure of the private pension system, by creating new voluntary collective
pension funds managed by professionalpensioncompanies, and operatingunder an effective
tax'regime. However, since this draR legislationmay be introducedinthe context ofa broader
pension reform, and this reform requires more preparation, we muy postpone submission of
the draft lawto Cabinetto 2009.

        (iii)Tnvesrrm?.ntFunds
     '  We are aware that the lack of developmento f the investment fund industry is at least
partly due to regulatory flaws and have started addressing these flaws. We have issued a
decree and other regulation that clariq the legal structure of investment Funds and the roles
and obligations af sponsors and related parties. The new regulations also Improve the
computation of net asset values, strengthen disclosure requirements, and reduce the ratio of
paid up capital from 5% to 2% of assets under management. We m prepared to reduce
further this ratio, in line with internationalstandards, ifthat proves to sfow the hture growth
ofthe industry. Finally, we have also established the regime for exchange-traded hnds in the
stock exchange.

        H.DevelopingtheCapitalMarket
        We are encouraged by our recent progress in developingthe capital market, especially
the equity market, and maintainour vision to positionEgyptas the financial hub for the region
in the long-term. To achieve this goal, the government is committed to developingfurther the
capital market and will use all available technical and financial assistance to support these
efforts, We are aware that we will need to make krther progress in several areas to achieve
this goal: (i)build an institutional investor base; (ii)improve the structure and regulatory
framework for securities markets; (iii) strengthen the soundness and efficiency of
intermediaries; (iv) enhance the institutionaf capacityofthe CapitalMarketsAuthority (CMA)
andthe Cairoand Alexandria Stock Exchange(CASE).

        We are aware that a solid domestic institutional investor base is an essential
component of a well-functioning capital market, and have started implementing specific
agendas for the insurance, pension, and investment fund sectors, as notedabove. The growth
of these sectors will imply a stronger and more stable demand for financial instruments,
includinglongduration instruments, facilitatingaccess to finance and better risk management.
                     --

                                                13

It will also strengthen the quality o f asset management and contribute to more efificient
regulationand improvedoutcomes overall.

         In the regulatoryarea, we have taken m important step by introducingIFRS standards
for all listed firms and securitiescompanies, and plan to introduce internal auditing standards
in the corning months as well. Moreover, the CMA issued a decree on August 2006 that
establishes a list of auditors of fisted companies, securities firms, and investment funds. Only
listed auditors are entitled to audit the accounts of these companies and mutual funds. This is
expected to improvethe qualityof Financialinformationand fostermarketdiscipline.

        The structureand operationat procedures at CASE are being improved through several
measures. The CMA ha3 introducedonline trading, which provides a more time saving and
accurate trading outlet, and has also authorized short selling. CASE*smarket-making rules
a x now effective. A new SME exchange has been introducedd.We have also completed draft
amendments to the capital market law that wilt simpHfLthe four different listing schedules at
CASE, and wiIr submit thest?draftamendmentsto ParEiamentin2008.

        To promote the soundness of intermediriries, the government has issued amendments
to the Executive Regulations of the CMI, that enhances capital adequacy standards and risk
management requirements for financial intermediaries. This will allow intermediaries to
address moreeffixtively their risks, includingmarket, settlement, liquidation,andcreditrisks.

        Finally the supervisory framework is being strengthened further. The CMA has been
implementingits own institutionaldevelopment plan. In April 2006 the CMA approved the
new CASE membership rules that were prepared in accordance with international best
practices, and the governmentwill issuea policy statement that wit1clarify the legalstatus and
governance of CASE. During 2008 and 2009 CASE will implement fully its restructuring
plan, addressing gavernance,market structure,and self-regulatoryfunctions.

        I,StrengtheningtheLegalandRegulatoryFrameworkoftheFinancialSECTOR
        The Government of Egypt is committed to strengthening the legal, regulatory, and
supervisory framework of the financial sector as a whole. Establishing strong and credible
regulatory and supervisory frameworks are essential to ensure the success of the financial
reformprogram. Tothat end, the governmenthas already:

    =   Fssued a new centrat bank and banking law, and its executive regulations, which were
       approved by Parliament. The application of this new legal framework provides
       autonomyto the Central Bank inconductingmonetarypolicy and bankingsupervision.

       Enhanced the powers of supervisors to intervene in and resolve troubled financial
       institutions. We have adopted a risk based supervisory approach for all commercial
       banks and have mquestedcommercialbanks, which have not met the capital adequacy
       standards  8s ofend-2003, to providerecapitalizationplans.

         Adopted a series of legislative and regulatory texts applicable to the insurance and
         capital markets sectors. Implementing regulations to this mended regulatory
         framework are being finalized. In addition, new management was introduced at all
         ~ u p e ~ i sandr yregulatory bodies, includingthe MFA, EISA, CMA, andthe Cairoand

        upgrade of CBE's banking supervision capabilities according to international best
        practice,

        J. EnhancingtheFitlanciat Sector's Infrastructure,Transparency,andIntegrity

     I  Since June 2005, the Government has made further efforts to improve the
infiasttnt~ureof the financial sector, including measures to enhance the eficiency of the
payments system, develop further the credit information system, improve the quaiity of
corporate accounting and financial information, and improve auditing standards. Moreover,
efforts to fight againstmoney launderinghave been stepped up.

        Payments system: Emphasis is placedon upgradingand modernizingthe institutional
        fmework of the payments system at the Central Bank, including providingthe CBE
        with morehuman resouws, improvingcIient services, and makingfurther progress in
        introducing a reabtirne gross settlement system (RTGS). The business plan for the
        RTGS system complying with international standards and best practices is being
        developedBS well as the regulationsofthe AutomaticClearingHouse(ACH) to reduce
        total processingtime of checks and introduceconcepts of finality and irrevacabitityin
        ACW processing, The RTGS system will becomeoperationalduring 2008.

    8   Credit ittfomation gwtem: In order to enhance access to financial services, the CBE
        has been working on strengthening the existingcredit information department at the
        CBE since early 2004. This has been coupled with necessary regulatory, legal and
        institutional changes, including amendingthe secrecy laws in lune 2005 to allow for
        the establishmentof private credit bureaus, and the shan'ng of credit informationwith
        non-bank financial institutions, The legal establishment o f the new private credit

           Money launderingand thefinancing of terrorism: An Anti-Money Laundering Law
           hadken adopted, with independentenforcement mechanisms, which broughtEgypt in
           tine with FATF and United Nations standards. Egypt having fulfilled all legal and
           institutional requirements in accordance with the FATF recammendations and
           measures was removed in earIy 2004 from the list of non-cooperatingcountries and
           territories.

           K. RatructuringandPrivatizationofPublicEnterprises
           The Government i s committed to continuing the restructuring and privatization
  programof public enterprises. This has been evident in the recent high pace of divestiture as
  reflected in the sales proceeds that have amounted to LE 14.6 biilion in fiscal year 2005/06,
  compared to a volume that read LE5.6 billion inthe precedingyear. This is in additionto the
  fact that the commitment to the financia1restructuring, partialsettlementofNPL's, inaddition

  profit for the SOE's reachingLE 1.7 billion in the fiscal year 2004/05 compared to LE 604
  million in fiscal year 2005/06.


  V.       COLLABORATTON OTHER DONORS
                                  WFTW

           There ha9 been good collaboration between the Government of Egypt and various
  donors involved in the development of the financial sector in Egypt. Various dements in the
  reform program were based on the recommendations put forward by the 2002 and 2007
  FSAPsandthe IMF Article IV process. The African DevelopmentBank (AfDB)has extended
  a US$ 500 million Financial Sector Development Policy Loan in parallel financing to the
  World Bank DBL Iloan. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) had also expressed
  interest in further involvement in the financial sector, as opportunities may arise far private
  transactions.

the two largest public commercial banks, focusingon three main areas, human resowrces, IT,
and risk management, The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal ReserveBank have
been providing technical support to bank supervision. It is expcted that this cooperation wilt
continue. This would lead to improvements in the corparate governance of these banks,
preventingthe reoccurrenceof previous problemsthat led to poor asset quality,



        The Government is keen on ensuringgood coordination betweenthe various partners,
and inthat context has requestedthe World Bank to play a lead role with the various donors to
ensure that the various donors' initiatives related to financial sector reform are well
coordinatedto avoid overlap and address key issueson a timely and priority basis. To this end,
a Financial Sector Donors Subgroup, chaired by the World Bank, has been formed to
coordinateboth technicaland financial support providedto the government.




VI.     CO-ORDINATIONWITH THE WORLD BANK

        To ensure high-level oversight ofthe financial sector reform program, an effective
Ministerial and an inter-agencyCommittee is responsiblefor planning, developing strategies,
and monitoring their implementation. The success of the implementation of the financial
sector reform program will also require close coordination between various donor agencies
involved, with clearly defined mandates. The World Bank ha5 been requested by the
Governmentof Egypt to take a leadingrole in the coordination efforts. Over the last two years
we have worked closely with the Wotjd Bank in the implementation o f our "Financial Sector
Reform Program" providing the Bank with updates on the progress of the program and
drawing on its resources to provide technical expertise required as needed. Consistent with
normal fiscal accountingconventions,the proceeds and use o f World Bank loans will be fully
accounted for in the budgetas part ofthe consolidatedcentralgovernmentbudget.

         We would like to express our appreciation to the World Bank for its invaluable
  assistance with the implementation of this comprehensiveprogram.



  Sincerelyyours,

     ANNEX3: FRAMEWORK           FORINSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATIONALRESTRUCTURING                          OF
                                          STATE-OWNED       BANKS


 I. Introduction

 1.      The reforms initiatedover the past few years - in particularthe enactment of the new "Central Bank,
 Banking System and Money Law", the floating of the Egyptiancurrency, the liberalization of interest rates,
 and the strengthening of monetary policy framework - set the stage for the development of a more efficient
 bankingsystem.

 2.      Under the comprehensive "Financial Reform Program" recently approved by the Egyptian
 government - which addresses, inter-alia, the problems of state-owned banks - the CBE is managing the
 banking reformprogram on behalfof the government (owner of the public banks) andto this effect is acting
throughthe "Banking ReformUnit" establishedat the Centralbank.Inthis context, the owner has directedthe
board of directors, and the chairman of the board, to develop and implement an institutionaland operational
 strengtheningprogramfor each state-ownedcommercialbanks(henceforth the Bank) incoordination with the
Banking Reform Unit. Any potential financial restructuring of the Bank will be made conditional on a
convincing and detailed institutional and operationalstrengthening plan which would provide comfort to
the Egyptianauthorities- owner and regulator- and the market that the restructuredinstitutionwould be
able subsequently to operate and grow on a commercially sustained basis in increasingly open and
competitivemarkets.

3.       There are now two state-ownedcommercialbanks, the NationalBank of Egypt (NBE) and the Bank
Misr-Banquedu Caire that was been merged under a single management team with both retainingseparate
operations; the Banque du Caire is under consideration for privatization, which would leave NBE and Bank
Misras the remainingstate-ownedbanks.Themaincreditfocus ofNBEandBankMisr hasbeenlendingover
short-term periods to Egyptian companies and households, and both have a solid base of retail deposits
through its branch network. The development of the plans has involved a thorough assessment o f (i)the
Bank's current status and business data (size, markets, geographical scope, products and services,
organization, and financial statements); (ii)current strategy; (iii)progress to date in the Bank's institutional
development; and (iv) current andplanneddevelopment actions.

4.       The development of the programis beingcarried out by dedicated staff- includingexternal expertise
involving, as required, a specialized firm or banking institution with sub-contract arrangements as the need
may be - with appropriate professional qualifications and experience (numbers, skills) in assignments
concerning bankinginstitutions of comparable nature, size, and complexity. The program of operational and
institutionalstrengtheningis conducted and coordinatedby the Bank's managementworking closely with the
Board in coordinationwith the Banking Reform Unit acting on the owner's behalf. The following sections
outline an all exhaustive suggested framework which would be tailored to the specific situation, needs and
prioritiesof each bank.

11.      GeneralScope of the Program

5.       This note defines the overall framework of the programof operational and institutionalstrengthening
which will enablethe Bank to function successfully as amodern, competitivecommercialbank. Dueaccount
is beingtaken ofthe effectivenessandreliability of the Bank'saccounting, financial,administrative and control
proceduresandtheir upgrading. The boardandmanagementof the Bank has already launchedthe operational
strengthening program- under mandate from the owner and guidance from the BankingReformUnit which
has providedBank's management with specific guidelines to this effect. The BankingReformUnit had also
commissioneda comprehensive independentfull financial due diligence and diagnostic study finalized in
2006, to assess the Bank's performance, outline the main areas of institutional weaknesses and present
recommendationsto addressthe weaknesses detected.

                                                     - xxiv -

 6.       More specifically, the objective of the program is to support the Bank's board of directors and
managementteam efforts in developing a detailed, credible business strategy and plan, and to recommend,
 inter-alia, steps that should be taken to streamline operations, optimize the branch and distribution
network, and strengthenorganizational,operationaland management structures. The plan proposed under
the program should include a candid and detailed assessment of needed professional skills in critical
business areas (front, middle and back office), as well as staffing and stafftraining. The (revised) strategy
of the Bank would need to be strictly defined under its proposed business plan to preclude lax lending
policies and ensure a level playing field for all banks with private as well as public ownership. The
proposedscope of work under the programshould cover - as detailed in the following sections-the specific
areas of: (i)strategic and business planning; (ii)organization structure; (iii)budgeting and performance
measurement; (iv) managementinformationsystemand managementaccounts; (v) operations; (vi) automation
and technology support; (vii) internal audit; (viii) credit analysis and portfolio management; (ix) asset and
liability management; (x) market development and marketing; and (xi) human resource management and
training.

          A. Strategicand BusinessPlanning

7.        While the Bank has developed a planningprocess, it also needs to strengthenits formalizedstrategic
planning capability. Given the need to build and develop the Bank in a changing economic and market
environment, the completion of a comprehensivestrategic planis apriorityas it is the necessaryfoundationfor
building a programof institutionalchange. The Bank's mandate from the owner would providethe basis for
formulatingthe strategy. The strategic planneeds, moreover, to be extendedinto a series of business plans for
various functions and organizational levels. The strategic plan must clearly define the Bank's mission and
objectives, target markets, products and services, financial goals, resource requirements and action plans for
executing its strategy andachieving its goalsandobjectives:

8.        One of the program's outcomeswill be to support the boardof directorsandmanagementdesignand
implement a formalized strategic planning process for the Bank as a whole and the individualbusiness and
staffunits. That processmust establish how the task of planningis organized, conductedand monitoredonan
on-going basis. The role of various departments (including, if necessary a specialist strategic planning unit
within the Bank) in the planningexercise must be established and the steps in the process with appropriate
deadlinesfor completionoftasks must be outlinedand agreedwith the Bank'smanagement.

9.        The preparation of the strategic plan will be based inter-alia on the analysis of the external
environment, the competition, current and potential markets, and the Bank's current market position. To this
end, there would be a need to conduct relevant internal analyses to identify the Bank's strengths and
weaknesses in relation to the market, the competition and future business opportunities. These internal
analyses should includeprofitability analyses of existingbusinessessuch as corporate and consumer lending.
It is expected under the program, that the Bank's board of directors and senior management would then
address and define the Bank's mission and strategy, and prepare business and action plans to execute that
strategy. This corporatestrategy will then be extended into a series ofplans, each coveringa major businessof
the Bank - defining specific goals, target markets, products and services, resource requirements, and actions
programs as needed to provide practical guidance to each business unit and tools for monitoring and
evaluating performance.

10.       In the frame of the program, it would be expected to train Bank staff in strategic and business
planning in the course of the work, so that the Bank has the ability to continue the planning process in the
future. Any identifiedgaps incritical skills within the Bank shouldbe reportedto management.

         B. OrganizationStructure

11.      The Bank will assess the existing organization shcture and its adequacy for its new role and the
requirements of the strategy and businessplan. Thus, once the strategy and business plan are developed, the
Bank must reviewits organizational setting so that it may executeits strategy successfully. Inthis regard, the

                                                   - xxv -

Bank's Boardand managementwill work together to develop and documentthe organization structure of the
head-office, regional offices (as the case may be), and their specific relationships to the branch offices and
other distribution platforms (e.g. E-banking). This would entail a definition of each organizational unit
(including permanent committees), its mission, main responsibilities, key functions to carry out each
responsibility,andrequiredstaffinglevels.

 12.      To build the new organization structure, the Bank's board and management will define the specific
requirements and will be expected to prepare a plan for implementing the new organization indicating
implementationactions andresponsibilities, scheduleandsupport requirements.

          C. BudgetingandPerformanceMeasurement

 13.      There will be a needto assess the Bank's existingcapital planning(interms ofregulatorycapital) and
budgeting systems, and identify any needed improvements. The objective will be to ensure that the capital
planningandbudgeting systems are sufficientlycomprehensiveto meet hlly the needs ofthe Bank, including
as a basis for providing incentives for, and controlling, management and staff performance throughout the
institution. Should the need to upgrade the capital planningand budgeting systems be confirmed, the Bank
would needa revised system which should be formally linkedto the strategic planningprocessto ensure that
the annual financialplanfor the Banktruly representsandreflectsthe strategic objectives.

 14.      The system, which should be comprehensive and formalized, should ensure that individualbranches
and units within the Bank prepare budgets for all income and expenditure items over which they have
responsibility. The process should ensure in particular that: (i)annual budgets for the Bank and its
departments and branches are linked to the strategic planningprocess and objectives; (ii)budget targets are
agreed to between head-office and individual department and branch managers to ensure challenging but
realistic targets and secure good motivation and performance from managers; (iii)detailed and relevant
variance analyses take place on a regular basis and all significant variances from the Bank's targets and
objectives are highlighted and explained as necessary and corrective actions are initiated; and (iv) the
managementaccounts for the Bank and its constituent parts are designedto report actual performanceagainst
budgetsandstrategictargets.

15.       Inadditionto variance analysis, the Bank will ensurethat it has a comprehensivesystemofmeasuring
performance against targets through the use of a well defined set of management accounts and reports and
through a systemof individualperformance management. The Bank will train a core staff inthe utilizationof
the new systems andprocesses that maybe developed.

          D. ManagementInformationSystemandManagementAccounts

16.      There will be aneedto define the informationrequiredto manage the Bank, measure its performance
and control its risks. On completion of the Bank's strategic plan, a detailed plan of the management
informationrequiredto execute the strategy will needto be completed, includingmanagementreports at each
managerial level. This will cover the accounting system needed to provide management with financial
informationfor each of the operational units and product lines, as well as for the Bank as a whole. The new
managementinformationrequirementsmustbe integratedintothe automationstrategy ofthe Bank.

17.      In assessing the adequacy of the existing management information system and recommending
adjustments as needed, the Bank will ensure that the management informationplan would cover all the key
areas of Bank operations and management, including: (i)credit and portfolio status; (ii)treasury including
liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange risks, funding, asset and liability management, and deposits
management; (iii)operations (front, middle and back-office), head-office and branches; and (iv) strategy,
budgeting and performance measurement including the design and implementation of an appropriate
managementaccounting system.

18.      To this effect, measures will be needed to ensure that a comprehensive accounting system for the
Bank will give management financial information on each of the operational units and for the Bank as a

                                                  - xxvi -

whole. The accounting system should include informationon a profit and cost-center basis with appropriate
transfer pricingfor inter-unittransactions. The managementaccounts shouldalsobe designedto give revenue,
cost andprofitability informationby product, customer, branchandbusinessline.

19.       The Bank's management will ensure that the new management informationrequirements, including
the managementaccounts, are integrated into the automation strategy and technology support framework of
the Bank. The Bank will also need to train a core staff inthe utilizationofthe new systems and processesthat
may be developed.

          E. Operations

20.       Inlight ofthe strategicplan-whichwould haveaddressedthe systems requirementsfor new business
units- the adequacy ofthe Bank's operating systems and procedureswill be assessed, together with the need
for their strengtheningto ensure their effectiveness. There will be a need to ensure that any strengthened or
revampedsystems would take into accountthe Bank's plannedbusinesses, methods of operations, service and
controlrequirementsandthe automationstrategy.

21.       New operations systems and procedureswould needto cover bothhead-office and branchoperations
and other productherviceproductionand distributionnetworkshystems. Indeed, with intensifiedcompetition
for products and services, and pressure on margins, it would be necessary to strengthen operations at the
branch level. To this effect, there may be a need to develop and implement a "model" branch, and test its
practicality.(There might be a need also to contemplate non-branch productionand distribution).The Bank
would then planthe model implementationinthe rest ofthe branchsystem includingallowance for necessary
variations to account for differences in branches in such aspects as size, level of automation, and product,
service, or customer mix. The development of the model branch would include the: definition of the mission
and role of the branch (integrated with the strategic plan and the overall organizational plan); design of
operational processes, procedures and workflows; design of the organizational structure; and design of the
branch operational infrastructure. The Bank will also train the relevant team in the skills necessary to assure
effective planimplementation.

          F. Automation andTechnologySupport

22.       There will be a need to assess whether the Bank's existing automation and technology support
infrastructure is adequate for the operations, management and control of an efficient commercial bank,
especially the core systemthat assists inthe administration of most ofthe central functions. To this effect, the
Bank's management(and external auditors as the case may be) will review the progressmade with regardto
automationandtechnology and ensurethat the Bank has a detailedautomationstrategy.Once the management
informationneeds havebeendefined, the efficiencyand effectivenessof the hardware architectureand system
engineering inthe Bank will be reviewedandevaluated(taking into account any contingency plans relatingto
business continuity risks). In so doing, due account will 'be taken of the need for congruence between the
Bank's strategy, business goals, and existing technology. The work would require more specifically:(i)an
assessment of the informationand processingrequirements, and a definition of a set of additional application
needs for the Bank; (ii)an analysis ofthe informationandprocessingeffectivenessofexistingsystems; (iii)an
estimate of the cost of additional hardware, software (especially for the basic banking functions related to
customer accounting, portfolio analysis and management, foreign exchange operations, etc.,.);(iv) an outline
of the management,organization, manpower andtrainingrequirementsneededto implementthe program; and
(v) an implementation schedule together with critical milestones. Due attention will be neededin integrating
any new initiative: internally, with regardto a compatible system of hardware, software and communications
from branchto head-office; and externally, with any new paymentssystemandinterBank arrangements.

         G. InternalAudit

23.      The Bank's internal audit function will be assessed as well as the need for strengtheningthe related
policies, proceduresandstandardsto deal with the Bank's prospectivestrategy and revisedbusinessmodel. In

                                                     - xxvii -

 line with the strategic plan and the implications of that plan - in terms of organization structure, financial
 instruments, operations, systems and procedures,and automation-there will be aneedto proposeadjustments
 as requiredto the internalaudit systemandprocesswith appropriatecorrespondingmanuals.

24.       There will be specifically a need to: (i)advice on improvements to audit methodologies, and
adequacyofaudit coverageinterms of scope (e.g. credit, operations, assets and liabilitiesmanagement), depth
andreportingstandards; (ii)suggest requiredfollow-upand monitoring;(iii)definethe audit organization; and
(iv) identify complementary audit skill requirements. The Bank auditing staff will need to be trained in the
utilizationof new methodologies. (This sub-component - which requires specialized skills         --would call for
 interactionwitldinvolvementofthe externalauditors.)

          H. CreditAnalysisandPortfolio Management

25.       Long standing problems of portfolio quality have taken a heavy toll on the Bank's operations and
financial position. A formalized and thorough management and operational structure delineating credit
policies,procedures and systems must be developedas a matter of priority. Specialemphasisshould be given
to portfoliocontrolandproblem loanmanagement. The revisedstructure shouldbringup-to-datemarket skills
and techniques to the process of credit management, especially in the context of the asset quality problems
facedby the Bank. The Bank's managementwill needto enhance creditmanagementpolicies,proceduresand
systems, regardingbothaspects of creditanalysisandportfoliomanagement,and problem loanmanagement.

26.     (a) Credit analysis and portfoliomanagement.There would be a needfor improvement inpolicies and
procedures regarding: (i)target market guidelines; (ii)portfolio limits; (iii)risk tolerance criteria; (iv) credit
approval authorities; (v) credit analysis, structuring and pricing; (vi) loan documentation, contracts and
security; (vii) loan disbursement procedures; (viii) loan follow-up and monitoring; (ix) credit recovery and
legal enforcement; (x) credit administrationand controls, including disbursement, amendment to terms and
other sanction authorities, credit audit and policy exceptions; (xi) organization of credit within the context of
the strategic plan; and (xii) automationofreportsneededto monitorassetquality.

27.     (b) Problem loan management. There would be a need to optimize policies, procedures and
organizational arrangements [including if warranted, special workout unit for certaintypes of problem assets)
relatedto: (i) problem loan definitionand identification;(ii)  problem loanreporting; (iii)problemloanfollow-
up; (iv) delinquent loan recovery; (v) viability analysis and loan restructuringoptions; (vi) repossessionand
legal recoveryactions; and (vii) provisions andinterestaccruals.

28.       There will be a needto train a core staff in the utilizationof each of the new processes that may be
developed.

          I.AssetandLiabilityManagement

29.       The needfor up-to-datetreasury and asset and liability management(ALM) policies and practices is
being accentuated by the on-going liberalizationof the financial markets. The skills, policies and systems
requiredto manage these risks must be strengthened in the Bank, so that comprehensive risk management
policies be developed or improved to govern interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and other non-credit
related risks. In this regard, consultants will be expected to advise on, and as needed, help implement the
processes,organization, and informationsystems requiredto managethe range ofALM risks currentlyfacing
the Bank and any additional risks inherent in the execution of the Bank strategic plan. The consultants will
assist in developing and documenting processes to cover, at a minimum, suchALM areas as liquidity, interest
rate and duration gap and pricing, and foreign exchange. Further, the consultants will advise on an
organization structure that will execute the proposed, upgraded ALM processes                 - defining specific
responsibilities, authorities, and functions of each unit, as well as requiredstaffingskills. Inaddition, it will be
necessary to define the information required to support the ALM processes (e.g., external and internal
information, formats and time-frames). The consultants will assist also as neededin the implementation and
the start-upofthe upgradedALM unit.

                                                   - xxviii -

30.      The consultantswill train key staff (treasury staff and management, and other senior managers who
will participate in, or contribute to, ALM decisions) in utilizing the ALM system and implement the practical
day-to-dayfunctions.

         J. MarketDevelopmentand Marketing

3 1.     There will be aneedto assessthe adequacyofthe Bank's formal marketingfunctionand strategy and
the degree to which these are aligned to its activities and to the requirements of the market. This would
include an assessment of staff marketingand sales experience. In this regard recommendations, as needed,
regardingadjustmentsto the marketingfunctionand strategy would needto be developedas part ofthe Bank's
strategic and business plan. Inthis context, a market analysis might be critical to the success of the strategic
planandvital for the proper executionofthe businessplan.

32.      Inconjunctionand congruentwith the strategicplan, the Bank's managementwouldneedto complete
a detailed marketing plan for the Bank and each of its business units covering, as the case may be, new
product introductions, service innovations and improvements. These plans should include: (i)a definition of
market objectives; (ii)an analysis of markettargets, products, and growthrates and shares; (iii)an analysis of
customer needs, and marketingimage of the Bank and its services; (iv) a marketing"strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities andthreats" analysis for the Bank; and (v) aplanof organization of marketingand sales at head-
officeandbranchlevels.

33.      In particular, t consultants, as needed, should advise the Bank's managementon how business units
should best be defined to meet the requirements of customers and the achievement of the Bank's strategic
goals. (For instance, the assessment could be made as to whether there is a need for relationshipor account
managers to handlemajor clients, the differentorganizational arrangementsrequiredfor retail, small corporate,
private sector clients or the possible requirement to set up specialist units for individualproduct areas.) The
Bank's non-marketing functions and operations should be examined also for impact on the Bank's marketing
goals. The resultsofthe analysisshouldbe consideredinthe Bank'soverallreviewof strategy and operations.

34.      The consultants will advise on skills needed for market analysis and planning, and help institute a
formalized market planningand development process within the framework of the Bank's strategic planning
process. The consultants will be expected also to help the management of the Bank define: (i)a training
program regarding the Bank's marketing strategy and methods of sales and customer service; and (ii)an
advertising andpublic relations program.

         K. HumanResourceManagementandTraining

35.      There will be a needto assess the Bank's human resourcemanagementpractices andtheir adequacy
for a commercialbank operatinginan increasingly competitive environment. Followingthe assessment of the
adequacyinterms of staff skills, recommendationsmay be neededto address identifieddeficiencies in light of
the Bank's revised business strategy and business focus and plans. To this end, a comprehensive training
needs analysis will be requiredand a formalized training (and as needed recruitment) plan, in line with the
requirements of the Bank's strategic plan, should be established. The analysis and plan should take into
accountthe requirementsundereachofthe Bank's functionalareas.

36.      The Bank's human resource management systems will have to be thoroughly assessed, and as need
be, upgradedto meet both current and future human resource requirements. There will be a needto address:
(i)firsttheBank'simmediateneedsforbuildingcriticalskillsandefficientlydeployingtheworkforcetostaff
itsnew organization, and supportthe execution of its strategy and businessplan; then (ii)  the Bank's medium-
term needsfor developingandmanagingits humanresources.

37.      The Bank will need to implement a first set of high-priority human resource management systems
consistingspecificallyof: (i)atrainingneeds analysis; (ii)a trainingand development masterplan, includinga
prioritization and planning of how all training needs will be met, and the launching of highest priority
programs; (iii)a performance appraisal system, includingthe assessment of the performance and potentialof

                                                   - xxix -

employees, and the identificationof major development needs; and (iv) a staffingprogram which entails the
effectivematchingofpeopletojobs inthe revisedorganizationstructure.

38.      The Bank's next order of priority is to build, implement and train staff in applying the human
resource management systems, related to: (i)manpower planning, covering supply and demand analysis,
projectionof manpower gaps and excesses (over 2 to 4 years) by major skill and rank level, and plans to fill
the gaps and deal with the excesses; (ii)recruitment, with pro-active methods for finding and selecting key
talents; (iii)rewards management, along a compensation scheme that will attract, retain and motivate
managers, technical personneland staff; (iv) managementdevelopment, with methods for developinggeneral
and technical managers; (v) performance management,through an effective system for managing individual
performance (e.g., goals, standards, monitoring, evaluation); and (vi) work culture development, under a

                                                   - xxxi -

5.       The full financial due diligence should be planned and conducted on the basis of a program
sufficiently expansive in coveringthe Bank's activitiesto enable the Auditor to sign the opinions and reports
required as per section I11 of these terms of reference. In devising the diagnostic review, the Auditor is
required to take into consideration the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank's accounting, records and
administrative procedures,as well as the financialand administrative internalcontrols and proceduresapplied
by the bank.

6.       Independenceand Impartiality.At the time of submissionof aproposalandwork planto carry outthe
full financialdue diligence and diagnostic study, the auditor must be independentof any member ofthe board
of directors, executive officer, or senior manager of the bank. Independenceimpliesthat the senior managing
partner, and any partner, or staffwho would be involvedinthe assignment, is not serving as a director of the
bank, nor has any personal, financial, or close business relationship except as an independent professional

areas

         A Accounting policiesand procedures
           -
7.       The Auditor should comment on the accounting principlesapplied by the Bank and its subsidiaries,
particularlyto: (i)confirm whether andto what extent EgyptianAccounting Standards and rules of preparing
the Banks' financial statementsissuedby CentralBank ofEgypthavebeenand are beingconsistentlyapplied;

         C Internal controlsystems
           -
9.       The systems of internal controls and checks, including internal auditing, should be assessed and
reviewed and evaluated in order to determine the degree of reliance that can be placed upon them, and the
extent of testing and verification that needs to be performed by the Auditor. Regardless of whether the
Auditor intendsto rely or not onthe existinginternalcontrolsystems, the Auditor will reportthoseweaknesses
detected that according to the volume and complexity of transactions and their risk profile, have to be
corrected in order to ensure prudent detection, measurement, management and control of operational, credit

                                                    - xxxii -

          D Assetqualityreview
             -
 11.      The Auditor will assess the quality of assets and the implied risk profile of the Bank and provide a
specific opinioncommentingon the reliability ofthe statedvalues ofthe Bank's assets.This assessment should
include not only loans and facilitiesbut also all other extensionsofcredit (on and off-balance sheet items), the
bank's financial assets including investments portfolio and other assets including other accounts receivable
and inventory items. The analysis of the credit exposure should be related to corporate whether public or
private sector, medium enterprises, and agricultural and livestock loans (retail activities including
individuals).Inmakingthe assessment, the Auditor shouldconsider specifically, the following:

 12.      (a) - Classificationofassets heldby the Bank.The Auditor will ensure that the classification of assets
is basedon qualitative criteriaandagreeddefinitions, andthat adequate consideration has beengivento: (i)     the
level, distribution, and severity of classified assets; (ii)the level and composition of non-accruing, non-
performing, andreducedrate assets; and(iii)undueconcentrationsof credit. Assets shouldthus becategorized
as performing or non-performing, and risk-classifiedirrespective of whether they are overdue for payment.
Problemassets (defined as loans with principalor interest past due for 90 or more days) should be placed in
risk classifications according to specific criteria for "substandard", "doubtful", and "loss" categories as
describedinObligorrisk ratingcircular issuedby the CentralBank ofEgypt. Also performingloans shouldbe
classified in accordance to the mentioned circular. (Attached in annex I).   Assets should be categorized into
corporate whether public or private sector, medium enterprises, and agricultural and livestock loans (retail
activities including individuals). Additionally, all credit to an individual borrower (or to a related group of
                                   ,
borrowers) should be placed in the same risk classification; different classifications should be specifically
noted andjustified. Impairment losses shouldbe clearly identified,distinguishingtheir impact uponprovision
andthe income statement.

 13.      (b) Selection of loans and other assets for review. In assessing the quality of assets, the Auditor
              -
should assure not less than 75% coverage ofthe portfolio of loans, advances, and all other similar credit risks,
includingguarantees, open letters ofcredit, and similar off-balance sheet credit risk items. The review will be
divided into categorized loans (corporate whether public or private sector, medium enterprises, and
agricultural and livestock loans (retail activities including individuals). Each loan should be first assessed
conventionally (documentation, payment performance, collateral, current profitability ofthe borrowingentity,
and any special known problems). Typically, the Auditor will examine and appraise all loans, advances and
guarantees to a single obligor or related group of obligors which exceeda cutoff amount equal to one-half of
one percent of paid-up capital and retained earnings. Past due loans and advances, renegotiatedloans and
advances, internally identifiedproblem loans and advances, loans and advances to insiders, and their related
interest, investments, equity participations, inter-bank loans and money market claims, foreclosed or
repossessed properties, contingent liabilities and guarantees, and other assets should also be reviewed. In
addition, a sample of loans and advances below the cutoff amount, not otherwise selected for review, should
be reviewedandthe results ofthat appraisal extrapolatedto the loanportfolio not otherwiseexamined.

14.      (c) -  Methodologyand Criteria for asset quality review. In assessing the quality of assets related to
corporate andmediumenterprises loansandadvances, primaryemphasis shouldbeplaceduponthe borrowers'
ability to repay debts and support interest service and principalrepaymentsout of prospective operating cash
flows. To this effect, the Auditor would be expected, especially inthe case of large borrowers,to commenton
the: (i)adequacy of the borrower prepared projections to identify future cash flows to service total
indebtedness; (ii)appropriateness of the assumptions relied upon in these projections; and (iii)process by
which the Bank evaluates the borrower's projections and subjects them to rigorous sensitivity analyses.
Collateral support should normally be of secondary importance. To the extent, however, that the Bank relies
on collateral as the primary source of payment, the Auditor will ensure that appropriate appraisal procedures
have been followed, including updated appraisalsof such collateral, and that the existing documentation and
legal proceduresallow the Bank to realize, without protracted delays, the estimated value of the collateral. In
upraisingthe value of collateralsunder constructionor inprogressthe auditor shouldsegregate andpresentthe
progress of construction in 3 tranches depending on the level of completion (i)up to 35% completion; (ii)
above 35%    -  70% completion and (iii)above 70% completion. When the primary source of repayment is

                                                     - xxxiii -

supportedby secondaryguarantees granted by other localbanks, the Auditor should evaluatethe likelihoodof
those guaranteesbeing executedbecause of the problematic situation of the final borrower, and the prospects
for thosebanksbeingableto serve those guarantees.

 15.     (d)  - Concentration of credit exposure. The Auditor would identify, quantify and appraise the
concentration of credit with particular emphasis on credit extendedto: (i)insiders and their related interests;
(ii)connectedparties;and(iii)majoreconomicsectors.Forthepurposeofthisreview,relatedorconnected
borrower concentrationsrepresenting5% or moreofcapitalor 5% ofuncoveredportfolio whichever is less, or
industry concentrationsrepresenting 10% or more of capital or 10% of uncoveredportfolio whichever is less
should be specificallydetailed. Borrowers should be considered "related" basedon commonownership, inter-
company dependence, or common sources of repayment. "Connection" implies the ability to exert control or
influence policy and decision-making, especially on credit decisions. (Connected parties or firms typically
include a firm's parent, major shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, directors, and executive
officers.) The status of each individualconcentration exceedingthe 5% level will be analyzed. Inthis case,
the Auditor should comment onthe borrower'sperformanceandthe probabilityof repaymentaccordingto the
existing terms of the loans. The Auditor should comment on the adequacy of the Bank's current policies,
practices, and proceduresto identify common ownership, control, and reliance on common cash flows. The
Auditor should also comment on the Bank's ability to identify and track extensions of credit to insiders and
whether these credits are based on normal terms or whether they are granted on terms more favorable
(availability, tenor, rate, collateral, risk tolerance) than those provided to the general public. The Auditor
should also, if appropriate, suggest new guidelines and new procedures by which concentrations should be
identifiedandtracked inthe Bank.

16.      (e) - Adequacy   of loss reserves andadditional capital needed for regulatory compliance. The Auditor
will assessthe adequacy ofthe reserves for loan losses andother valuation reserves, andprovidean opinionas
to the adequacyof capital. To the extentthat capital is inadequateto supportpresentandfuture operations, the
Auditor should recommendthe amount of additional capital required on the basis of the relevant regulations
established by the Central Bank of Egypt. The analysis would take into account, inter-alia, the adequacy of
provisions for losses, and adjustmentsnecessary to bringvaluation reservesto adequate levels.To this end, the
Auditor should outline the methodology used to determine the level of reserve adequacy, including the
amounts set aside as specific reserves and general reserves, and the extent of reliance on collateral for
establishing the recommendedreserves. In this regard, the analysis should specifically state the amount of
reserves required without collateral reliance, and the amount required with collateral reliance and the basis
uponwhich collateral hasbeenvalued.

17.      (f) Quality of earnings. The Auditor will assess the reliability and composition of the Bank's
             -
reportedearnings for the periodreviewed. The Auditor thus should specificallycomment on: (i)the extent to
which accrued but uncollectedinterest is taken into income - especially when such interest income relates to
loans which the Auditor, or the Bank, has placed into substandard risk category or below; (ii)the extent to
which collateral values (rather than operating cash flows) are the basis for decisions to capitalize interest
and/or to roll-over extensions of credit; (iii)capitalization of expenses; and (iv) any other income recognition
policies which could distort earnings. On the basis of the analysis, the Auditor would recommend,as needed,
adjustmentsto the profit and loss statementfor interesttaken into income on non-performing assets, as well as
for pastdue interestwhichhas beencapitalized, renegotiated, or refinanced.

         E Adequacy of, and adherenceto, lendingand credit administration policies
           -
18.      The Auditor would make an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of, and adherence to,
operational and lending policies, and credit administration procedures. This would include policies and
proceduresfor approvingcredit and establishing and enforcingrepaymentprograms, collectingpast due loans,
provisioning for actual and potential losses, writing-off of bad assets, debt recovery, and management
reporting. Where deficiencies have been identified, the Auditor would make recommendations for
strengtheningthe policies andcorrectingthe weaknesses.

                                                    - xxxiv -

 19.      More specifically,the Auditor shouldprovidea comprehensiveevaluation ofthe capacity ofthe Bank
to assess, administer, supervise and recover loans, advances, guaranteesand other investments, as well as an
evaluation of the Bank's current credit procedures and organization, including: (i)the standard loan process
from client's initial enquiry to final lending decision; (ii)formalized credit policies, procedures, and
underwritingcriteria; (iii)adequacy of financial informationreceivedfrom the borrower and analyzed by the
Bank as the basis for credit extension and for periodicassessment of the changingrisk inherent in the credit;
(iv) specific lending procedures and techniques for project appraisal, approval and legal finalization of
projects, procurement, disbursement, and follow-up; (v) lending organization covering relevant departments
and staffing including profile and skills of chief lending officers, credit managers and officers; (vi) internal
loan review process, internal risk categories, and procedures for management of problem loans; (vii)
specialized work-out units including scope, skills, resources, and efficiency; and (viii) mechanismsfor legal
recovery, foreclosureandrepossessionofcollateral, andtransmissionoflegalrights.

          F Interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity positions
            -
20.       The Auditor would be required to appraise and report on the adequacy of, and compliance with
policies and procedures for assets and liabilities management, including interest rate, liquidity and foreign
exchange risk exposures. The Auditor, where relevant, will assess and report on the existence of adequate
trading limits and controls, segregation of duties, accounting and revaluationprocedures, and management
reportingrequirementsand systems.

21.       The Auditor should report significant exposures to changes in interest rates, and comment upon
proceduresand controls inplaceto manage interestraterisk.

22.      The Auditor shouldevaluatethe Bank's foreignexchangerisk, determinethe profileof openpositions
andtheir evolution, and assess the controls andproceduresinplaceto managethe associatedrisk.

23.      The Auditor should assessand comment onthe Bank's liquidity bothinterms of the abilityto manage
asset and liability positions, and generate operating cash flows sufficient to cover operating cash expenses.
The Auditor shouldalso comment ifliquidity support is beingprovidedby any organization, bank or financial
institution, or the government, and the relative impact there from upon the Bank in terms of profitability,
liquidity, and interest rate and foreign exchange risk exposures. More specifically, in assessing liquidity
management risks, the Auditor should consider: (i)the volatility of deposits; (ii)the reliance placed on
interest-sensitivefunds; (iii)the access to money markets or other ready sources of cash; (iv) the ability to
convert assets readily into cash; (v) the capacity to meet unexpecteddeposit withdrawals and other demands
for payment; (vi) the ability to satisfy reasonablecredit demands readily; (vii) the financial strength of clients
relatedto off-balance sheet liabilitiesandthe prospects and,timing for possible draws on guaranteesand other
off-balance sheet items; (viii) the overall adequacy, effectiveness, and compliance with liquidity management
policies; and (ix) the nature, volume, and anticipated use of credit commitments, contingent liabilities, and
guarantees. Where deficiencies have been identified, the Auditor should recommend measures for
strengtheningor correctingthe weaknesses inthe Bank'smanagementandmonitoringof its liquidity position.

         G Verification of title to, and value of, fixed assets
            -
24.      To the extent that fixed assets are material to the total assets and to the capital of the Bank, the
Auditor will verify that the Bank has clear and unobstructedtitle to these assets. Specifically, it is anticipated
that the Auditor will conduct (or have conductedonthe Auditor behalf) a reviewof all title documentationand
relevantlandregistries. The Auditor will providecommentsonthe statusofthe titleto fixed assets.

25.      To the extent that the value of fixed assets is materialto the total assets andto the capitalofthe Bank,
the Auditor will verify the reasonablenessof the values assignedto fixed assets. To this end, the Auditor will:
(i)identifythemethodologybywhichvalueshavebeenassigned,and(ii)reconcilehistoricalcoststoexisting
book values. Finally, the Auditor will confirm (by separate appraisal basedon comparable sales or another

                                                   - xxxv -

accepted methodology) that the values assigned provide a realistic measure of realizable values and that the
values assignedare notso distortedthat they may infact distort the Bank'sstatedcapital levels.

          H Equityposition
             -
26.       The Auditor will review the equity accounts of the Bank and verify existing equity levels. The

27.       The Auditor should provide a detailed listing of adjustments required in order to ensure that the
financial statements accurately and fairly represent the financial position and performance of the Bank.
Adjustments may include additional provisionsto the loan loss andother valuationreserves, the suspensionor
reversalof interest accrual on loans and advances which arejudged to be non-performing, assets whichare to
be written-off, foreign exchange losses, income which is to be restated, or any other reclassifications and
adjustmentswhich materiallyaffect the financialstatements. (For reportingon individualreclassifications and
adjustments, materialitywill be kept at the 2% levelof the Bank's net worth for balanceand off-balance sheet
relatedadjustments, and 1YOfor the profit andlossaccount.)

28.       The Auditor should providea detailed listingof asset and liability items which, after adjustments, are
still carried in the financial statements at amounts which may differ significantly from realizablevalues. The
Auditor shouldprovide also adetailed listing of revenueand expense items which, after adjustments, may still

                  ANNEX5: BANKINGREGULATION SUPERVISIONPROGRAM  AND

 1.      The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking sector is a critical
part of the financial reform program. A credible, independent regulator is the necessary anchor of an
effective and resilient financial system, especially in an environment where state ownership of financial
institutionsis expectedto remainsignificant inthe mediumterm.

2.        The CBE Banking SupervisionDepartment has embarked on a comprehensive two-year program
o f capacity building covering extended areas of the regulatoryand supervisory functions, as it is seeking to
move from compliance to risk-based supervision.The Eurosystem26provided assistance to the CBE from
end of 2005 to upgrade the banking supervision with the program ending in November 2007. A report
basedon a needsassessment was issuedoutlining a two-yearprogram of capacity building. Duringthe first
phase of this two-years program (December 2005 - May 2006), the CBE conducted a comprehensive
review of its on-site and off-site processes and carried out an organizational restructuringof the banking
supervisionfunction.

3.        In March2006 the Sub Governoralready incharge of the BankingReformUnit was designatedto
take over the BSD. After a re-organizationin early 2007, the BSD is composed of 5 divisions (3 of them
are headed by an Assistant Sub Governor): the On-Site Inspection, the off site supervision, the Licensing
Department, the CentralCredit Registry (CCR) and the Macro-prudentialAnalysis Unit, financial stability
oriented(the latest was set up following the EU program recommendations).In addition, a RegulationUnit
(also recommendedby the EU program)has beenset up.

4.       The second phase, which started in June 2006, focused inter-alias on developing and
implementing appropriate supervisory tools and methodologies. As a result, the banking supervision in
Egypt is moving from compliance to a more proactiveand modern risk-basedsupervision.Once this new
framework is in place CBE needs to build a strong track record of successful enforcement of the new
regulations(namely in the loan classification, provisioningand internal control) and further strengthen its
capabilitiesto performan effectiverisk-basedsupervision.

5.       On site inspection is focusing on risks. Increased attention has been directed to credit
organizationand policy, concentrationof credit, risk management system, IT system and internal controls.
New manuals for on-site supervisionwith a risk focus are being used to drive on site inspections. Credit
registry and off-site supervisory information are feeding the preparationof on site examinations and the
relationshipmanager in charge of the off site supervisionfor the examinedbank is part of the on site team
An internal CAMEL rating is assigned at the end of the on-site exam to reflect the overall financial
standing of the bank. The on site team assess also risks beyond the financial performance of the bank like
operational, reputation, and IT risks with a specific rating for each family of risk and an overall composite
rating. On-site surveillance also gained greater efficiency by sending to the concerned parties an
"introductory letter" that aims at gathering the relevant data and information before the on-site
examinations start. The Relationship Manager attends the meetings held by the Head of the banking
supervision and the on-site mission chief with the bank's representatives to draw the conclusions of the
missionand define the requiredcorrective plan. It is expected that the synergies between the two divisions
and the recently established macro-prudential unit would help enhance off-site and on-site perspectives
through regular interactions as per the mapping recommended by the Eurosystem program on banking
supervision.

6.       The EU program aimed also at providing the inspectors with new IT tools giving them access to
off site supervisionand CentralCredit Registrydatabases.As a feedback inspectionteams will now haveto
update theses databases with the data collectedin the field. Once in effect, this type of feedback will help
strengthen and improvethe off site supervisionreports credit institutionsalong a CAMEL basedapproach.


26"Eurosystem" refers to the European Central Bank and national central banks members of the Euro-zone.

                                                   - xxxviii -

 The EU programalso recommendedsome improvement inthe staffing of inspectionteams. It underscored
 the need for more trained personnel, particularly in the fields of IT and market risks. To address this
 recommendation,the On-Sitedivision has internallyrecruitedtwo IT specialists to support the examinersin
 their controls.. Thanks to this new working environment, significant progress has beenmade especially on
 credit risk analysis. This is particularly important since credit risk analysis remains the main risk of the
 banking system in Egypt. Training sessions continue to be implemented in various aspects of the on-site
 examinations and especially to better assess bank strategies andrisk management systems.

 7.       The Off Site Supervision has developed new tools to help focus on critical issues for an
 enhanced decision making process. A new IT system which will be finalized in 2009 would aim at
gatheringrelevantraw data from the banks for analyticalpurposes..Timely implementationwould increase
 efficiency and productivity in implementing technological and organizational characteristics of the
 supervisory management informationsystems. A risk-orientedreport regardingthe strategy, management
 and the overall performance of a credit institution is at its final stage of design along a CAMEL typed
 approach. Produced on an annual basis, this report will cover all risks inherent in the bank's activities,
 including both quantitative (key figures regarding the bank's financial position, based inter-alias on the
yearly balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, along with peer comparisons, market shares) and
qualitativeinformation(facts about mainshareholders, descriptionof the mainbusiness activities, corporate
governance, internalcontrol, analysisof the earnings sustainability,solvency, liquidity andmarket risks).In
a nutshell, this annual report is designed to convey the banks' overall risk profile. However, to strengthen
this report, the CBE would have to streamline the existing reporting forms that are regularly sent by the
banksto the bankingsupervisor to beefup the new risk-orientedreport. Inaddition, the off site supervision
has designed two other reports: a quarterly report, oriented mainly on the prudential ratios currently
reported by the banks to the Supervisor, and a monthly report, mainly used for statistical purposes and
routinecompliance controls.

8.        All those elements should, in the long run, help the CBE develop an Early Warning System
enabling an adequate, proactive framework to deal with problem banks. In particular, it should help
the CBE in determining the levels of capital ratios as well as best suited remedial measures to address
particularevents or risk profile of credit institutions.Inadditionto the work already accomplished, a broad
range of analysis may be neededto assess the banks capitaland their ability to sustain nonexpectedlosses,
assuming that their provisions would be sufficient to cover the expected losses. The CBE should also
formalize transparent guidelines on crisis managementto deal with problembanks. It would includetaking
control of a bank in distress, imposinga moratorium,restructuringthe bank's liabilities, transferring all or
part of its business to another bank or to a special purpose entity, and providing lender of last resort
facilities.

9.        A macro-prudentialunit has been set up in a financial stability perspective. An experienced
analyst has been recruitedto run this new unit composed o f 4 staff members (roughly 10 to 15 new staff
will be appointed in the short to medium term). The key deliverables for this team will be an annual
Banking Sector Review and a Banking Stability Report. The Banking Sector Review will deliver a
comprehensive analysis of the banking sector in dealing with macroeconomic and financial markets
developments, bankingsector structure, earnings and profitability, capitaladequacy, asset quality, liquidity
and other risks, and regulatory and supervisory developments. The Banking Stability Report will aim at
addressingthe key developments, risks andvulnerabilities,as well as the assessment on the resilienceofthe
Egyptianbanking sector. This initiative, in line with the Basel best practices aims at enhancingthe market
discipline, thanks to a greater disclosure of the bankingsector issues.

10.      The regulatory framework has to be improved, notably regarding internal control system
and market risk management. As the BSD cannot rely only on the external auditors since the quality of
their report is uneven, internalcontrol regulationsystem appearsto be critical. More over, it would prepare
the banks in their progress towards the Basel 11 framework. The CBE would help support the banking
sector by issuing specific guidelines spelling out what is an accurate and comprehensive internal control

                                               - xxxix -

system based on risk management. As to the market risk, there are currently still no limits to equities
trading and investment, and no guidelines for banks to deal with these risks, notably in stress testing. The
CBE is preparing a regulation that would address this rising risk in Egypt. A close cooperation would be
needed with the IT group in order to define the specifications for banks' data reporting to the CBE.

           ANNEX6: FRAMEWORKRESTRUCTURINGSTATE-OWNEDINSURERS
                                       FOR                      OF

1.       The Program Document (PAD) dated May 17, 2006 for the first DPL (Report No. 36197-EG)
contained a section specific to the restructuring of state owned insurance companies (Operational Policy
Matrix SectionV).

2.       The first of these items was supported by Annex IV to the DPL IPAD, which laid out the advisory
consortium's terms of reference. All Board Approval triggers were satisfied. The due diligence advisory
agreementwas signed with BNPP/ CIB after a competitivetendering process. For technicalreasonsand to
hasten the process the first stage (due diligence and recommendation), involving a consortiumof advisers
under BNPP/ CIB leadership, was signed with each of the four state owned insurers, with coordination
being achieved though a Steering Committee. Subsequently the Insurance Holding Company (IHS) was
establishedandthis took over the role ofthe SteeringCommittee.

3.       The MTPL project was carried out by Actuaria, an Italian actuarial firm, and in the process
significanttechnology transfer was achieved. This exercise establishedthat MTPL claims provisionswere
approximately ELl.9 billion indeficit andthat on averageMTPL premiumlevels (which are establishedby
the State and had not beenchanged for many years) were approximately 1/5thofthe requiredlevel. These
figures were supported by the independent work of Milliman, an actuarial firm working as part of the
PNPP/ CIB consortium, andby actuariesworking inthe IHS.

    1    Time boundMTPL reformstrategy has beenagreedat Cabinet level.

    8    Real estate Assets have been transferred to a specialist asset management company and a
         liquidationprogramhas begun.

4.       Ofthese the first 2 were satisfied. The third is beingprogressingwell as the general assembliesof
the three SOIs have approved the full transfer of real estate assets to the newly established specialized
company starting from 1st of Oct., 2007,. In additionthe Chairman of the IHS has recently announced in
the Egyptianpressthat all JV holdingsare to be divested.

5.      The first indicator (restructuring and privatization) was delivered according to the following
schedule:

        The due diligence commenced in February 2006 and the resultant report was delivered in
        September 2006 to the IHC andthe four state owned insurers'Chairmen.
        Basedon the due diligence reports 5 year businessplans were producedby each company with the
        assistanceofthe consortium.
        Further feedback was provided and, based on this, BNPP/CIB prepared valuations and
        restructuringrecommendations.
        Basedon feedback from the Minister and the World Bank a more focused and refined strategywas
        subsequently submitted.
        The Minister of Investment announced a broad state owned insurer restructuring strategy in the
        mass media onAugust 16,2007.
        The Chairman of IHC announced a non core asset realization strategy in the mass media on
        September 3,2007.
        The minister of investment announced that A1 Chark insurance company and Egypt Re will be
        mergedinto Misr insurance companyto create a giant insurancecompany
        The general assemblies of the SOIs have approved the transfer of real estate asset to the newly
        establishedreal estate asset managementcompany.
        Key findings of the due diligence carried out in2006 were as follows: (i)As at June 30, 2005 the
        three direct insurers all hadaggregatereserving(life) and provisioning(non life) deficits. Of these
        the two smaller direct insurers were in deficit. One of these was heavily insolvent and the other

                                                      - xli -

         was on the margin; and (ii) two larger direct insurersand the reinsurerhad positivenet present
                                        the
         values.

6.       The second indicator (MTPL reform) has proved to be highly relevant to the restructuring and
privatization process. In their first report BNPP pointed out that any privatizationstrategy involving trade
sales would be stymied by the MTPL deficits and premium inadequacy. Thus if this approach were to be
adopted MTPL would need to be removed from the equation. The GOE had in the interim adopted an
MTPL strategy (as requiredunder the WB operationalmatrix) and this is inconsistentwith a full or partial
trade sale strategy. The elements of the MTPL strategy are as follows:
     ...
     8   Publicizingthe extent of the MTPL shortfallto preparethe general public for reform.
         Bringing claims provisiondeficits inthe two largest direct insurers andthe reinsurerup to required
         levelsover 3 years.
         Gradually raisingpremiumlevels, andtakingactionto limit claims costs and inflation.
         Requiringthe insurancesector to continue underwritingthis class of business.

7.   ..  The secondindicator(MTPL reform) was deliveredaccordingto the following schedule:

         A new law no.72 of year 2007 was issuedon 29 June 2007. This, amongst other things, caps pay
         outs.
         The attendant Executive Regulation has been issued by the Ministerial Decree no. 217 of year
         2007 on 13 August 2007.
    ..
    I    A new increasedprice list has beenissuedand implemented startingfrom 1st September2007.
        A notional defendant fund to protect "Hit and Run" victims was established and its bylaws were
         issuedby aPMDecreeon 20 August 2007.
         The Board of the above mentioned Fund was appointed by Ministerial Decree no.311 of year
        2007.

8.      The restructuringstrategy announcedby the Minister of Investmenthas taken all of these elements
into account and hasthe following components:

    8   The reinsurer and less distressedof the two direct insurers have been merged into Misr,the largest
        and soundest of the state owned insurers, and a well respected brand name in Egypt (Misr means
         'Egypt').
    1   The remaininginsurer, which has major pension contracts with the police and military, and is the
        major underwriterof MTPL, will remainwith the government and take over the legacy MTPL and
        group life liabilities of all the state owned insurers.

                       ANNEX7: REFORMING         THE PRIVATEPENSION SECTOR

 1.       The secondDPL will support actions to develop privatepensionsmarket by:
          .  Introducing a sounder regulatory framework that diversifies the pension plan products,
             introduces capital and funding requirements, providesrules for investment and annuitization,
             requires professionalmanagement of intermediaries,and improves the quality of reporting to
             support a sounder supervisionof funds;
             Improving informationof the existing pensionplans in order to identify those facing critical
          .  problems of funding and support the actions from EISA to requirecorrectiveactionplans.
             Improving capacity building in supporting professional areas such as specialized pension
             actuarialstudies.

2.        Voluntary private pensions have a long history in Egypt. In 2006 there were 585 active funds
coveringaround 8.5 million membersof the public and privatesectors. Most ofthe plans are sponsored by
employers (mainly in the public sector), and only a few of them offer annuity products. There are no rules
requiring professionalmanagement, and funds normally do not have independent administrative capacity.
Decisionmakinglargely relies onthe boards of directors.

3.        Market concentrationis high as expressed in number of members and size of the funds. In fact,
out of the 585 active funds, only 25 representedmorethan 50% ofthe market.

4.        Pension funds portfolios are strongly concentrated in fixed deposits (26.3%) and government
bonds (67.5%). This may be explained, among other factors, by low standards of professionalportfolio
management, and lack of autonomous investment policies that will be addressed by the new regulatory
framework. In additionto the regulatory requirements, portfolio diversificationwill largely depend on the
capacity of the capital market to develop and offer more diversifiedand longerterm investment options, as
also addressedby DPL 11.

5.       A preliminary actuarial solvency valuationdone.byEISA for the 25 largest funds showed that only
three of them have funded ratios o f 100% or more, with the vast majority being under-funded. Under the
new regulations, the funds will be required to conduct regular actuarial valuation and adopt corrective
actions inthe cases o f under-funding.

6.       Most of the current pension plans offer lump sums to members. The development of annuities is
essential in order to provideenhancedincome support in old age. While regulatoryreformwill support this
development, investment opportunities and inadequate knowledge of this product will impose severe
limitationsto expand market opportunities. Public informationand financial education programs will need
to support the efforts to expand the sector by addressing the strong preference for present consumptionat
retirement.

7.       Another important limitation for the expansion of private pensions is the generosity of the public
pension schemes. The longterm nonsustainability of these schemes requires correctiveactions that will in
turn impose additional opportunities and also challenges to the voluntary pension funds in order to be
preparedto provideadequate complementarysupport to mandatory pensions.

8.       The expected expansion of voluntary pensions will demand a strong supervisioncapacity. Under
the new pensionlaw, EISA will be responsible of supervising private pension plans. In order to perform
this role, EISA will need to go through an institutional and administrative reform process, including the
development of a specialized department for private pension supervision. The decision to shift to a risk-
basedsupervisionapproach for insurance will create the adequateenvironmentto develop a similar strategy
for private pension plans. The preparation of EISA for this organizational re-structuring will also be
supported by DPL 11.

                           ANNEX8: CAPITALMARKETS               DEVELOPMENTS

1.       Inthe capital markets area, the second DPL would support policy reforms in two areas. The first
goal is deepeningandstrengtheningthese markets by:

         Implementinginternationalstandards of auditingand accounting and ensuring the externalauditors
         of firms inthe publicdomain deliver highquality audit service;

     1   Enhancingcapital adequacy and riskmanagementat securities firms;
     *   Simplificationofthe listing schedules at CASE;
     .   Introducingregulationoftake over bids andpublictender offers;
         Establishinganew SME exchange;
     ..  Improvingefficiency and liquidity of CASEby institutingmarket makingand on-line trading;
         Overhaulingthe regulationof investmentfunds and
         Introducingregimes to allow greater diversityof financial instrumentsto be issues andtraded, such
         as securitizationsand exchangetraded funds.

The second goal is strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the CMA and CASE to
ensure compliance with internationalstandards andeffectiveenforcement.

Deepeningand Strengthening the Efficiencyof the Capital Markets

2.      Accounting and Auditing.        Correct decision-making by investors and lenders depend on the
receipt of high quality, timely and complete financial informationabout the companies or other entities in
which they are consideringinvesting. The initiativessupported by this operation, relating to adoptionand
implementationof IFRS for listed companies, public companies, and regulatedfirms and establishment of
registry for the external auditors of these firms, will improve the quality of financial disclosure in the
capital markets. Implementing International Standards of Auditing and bringing the external auditors
oversight body into full operation will provide additional assurance on financial disclosure. Better
informationproducesbetter decisions andtherefore more effectiveallocationsof capital inthe market.

3.      Capital Adequacy and Risk Management. The protectionof investors and stability of financial
systems are increasedby an adequate supervisionof ongoing capital standards.Capital adequacy standards
foster confidence in the financial markets and should be designed to allow a firm to absorb some losses
without failing and wind down its business over a relatively short period without loss to its customers or
disruptingthe orderly functioning of the financial markets. The introductionof capitaladequacy standards
for Egyptian securities firms designed to measure the ability of the companies to cope with the risks
associated with their activities, clients, and the securities they deal in supports these investor protection
goals. These risks addressed in the new standards include market risk, settlement risk, credit risk,
operational risk and liquidity risk. Also new risk management and technological capacity standards
complement the capital adequacy enhancements to reduce the likelihood of intermediary failure further.
These higher standardsmay also encourage additionalconsolidationof smaller firms, thereby strengthening
the industryas a whole.

4.      Corporate GovernanceRules. The capital adequacy and accountinginitiativesare complemented
by improvements in the framework relating to corporate governance in Egypt. The Egyptian Institute of
Directors has been created with the mandate of formulating and promoting the application of corporate
governance principlesand rules that would increase efficiency and improve the organizational structure of
companies, includingsecurities firms. A Guide on Corporate Governance Rules has been published, along
with another guide on general principlesof corporate governance.

5.      Simplification of CASE Listing Schedules.           The current CASE listing schedules are too
complicated, involving several official and unofficial lists. This structure fragments the markets, confuses

                                                    - xliv -

 investors and issuers, and increases costs. SOEs are given special treatment and are not requiredto meet
 certain listing standards such as the minimum number of public investors or prior public subscriptions.
 Phase I1will support changesto the CML to permit rationalizationof the listing schedule, the elimination
 of special treatment of SOEs, and the subsequent implementationof a single listing board. These three
 changes should improve the overall efficiency of both CASE and the market as a whole. The existing
 initiative at CASEto actively enforce the listingand delistingrules is also supportedby the loan.

 6.        Take Over Bid Regulation.       To safeguard the fair and equitable treatment of shareholders,
 international standards require regulation to provide a framework to govern transactions involving the
 acquisition of a significant position in a public company or mergers between public companies. Phase I1
 supports the promulgation of a new section to the executive regulations of the CML to address the
 disclosure, pricing and other issues relating to takeover bids and tender offers. Egypt would be the first
 country inthe regionto issue separateregulatoryprocessesfor mergers and acquisitions, in alignment with
the internationalstandards andbestpractices.

 7.        New SME Exchange. The establishment of a special stock exchange (Nilex) for listing and
 trading SMEs is intended to facilitate their access to equity capital. The new exchange will fall under the
 umbrellaof CASE, but will have a completelyseparatesystem of infrastructureand procedures.Companies
 wishing to list on Nilex must have an advisor approved by the CMA to assist the company in meeting its
 initial listing and on-going disclosure requirements for at least two years. CASE has finalized the listing
 rules, organizationalstructure and transparency and disclosure rules. CASE is applying a carefulprocess in
 assessinglisting applications and expects to list the first company on Nilex sometime in 2008. Success of
this initiative will depend on the readiness of high-quality companies to pursue a public share offering, of
qualified advisors to support the listing and disclosure'needs of small companies, and of investors to
provide liquidity for tradinginsmall issues.

 8.        EfJcient Trading & Disclosure. The efficiency of the marketplace is being improved by the
adoption of on-line trading by securities firms and will be enhanced further by other planned technology
improvements such as an electronic filing and disclosure system for public company data, like the EDGAR
system in operation in the US. Improved liquidity of the equity markets will be enhanced by full
implementation of the market maker system introduced by CASE and by the short selling initiative
underway by the CMA and the central depository. Further, the CASE trading system has now been
modifiedto permitthe tradingon stocks of seventeencompanies duringthe same day (Le. for settlement on
trade date, rather than trade date plus two days, which is the normal settlement cycle), which will also
enhance liquidity.

9.         Investment Fund Regime Enhancements. Investment funds are an importantmeans for investors
to achieve a diversifiedexposure to investment opportunities.Proper regulationof these funds is critical to
the objectiveof investor protectionand should ensure that investorshave access to a fair market. Investors
in collective investment schemes rely upon sponsors, operators and other related parties of the funds to
manage their assets andto act intheir best interests.

10.        The proposed loanwould support new regulationthat would revamp the regulatoryframework for
mutual funds in line with internationalstandards and facilitate their sound growth. Amendment of the
CML would: (i)clarify the legal structure of investment funds; (ii)clarify the roles and obligations of
sponsors, operators and related parties; (iii)improve the computation of net asset values, sales and
redemption procedures; (iv) improve the quality of disclosure to investors; and (v) reduce the mandatory
investment in paid-up capital of a fund from 5% to 2% of assets under management, with the goal of
eventually removingthis requirement. These improvements are complemented by the creationof a regime
for issuingandtradingexchange traded funds (ETFs) on CASE.

11.        These changes improve investor protection. They also should facilitate growth in the market for
these funds and build the presence of the institutional investor community in the market, which otherwise
has beenlargely retail investordominated.

                                                   - xlv -

 12.     Introduction of New Instruments. In additionto the introductiono f ETFs, recent amendmentsto
the CML and Executive Regulations permit securitization. The Egyptianmarket has seen the issue its first
asset backed securities transactions - three backed by car loans and two backed by mortgages. Greater
choice infinancing options and in investment alternatives allowsthe market to cater to specific needs from
both the issuer and investor perspectives. CASE is in the process of acquiring a next-generationtrading
systemfrom one of the world's leadingprovidersthat will supporttrading ina wider variety of instruments.

Strengtheningthe Supervisory Framework for the Capital Market

 13.     CMA Restructuring.       International standards require the regulator to have adequate powers,
proper resources and the capacity to perform its functions and exercise its powers. Recent assessments
identified gaps in the skills of the CMA staff, in its enforcement capabilities, and in its governance. An
agreed framework to address the identified issues was developed under Phase Iincluding an overall
reorganization, increased IT investment, and more diverse training programs. Under Phase 11, the
authorities will ensure substantial progress in the implementation of the institutional and operational
restructuringof CMA as per the agreed framework. CMA has established a supervisiondepartment, and
assigned and trained staff. In addition, CMA is exploring additional IT-basedapproaches for improving
market surveillance. Lastly, CMA is upgrading training and licensing for securities industry staff (e.g.,
portfolio managers, brokers). The authoritieswill also want to maintainprogresstowardthe Government's
objectivesofintegratingsupervisionofnon-bank financial sector firms.

14.      Prevention of Market Abuse. The CMA's tools to combat market manipulation and insider
trading has been enhanced by the addition of Chapter 11,to the ExecutiveRegulations to the CML, which
prohibits insider dealing and specified attempts at market manipulation, and prescribes penalties. It being
inherently a challenge for securities regulators to detect and punish market manipulation and insider
trading, CMA will need to remain vigilant and continuously upgrade its supervision and market
surveillancecapabilities.

15.     Strengthening the Market Operator.          Self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as stock
exchanges, can be a valuable complement to the regulator in achieving the objectives of securities
regulation. There can be substantial benefits from self regulation as SROs may require the observance of
ethical standards which go beyond government regulations and they may offer considerable depth and
expertise regardingmarket operations and practices, and may be able to respond more quickly and flexibly
than the government authority to changing market conditions. Most SROs are self-funding so that the
scarce resources o f the statutory regulator can be applied to other priorities and their investment in
exchange operations can be limitedto suitable oversighto fthe exchange.

16.     However,these benefitsandrelianceby the regulatorson the SRO's activitiesis predicated on that
SRO being structuredand operated in accordance with internationalstandards. Strengthening the corporate
and oversight framework of CASE therefore is a priority, and should focus on (i)public clarification of its
legal and corporate governance structure, (ii)simplifying the market organization within CASE, and (iii)
enhancingits selfregulatoryfunction.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article I V Consultation with the
Arab Republic of Egypt
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/139
December 3, 2007

 Public Information Notices (PINS)form part of the IMF's efforts to promotetransparency of the IMF's views and analysis
 of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINSare issued after
 Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillanceof developments at the
     onal level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program
                  INSare also issued after Executive Boarddiscussionsof generalpolicy matters, unless otherwise decided
                   Board in a particularcase.


On November 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt .I
Background
Sustained and bold reforms, prudent macroeconomic management, and a favorable external
environment enabled the Egyptian economy to register another year of impressive
performance. Growth remained high and has become more broad-based, creating record
numbers of jobs. Inflation has returned to single digits after spiking during the year through
March 2007. Investor confidence remains high.
Real GDP growth in 2006/07 is estimated at 7.1 percent, the highest in years, The expansion
was broad-based, with a further acceleration in non-hydrocarbon sectors, including in
agriculture and manufacturing. The growth since end-2004 has added 2.4 million jobs as of
end-March 2007, reducing unemployment from 10.5 percent to 9 percent.
Strong growth and rising equity and real estate prices have boosted domestic demand,
contributing to strong import growth and a pick-up in underlying inflation. Exports also rose
sharply, along with worker remittances, Suez canal receipts, and tourism revenues. With
record levels of Foreign Direct Investment, the balance of payments recorded a surplus of
US$5.3 billion in 2006/07, bringing official reserves to the equivalent of more than 6 months
of imports of goods and services. A spike in inflation over the year through March 2007 was
driven largely by the impact of an avian flu outbreak and adjustments in administered fuel
prices in 2006; but a rise in underlying inflation (one that excludes food and most energy
prices) points to some spillovers and demand pressures as well, along with some imported
inflation. After peaking at 12.8 percent in March 2007, inflation measured as the Consumer
Price Index has gradually receded since, to 8.5 percent in August; underlying inflation has
also fallen substantially.
Macroeconomic policies in 2006/07 helped contain demand and inflationary pressures, but
were complicated by strong capital inflows. Monetary policy. was tightened once spillover
effects of administered price increases became visible, and the nominal exchange rate
allowed to appreciate by 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar in the year to end-June, with
considerably greater flexibility since then. Through the partial sterilization of external inflows,
broad money growth was kept in the 13-15 percent range until April 2007, but subsequently
surged to 18 percent.
Fiscal imbalances narrowed as there was significant underlying adjustment in 2006/07.
Preliminary data indicate a central government deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP, below the 9
percent average of recent years, largely due to structural improvements in the tax area, fuel
price adjustments, wage restraint, and windfall receipts from a telecom license sale, with a
broadly similar adjustment for the general government (which includes social security funds
and the National Investment Bank, NIB). Combined with privatization receipts and the draw-
down of idle cash balances following the consolidation of most government accounts into a
Treasury Single Account, budget borrowing requirements fell dramatically, contributing to a
decline in Treasury-bill yields.

                                             - xlviii -

 Structural reforms advanced significantly in promoting a private-sector driven economy. The
 fourth largest state bank (Bank of Alexandria) and a large department store chain along with
 other assets were sold to foreign investors (about 1.4 percent of GDP), Import tariffs were
 reduced in early 2007, and tax administration reforms progressed. Cash and debt
 management was streamlined by consolidating government accounts into a treasury single
 account and by the settlement of circular debts among the central government, the NIB and
 the Social Insurance Funds. Plans are afoot to restructure the pension system with assistance
 from the World Bank and the government is putting in place a strong institutional framework
 for Public Private Partnerships. Egypt successfully issued its first international local-currency
 bond (LE 6 billion), seeking to widen the investor pool, foster secondary trading and hence
 establish a meaningful benchmark yield curve.        '



 Recent steps undertaken to facilitate business activities include slashing the time, fees, and
 minimum capital required to set up a business; drastically lowering fees for registering
 property; and cutting further the time needed for imports and exports to clear customs.
 Egypt's macroeconomic vulnerabilities seem low. The diversified sources of foreign capital
 (mostly from Europe, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and North America) and a
 still-low share of speculative funds limit the risk of a sudden reversal of capital flows. The
 vulnerability to any reversal is furthermore limited as little of these inflows have been
 intermediated through the banking system and the Central Bank of Egypt's international
 reserves are high. Stress testing conducted during the recent joint World Bank/IMF Financial
 Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update highlights that the banking system would be
 vulnerable mainly to a deterioration of domestic credit quality and much less to exchange and
 interest rate movements. To date Egypt has weathered the recent turbulences in global
 financial markets rather well, some pullback in the stock and fixed-income markets
 notwithstanding.
 Executive Board Assessment
 Executive Directors commended the Egyptian authorities' sound macroeconomic management
 and bold economic reforms. Fiscal adjustment and significant achievements in privatization
 and financial sector reform have increased market confidence and boosted investment,
thereby helping to sustain a high pace of economic growth. Growth is increasingly broad-
 based, contributing to a substantial reduction in unemployment.
 Looking ahead, Directors observed that important challenges remain. They pointed, in
 particular, to the high government budget deficit, shallow financial intermediation, and
remaining bureaucratic barriers to private sector activity, Furthermore, domestic demand
continues to contribute to the inflationary pressures. Directors also cautioned that the slow
trickle-down of the benefits of economic growth could weaken public support for the reform
effort.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to reduce the fiscal
deficit to 3 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2010/11. This will help further increase investor
confidence, further improve the economy's resilience to exogenous shocks, reduce the public
debt, and underpin macroeconomic stability. I n this context, Directors commended the fiscal
adjustment achieved last year, including through the reform of tax administration and public
finance management and the reduction of fuel subsidies. They welcomed the planned further
reduction of fuel subsidies, and called for stronger social safety nets to protect vulnerable
segments of the population, as well as more efficient and better prioritized social spending.
Directors looked forward to quick progress on the value added tax reform, containment of the
wage bill, and further broadening of the tax base.
Directors commended the efforts of the central bank to strengthen monetary policy
formulation and improve the interest rate transmission mechanism. They generally supported
the central bank's pragmatic approach of focusing on underlying inflation to forestall second-
round effects of administered price increases and supply shocks. Directors cautioned that,
going forward, monetary policy will need to be vigilant in light of continued demand
pressures. They welcomed the planned adoption of inflation targeting, which should be
introduced after steps are taken to ensure a competitive banking system and a consistent
monetary policy framework.

                                                   - xlix -

Directors welcomed the move to greater exchange rate flexibility since mid-2007, which has
enhanced the coherence of the macroeconomic policy mix. The ensuing exchange rate
appreciation has helped in curbing inflation. Directors considered that allowing a greater role
for market forces in determining the exchange rate would help to deal with pressures arising
from capital inflows and to underpin the move to inflation targeting. They agreed that Egypt's
current account is consistent with external stability, and that the exchange rate is broadly in
line with economic fundamentals.
Directors commended the significant progress in financial sector reform, and welcomed the
authorities' plans for further reform in line with key recommendations of the recent FSAP
Update. They welcomed the successful sale of a major state-owned bank and the efforts to
reduce the nonperforming loans in the banking system. They encouraged completion of the
privatization of another bank in 2008 as planned. Directors emphasized the importance of
improving supervision, completing bank recapitalization, enhancing the monitoring of state
banks, and undertaking complementary regulatory and judicial reforms. Some Directors
called for gradual privatization of the large state-owned insurance company, in line with the
authorities' overall thrust toward greater private sector participation in the financial sector.
Directors stressed that enhancing the investment climate will be crucial to sustain the growth
momentum. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to reduce barriers to private sector activity,
including through lower import tariffs, reduction of red tape, and a strengthened legal
framework for business activities. They also pointed out that a faster pace of job creation will
require labor market reforms and education to reduce skill mismatches, non-wage costs, and
constraints on hiring and firing.

  Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.
