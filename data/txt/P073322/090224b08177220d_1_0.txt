                         The project's renewable energy objective, in line with GEF Operational Program 6, is to remove the barriers to, and reduce the implementation costs of, renewable
                         energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The specific priority is CC-3 Power sector regulatory frameworks and policies for grid-based renewable
                         energy.

                         The implementation of Matching Grants and Performance Grants has continued to demonstrate progress. The Program has completed four rounds of Matching Grant selection in
                         order to support feasibility and pre-feasibility studies of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind and biomass as well as solar water heating (SWH). After consultation with
                         key stakeholders such as DoE, Eskom, Sustainable Energy Society of SA, Association of Energy Service Companies, and Economic Development Department of EDD, the launch of
                         an additional fifth round of MG selection took place in May to ensure the resources under the MG are fully utilized. The Round Five MG outcome, with selections expected to be
                         completed between July to December 2012, will lift the REMT MG contractual commitments to approximately ZAR17.24 million.

                         Recognizing the significant support that REMT has been bringing to the renewable energy development in South Africa, the Department of Energy of South Africa (DoE) has
                         contributed ZAR 7.4 million as co-financing to REMT project. This support has created a level of continuity and sustainability for the Project.

                         A series of workshops in renewable energy, such as SWH and Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) have been organized, and the REMT website was well established as an important
                         renewable energy resource information dissemination platform.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The maximum threshold for SWH Matching Grants was revised from USD50 000-00 to USD100 000-00 in May 2012. This was designed to increase interest in the market, noting that
                         the remaining budget allocated to this category is ZAR 5.8 million. In addition, the Government has requested an extension to the term of the grant by an additional nine months.
