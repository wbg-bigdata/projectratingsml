A.      STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.      COUNTRYAND SECTOR ISSUES

1.1     Overall economic conditions. South Africa's economic performance during the first
decade o f freedom has been impressive on several counts. Sound macroeconomic policies and
strong fiscal discipline contributed to the 3 percent average annual growth duringthe first decade
after 1994. Recent economic performance has also been strong. Real GDP growth reached 4.9
percent in 2005 and 4.6 percent in 2006, employment has risen, and inflation has remained
within the target bandfor over two and a half years. Foreign debt is low and overall borrowing
has been brought below 40 percent o f GDP. The fiscal deficit fell from 1.5 percent o f GDP in
FY2004/05 to 0.3 percent in FY2005/06, reflecting buoyant revenues. Owing to large capital
inflows, internationalreserves continued to rise.

1.2     South Africa contributes 40 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP-its        nine largest cities
alone account for about 24 percent o f Africa's GDP. Growth spillovers to the rest o f the
continent are exceptionally large by international standards: an additional percentage point o f
South African growth i s associated with 0.5 to 0.75 percent GDP growth increases inthe rest o f
Africa, independent o f common regional shocks.

1.3     Energy and Environmental Issues. South Africa is one o f the few countries in the
world that heavily relies on coal to meet its energy needs, with 75% o f total energy consumption
from coal in 2004. It is the world's sixth largest coal producers, 90% o f which was used for
electricity generation and the synthetic fuel industry. As a result, South Africa has high
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the largest contributor inAfrica.

1.4     Power sector. South Africa has a well-developed power sector, with a total installed
capacity o f 42 GW and a total electricity production o f 244,607 GWh in 2004, which i s
predominantly coal-fired (92%)' and includes nuclear (5%),          hydro (2%), as well as solar,
biomass, and gas (1%). South Africa accounted for 45% o f the total power produced in all o f
Africa. The generation and transmission o f power i s concentrated in the hands o f Eskom, the
vertically integrated state-owned utility. Eskom i s also the largest singledistributor inthe country
interms o fenergy sales for final consumptionandnumber o fcustomers, althoughthere aremore
than400 other distributors, mainly municipal electricitydepartments that also supply electricity to
end customers. While Eskom is widely recognized as a world-class power utility (electricity
prices in South Africa are among the lowest inthe world, with an average sales price o f around 2
U.S. cents per kWh), the Cabinet approved in June 1999 a plan to merge the large number o f
municipal distributors and Eskom's distribution businesses into six Regional Distribution
Companies (REDS).However, implementationo f the Cabinet's decision has been painfklly slow
andconvoluted. The first RED was established only in2005 and on paper. Other changesto the
generation andtransmissionsectorswillbemade indue course.

1.5     South M c a is currently experiencing power shortages and load shedding, as generation
capacity has not increased over the past ten years, despite a steady growth in demand for electricity.
Increasingpower shortages inSouth Africa couldpose a serious threat to sustained economic growth
and international competitiveness. ESKOM is currently planning to build 1,500 MW o f power
capacity eachyear over the next five years to meet the growingdemand.

1.6      Project background. This project has been formulated after several years o f dialogues
and discussions between World Bank and the Government o f South Africa. In early 2000, the
Minister o f Energy (who is now South Africa's vice president) requested Bank assistance on two
fronts: (i) utilizing renewable energy resources, and (ii)
                                                         stimulating productive uses o f electricity
inthe rural areas, where electricity hadbeensuccessfilly provided by Eskomunder a subsidized
program (which, however, had not led to income-generating activities). The Bank took the
following measures inresponse:

    (a) helped organize a People's Power workshop in SouthAfrica in2000;
    (b) helped draft the Government's WhitePaper on RenewableEnergy, which was approved
         in2003;
    (c) helped define a program to stimulate the productive uses o f electricity in rural areas, in
        partnership with the Independent Development Trust (IDT) and a variety o f stakeholders;
    (d) held extensive discussions with the Department o f Housing about Bank assistance for an
         efficient-energy housingprogram, which didnot proceed beyond the draft stage;
    (e) helped the government understandthe practical opportunities open to South Africa under
         the Kyoto Protocol;
    (0 assisted the government with advice and expertise on a number of energy-related issues,
         such as ambient air pollution in townships like Soweto and removal o f lead from
        gasoline.

1.7     This proposed Renewable Energy Market Transformation (REMT) project is a result o f
this dialogue, and aims to help the government implement the White Paper on Renewable
Energy. The project concept has been vetted by South Africa's National Treasury, which has
formally requested the Bank to prepare this project using GEF grant support.

1.8     Development of renewable energy. The government has committed South Africa to
reducing the country's GHG emissions. The government's White Paper on Renewable Energy
(2003) sets the following target for renewable energy:

        10,000 GWh (0.8 Mtoe) renewable energy contribution tofinal energy consumption by
        2013, to be produced mainly from biomass, wind, solar and small-scale hydro. This is
        approximately 4 percent (1,667 MW) of the estimated electricity demand by 2013
        (41,539).

The WhitePaper lists these sources for meetingthe target:

        The renewable energy is to be utilized for power generation and non-electric
        technologiessuch as solar water heating and bio-fuels.

1.9     The government currently plans to adopt a mandatory feed-in tariff and a voluntary green
electricity trading scheme to promote renewable energy development to achieve this target. In
addition, given the highdemand for solar water heaters, Eskom recently plans an aggressive solar
water heater program to mitigate the power shortages. Solar water heaters have a large replication
potential to reduce greenhouse gases by replacing fossil fie1combustion. Furthermore, the power
tariff for newly built power plants has increased to 3.6-4.3 U.S. centskWh, according to the



                                                4

National Energy Regulator o f South Africa (NERSA). With additional revenue streams from
carbon financing, some renewable energy technologies canbe financially viable at this tarifflevel.

1.10    Given South Africa's strong industrial and financial sectors and the highoverall level o f
capacity, the 10,000 GWh target may appear to be easy to achieve. To the contrary, this i s an
ambitious target for South Africa, because it has significant barriers to renewable energy
development. Inprinciple, South Africa could eliminate these barrierson its own; however, long
years o f being cut o f f from international trends as well as the historical reliance on coal make it
difficult for the country to move forward on renewable energy on its own. Consequently, the
government has requested assistancefrom the World Bank andGEF.

1.11 The main barriers to this project's two renewable energy components are described
below:

   (a) Renewables-based power generation in South Africa: So far there are few renewable-
       based power generation inSouth Africa, though a few renewable energy power generation
       projects have been developed, with some form o f financial assistance from
       officialhilateral funds or international carbon funds. The main barriers to such generation
       are as follows: (i)  low current power tariff levels (an average tariff o f 2.3 U.S. centskwh),
       well below the long-run marginal costs of expansion and costs o f most renewable energy
       technologies in South Africa; (ii)   lack o f a policy and institutional framework for sale o f
       power into the main grid; (iii)  absence o freadily available reliable basic information about
       renewable energy resources; (iv) potential developers' unfamiliarity with details o f the
       government's approach for promoting renewable energy, as well as unfamiliaritywith the
       nature and extent o f support for renewable energy; and (v) inadequate capacity and
       knowledge in government agencies, private sector, and financial institutions that would
       finance renewable energy investments.

   (b) Solar water heating: A nascent market has emerged in large-scale solar water heaters
       suitable for commercial establishments such as hotels, hospitals, old age homes, and rural
       fish farms. N o official, bilateral, or international funds are involved inthese transactions.
       The mainbarriers to scale-up are as follows: (i) o frecognized industrybest practices,
                                                           lack
       standards, and codes; (ii)  potential customer's unfamiliarity with the technology; and (iii)
       potential customers' unease at doing business with suppliers and vendors that are often
       viewed as lacking adequate stature and backing, given their small scale and recently
       established status.


1.12    Assessment of Availability of Commercial Funds for Overall Renewable Energy
Development.An assessmenthasbeenmade o fthe interest, awareness, capacity, andexperience
o f South African financial organizations to finance the type o f renewable energy investments
requiredto meet the government's overall renewable energy target o f 10,000 GWhper year. This
assessmentwas based on the following:

    0 Discussions with three o f the four largest banking groups in South Africa-Absa,
      FirstRand,and Standard;




                                                    5

   0Discussions with three specialized public sector development finance organizations
    (DF1s)-the Central Energy Fund, the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA),
    and the IndustrialFinance Corporation;
    Reviews with each o f these institutions o f their arrangements, expectations, and issues for
    financing renewable energy investments o f the type that would be expected to be
    supported.

1.13 The main findings o fthe assessmentare as follows:

     Strong financial sector. South Africa has a sophisticated, deep, and broad financial
     sector. The IMF has characterized the sector as sound and well regulated, and as having
     demonstrated, based on the 2001 experience, that it can handle sharp currency
     depreciations.

   0 Strong interest in financing renewable energy projects. The six finance organizations
     surveyed confirmed their interest in renewable energy investments. All are currently
     getting ready-in     terms o f organization, staffing, research, and marketing-to    finance
     project investments for energy, including renewable energy. Energy is viewed as the
     "next bigwave" inSouth Africa and the regionby several financial institutions. The three
     banks have formed special energy units or have energy-specific staff capable o f
     structuring competitive finance services for energy projects, including debt and assistance
     with equity placements. The three specialized finance organizations have particular
     interests andcapabilities inthe energy sector, including renewable energy.

     Suitable financing packages can be made available. The maximum debt sizes would
     not be limiting for renewable energy investments in South Africa, as these investments
     are relatively small by local standards. Tenure o f debt of longer than seven years for the
     banks or ten years for the DFIs is a potential issue, although the South African financial
     sector has the capability to structure instruments for dealing with this. It is expected that
     the financial institutions will carefully scrutinize the quality o f the power off-take
     agreements, particularly for the financial strength o fthe buyer.

     Few renewable energy projects in the portfolio. Renewable energy is a relatively new
     interest for South Africa's financial sector. DBSA, for example, regards renewable
     energy as a potential area to provide debt financing. DBSA has a partnership agreement
     with the World Bank's Carbon Finance Unit for the identification o f potential Clean
     Development Mechanism (CDM) project that might qualify for carbon finance. To date,
     the DBSA has approved debt financing for two renewable energy projects-a             4 MW
     Bethlehem Hydro project and a 4.2 MW Biotherm landfill-gas-to-energy project-both
     with carbon financing. DBSA also provided debt financing for the National Pilot
     Demonstration Darling Wind Farm project in the Western Cape region. The banks and
     DFIs expect that the renewable energy portfolio will grow, given the demand and the
     policy o f attracting new sources o f generation.

2.      RATIONALE FORBANKINVOLVEMENT

2.1     The Bank has received a mandate from the G8 summit at Gleneagles to undertake a
Climate Change Initiative in G+5 countries - Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa.
Renewable energy i s one o f the priority areas for the clean energy work program, and the DME
has requested Bank's assistance to this program. The Clean Energy Investment Framework that
was recently endorsed by the Development Committee also highlighted the importance o f
renewable energy. In this project, the government intends to use the World Bank as a
"knowledge bank," and not as a lending institution, which is consistent with the overall
relationship between the government and the Bank in South Africa. Bank involvement in this
project will: (1) introduce international best practices and cutting-edge knowledge o f renewable
energy development, in particular renewable energy policy frameworks; (2) link this project to
Bank's overall power sector policy dialogue and climate change dialogue in South Africa; (3)
build local capacities; and (4) leverage public-private financing instruments such as "carbon
credit" financing.

2.2     This project i s closely coordinated with DANIDA, which supported Department o f
Minerals and Energy (DME) on renewable energy. The Bank's comparative advantage i s its
ability: (i) provide high-level technical support, such as that already provided infinalizing the
           to
government's white Paper on Renewable Energy; and (ii)           to mobilize significant amounts o f
carbon h d s for renewable energy development.

Rationalefor GEFFunding

2.3     The core rationale for GEF support is to mitigate barriers to renewable energy
development inSouth Africa. The key role o f GEF inthis project i s to provide grant co-financing
TA that wouldjumpstart the move towards the 10,000 GWhtarget byremoving the mainbarriers
listed above. GEF will not finance the renewable energy investments itself, as South Africa has
the financial capability to raise significant resources both in the domestic and international
markets to finance renewable projects.

2.4     Furthermore, the project sets inplace a structure that will continue to support renewable
energy development beyond the current 10,000 GWh target. This structure consists o f a new
policy and regulatory framework, and improved institutional capacity in the DME and various
stakeholder agencies. Undoubtedly, this structure will needto evolve over time, but this can take
place without external support, given SouthAfrica's generally strong institutional capacity.

2.5     The technical feasibility o f achieving this target was assessed in a study during project
preparation, which developed a "cost supply curve" o f renewable energy. The study examined
specific projects in different sources o f renewable energy, such as bagasse cogeneration, solar
water heating, pulp and paper, wind, and small hydro. The supply curve derived inthis study i s
showing below inFigure 1. The estimated least-cost supply for the first 10,000 GWh shows that:

   0  Windis not part o fthe first 10,000 GWh
   0  All o f the landfill gas potential is within the first 10,000 GWh (and occupies a significant
      portion o fthe first 1,000 GWh)



                                                   7

       The balance o f the 10,000 GWhtarget i s made up of commercial solar water heating, small
       hydro, pulp & paper, and the sugar industry.

2.6     This supply curve should not be interpreted to mean that all the potential of a particular
renewable resource will be fully used up by the GWhattributedto it. For example, the 240 GWh
contribution o f landfill gas (LFG) is from seven "identified projects" that have been studied in
detail, andthe additional contribution o f 600 GWh is from 57 sites that have been studied inless
detail. A very conservative approach was adopted for these 57 sites, and it is quite possible that
the true potential is twice the estimated amount. A similar conservative approach has beenused
for the other resources as well.

2.7     The detailed contribution of each renewable energy source towards the 10,000 GWh
target is shown intable 1.

3.     HIGHER-LEVEL       OBJECTIVESTO WHICH THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES

3.1    South Africa, being one o f the most significant emitters o f carbon dioxide (COz) in the
developing word, considering the size o f its economy and its heavy reliance on coal-based
energy generation, faces greater challenges than other countries in dealing with climate change.
This project will assist the government inimplementing its White Paper on Renewable Energy,
and meeting the 10,000 GWh target, which will contribute to mitigation o f GHG emissions in
South Africa. This project is consistent with the proposed 2007 Country Partnership Strategy,
focused on "fostering social and environmental sustainability" in previous 1999 Country
Assistance Strategy. It i s also coherent to the Bank's mandate from the G8 Summit at Gleneagles
to undertake a Climate Change Initiative inG+5 countries.


B.     PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.     LENDING    INSTRUMENT

1.1    This project does not involve any Bank lending. It will provide only GEF funds, which
will be used for technical assistance. Outside this project, renewable energy investments will be
financed by a combination of: (i)     private equity and commercial debt; and (ii) funds.
                                                                                   carbon
Keepingcarbon credit financing outside the project will provide full flexibility to all interested
buyers to negotiate each renewable energy investment on its own merit.


2.     PROJECTDEVELOPMENT           OBJECTIVE AND KEY INDICATORS

Project DevelopmentObjective

2.1    The project development objective is to establish policy and regulatory frameworks and
build institutional capacity for renewable energy development in South Africa. The global


                                                   9

environmental objective, in line with GEF Operational Program No. 6, is to remove the barriers
to renewable energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The specific
strategic priority is under climate change priority No. 4: to promote on-grid electricity from
renewable sources.

2.2     The principal outcomes o f the project will be (i)  the establishment o f the policy and
regulatory frameworks and institutional capacity required for meeting the government's
renewable energy target, and (ii)an established commercial solar water heating (CSWH)
industry. Interms o f the government's ultimate objective, the project will significantly increase
the likelihood o f meeting and going beyond the 10,000 GWh target, towards which there would
be little progress inthe absence o fthis project.

Key Indicators

2.3     This project provides TA and capacity building, that is, it will not finance investments,
with the exception o f limitedsupport for capacity buildinganddemonstrative subprojects o f the
CSWH industry. Thus, indicators linkedto investments, power generation, and C02 inrenewable
energy other than CSWH are outside the scope of the project. However, in order to assist the
Government of South Africa inmeasuring progress towards its overall renewable energy target,
it has been decided to monitor some additional indicators that are outside the scope o f the
project.


Project key indicators

2.4     The project indicators for the renewable energy Dower generation component are as
follows:

        Legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks for grid-based renewable energy power prepared
        by the government and electricity regulator and submitted for government approval by
        December 31,2009
        Databasefor renewable energy resource available
        Number o f potential developers for renewable energy power generation assisted and
        number o fpre-feasibility studies prepared
        Knowledge about renewable energy increased in relevant government agencies, private
        sector, andfinancial institutions

        The project indicators for the CSWH component are as follows:

        Industrystandardsandcodes formulated
        Number o f commercial solar water heaters installed
        Fossil fuel-based power generation avoided
        InvestmentsinCSWH systems

3.       PROJECT COMPONENTS

3.1      The project has two components (see table 2):

              1. Renewables-based Dower generation in South Africa: Technical assistance (TA)
                  and capacity buildingwill eliminate the barriers identifiedabove.
              2. Commercial solar water heating: Focusing only on the commercial segment
                  (which complements a UNDP-GEFproject focused on the residential' segment),
                  TA and capacity buildingwill address the barriers identified above. Inparticular,
                  a "participating CSWH company program" will be created that would enhance the
                  companies' credibility, as they would agree to observe the conditions o f the
                  program (including performance verifications o f installed systems) in exchange
                  for some performance-based grants for demonstrative subprojects in the initial
                  stages o f the project.




  Project implementation period.

  2.       This project i s expectedto leverage $ 9.00 million from the private sector for investment inCSWH
  systems sold under this project. As such, this leveraged fund cannot be committed inthe same manner as
  Government or donor funds. However, unlike inmany other countries, South Africa's financial markets have the
  required motivation and capability to provide funds o f this magnitude.

'CSWH     systems range instorage capacity 5,000 to 50,000 liters, whereas the capacity o f residential systems i s
200-300 liters. Some o fthe mainend-users o f CSWHsystems include hotels, hostels, hospitals, fish farms, and
flatdapartment blocks.

Component A: RenewableEnergy Power Generation

3.2      For renewable energy power generation, the project will assist South Afiica in
strengthening the organizations and institutions that would help the government meet its
renewable energy target. The capacity areas include development o f legal and policy
frameworks, promotion, regulation, and service provision o f renewable energy power generation.
The agencies would cover DME, NERSA, andpotential project sponsors and financiers. Details
are given intable 3.

3.3      Sub-Component 1. Policy and Regulatorv Framework: This sub-component will develop
legal, policy and regulatory framework, taking account o f the experience with promoting grid-
connected renewable energy power generation in both developed and developing countries,
particularly the feed-in laws, renewable energy portfolio standards, and competitive tendering
(see Annex 15 for details). The project will also adopt a mandated market policy that i s
appropriate for South Africa to achieve the renewable energy target and reduce costs. Currently,
the South African government i s contemplating to adopt a feed-in tariff scheme to promote
renewable energy. This project will assist the government in developing a detailed design o f the
feed-in tariff policy and development o f a draft Renewable Energy Law. It will include the
following four sub-components:

         (a) 1.1Reviewing renewable energy policy instruments and financing mechanisms o f
             successful renewable energy programs worldwide, and recommending their adoption
             to SouthAfrica;

         (b) 1.2 Supporting DME and NERSA to develop a legal, policy, and remlatorv
                            -
             framework for renewable energy;

         (c) 1.3 Developing detailed financing mechanisms for covering the incremental cost
             between renewable and conventional energy; and

         (d) 1.4 Updatingresource-specific supplv curves interms of the renewable energy target
             set in the government's WhitePaper on Renewable Energy, all through the provision
             o ftechnical advisory services.

3.4      Sub-Component 2. Capacity Building: This sub-component will carry out capacity
building activities to strengthenthe relevant public and private sector institutions, andto enable
them to meet the renewable energy power generation target. It will build capacity for
government agencies such as DME andNERSA, as well as industries and financial institutions.
It also will set up a Help Desk to provide advisory services and matching grants for project
developers to conduct pre-feasibility studies to facilitate private sector investment in renewable
energy. The TA provided by this project i s expected to leverage significant private sector funds.
It will includethe following three sub-components:

         (a) 2.1 Developing public and private sector institutional capacitv for renewable energy
            investments;




                                               12

       (b) 2.2 Developing resource information and dissemination of renewable energy related
           information; and

       (c) 2.3 Provision o f Matching Grants to strengthen the capacity o f the private sector to
           implement renewable energy Subprojects, and development o f a "help desk",
           including: (i)  facilitating activities for renewable energy investments; (ii)preparing
           pre-feasibility studies for renewable energy investments; and (iii)facilitating
           activities for promotion o f off-grid renewable energy.

3.5    As a result o f the TA, it is expected that inthe four-year project implementation period,
renewable energy projects will be undertaken in conversion o f landfill gas to electricity, sugar
mill and pulp & paper cogeneration, and small hydro power generation. The total renewable
generation capacity installed i s expected to be about 100-135 MW (yielding about 600-800
GWh) with a capital cost o fUS$90-120 million.

3.6    These investments will be financed outside this project by the private sector, with a small
amount o f government subsidies. Insome cases, the financial viability o f these investments will
be enhanced by carbon financing, such as those provided by the Bank's carbon fimds, but this
does not reduce the need for upfront financing o f capital costs, as these funds are paid only after
the electricity is actuallyproduced.

ComponentB. CommercialSolar Water Heating

3.7    CSWH is an integral component o f South Africa's renewable energy policy framework.
However, it i s important to recognize that solar water heating i s a substitute for all types o f
power generation, whereas renewable energy power generation is a substitute for fossil fuel
power generation. As a result, solar water heating transactions are not linked to transmitting
power over the main power grid, and there i s no need to involve the grid operator (Eskom) in
promoting this resource.

3.8    Sub-Component 3. Capacity Building: The sub-component will provide TA and capacity
buildingto professional, technical, and business groups inkey market segments and companies
engaged in selling CSWH systems and services. This project will not support any renewable
energy resource other than CSWH. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1, CSWH companies are
expected to contribute significantly towards the target o f 10,000 GWh. The reason for singling
out CSWH for inclusion in this project i s that this resource i s near-commercial, and does not
require significant subsidies. As such, it is suitable for GEF support aimed at reducing the
barriers facing this resource. It will include the following two sub-components:

       (a) 3.1 Carrying out activities to support the development o f the solar water heating
            industrv to international best practice levels through technical assistance in
            developing standards and codes for CSWH, promotion campaigns, andtraining.

       (b) 3.2 Provision o f Matching Grants and Performance Grants to Eligible Beneficiaries,
            to establish a program for small and medium size private enterprises to design and
            implement CSWH Subprojects including: (i)        develop CSWH business development
            activities; (ii)improve performance in installation o f systems; and (iii) themeet

        requirements for a code o f conduct for use o f best practice indesigns, equipment and
        installation, transparent and credible practices in dealing with consumers. This sub-
        component will establish a "participating CSWH company program", which will
        assist the companies in a variety o f ways on an as-needed basis. Company program
        assistance will include the following: securing certifications that companies'
        equipment meets standards; conducting independent installation and performance
        verifications o f demonstrative subprojects to increase customer confidence;
        facilitating equipment performance guarantees in case this should be needed initially;
        providing co-finance performance grants for design, installation, or improvement; and
        monitoring and documentation o f systems that are deemed to be demonstrative or
        path-breaking. Inreturn, the participating companies will agree to meet the program's
        code o fbehavior and risk suspension incase they fail to meet the conduct code. These
        features will significantly improve the companies' status and make them more
        credible to their potential customers and lenders.

3.9 Supporting the implementation o f Component A and B o f the Project, including:

    (a) 4.1 Conducting due diligence on specific renewable energv investment that would be
        supported by DME;

    (b) 4.2 Monitoring and evaluation of progress towards achieving the renewable energy

 4.      LESSONS   LEARNED REFLECTEDINTHEPROJECTDESIGN
                             AND

 4.1     Since there has been no significant experience with renewable energy power generation
 insub-SaharanAfrica, the only available lessons are from experience inother parts oftheworld.
 GEF-one o f the prime supporters o f renewable energypower generation-recently       sponsored a
 forum that reviewed the worldwide experience on grid-connected renewable energypolicies. The
main lessons derived are discussed below and Annex 15 listed detailed lessons learned from
other countries.

4.2      Twenty-five years of experience with successful renewable energy programs
demonstrates that the implementationo f an enabling environment o f legal, policy, andregulatory
frameworks to attract large-scale capital investments i s instrumental to scaling up renewable
energy. Such frameworks should ensure fair and open grid access and long-term stable tariffs for
Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Long-term price predictability through long-term power
purchase agreements (PPAs) with transparent and adequate pricing is the most important factor
to attract investors.

4.3      Based on successful renewable energyprograms around the world, three major mandated
marketpolicyoptions to promoterenewable energyare operatingto date inthe marketplace:

    (a) Price-based feed-in laws, which require mandatory purchase o f renewable energy at a
         fixed price. These are usedinGermany, Spain, and France.

    (b) Quantity-based renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS), which require that a
         minimumshare o fpower or aminimumlevel o finstalled capacity ina given regionmust
        be met by renewable energy. These are used in Australia, Denmark, Italy, the
        Netherlands, and some U.S. states.

    (c) A tendering mechanism, which involves government-sponsored competitive bidding
        processes for the acquisition o frenewable electricity. Long-term contracts are awarded to
         lowest priced projects. This i s used in the British Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation, Ireland,
         and California.

4.4     All three mandated market policies ensure the right for the power suppliers to recover
incremental costs o f renewable energy from consumers, and to be able to connect to the grid.
Eachapproach has its own advantages and disadvantages.

4.5     Feed-in laws produce highpenetration rates in a short period, create local manufacturing
opportunities, provide strong incentives for private investments, and can be cost effective if the
tariff is periodically and wisely adjusted. To date, feed-in laws have demonstrated the highest
installation rates for renewable energy and are considered most desirable by investors given their
price certainty. RPS are good at reducing cost and price with competitive bidding, yet tend to
favor least-cost technologies and established industry players unless separate technology targets
or tenders are put in place. They are also more complex to design and administer than feed-in
laws. Tendering policies are effective at reducing cost, but ensuring that signed contracts are
realizedi s a key challenge.



                                                16

4.6     The types o f instruments selected should be based on objectives, country conditions, and
power sector structure. There is no single solution. The effectiveness o f a particular policy will
rely on how well it i s designed and enforced.

4.7     A range o f financial incentives exists to level the playing field for renewable energy
investments. These incentives can decrease upfront capital costs through subsidies, reduce
CapitaVoperating costs through tax credits, improve revenue streams with carbon credits, and
provide financial support via loans and guarantees. Experience demonstrates that output-based
incentives are generally preferable to investment-based incentives for grid-connected renewable
energy. This is because the investment-based mechanisms do not necessarily provide incentives
to generate electricity or maintain the performance o f the renewable energy plants once they are
installed, whereas the output-based incentives promote the desired outcome-generation o f
electricity from renewable energy.

4.8     The most frequent approaches for covering the incremental cost o f renewable energy and
the funding o f the various policy measures are passing the costs onto consumers through a
systems benefits charge (SBC), imposing a carbon tax on fossil fuel, and setting up a dedicated
fundfinanceddirectly bythe government or with donor support.

4.9     Project design fully reflects these lessons: the regulatory framework to be developed will
create the appropriate incentives and market signals, and capacity building will be provided to
various actors inthe supply chains for renewable energy generation.

4.10    Furthermore, lessons learned from the Bank's experience in South Africa have also been
reflected inthe project design. As South Africa is a sophisticated client, the Bank's interventions
in South Africa should be demand-driven, bring value added services, buildlocal capacity, and
act as a "knowledge bank".


5.      ALTERNATIVESCONSIDEREDAND REASONSFORREJECTION

 5.1    For renewable energy, the conventional approach o f the Bank, including GEF, of
 financing renewable energy power generation investments, was rejected. In other words, unlike
most renewable energy projects where the Bank and/or GEF finance both TA and investments,
this project supports only TA. South Africa has well-developed private and financial sectors.
Project developers have access to both domestic and international financial market to finance
investment in renewable energy. However, the current main barriers to renewable energy
development in South Africa are lack o f regulatory frameworks and limited local capacity to
identify and develop renewable energy projects. Therefore, this project will only provide TA to
remove these barriers. As a result, an improved enabling environment and local capacity are
 expected to leverage private sector investment.

C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1.      PARTNERSHIPARRANGEMENTS

RelatedOngoingActivities

 1.1    There are some ongoing activities related to renewable energy development in South
Africa, as follows:


   0  Development o f power generation proiects. The adoption o f the White Paper on
      Renewable Energy has stirred some interest in the private sector in developing suitable
      projects. This interest has been whetted by the possibility o f obtaining external carbon
      funds, following the government's approval o f the Kyoto Protocol. These projects, which
      are in advanced stages o f development, are special cases in the sense that there are unique
      underlying factors. For example, the Durban landfill-gas-to-electricity project i s for own
      use; that is, not for sale to the main grid, for which there are no market rules so far.

   0  Government subsidies. The government has established a Renewable Energy Subsidy Fund
      (about US$500,000-$700,000 per year), managedby DME, to subsidize suitable renewable
      energy power projects. The purpose is to get some experience with the nature o f the
      projects that are likely to emerge inthe future and get an estimate o fthe extent o f subsidies
      that would be required to reach the 10,000 GWh target. As explained in Table 2, the
      government has committed the majority o f this SubsidyFundas co-funding to this project.

   0  DANIDA capacity building in energy efficiency and renewable energy. This DANIDA
      project has recommended market rules for renewable energy in South Africa, developed a
      cost-supply curve for renewable energy development, and conducted a renewable energy
      resource assessmentthat focuses on solar, biomass, andhydro. This GEF project builds on
      the DANIDA study recommendations to assist the government in developing a detailed
      legal, policy, and regulatory framework for renewable energy. Resource assessment under
      this project will primarily focus on compilation o f existing renewable energy resource
      information ina database andmapping to make it available for private developers.

      UNDP/GEF solar water heaters for low-income housing in ueri-urban areas. This UNDP
      project aims to support a solar water heater business plan in South Africa in order to
      overcome market barriers for widespread use o f residential solar water heaters. To
      complement this UNDP project, this proposed GEF project will only support commercial
      solar water heaters.

1.2    Annex 4 also describes indetail the UNDP/GEFSouth Africa Wind Energy Project, and
proposed coordination mechanisms with UNDP and DANIDA. In addition, it i s expected that,
outside this project, carbon funds will help finance renewable energy investments.

2.     INSTITUTIONALAND IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

2.1    The DBSA will be the implementing agent for this project. A Memorandum o f
Understanding (Mow will be entered into betweenDME and DBSA for the purposes o f spelling
out the overall implementation arrangements under which DBSA will act as the implementing
agent o f DME. Furthermore, for the purposes o f carrying out the agreed activities in the MoU,
DBSA wouldbe contracted for services by DMEpursuant to Bank guidelines.

2.2    DBSA is a well-established agency that has considerable expertise inboth financing and
managing development projects. In recent years, DBSA has taken an interest in promoting
renewable energy investments. DBSA is familiar with World Bank procedures and does not face
constraints in areas such as financial management and procurement. Although DBSA does not
have extensive in-house capacity on renewable energy, this i s not a constraint as DBSA will set
up anISUandhire(mainly local) consultants inimplementingthis project.

2.3    A Steering Committee (SC) to be appointed by DMEwill oversee the project. The SC
will be responsible for monitoring project implementation and identifyingactions to ensure that
it proceeds in a timely and efficient manner. The SC will consist o f five members: (i)  Deputy
Director General o f Hydrocarbon, Energy Planning, and Clean Energy, DME as its Chair; (ii)
Chief Director, Clean Energy, DME; (iii)     Director, New and Renewable Energy, DME; (iv)
National Energy Regulator o f South Africa (NERSA); and (v) Central Energy Fund (CEF). The
SC will meet at least twice every year. The SC may also expand to include technical expert(s) in
renewable energy andprivate sector representative(s), as required.

2.4    The SC will provide overall advice and guidance to the project, and ensure
recommendations made by the project will be incorporated in policy and regulatory frameworks
and implemented. The SC will facilitate good coordination between the different agencies
involved in scaling-up renewable energy implementation. The SC shall discuss and approve
progress reports, changes inproject implementation, and other items as may be requested by the
DME. The SC shall monitor that proper quality assurance of the outputs is carried out by the
Renewable Energy Market Transformation (REMT) project staff. The SC will guide and follow
the development o f the project according to the implementation schedule, and cause periodic
progress reports to be submitted, including use o f funds, to the Bank andDME.

2.5    The SC will form a working group o f designated staff to provide close supervision and
guidance to the project team during implementation. The SC may also decide to establish an
advisory board or use other mechanisms to present and share ideas with key external
stakeholders in the implementation process. The stakeholders will include different sections
within the renewable energy power generation and CSWH communities (for example,
consumers, academic, finance, consulting engineers, NGOs, project developers/owners, and
Eskom).

2.6    The DBSA will establish an I S Uto manage day-to-day activities during the four years o f
the REMT project implementation. The ISU will be responsible for carrying out the various
project activities-that  is, the policy and institutional framework, capacity building, and
implementation activities. As such the I S U will also be handling quality assurance and progress
reporting. The I S Uwill also be responsible for administering the performance grants for CSWH


                                                19

subprojects and the matching grants for renewable energy and CSWH capacity-building
activities. The private sector will be responsible for implementing all the investments supported
under this project.

2.7     The I S U will be headed by an international Project Coordinator, who will lead the
implementation activities o f the REMT project and will be responsible for the substantive work
for renewable energy policy and institutional framework development and capacity building. In
addition, the I S U will also consist o f a business support manager, who will be a national
consultant and i s responsible for implementing the Help Desk to guide project developers for
both renewable energy power generation and CSWH, and one support staff. Existing DME staff
will be allocated to provide close supervision and guidance to the project team during
implementation. Short-term consultants and advisors will provide services on an as-neededbasis.

2.8     The Agencies Unit within DBSA is responsible for procurement, financial management,
disbursement, budgeting, accounting, treasury services, and corporate services such as human
resources management, legal advisory services, and so forth.

2.9     The direct stakeholders involvedinthis project are as follows:

    a   DME:overallresponsibilityfor thisproject
    a   NERSA: responsible for regulating the power sector, and will be assisted by the project

3. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomeshtesults

3.1             The overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation will be with DME; the day-to-
day responsibility will be with the I S U overseen by DBSA. DBSA i s well-suited to undertake
this type o f work and will hire additional consultants as needed. The costs o f this activity have
been includedintables 2 and 3.

3.2             The ISU will submit regular reports to DME, which will include all the information
necessary for managers and policymakers to assess the project's effectiveness.

3.3            The monitoring and evaluation system will consist o f four parts and, to the extent
feasible, will be integrated in the preparatory activities for the mid-term review o f the White
Paper:




                                                                                                 21

        magnitude, and performance o f the systems involved (including investments and power
        generation avoided); the customers' views about their systems; and the overall activities
        o fthe participatingcompanies.
    (c) Monitoring renewable energy Dower peneration: Key information will be collected about
        the nature, magnitude, and performance o f the installations involved, including
        investments andpower generation.

        part o fthe TA activities under the project, andwill beused to assist the government inits
        mid-tem evaluation o f its overall target.


4.      SUSTAINABILITY AND REPLICABILITY

Sustainability

4.1     South Africa's commitment to renewable energy i s shown by the white Paper on
Renewable Energy, and there i s little risk that the policy framework supported by this project
will not be developed.

4.2     There is limited concern about the sustainability o f the investments undertaken either
under this project or within the framework developed by the project. This i s because the
investmentswould be installed and financed mainly by private sector entrepreneurs, who would
have a clear incentive to maintain and sustain their individual investments.

4.3     However, there are some concerns about South Africa's ability to achieve its long-term
target o f 10,000 GWh, even ifthe framework is successfully developed. The main source o f this
concern i s the low cost o f generating coal-based power in South Africa, which makes it difficult
for renewable energy to be competitive. As a result, local or external finds are required to
support renewable energy investments. Long-term sustainability depends upon the following: (i)
future increases in Eskom's costs, arising from the need to add generation capacity; (ii)
reductions in renewable energy costs, arising from economy o f scale; and (iii)the continued
availability of an adequate level o f local and global carbon finds.

4.4     As mentioned in Section Al, given the current severe power shortages in South Africa,
Eskomplansto expand power capacity to meet growing demand. According to NERSA, the power
tariff for newly built power plants has increased to 3.6-4.3      U.S. centsikwh. With additional
revenue streams from carbon financing, some renewable energy technologies can be financially
viable at this tariff level. In addition, based on the recommendations made from the DANIDA
study, the government currently plans to adopt a mandatory feed-in tariff and a voluntary green
electricity trading scheme to promoterenewable energy development.

4.5     It is expected that increased government h d s to support renewable energy investments
would become available inthe future. First, a track record would be established that would show



                                                  22

that renewable energy investments can be successfilly financed and undertaken in South Africa,
and the extent o f the grants required would also be clear. This would make it easier to
incorporate such grants into the budgetaryprocess. Second, it i s expected that other high-priority
subsidized energy activities such as rural electrification will reach their end in the fiture, thus
creating additional fiscal space for renewable energy. However, there i s no assurance that these
events will actually take place, with the implication that future government funds to support
renewable energy are not assured.

4.6     It is also expected that carbon finds will be available to support renewable energy inthe
future. While current indications are that such funds will be available, their actual availability
will depend upon various factors beyond both o f this project and the Government o f South
Africa. Much will depend upon how various international agreements, such as the Kyoto
Protocol, are actually implemented, and how risky the international community views
investments in South Africa. Thus, there is no assurance that external funds will be available in
the long-term.


Replicability

4.7     After the legal, policy, and regulatory framework for renewable energy is put inplace and
institutional capacity is strengthened through this project, it is expected that this project will
leverage significant private sector investment to scale up renewable energy development in
South Africa. There i s clear potential for long-term growth o f the CSWH in both the retrofit
,market as well as the new opportunities opened by the growth o fthe economy.

4.8     Outside South Africa, the framework developed in this project would also be applicable
in other countries throughout Africa, as well as in other parts of the world. At present, an
increasing number o f developing countries are developing renewable energy legal and policy
frameworks, and this project canbe replicatedinother developing countries.


5.      CRITICAL R I S K S AND POSSIBLE CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS

5.1     The project has no significant risks and appears to be largely non-controversial, as the
project will primarily provide technical assistance and capacity building to local stakeholders in
South Africa, and the implementing agencies are well-established and suitable for the job. The
Project has beenrated as a Category C project under the Bank's safeguard policies. The principal
risks, their ratings, and related mitigation measures are as follows:

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.      ECONOMICAND FINANCIALANALYSIS

1.1     The economic and financial analysis examined a sample o f potential projects for each
renewable energy technology-small         hydro, sugar bagasse, wind, pulp and paper industry,
landfill gas, and solar water heating-to     reach the 10,000 GWh target set in the government's
White Paper for Renewable Energy. Therefore, REMT can proceed with some confidence that
there are viable renewable energy project transactions that will be taken up by the private sector
inresponseto the market transformationactivitiesplannedfor REMT.

1.2     The economic and financial analysis follows a renewable energy cost supply curve
approach, as shown inFigure 1, based on a detailed economic and financial analysis o f a sample
o f projects to meet the government's target o f 10,000 GWh per year. This approach i s
particularly appropriate to a sector where the bulk o f the projects are expected to be undertaken
in the private sector, structured either as non-recourse financed IPPs or under balance sheet
financing by large corporations (e.g. as inpulp andpaper).

1.3     While economic analysis shows a project to be economically attractive, based on
economic costs and benefits measured by avoided generation costs o f long-run marginal costs
(LRMC), financial returns can be insufficient for implementation by the private sector. This is
because traditional financial analysis, based on discounted cash-flow accounting, undervalues
future price risks o f fossil fuels and completely ignores the environmental and health costs o f
fossil-fueled power plant emissions. As a result, the current utilization o f modern renewable
energy (excluding traditional biomass use) in many countries i s quite small. Given the market
distortion that environmental externalities and diversification values are not recognized in the
market place, together with a series o f market bamers, financial incentives are required in the
form of higher level o f tariff, government subsidy, concessional loans from development banks,
andvarious forms o f public-private partnerships to attract investors to achieve the economically
viable optimum quantityo frenewable energy.

1.4     The economic and financial analysis demonstrated that, with the exception o f wind, it
was possible to find viable projects for all the resources. The analysis shows that it i s feasible to
reach the government's target o f 10,000 GWh with relatively small amounts o f carbon finance.
The analysis also shows that the only resource where carbon finance increases the returns
significantly i s landfillgas; inother cases, carbon finance will play mainly a catalytic role. Table
1 shows the technology mix and supply potential from each technology to reach government's
target o f 10,000 GWh.

EconomicAnalysis

1.5     A standard economic analysis was undertaken for each sample project. NPV and
economic rate o f return (ERR) are calculated, and benefits o f avoided energy measured by
LRMC are calculated. ERR is calculated both with and without environmental benefits. In
economic analysis, avoided greenhouse gas emissions are valued at the reported carbon finance




                                                 25

transaction price for the Durban Landfill gas project as the proxy for global willingness to pay
for SouthAfrica's carbonreductions.

 1.6    The analysis identified a numbero f candidate projects to be financedby the private sector
under REMT. The calculated ERRSwith environmental benefits range from 13 percent to 24
percent for small hydro projects, 15 percent to 38 percent for sugar bagasse projects, 18 percent
for a pulp andpaper project, and 31 percent to 34 percent for landfillgas projects.

 1.7    An economic analysis o f a CSWH systemwas conducted (see Annex 9 for details). In
this analysis, the economic costs are the current costs prevailing in South Africa. It i s
expected that costs will decline in the future as the scale o f the market increases. There are
two types o f benefits:

        Local: Since the use o f CSWH instead o f conventional electricity i s a form o f "fuel
        switching," the benefits are the costs avoided by switching; that is, the economic cost
        of the electricity saved. Inthe CSWH case, this consists o f the generation plus network
       costs, and in South Africa, Eskom's tariff i s the best available indicator o f these costs.
       For simplicity, the "demand charge" and the "energy charge" have been rolled into a
        single cost per kWh. It i s estimated that this combined charge i s 25 rand cents (3.62
       U.S. cents) per kWh. The economic cost o f generation is expected to increase in the
       next 3-5 years when Eskom would have to add generation capacity to meet peak
       demand.

    0  Global: The market value o f the carbon emission reductions (CERs) i s a measure o f
       global benefits, even though it i s recognized that, inpractice, it i s not yet feasible to sell
       these CERs because o f hightransaction costs. The CER price is estimated to beUS$4/ton
       of c02.

1.8    The economic analysis shows that, at today's CSWH costs and power tariffs, the CSWH
systems are marginally attractive, with an internal rate o f return o f 14 percent based only local
benefits, and 17 percent on adding global benefits. This is consistent with the low level o f
CSWH market penetration, andindicates that CSWH cost reductions are necessary to make them
more attractive to individual end-users as well as the economy as a whole.

Financial Analysis
1.9    A standard financial model to calculate financial internal rate o f return (FIRR) has been
developed. The financial analysis i s conducted from the perspective o f the implementing entity,
and the calculated FIRR is therefore a function o f the capital structure assumed. Inaddition, the
projects to be financed will be screened by private promoters, commercial lenders, external
carbon fund financiers, and in some cases government agencies. The private sector will only
invest commercially feasible projects. The financial analysis identified a number o f financially
viable small hydro, sugar bagasse, pulp and paper, and landfill gas projects, which can be
financed bythe private sector under REMT.

2.      TECHNICAL

2.1     The project itself does not feature any significant technical issues, apart from the
investments in the CSWH component. These investments will meet the technical standards
established in SouthAfrica.


3.      FIDUCIARY

3.1     Disbursements from the Grant will be made on the basis o f interim financial reports
(IFRs). DBSA understands that this approach relies on comprehensive reports generated from its
financial management system rather than the transaction based approach DBSA i s currently
using for the ongoing Bank-supported projects. Resources will need to be made available to
ensure timely reporting and accuracy o f information.

3.2     Project financial management will be overseen by the existing DBSA Finance
Department, who will be responsible for receiving and reviewing the completeness and
appropriateness o f invoices and other requests for payment. The actual capture and settlement o f
those invoices will be made by and through the existing DBSA payments system. While the
DBSA has its own existing "Administrative and Accounting Procedures Manual," it will prepare
an appropriate update or other version to incorporate the new positions and arrangements for the
REMTISU. This update or separate versionwill be circulatedto the Bank for comment.

3.3     The Grant Agreement will require the submission o f audited financial statements to the
Bank within six months after the financial year-end. The financial statements will consist o f the
following: (i) Statement of Sources and Uses ofFunds that recognizes all cash receipts, cash
               A
payments, and cash balances controlled by the project; (ii)The Designated Account
Reconciliation; and (iii)The Accounting Policies Adopted and Explanatory Notes. The
explanatory notes should be presented in a systematic manner with items on the Statement of
Sources and Uses being cross-referenced to any related information in the notes. Examples o f
this information include the following: (i)a summary o f fixed assets by category o f assets; (ii)
copies o f IFRs; and (iii)a Management Assertion that Bank funds have been expended in
accordance with the intendedpurposes as specified inthe relevant World Bank legal agreement.

3.4     The internal audit at DBSA is in-house. For the DBSA, the external audit will be carried
out annually by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG). The external audit will cover all
World Bank funds and counterpart funds at all levels o f project execution. The auditor will be
required to express an opinion on the audited project financial statements only, in compliance
with International Standards on Auditing (IFACANTOSAI pronouncements), and submit the
audit report within six months o f the end o f the financial year. Inaddition, detailed management
letters will be prepared and submitted to management for follow-up. These letters will contain
the auditor's assessment o f the internal controls, accounting system, and compliance with
financial covenants in the Grant Agreement, and suggestions for improvement. Although the
Bank is satisfied with the Auditor General Standards, the agreed audit terms o f reference will
need to be reviewed for compliance with the requirements o f the Bank.




                                                 27

3.5      Financial management supervision will be carried out regularlyby the Bank's Financial
Management Specialist (FMS) at least once a year. The FMS will conduct financial management
supervision shortly after project effectiveness. The FMS will also review the annual Audit
Reports and Management Letters from the external auditors and follow up on material
accountability issues by engaging with the Bank's Task Team Leader for REMT, the DME,
DBSA, and/or auditors.

4.       SOCIAL

4.1      This project itself does not pose any significant social issues. However, there is evidence
that some o f the investments financed under the framework developed by this project may raise
significant social issues, which i s not unusual for power generation projects. These issues will be
addressed during the course o f each such generation projects, which will all have to meet the
well-established South African guidelines for these types o f projects; these guidelines are
acceptable to the Bank.

5.       ENVIRONMENT

5.1     This project itself does not raise any significant environmental issues. Any environmental
issues raised by some o f the investments financed under the framework developed by this project
will be addressedduringthe course o f each such generation projects, which will all have to meet
the well-established South African guidelines for these types o f projects; these guidelines are
acceptable to the Bank.

6.      SAFEGUARD POLICIES

 6.1    The project is not expected to present any environmental or social risk. Solar water
heating is not a "listed activity" with respect to South Afiican environmental requirements, and
therefore would not be subject to the environmental screening or environmental assessment
process. Since the project does not involve any land taking, and the only construction will be
within the perimeter o f existing institutional, commercial, or industrial establishments (and in

fact, mostly on rooftops), no social safeguards are expected to be triggered. Therefore, the
project has been ratedas a "C" (no environmental or social safeguard impact).


7.      POLICY EXCEPTIONS READINESS
                            AND

7.1     The project complies with all World Bank applicable policies and no exceptions are
necessary. The Project Procurement Plan for consultants' services has been reviewed by the
Bank and is ready for the start of Project implementation. DME has prepared TORSfor the
Project Steering Committee, Project Coordinator, and MoU between DME and DBSA who acts
as the implementing agent for DME.

 COUNTRY AND SECTORISSUES

 1.      Overall economic conditions. South Africa's economic performance during the first
 decade o f freedom has been impressive on several counts. Sound macroeconomic policies and
 strong fiscal discipline contributed to the 3 percent average annual growth duringthe first decade
 after 1994. Recent economic performance has also been strong. Real GDP growth reached 4.9
 percent in 2005 and 4.6 percent in 2006, employment has risen, and inflation has remained
 within the target band for over two and a half years. Foreign debt is low and overall borrowing
 has been brought below 40 percent o f GDP. The fiscal deficit fell from 1.5 percent o f GDP in
FY2004/05 to 0.3 percent in FY2005/06, reflecting buoyant revenues. Owing to large capital
 inflows, international reserves continued to rise.'


2.      South Africa contributes 40 percent o f Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP-its nine largest cities
 alone account for about 24 percent o f Africa's GDP. Growth spillovers to the rest o f the
continent are exceptionally large by international standards: an additional percentage point o f
South African growth i s associated with 0.5 to 0.75 percent GDP growth increases inthe rest o f
Africa, independent o f common regional shocks.

3.      Energy and Environmental Issues. South Africa is one o f the few countries in the
world that heavily relies on coal to meet its energy needs, with 75% o f total energy consumption
from coal in 2004. It i s the world's sixth largest coal producers, 90% o f which was used for
electricity generation and the synthetic fuel industry. As a result, South Africa has high
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the largest contributor inAfrica.

4.      Power sector. South Africa has a well-developed power sector, with a total installed
capacity o f 42 GW and a total electricity production o f 244,607 GWh in 2004, which is
predominantly coal-fired (92%), and includes nuclear (5%), hydro (2%), as well as solar,
biomass, and gas (1%). South Africa accounted for 45% o f the total power produced in all o f
Africa. The generation and transmission o f power i s concentrated in the hands o f Eskom, the
vertically integrated state-owned utility. Eskom i s also the largest singledistributor inthe country
interms o fenergy sales for final consumptionandnumber ofcustomers, althoughthere are more
than400 other distributors, mainly municipal electricity departments that also supplyelectricity to
end customers. While Eskom is widely recognized as a world-class power utility (electricity
prices inSouth Africa are among the lowest inthe world, with an average sales price o f around 2
US.cents per kWh), the Cabinet approved inJune 1999 a planto merge the large number of
municipal distributors and Eskom's distribution businesses into six Regional Distribution
Companies (REDS).However, implementation o f the Cabinet's decision has been painfully slow
andconvoluted. The first REDwas established only in2005 and only onpaper. Other changesto
the generation andtransmission sectorswill bemade indue course.

5.      South M c a is currently experiencing power shortages and load shedding, as generation
capacity has not increasedover the past ten years, despite a steady growth in demand for electricity.
Increasingpower shortages inSouthM c a could pose a serious threat to sustainedeconomic growth


                                                  30

and international competitiveness. ESKOM is currently planning to build 1,500 MW of power
capacity eachyear over the next five years to meet the growingdemand.

6.      Project background. This project has been formulated after several years o f dialogues
anddiscussions between the World Bankandthe Government o f South Africa. Inearly 2000, the
Minister o f Energy (who i s now South Africa's vice president) requested Bank assistance on two
fronts: (i)
          utilizing renewable energy resources, and (ii)  stimulating productive uses o f electricity
inthe rural areas, where electricityhadbeensuccessfilly providedbyEskom under a subsidized
program (which, however, had not led to income-generating activities). The Bank took the
following measures inresponse:

    a) helpedorganize a People's Power workshop inSouth Africa in2000
    b) helped draft the Government's WhitePaper on Renewable Energy, which was approved
        in2003
    c) helped define a program to stimulate the productive uses o f electricity in rural areas, in
        partnershipwith the Independent Development Trust (IDT) and a variety o f stakeholders
    d) held extensive discussions with the Department o fHousing about Bank assistance for an
        efficient-energy housingprogram, which didnot proceed beyondthe draft stage
    e) helpedthe government understand the practical opportunities open to South Africa under
        theKyoto Protocol
    f) assisted the government with advice and expertise on a number o f energy-related issues,
        such as ambient air pollution intownships like Soweto and removal o f lead from gasoline

7.      This proposed Renewable Energy Market Transformation (REMT) project i s a result o f
this dialogue, and aims to help the government implement the White Paper on Renewable
Energy. The project concept has been vetted by South Africa's National Treasury, which has
formally requested the Bank to prepare this project usingGEF grant support.

DEVELOPMENTRENEWABLEENERGY
                  OF

8.      The government has committed South Africa to reducing the country's GHG emissions.
The government's White Paper on Renewable Energy (2003) sets the following target for
renewable energy:

        10,000 GWh (0.8 Mtoe) renewable energy contribution to Jinal energy consumption by
        2013, to be produced mainly from biomass, wind, solar and small-scale hydro. This is
        approximately 4 percent (1,667 Mm of the estimated electricity demand by 2013
        (41,539).

The WhitePaper lists these sources for meetingthe target:

        The renewable energy is to be utilized for power generation and non-electric
        technologiessuch as solar water heating and bio-fuels.




                                                  31

 9.       South Africa has many renewable energy resources that can be used to generate power,
but it is also well-endowed with low-cost, high-quality coal. At present, coal is and is likely to
remaj-4from a financial viewpoint, an attractive source o fpower generation inSouth Africa, and
renewable energy resources have remained largely untapped. At the same time, South Africa
recognizes that the emissions o f greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from the use o f fossil
fuels such as coal and petroleum products has ledto increasing concerns, worldwide as well as in
Africa, about global climate change, and it is the intention o f the government to make South
Africa's due contribution to the global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

 10.    Government's long-term goal is the establishment of a sustainable renewable energy
industry that will offer in future years an alternative to fossil fuels. The White Paper on
Renewable Ertergy sets out the Government's vision, policy principles, strategic goals and
objectives for promoting the potential o f renewable energy. The 9 percent o f final energy
consumption currently provided by renewable energy has come about largely as a result o f
poverty (e.g. wood and animal waste used for cooking and heating). To get started on a
deliberate path towards this goal, the Government's medium-term (10-year) target i s that
renewable energy sources share o f final energy consumption should increase from 9 percent (2
216 793 TJ or 53 Mtoe in 1999) to 14 percent, an increase o f 5 percent, by the year 2013.
Specifically within the electricity sector, the Government's medium-term target i s that renewable
energy - excluding imports from large scale hydro - would provide about 5 percent o f the total
electricity generation.

11.     This is an ambitious target. Achieving it requires a phased, flexible strategy for
promoting renewable energy generation ina cost effective manner with limitednumber o f "early
win" investments based largely on relatively low cost technologies, such as waste-based
cogeneration and commercial solar water heating. Inkeepingwith this, the overall target for this
Project i s relatively modest, with scale-up to occur in the future. Further, mid-way through the
ten-year government program, there would be a mid-termassessment, which would consider any
changes required in policies, targets or implementation strategies, taking account of changes in
costs o f coal-based as well as renewable energy power generation, availability o f international
funds as well as any international obligations agreed-to by South Africa, and the South African
budgetary situation.

12.     There is also need for assurance that the "supply curve" o f renewable energy shows that
there are potential projects with reasonable costs. The estimated supply curve for the first 10,000
GWhshows that:

      Windis not part ofthe first 10,000 GWh
   0  All of the landfill gas potential is within the first 10,000 GWh (and occupies a significant
      portion o fthe first 1,000 GWh)
   0  The balance o fthe 10,000 GWhtarget is made up o f commercial solar water heating, small
      hydro, pulp & paper, andthe sugar industry.

13.     This "supply curve" shouldnot be interpreted to meanthat all the potential o f a particular
renewable resource will be fully used up by the GWh attributedto it. For example, the 240 GWh
contribution o f landfill gas (LFG) is from seven "identified projects" that have been studied in
detail, and the additional contribution o f 600 GWh i s from 57 sites that have been studied in
lesser detail. A very conservative approach was adopted for these 57 sites, and it is quite possible
that the true potential is twice the estimated amount. A similar conservative approach has been
used for the other resources also.

14.     The government currently plans to adopt a mandatory feed-in tariff and a voluntary green
electricity trading scheme to promote renewable energy development to achieve this target. In
addition, given the highdemandfor solar water heaters, Eskom recently plans an aggressive solar
water heater program to mitigate the power shortage. Solar water heaters have a large replication
potential to reduce greenhouse gases by replacing fossil he1combustion. Furthermore, the power
tariff for newly built power plants has increased to 3.6-4.3 U.S. centslkWh, according to the
National Energy Regulator o f South Africa (NERSA). With additional revenue streams from
carbon financing, some renewable energytechnologies can be financially viable at this tariff level.

15.     Given South Africa's strong industrial and financial sectors and the highoverall level o f
capacity, the 10,000 GWh target may appear to be easy to achieve. To the contrary, this i s an
ambitious target for South Africa, because it has significant barriers to renewable energy
development. Inprinciple, South Africa could eliminate these barriers on its own; however, long
years o f being cut off from international trends as well as the historical reliance on coal make it



                                                  33

very difficult for the country to move forward on renewable energy on its own. Consequently,
the government has requested assistance from the World Bank and GEF.

16.     The main barriers to this project's two renewable energy components are described
below:

    (a) Renewables-based Dower generation in South Africa: So far there are few renewable-
        based power generation in South Africa, though a few renewable energy power
        generation projects have been developed, with some form o f financial assistance from
        officialhilateral funds or internationalcarbon funds. The mainbarriers to such generation
        are as follows: (i) current power tariff levels (an averagetariff o f 2.3 U.S.CentskWh),
                           low
        well below the long-mn marginal costs o f expansion and costs o f most renewable energy
        technologies in South Africa; (ii)  lack o f a policy and institutional framework for sale o f
        power into the main grid; (iii)absence o f readily available reliable basic information
        about renewable energy resources; (iv) potential developers' unfamiliaritywith details o f
        the government's approach for promoting renewable energy, as well as unfamiliaritywith
        the nature and extent o f support for renewable energy; and (v) inadequate capacity and
        knowledge in official agencies as well as private sector financial institutions that would
        finance renewable energyinvestments.

   (b) Solar water heating: A nascent market has emerged in large-scale solar water heaters
        suitable for commercial establishments such as hotels, hospitals, old age homes, and rural
        fish farms. No official, bilateral, or international funds are involved inthese transactions.
       The main barriers to scale-up are as follows: (i)lack o f recognized industry best
       practices, standards, and codes; (ii)potential customer's unfamiliarity with the
       technology; and (iii)   potential customers' unease at doing business with suppliers and
       vendors that are often viewed as lacking adequate stature and backing, given their small
       scale and recently established status.


ASSESSMENT AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL FUNDSFOR OVERALL RENEWABLE ENERGY
               OF
DEVELOPMENT

17.    An assessment has been made o f the interest, awareness, capacity, and experience o f
South African financial organizations to finance the type o f renewable energy investments
required to meet the government's overall renewable energy target o f 10,000 GWhper year. This
assessmentwas based on the following:

      Discussions with three o f the four largest banking groups in South Africa-Absa,
      FirstRand,and Standard;
      Discussions with three specialized public sector development finance organizations
      (DF1s)-the Central Energy Fund, the Development Bank o f Southern Africa (DBSA),
      andthe IndustrialFinanceCorporation;
      Reviewswith each o f these institutions o ftheir arrangements, expectations, and issues for
      financing renewable energy investments of the type that would be expected to be
      supported.



                                                  34

18. The main findings o f the assessmentare as follows:

    Strong financial sector. South Africa has a sophisticated, deep, and broad financial
    sector. The IMF has characterized the sector as sound and well regulated, and as having
    demonstrated, based on the 2001 experience, that it can handle sharp currency
    depreciations.

    Strong interest in financing renewable energy projects. The six finance organizations
    surveyed confirmed their interest in renewable energy investments. All are currently
    getting ready-in    terms of organization, staffing, research, and marketing-to      finance
    project investments for energy, including renewable energy. Energy is viewed as the
    "next big wave" inSouth Africa andthe regionby several financial institutions. The three
    banks have formed special energy units or have energy-specific staff capable o f
    structuring competitive finance services for energy projects, including debt and assistance
    with equity placements. The three specialized finance organizations have particular
    interests andcapabilities inthe energy sector, including renewable energy.

    Suitable financing packages can be made available. The maximum debt sizes would
    not be limiting for renewable energy investments in South Africa, as these investments
    are relatively small by local standards. Tenure of debt o f longer than seven years for the
    banks or ten years for the DFIs i s a potential issue, although the South African financial
    sector has the capability to structure instruments for dealing with this. It is expected that
    the financial institutions will carefully scrutinize the quality o f the power off-take
    agreements, particularly for the financial strength o f the buyer.

    Few renewable energy projects in the portfolio. Renewable energy i s a relatively new
    interest for South Africa's financial sector. DBSA, for example, regards renewable
    energy as a potential area to provide debt financing. DBSA has a partnership agreement
    with the World Bank's Carbon Finance Unit for the identification o f potential Clean
    Development Mechanism (CDM) project that might qualify for carbon finance. To date,
    the DBSA has approved debt financing for two renewable energy projects-a              4 MW
    Bethlehem Hydro project and a 4.2 MW Biotherm landfill-gas-to-energy project-both
    with carbon financing. DBSA also provided debt financing for the National Pilot
    Demonstration Darling Wind Farm project in the Western Cape region. The banks and
    DFIs expect that the renewable energy portfolio will grow, given the demand and the
    policy o f attractingnew sources o f generation.

                            Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
           South Africa -Renewable Energy Market Transformation Project


1.      The project has two components:

A. Renewables-basedpower generation inSouthAfrica: Technical assistance(TA) andcapacity
    buildingwill eliminate the barriersidentified above.
B. Commercial solar water heating: Focusing only on the commercial segment (which
    complements a UNDP-GEF project focused on the residential2 segment), TA and capacity
    building will address the barriers identified above. In particular, a "participating CSWH
    company program" will be created that would enhance the companies' credibility, as they
    would agree to observe the conditions o fthe program (including performance verifications o f
    installed systems) in exchange for some performance-based grants for demonstrative
    subprojects inthe initial stages o fthe project.

A.      COMPONENT A. RENEWABLE ENERGY                POWERGENERATION

2.      For renewable energy power generation, the project will assist South Africa in
strengthening the organizations and institutions that would help the government meet its
renewable energy target. The capacity areas include development o f legal and policy
frameworks, promotion, regulation, andservice provision o frenewable energy power generation.
The agencies would cover DME,NERSA,andpotentialproject sponsors and financiers.

Sub-Component 1. Policy and Regulatory Framework

3.      This sub-component will develop legal, policy and regulatory framework, taking account
o f the experience with promoting grid-connected renewable energy power generation in both
developed and developing countries, particularly the feed-in laws, renewable energy portfolio
standards, and competitive tendering (see Annex 15 for details). The project will also adopt a
mandated market policy that is appropriate for South Africa to achieve the renewable energy
target and reduce costs. Currently, the South African government is contemplating to adopt a
feed-in tariff scheme to promote renewable energy. This project will assist the government in
developing a detailed design o f the feed-in tariff policy and development o f a draft Renewable
EnergyLaw. Itwill includethe following four sub-components:

1.1 Review renewable energv Dolicv                  instruments      and financing          mechanisms        and
recommendations for South Africa

4.      This activity will review and summarize: (i)existing renewable energy policy
instruments used around the world, particularly mandated market policies such as feed-in laws,


  CSWH systems range instorage capacity 5,000 to 50,000 liters, whereas the capacity of residential systems is
200-300 liters. Some of the mainend-users o f CSWH systems include hotels, hostels, hospitals, fish farms, and
flatdapartment blocks.



                                                     41

renewable energy portfolio standards, and competitive tendering mechanisms; (ii)financial
incentive policies such as grants, concessional loans, and tax credits; and (iii)financing
mechanisms such as system benefit charges to cover the incremental costs between renewable
energy and conventional energy. Then recommendations for adaptation of these policy
instruments and financing mechanisms will be made. Specifically, this activity will update the
DANIDA study onmarket rules for renewable energy.

1.2Prevare South Africa legal and realaton, framework-for renewable enerm implementation

5.      Based on the outputs from above, this activity will assist the Government o f South Africa
indeveloping legal, policy, and regulatory framework to promote renewable energy in order to
achieve the 10,000 GWh renewable energy target set in the White Paper. The principles
governing electricity market rules will help facilitate the sale o f renewable energy power into the
main grid.

6.      The South African government i s contemplating adoption o f a feed-in tariff scheme for
renewable energy. This activity will assist the government inpreparing: (i)a Renewable Energy
Law that mandates Eskom to purchase renewable energy power and adopts feed-in tariff policy
for renewable energy; and (ii)a renewable energy regulatory framework for the regulator
(NERSA) to set up feed-in tariff levels for different renewable energy technologies; develop
sample PPAs; establish detailed implementation mechanisms for sharing the incremental costs
between renewable energy and conventional energy across the national gridnetwork; and linking
the mandated market mechanisms with CDM. The detailed implementation regulation should
also specify financial incentive policies, including subsidies on capital costs, tax credits, and
concessional loans and guarantees; a streamlined approval procedure; the responsibilities o f each
agency in implementingthe Renewable Energy Law; and how to count heating services such as
solar water heaters to replace electricity towards the 10,000 GWhtarget.

1.3Develov financing ovtions for-financing subsidies, including green premiums

7.     This activity will help develop financing options, such as system benefit funds or
voluntary consumer "green payments," for financing the incremental costs between renewable
energy power generation and conventional energy. The government is now piloting the green
electricity scheme. This activity will help the government design detailed market rules for such a
scheme.

1.4Update resource-svecific suvvlv curves in terms of total (10,000 G         target. and specifi,
corresvondina green premium and financing requirements

8.     This activity will update the supply curve analysis already undertaken by consultants,
namely: (i)Conningarth Economists, June 2004, Economic and Financial Analysis Due
Diligence, Renewable Energy Market Transformation (REMT) Project, Report to the World
Bank; and (ii) cost-supply curve study byDANIDA.This will help the Government o f South
               the
Afiica select the least-cost renewable energy technology to achieve the renewable energy target.

Sub-component2. CapacityBuilding

9.      This sub-component will carry out capacity building activities to strengthen the relevant
public and private sector institutions, and to enable them meet the renewable energy power
generation target. It will build capacity for government agencies such as DME and NERSA, as
well as industries and financial institutions. It also will set up a Help Desk to provide advisory
services andcost sharing matching grants for project developers to conduct pre-feasibility studies
to facilitate private sector investment in renewable energy. The TA provided by this project i s
expected to leverage significant private sector funds. It will include the following three sub-
components:

2.1 Cavacitv building for government agencies. industries. and financial institutions for
renewable vower generation

10.      This activity will build capacity for (i)government agencies, particularly DME and
NERSA, in renewable energy policy instruments, including selection o f appropriate renewable
energy policy for South Afiica, lessons learned from design and implementation o f renewable
energy policies, development o f regulatory frameworks for renewable energy particularly on
mandatory purchase o f renewable energy and tariff levels, and financing mechanisms to cover
the incremental costs through training and workshops; (ii)renewable energy industry and
enterprises to initiate, undertake and manage renewable energy projects; and (iii)financial
institutions in evaluating and appraising renewable energy projects. This activity will involve
training, workshops, andconsultant services.

2.2 Resourcedatabasedevelovment and dissemination

11.     Information related to renewable energy resources i s a public good; that is, there i s little
incentive for any single promoter to collect this information. Yet, this information is the base on
which renewable energy power projects can be designed. This activity will: (i)    compile existing
renewable energy resource information from the DANIDA project, UNDP project, and other
sources to develop a renewable energy database and mapping; (ii)disseminate this resource
information together with technology information indicating feasible development options for
the resources; and (iii)conduct site-specific resource measurement and assessment, ifneeded.

12.     The promotional activities will be linked to the business-to-business help desk (below) as
much o f the promotion will be early-stage building o f business capacity and early identification
with investors and financial institutions o fpotential investment-grade projects.

13.     The promotion will include the development o f a Web site with links to comprehensive
information on South Afiica's renewable energy resources and development options. This will
be part o f the project's broader capacity-building strategy o f widening the base o f businesses,
professionals, and others that have access to relevant information on renewable energy
opportunities.




                                                 43

 2.3 Provision ofMatchina Grants

 14.      This activity will support a "help desk" to provide cost sharing matching grants and
 business-to-business advisory services to strengthen the capacity o f the private sector to
 implement renewable energy Capacity Building Subprojects, in the following main areas: (i)
 facilitate activities leading to the financial closure o f 10 to 14 investment projects; (ii)
                                                                                            prepare to
 pre-feasibility level an additional 4 to 6 investments for possible financial closure in the year
 following project closing; and (iii)assist the promotion o f off-grid renewables, including the
 related development of productive uses and "energy stores." The help desk will assist project
 developers in promoting, identifying, preparing, and financing o f renewable energy generation
 investment projects. The services would assist the project sponsors to identify, prepare, and
 finance renewable energy investments. Most o f the capacity-building assistance to the private
 sector would be on a cost-share basis using matching grants, which are described in details in
 Section D. It i s expected that a private sector project sponsor will develop each investment. The
project sponsor will undertake the necessary technical, market, environmental/social safeguards,
andother neededstudies; prepare the financingpackage; andimplement the project.

 15.     These services are targeted at investments that will be financed during the four years o f
the REMT project and others that would be financed during the initial year following project
implementation. The focus will be on the provision o f the upstream transaction identification
support. South Africa has most o fthe capacities necessary to carry investments forward from this
stage into detailed feasibility and implementation planning and closure, although specialist
services would be available through these services as needed.


B.       COMPONENTB.COMMERCIALSOLAR WATERHEATING

 16.     The sub-component will provide TA and capacity buildingto professional, technical, and
business groups in key market segments and companies engaged in selling CSWH systems and
services. This project will not support any renewable energy resource other than CSWH.
Nevertheless, CSWH companies are expected to contribute significantly towards the target o f
10,000 GWh. The reason for singlingout CSWH for inclusion inthis project is that this resource
is near-commercial, and does not require significant subsidies. As such, it i s suitable for GEF
support aimed at reducing the barriers facing this resource. It will include the following two sub-
components:


Sub-component3. CapacityBuilding

3.1 Best practices. standards. promotion

17.      The project will support activities to improve the CSWH practices in South Africa to
international best practice levels. UNDP's Residential Solar Water Heating Project supports the
sale and installation o f solar water heaters at residences. The proposed project focuses on
commercial solar water heaters only, and thus complements UNDP's project. In addition, the
experience gained with developing codes, standards, and so forth in the UNDP project will be
utilized inthe proposed project.



                                                   44

18.     Standards for S W H equipment are being improved under the UNDP supported project,
and test equipment is being procured. The REMT project support will take into account the
standards and testing progress achieved under the UNDP project and provide the additional
support necessary to help improve industry and government arrangements to ensure international
best practice levels o f technology and services. This would include standardized ratings o f
equipment to facilitate comparisons of projected energy and cost savings and assistance to the
industry to improve standards. Standards to be used in the project's participating CSWH
company program would be no less than those applied inthe UNDP supported domestic project.
Equipment certified by international testing bodies acceptable to the Bank and the DME would
also be eligible. The cost share matching grants and performance grants, described below, are
market-based incentives for moving to best practice levels.

19.     Based on experience from China, integrating solar water heaters in buildings can
potentially penetrate a large market share and can substantially reduce GHG emissions. This
activity will evaluate the feasibility o f this approach in South Africa. If applicable, this activity
can help develop model design o f integration o f solar water heaters in buildings, and assist in
developing buildingstandards andcodes ifnecessary.

20.     Marketing activities, including targeted public relations, information dissemination,
workshops, and participation in key events will be conducted to increase awareness o f CSWH.
Promotional activities would be linkedto the human resource capacity building and design and
performance verifications and documentation.

21.     There will be an aggressive program o f short CSWH information and design workshops
customized and targeted for professionals and technical specialists. The workshops will increase
CSWH knowledge among architects, developers and builders, financial specialists, installers,
hotel and other facilities managers, owners, and others. These workshops will cover best
practices for incorporating CSWH in new and retrofit applications. The capacity building will
also take into account the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) opportunities that the sector
offers throughout the CSWH value chain.

3.2 Provision of Matchinn Grants and Performance Grants

22.     This activity will provide matching grants and performance grants to support the
development o f South Africa's nascent solar water heating industryby promoting the installation
o f systems for commercial, institutional, and industrial applications. The target would be the
small- and medium-scale CSWH segments. The project would support capacity-building
activities for market development that improve the quality and product credibility o f CSWH
equipment and installations, and thus raise confidence in the technology's cost savings
opportunities.

23.     A focus o f the work is to facilitate the development o f 10 or more sustainable private
enterprises selling and installing quality CSWH to hospitals, schools, hotels, and other
commercial, industrial, and institutional users o f hot water. As o f late 2004 there were an
estimated five companies selling CSWHproducts andservices at a low level with, inmost cases,
only occasional sales o f CSWH systems; for all o f these the CSWH portion o ftheir business was
small andrecent. Inmid-2004, a CSWH system was installed on a retirement home on an energy


                                                  45

 services basis, apparently the first use o f an energy service company (ESCO) model on a hlly
commercial basis. Sales and installations supported under the project will be on a competitive,
market-driven basis.

24.     CSWH companies that meet minimum standards o f design, equipment, installation, after
sales service, and customer relations will be considered eligible to participate in a "participating
CSWH company program." Business development support for capacity-building activities will
be provided to participating companies on a cost share basis through matching grants.
Performance grants will be available for capacity buildingbased on the installations o f systems
that are demonstrative or path-breaking. The participating companies will agree to meet the
program's code o f conduct requiring the use o f best practice designs, equipment, and
installations and that follow transparent and credible business practices in dealing with
customers; companies will also risk suspension in case o f noncompliance. These activities will
improve significantly the companies' status and make them more credible to their potential
customers andlenders.

25.     The initial designs o f proposed installations by participating CSWH companies will be
independently vetted by specialists, if requested by the company, to motivate sales. Providing
potential customers with independent professional assessments will contribute to building
confidence inthe market. The design verifications will contribute to capacity building.

26.     The initial two or three CSWH demonstrative installations in each subsector (for
example, retirement homes, hotels, correctional facilities, fish farms, mining hostels) supported
by capacity-building performance grants will be fitted with standard data loggers. Performance
will be monitored independently, with a view to developing authoritative South African
documentation that can be used by participating CSWH companies in their marketing and by
project-supported capacity-building activities. It is expected that there would be documented,
promotional profiles o fup to five investments with performance data available within 18 months.

27.     The capacity building supported by REMT through matching and performance grants
will be demand driven. Inaddition, the programwill assist the participating CSWH companies in
a variety o f ways on an as-needed basis. This support will include getting certifications that
companies' equipment meets standards, independent installation and performance verifications
to increase customer confidence, and possibly equipment performance guarantees in case this
should be needed initially. Section D outlines detailed description o f matching grants and
performance grants.

C.     ImdementationSupDortto Components A andB

Sub-component4. ImplementationSupport

28.    The specific activities to be supported are as follows:

4.1 Due diligence on spec@ projects supported bv the government




                                                 46

29.     This activity will develop and pilot DME's green premium payment intermediation,
including due diligence and approvaVpayment procedures. The intermediation will be assistedby
a team ledby DMEwith members drawn from IDC, DBSA, DEAT, as well as private sector and
financial sector representatives. Independent and professional due diligence assistance will be
provided by consultants under contract with DBSA through the ISU. Financial models will be
developed for conducting independent analyses o f developers' proposals.

4.2 Monitoring and evaluation and mid-term review of feasibilih, of total target

30.     This activity will support DME's monitoring and evaluation o f the project by putting a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation scheme in place. This scheme will address a number
o f issues: (i)
              project and off-project performance indicators, including overall monitoring o f the
10,000 GWhtarget; (ii) overall progress o fthe CSWH component; and (iii)
                         the                                                    monitoring o fthe
performance anddisbursements o f GEF and government funds.

31.     This activity will compile andupdate a database o frenewable energy development status,
including the status o f enforcement, installed capacity o f renewable energy, costs and tariff o f
renewable energy, renewable energy effectiveness andimpacts, andso forth.

32.     Independent and professional assistance will be provided by consultants under contract
with DBSA, who will be responsible for ensuring that an appropriate monitoring and evaluation
scheme i s inplace. The scheme will be built around the project indicators.

4.3 Project coordination and imvlementation

33,     This activity will support program coordination andmanagement, financial management,
information activities, and coordinated monitoring and evaluation for both components. The
project activities cover a fairly broad spectrum o f policy, capacity-building, and TA activities
with concerns for policy development, investment, and commercialization, and will involve a
largenumber o f actors inbusiness, finance, government, professional andcivil society groups.

34.     A project coordinator will head up the ISU at the DBSA and directly contributing to
development o fthe policy and institutional frameworks. The project coordinator andthe I S Uwill
conduct the overall management function, including responding to the authorities (the Project
SC, DME, the World Bank) and interfacing with stakeholders. The project coordinator and the
I S U will be responsible for project planning, implementation, financial management, and
reporting. Through its REMT Web site and through its handling o f the REMT-supported
workshops, conference participations, media events and other information activities, the project
coordinator and the I S U will ensure that REMT contributes strongly to renewable energy
development in South Africa. In addition, DBSA charges a 5 percent management fee to
implement this project.


D.      IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES        FORGRANTS

35.     The project provides two types o f grants:




                                                47

    0   Matching grants (MG) for capacity-building subprojects. The objective o f these
        grants, which are open to participating CSWH companies and other organizations in
        renewable energy power generation and CSWH, is to assist the beneficiaries to identify,
        prepare, and finance investments and improve their business and market development
        capabilities. A MG reimburses a portion o f the total costs o f a capacity-building activity
        undertakenby the beneficiary. The range of possible capacity-building activities is wide,
        and could include, for example, a consultant study, a workshop, the preparation o f
        marketing materials,     and promotional campaigns.         Disbursements      are against
        documentation and verification o f completion o f agreed milestones (such as satisfactory
        consultant report received or training workshop completed) and subject to satisfactory
        documentation and verification o f expenditures. Capacity-building subprojects for
        CSWH companies that cover the independent documentation o f the design, installation,
        and performance o f a CSWH system, so as to prepare materials suitable for use in the
       broader promotion o f the technology, will be eligible for MG support to share costs
       related to consultant services. The GEF Grant will finance only consultants' services
       under the Matching Grants.

   0   Performancegrants (PG) for CSWHsubprojects.The objective o fthese grants, which
       are limitedto CSWH companies, i s to support capacity-building subprojects covering the
       design, installation, or improvement, monitoring and documentation o f demonstrative
       CSWH systems. A PGwould be for a specific amount that would be an estimated percent
       o f the total cost o f the activities. It would be disbursed against documentation and
       verification of completion of agreed milestones related to the completion o f the
       subproject (for example, 50 percent upon commissioning o f a system; 50 percent upon
       confirmation o f satisfactory operation, monitoring and documentation after six months).
       The GEF Grant will finance only consultants' services and goods under the Performance
       Grants.

36.    This document establishes the basic guidelines to be followed bythe ISUinmanagingthe
matching andperformance grants. The I S Uwill issue forms, standard agreements, and additional
implementation instructions as may be necessary for the management o f the support. The ISU
will develop detailed rules and procedures for evaluating and assessingproposals submitted for
subprojects to be financed through MGandPG acceptable to the Bank, prior to the disbursement
o fMGandPGsub-components.

      Salaries and expenses o f government, including provincial government officials
      Expenses associated with routine business activities

      EvaluationCriteria

      The proposals for grants will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

      The activities proposed for assistance are well targeted and consistent with the
      company's development needs and strategy. For instance, the activities would be
      included within the company's market, business, or product development plan, or within
      an analysis o fthe company's strengths and weaknesses, or be identified during an I S Uor
      other professional review o fthe company's capacitybuildingrequirements.
      The need, the activity, and the assistanceare clearly all described.
      The implementation arrangements and schedule are feasible and likely to be effective.
      Deliverables are clearly defined andeasily verifiable by the ISU.
      Outcomes are defined in a form that can be objectively monitored. The proponent will
      specify in the proposal a level of outcome achievement the accomplishment o f which
      would mean that the company i s very satisfied with the outcome o f the supported
      activity andassistance.
      If a consultant is proposed, the terms of reference are satisfactory (including tasks,
      schedule, deliverables, and budget) and the proposed consultant is well suited to the
      assignment. Any fees being charged must be broadly in line with market realities, and
      overchargingi s to be strictly avoided.
      The budgetis sufficiently detailed andreasonable.
      The proposal achieves a minimumscore o f 80 percent against the criteria listedbelow.

40.    The evaluation o frequests bythe ISUwill also consider the following:

   0   Group activities. For matching grants, group activities covering more than one eligible
       company (for instance, those sponsored by an association) may be supported.
       Applications will be evaluated separately for each eligible company. Inparticular, each
       company that i s supported will match by 50 percent the costs o f providing the group-
       based assistanceto that particular company.

   0   Avoiding double subsidies. Grant support will not be provided to match contributions
       from public sources or other subsidies. In such cases, the level o f assistance will be
       calculated so that the total subsidy element from all sources external to the companies for
       the particular activity does not exceed 50 percent.

   0   Supplier selection. The choice o f suppliers will be made by the company and will not be
       restricted to suppliers already incontact with the ISU.However, the ISUwill satisfy itself
       as to the supplier's competence for the task intended; that there i s a genuine, arms-length
       commercial relationship between the supplier and the company; and that the company is
       following good commercialpractice inits purchasing.

related to renewable energy generation, the maximum aggregate amount per company i s the
equivalent of US$lOO,OOO over the course o f the REMT project. For capacity-building
subprojects related to CSWH, the maximum amount per company is the equivalent o f
US$50,000 over the course o f the project.

42.      The support provided by a MG can be usedto reimburse up to a maximum o f 50 percent
o f eligible expenditures.

Perform ance grants

43.      The maximum aggregate amount o f PG support per CSWH company is expected to be
US$50,000 over the course o f the REMTproject.

44.      Exceptions to the maximum support level per company and the maximum amount of
eligible costs to be reimbursed may be made with the approval o f the SC and "no objection"
fiom the World Bank.

Matching and verformance grants

45.      To apply for MGand PG support, eligible companies and organizations submit proposals
to the ISUat the DBSA.The I S Uwill issue standardforms for this purpose.

46.      The I S U will evaluate the proposal and inform the proponent o f the result within 30
working days after receipt. The ISU will establish internal procedures, which will be approved
bythe SC, for its evaluations andapprovals o fMGandPGproposals.

47.      The first MG award for each company will require the prior approval o f the SC and "no
objection" o f the World Bank. Subsequent MG awards will be subject to post review by the SC
and the World Bank. The ISU will seek the prior concurrence o f the SC and the "no objection"
o f the World Bank for the approval of any MG proposal that it considers raises potential issues
with regard to eligibility or evaluation.

48.      Each PG award by the I S U will require the prior approval o f the SC and "no objection"
o fthe World Bank.

49.     Any rejections are to be discussed by the I S Uwith the proponent, to give an opportunity
for identification o f possible next steps. The intention is to give each company maximum
opportunity and assistance required to benefit fiom the MG and PG facilities of the project. All
rejection notifications to companies will be inwriting. The ISUwill report to the SC on rejected
applications.

(h)     Processing of Approved GrantApplications

Matching and verformance grant agreements

50.     On receiving approval o f its proposal, each company will be required to sign an MG or
PG Agreement with the ISU, which will define the contractual obligations and rights o f each
party. The ISUwill develop standard MG and PG Agreements, which will be approved by the
SC and receive the "no objection" o f the World Bank, that will bind the company to present
defined deliverables for viewing by the ISU. All outputs from the supported activities will
remain the exclusive property o f the company or organization, with commercial confidentiality
fully preserved. ISU staff and consultants will respect the commercial confidentiality o f all
deliverables, outputs, and information supplied duringcontact with the company or organization.

51.     The MG and PG Agreements will require the beneficiary company or organization to
undertake the following:

        carry out the subproject with due diligence and efficiency and in accordance with sound
        technical, financial, managerial, and environmental standards and to maintain adequate
        records

    0   obtain services or goods to be co-financed out with the grant at a reasonable price using
        good commercial practices, account being taken also o f other relevant factors such as
        quality and the competence o fthe suppliers

    0  provide all information that the ISU, DME, or the Bank may reasonably request relating
        to the subproject and to the related administration, operations, and financial condition o f
        the beneficiary company or organization

52.     The MG and PG Agreements will also stipulate that the ISU may suspend or terminate a
Matching Grant Agreement or Performance Grant Agreement in case o f failure by the
beneficiary to comply with the terms o f the Agreement or for engaging in corrupt, fraudulent,
collusive, or coercive practices. A MG or PG Agreement may be suspended or terminated with
the agreement o fthe SC andthe "no objection" o fthe World Bank.

(i) DisbursementsandCompanyReports

Matching and verformance grants

53.    After signing a MGor PGAgreement, the ISUmay pay the company or organization an
advance of up to 50 percent o f the agreed level o f support, subject to any conditions that the ISU
may specify. After the assistance i s completed, the company or organization can request payment
o f the balance o f the support, submitting a completion report and evidence o f eligible
expenditures and agreed deliverables. If the I S U determines that the work has been performed
satisfactorily, it will pay the company or organizationthe balance amount.




                                                53

54.     The company or organization must substantiate all claims for reimbursement for eligible
expenditures. The I S U will verify that expenditures have indeedbeen made. The company must
retain the documentation and deliverables for three years after receipt o f the matching grant or
performance grant assistance for possible inspection by auditors, the ISU, or Bank supervision
missions.


(j)     Mitigationof FraudulentandCorruptPractices

55.     The implementation manual for matching and performance grants should include
adequate control and oversight mechanisms as well as legal remedies to mitigate fraudulent and
corrupt practices, such as the following:

        inflatedor duplicated claims
   0    fraudulent claims
   0    unjustified expense claims
        conflicts o f interest (for example, grant recipients awarding consulting and other
        contracts to their own staff and/or own subsidiaries/affiliates)
        approving grant proposals prepared by staff o fthe ImplementingAgency

2. This project is expected to leverage $9.00 million fromthe private sector for investment inCSWH systems
sold under this project. As such, this leveraged fund cannot be committed inthe same manner as Government
or donor funds. However, unlike inmany other countries, South Africa's financial markets have the required
motivation and capability to provide funds of this magnitude.

          South Afi-ica -Renewable EnergyMarket Transformation Project


1.     DME has designated DBSA as the implementing agent for this project. This annex
describes: (a) DBSA; (b) the Project Steering Committee; (c) the Implementation Support Unit;
(d) stakeholders participation; (e) flow o ffinds; and(f) coordination with ongoing activities.

A.     DBSA

2.     DBSA will be the implementing agent for this project. An M o U will be entered into
between DME and DBSA that spells out the overall implementation arrangements under which
DBSA will act as the implementing agent o fDME.Furthermore, for the purposes o f carrying out
the agreed activities in the MoU, DBSA would be contracted by DME pursuant to Bank
guidelines under a contract for services.

3.      DBSA is a well-established agency that has considerable expertise inboth financing and
managing development projects. In recent years, DBSA has taken an interest in promoting
renewable energy investments. DBSA is familiar with World Bank procedures and does not face
constraints in areas such as financial management and procurement. Although DBSA does not
have extensive in-house capacity on renewable energy, this is not a constraint as DBSA will set
up anISUandhire (mainly local) consultants inimplementingthisproject.

B.      ProjectSteeringCommittee

4.      A Steering Committee (SC) to be appointed by DME will oversee the project. The SC
will be responsible for monitoring project implementation and identifying actions to ensure that
itproceeds ina timely andefficient manner.The SC will consist o f five members: (i) Deputy
                                                                                        the
Director General of Hydrocarbon, EnergyPlanning, and Clean Energy, DME as its Chair; (ii)      the
Chief Director, Clean Energy, DME; (iii)      the Director, New and Renewable Energy, DME; (iv)
the National Energy Regulator o f South Africa (NERSA); and (v) the Central Energy Fund
(CEF). The SC will meet at least twice every year. The SC may also expand to include technical
expert(s) inrenewable energy and private sector representative(s), as required.

5.      The SC will provide overall advice and guidance to the project, and ensure
recommendations made by the project will be incorporatedinpolicy and regulatory frameworks
and implemented. The SC will facilitate good coordination between the different agencies
involved in scaling-up renewable energy implementation. The SC shall discuss and approve
progress reports, changes inproject implementation, and other items as may be requested by the
DME. The SC shall monitor that proper quality assurance o f the outputs is carried out by the
Renewable Energy Market Transformation (REMT) project staff. The SC will guide and follow
the development o f the project according to the implementation schedule, and cause periodic
progress reports to be submitted, including use o f funds, to the Bank andDME.

6.      The SC will form a working group o f designated staff to provide close supervision and
guidance to the project team during implementation. The SC may also decide to establish an


                                                  57

advisory board or use other mechanisms to present and share ideas and to otherwise involve key
external stakeholders in the implementation process. The stakeholders will include different
sections within the renewable energy power generation and CSWH communities (for example,
consumers, academic, finance, consulting engineers, NGOs, project developers/owners, and
Eskom)   .

C.      ImplementationSupportUnit

7.      The DBSA will establish an ISUto manage day-to-day activities during the four years o f
the REMT project implementation. The ISU will be responsible for carrying out the various
project activities-that   is, the policy and institutional framework, capacity building, and
implementation activities. As such the ISU will also be handling quality assurance and progress
reporting. The I S Uwill also be responsible for administering the performance grants for CSWH
subprojects and the matching grants for renewable energy and CSWH capacity-building
activities. The private sector will be responsible for implementing all the investments supported
underthis project.

8.      The ISU will be headed by an international Project Coordinator, who will lead the
implementation activities o f the REMT project and will be responsible for the substantive work
for renewable energy policy and institutional framework development and capacity building. In
addition, the I S U will also consist o f a business support manager, who will be a national
consultant and i s responsible for implementing the Help Desk to guide project developers for
both renewable energy power generation and CSWH, and one support staff. ExistingDME staff
will be allocated to provide close supervision and guidance to the project team during
implementation. Short-term consultants and advisors will provide services on an as-neededbasis.

9.      The Agencies Unit within DBSA is responsible for procurement, financial management,
disbursement, budgeting, accounting, treasury services, and corporate services such as human
resources management, legal advisory services, and so forth.

F.     Coordinationwith OngoingActivities

13.    This set of activities will facilitate the creation of a detailed framework for sale and
wheeling of renewable energy power into the main grid. These efforts will build on the work
being undertaken by UNDP (under the GEF-financed South Africa Wind Energy Project-
SAWEP) and DANIDA. It is expectedthat the detailed framework will be finalized during the
course of this project, and investments undertakenduring this project will be able to utilize the
framework.

14.    SAWEP focuses only onwindpower.Theprojecthas six components, ofwhichthree are
particularlyrelevantto this project:

   0  Green power funding. To assist initiatives geared towards green power marketing and
     setting up and implementing Tradable Renewable Energy Certificates as well as
     implementinga greenpower guaranteescheme.
   0 Long-term policy and implementation framework for wind energy. To assist the
     Government of South Africa with the development of a long-term policy, including
     implementationstrategy, for wind energydevelopment.
   0 Capacity building and institutional strengthening. To strengthen and support stakeholders
     involved in wind energy development, including key government departments (for
     example, national and provincial environmental departments), public agencies (such as
     financing), the wind farm industry (such as the SouthAfrican Wind Energy Association),
     andindependentprivatefirms.




                                                60

15.  It has been agreed with UNDP that this project will be coordinated with SAWEP (and
UNDP's Residential Solar Water Heatingproject) accordingto the following principles:

   0 There will be high-level coordination between the Task Managers. Specifically, (i)     the
     Bank mission will meet with UNDP on every visit to South Afiica, and (ii) UNDP the
     and Bank Task Managers will be in touch with each other by phone or e-mail on key
     issues. This coordination will be open-ended; that is, the Task Managers will discuss
     coordination issues as they arise, and make suitable adjustments as needed. This has
     already been done inthe past, andwill continue.
   0 There will be coordination in desim. Specifically, this project will determine its detailed
     tasks-the   TORs for specific TA components-with        reference to the UNDP SAWEP
     TORs. The purpose is to take advantage o f synergies and avoid duplication. This will be
     close-ended coordination. There will be aninitial "synchronization" o f REMT TORs with
     SAWEP TORs, followed by an exchange o f e-mails on a regular basis (say four times a
     year) to ensure coordination over time on key areas. A similar arrangement will be made
     for the CSWH Component o f the REMT project, with the coordination focus mainly on
     standards and certifications.
   0 There will be coordination in implementation without imposing a coordination burden.
     Specifically, the REMT and UNDP project implementers will use formal and informal
     opportunities and occasions to meet each other and discuss coordination issues, but each
     group will be free to pursue its activities without waiting for approval from the other.
     Formal opportunities are the existing SAWEP and S W H Steering Committees, to which
     the REMT implementers will be invited (as per agreement with UNDP) as soon as REMT
     becomes effective. This coordination will be facilitated in practice by the similar
     implementationarrangements inthe Bank andUNDP projects.

CountryRisk

1.      No Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) has been carried out on South
M c a to date. However, it is generally accepted that the country has one o f the more developed
accounting professions inthe world, andi s certainly amongst the more technically capable countries
inthe region. However, experienceofBank-financedprojectsisnotwidely available, although to the
project's advantage, DBSA i s familiar with World Bankprocedures.

2.      The country has a good reservoir o f qualified accounting professionals and as a middle-
income country has an adequatelystaffed Audit Office. Inaddition, where time is o fthe essence, the
Auditor General i s allowed, by legislation, to outsource some o f the work. The Auditor General's
Office has already produced severalannual audit reports, satisfactory to the Bank.

ProjectRisks

3.      The DBSAi s a well-established agency that has considerable expertise inboth financing and
managing development projects. This is an advantage in that the project will be handledby a very
experiencedproject management organization. The potential disadvantageo f competing projects has
been mitigated by the existence o f the ISU, a small unit within DBSA that i s dedicated to the
managemento fthe project.

FinancialManagementStrengthsandWeaknesses

Strengths

4.      Project financial management will be overseen by the existing DBSA Finance
Department. The I S U will be responsible for receiving and reviewing the completeness and
appropriateness o f invoices and other requests for payment. The actual capturing and settlement
o f those invoices will be made by and through the existing DBSA payments system. While the
DBSA has its own existing "Administrative andAccounting Procedures Manual," a small update
has to be made to this to incorporate the new positions at the ISU, and how they relate to existing
DBSA structures. The production o f this enhanced "Administrative and Accounting Procedures
Manual" will be circulated to the Bank for comment.

    0  providing timely and accurate information for use by other stakeholders inthe formats that
       they require
    0  supporting the preparation o fstatutory andother audits

9.     The accounting systems must support the general principles o f equity, economy, efficiency,
and effectiveness. With regards to the Bank's requirements, DBSA will coordinate and collate the
quarterlyprogressreports. These reports mustbe able to support the productionof quarterly internal
financial reports (IFRs) that integrate project accounting, procurement, contract management,
disbursement, andphysical progress o factivities onthe ground.

Reporting (IFRs)

10.    Formats o fthe various periodic IFRs, to be generatedfiom the financial management system,

                          Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
           South Africa - Renewable EnergyMarket Transformation Project


A. GENERAL

1.      The procurement under this project involves selection and employment o f consultants in
the following broad areas: project management, policy formulating, capacity building(including
training and workshops),     monitoring and evaluation, and management associated with
implementing the project. It also involves the procurement o f goods as part o f demonstrative
CSWH subprojects supported with cost-share performance grants.

2.      Contracts for consulting services by firms or individuals will be awarded in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers, dated October 2006, and the provisions stipulated inthe Grant Agreement. The Bank's
Standard Request for Proposals (RFP), the appropriate Forms o f Contracts (lump sum, time-
based, and/or simplified contracts for short-term assignments and individual consultants), as well
as the Sample Form o f Evaluation Report for the Selection o f Consultants will be used. For each
contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection
methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time flame
are agreedbetweenthe GrantRecipient andthe Bankinthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan
will beupdated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actualproject implementation needsand
improvements ininstitutional capacity.
Selection of Consultants

3.      The I S U at DBSA will obtain consultant services in the form o f TA, including
implementation support through contracts with firms and individuals. These consultants will
assist the ISU at DBSA in a suite o f activities such as project management, policy formulating,
capacity building (including training and workshops),            monitoring and evaluation, and
management associated with implementingthe project. The selection o f consultants will be done
inthe following manner:

        For contracts estimated to cost less thanUS$500,000 equivalent per contract, the shortlist
        may contain entirely national consultants (firms registered or incorporated in the
        country), provided the shortlist complies with paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant
        Guidelines.

        Quality-and-cost-based selection: All consulting service contracts with firms valued at
        more than US$200,000 equivalent will be awarded through the quality and cost-based
        selection (QCBS) method inaccordance with the provisions o f Section 11,paragraph 3 o f
        Appendix 1and Appendix 2of the Consultant Guidelines.

        Selection based on consultants' qualzjkations (applicable to selection of firms): This
        method may be used for assignments, valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent per



                                                67

   contract, for which the need for preparing and evaluating competitive proposals is not
   justified. Insuch cases, the DBSA will follow the procedures in paragraph 3.7 of the
   Consultant Guidelines: "The Client will preparethe TORS,request expressions o f interest
   and information on the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the
   assignment and establish a short list, and select the firm with the most appropriate
   qualifications and references. The selected firm shall then be asked to submit a combined
   technical and financial proposal for consideration and contract negotiation."

 e DMEnoted that they are obligated to follow the government policy to encourage Black
   Economic Empowerment (BEE), as DME i s one o f the leading ministries that initiated
   the BEEpolicy. When calling for Expressions ofInterest from interested firms, one ofthe
   criteria for shortlisting may include the South African BEE policy; that is, to show proof
   that they have fulfilled this policy requirement o f the government. The shortlisting
   process will, among other key criteria, take BEEinto account.

 e Evaluation o f Expression o f Interest shall not be an arithmetical exercise. Short list shall
   comprise six qualified firms,        according to paragraph 2.6-2.7 o f the Consultant
   Guidelines.

 e Evaluation of proposals from the shortlisted firms will be based on criteria elaborated in
   the Consultant Guidelines, such as experience of the firm inthe specific area ofthe TOR,
   qualifications o fkey staff, methodology, and so forth.

 e Although national firms are capable o f carrying out most o f the project activities, incases
   where international experience or expertise is needed (particularly regardingrenewable
   energy policy and regulatory frameworks), the TOR will specify that international
   experience and expertise are required (as reflected by participation among key staff) and
   should be listed as one o f the key evaluation criteria. This does not exclude South Africa
   nationals who have requiredinternational experience andexpertise.

 e All contracts for the selection o f firms will have their short list established only after
   publication o f a Solicitation o f Expressiono f Interest (SOEI) inlocal newspapers ofwide
   circulation. This can be done for several consultancy services at once, if convenient,
   particularly ifthe services are needed at the same period. In addition, SOEI for contracts
   worth US$200,000 or more equivalent shall be advertised in UNDB online and
   dgMarket, according to paragraph 2.5 o fthe Consultant Guidelines

e  Services o f individual consultants meeting the requirements o f Section V o f the
   Consultant Guidelines will be selected under the provisions for the Selection o f
  Individual Consultants method. For large assignments, such as assignments No. 11-12 in
  the procurement plan, requests for expression o f interests shall be advertised ina national
  newspaper and in an international newspaper or a technical magazine. This can be done
  for several consultancy services at once from time to time to enable the project to have a
  roster o f interested and qualified individual consultants. Individual consultants (IC) will
  be selected through comparison o f the applicant's curriculum vitae against job
  description requirements, or requirements identified directly by DBSA. Civil servants



                                            68

       cannot be hired as consultants under the project, unless conditions stated in 1.11 (d) o f
       the Consultant Guidelines are met.

  0    Services that are estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract, may,
       with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured in accordance with the provisions of
       paragraph 3.9 to 3.13 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.


B.ASSESSMENT THE AGENCY'SCAPACITYTO IMPLEMENT PROCUREMENT
                 OF

4.     DBSA will be responsible for all the procurement activities including contract
management. An assessment o fthe capacityofthe ImplementingAgency to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out by the Lead Procurement Specialist, Africa Region.
The following summarizes the findings from the assessment:

    0  From 1997 to 1999, DBSA successfully administered PHRD Grant No. TF027018
       amounting to US$l million. All procurements under the grant were done usingthe Bank's
       Procurement Guidelines. The total number o f contracts handled was 12, and this included
       handlingof all contract management issues.

    0  From 2002 to 2004, DBSA, on behalf o f the SouthAfrica National Treasury, successfully
       handled all procurement activities (mainly selection o f consultants) under the Municipal
       Financial Management TA Project (IBRD Loan 7146). The total amount o f contracts
       awarded was over US$12 million usingQCBS method.


    0  All procurement activities will be handled by a team o f four professionals, who have
       adequate experience in handling Bank-financed contracts. They will be responsible for
       handlingall financial and accounting aspects o fcontract management.

c.   PROCUREMENT OF CONSULTANT SERVICES AND GOODSBY COMPANIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER MATCHING          GRANTS PERFORMANCEGRANTS
                                              AND

5.     The project has allocated US$1,750,000 for matching grants and US$250,000 for
performance grants. Annex 4 has outlined preliminary Implementation Guidelines for the
matching grants and performance grants, including eligible recipients, eligible activities and
expenditure, evaluation criteria and procedure, and so forth. Development o f detailed rules and
procedures for the matching grants andperformance grants i s a condition for disbursement of the
matching grant and performance grant components. The I S U will evaluate the proposals for
matching grants and performance grants, and will establish internal approval and rejection
procedures, which will be approved by the SC.

6.     The matching grant will provide up to a maximumo f 50 percent o f eligible expenditure
on consulting services for both generation o f renewable energy power and CSWH-related
capacity-building subprojects, and performance grants will provide up to a maximum o f 50
percent o f eligible expenditure on consulting services and goods for CSWH-related capacity-
building subprojects. The maximum aggregate amount o f matching grants and performance
grants per company will be no more than US$lOO,OOO over the course o f the REMT project for


                                               69

capacity-building subprojects related to renewable energy power generation, and US$50,000
over the course o fthe project for CSWH-related capacity-building subprojects.

7.      Consultant services that are procured as part o f subproject activities co-financed by
matching grants and services and goods procured as part o f subproject activities co-financed by
performance grants will be procured by the beneficiary company or organization in accordance
with prudent and established commercial practices acceptable to the Bank. Consideration shall
also be given to the use o f competitive procedures, as outlined in the Consultant Guidelines,
particularly for large assignments.

8.      The commercial practices for procurement under the matching grants and performance
grants should be explained in detail in the grant implementation procedures manual to be
reviewed and approved by the Bank, and emphasized that adequate mitigation measures and
control mechanisms against fraudulent and corrupt practices should be included in the detailed
rules andprocedures for the matching grants andperformance grants.

9.      The overall project risk for procurement i s low.


D.PROCUREMENT         PLAN

10.     The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation
that provides the basis for the procurement methods. This Plan will be agreed between the
Recipient and the Project Team on April 23, 2007. The Plan will also be available in the
project's database and on the Bank's external Web site. The Procurement Planwill be updated in
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.


E.FREQUENCY OFPROCUREMENTSUPERVISION

11.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended one supervision missionper
year to visit the field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

                       Annex 9: EconomicandFinancialAnalysis
            South Africa -Renewable EnergyMarket Transformation Project


1.       The economic and financial analysis examined a sample o f potential projects for each
renewable energy technology-small          hydro, sugar bagasse, wind, pulp and paper industry,
landfill gas, and solar water heating-to      reach the 10,000 GWh target set in the government's
White Paper for Renewable Energy. Therefore, REMT can proceed with some confidence that
there are viable renewable energy project transactions that will be taken up by the private sector
inresponseto the market transformationactivitiesplannedfor REMT.

2.       The economic and financial analysis follows a renewable energy cost supply curve
approach, as shown in Figure A.9.1, based on a detailed economic and financial analysis o f a
sample o f projects to meet the government's target o f 10,000 GWh per year. Similar approach
for economic and financial analysis i s also adopted in other World Bank renewable energy
projects in China and Croatia. This approach i s particularly appropriate to a sector where the
bulk o f the projects are expected to be undertaken inthe private sector, structured either as non-
recourse financed IPPs or under balance sheet financing by large corporations (e.g. as in pulp
andpaper).

3.       Such a methodology o f economic analysis for renewable energy i s illustrated by figure
A.9.2. Traditional financial analysis, based on discounted cash-flow accounting, undervalues
future price risks o f fossil fuels and completely ignores the environmental and health costs o f
fossil-fueled power plant emissions. As a result, the current utilization o f modem renewable
energy (excluding traditional biomass use) in most countries is quite small. Yet, on a life-cycle
cost basis, some renewable energy technologies are already cost competitive with conventional
energy sources. However, the potential o f these financially viable renewable energy technologies
i s not fully realizedbecause o f a variety o fmarket barriers.

4.       As shown in figure A.9.2, if the cost o f local environmental externalities and global
externalities (for example, carbon credits) are included inthe economic valuation, as i s done in a
typical World Bank Group economic calculation, the economically viable quantity o f renewable
energyincreases. Ifthe diversification value is also added to the economic cost, the economically
viable optimum quantityo f renewable energy becomes even larger.

5.       While economic analysis shows a project to be economically attractive, based on
economic costs and benefits measured by avoided generation costs at long-run marginal cost
(LRMC), financial returns canbe insufficient for implementationbythe private sector. Given the
marketdistortionthat environmental externalities anddiversification values are not recognizedin
the market place, together with a series`of market barriers, financial incentives are required inthe
form o f higher level o f tariff, government subsidy, concessional loans fiom development banks,
and various forms o fpublic-private partnerships to attract investors to achieve the economically
viable optimum quantityo frenewable energy.




                                                  73

6.       The analysis shows that the estimated least-cost supply for the first 10,000 GWh would
come from the following technologies:

    0  Windis not part o fthe first 10,000 GWh
    0  All o f the landfillgas potential is within the first 10,000 GWh (andoccupies a significant
       portion o fthe first 1,000 GWh)
    0  The balance o fthe 10,000 GWhtarget is made up o fcommercial solar water heating, small
       hydro, pulp & paper, and the sugar industry.

7.       Therefore, with the exception o f wind, it was possible to find viable projects for all the
resources, and the analysis shows that it i s feasible to reach the government's target o f 10,000
GWhwith relatively small amounts o fcarbon finance. The analysis shows that the only resource
where carbon finance increases the returns significantly i s landfill gas; in other cases, carbon
finance will play mainly a catalytic role.

8.      Table A.9.1 shows the technology mix and supply potential from each technology to
reach government's target o f 10,000 GWh. This should not be interpreted to mean that all the
potential o f a particular renewable resource will be fully used up by the GWh attributedto it. For
example, the 240 GWhcontribution o f landfillgas (LFG) is from seven "identified projects" that
have been studiedindetail, and the additional contribution o f 600 GWh i s from 57 sites that have
been studied inlesser detail. A very conservative approach was adopted for these 57 sites, and it
i s quite possible that the true potential is twice the estimated amount. A similar conservative
approach has been used for the other resources also.

A. ECONOMIC      ANALYSIS

9.      A standard economic analysis was undertaken for each sample project. NPV and
economic rate o f return (ERR) are calculated, and benefits o f avoided energy at the applicable
substation are calculated at the LRMC. ERR i s calculated both with and without environmental
benefits. In economic analysis, avoided greenhouse gas emissions are valued at the reportedPCF
transaction price for the DurbanLandfillgas project o f $4/tonne COz,which i s used as the proxy
for global willingness to pay for South Africa's carbon reductions and may be taken as the
relevant economic benefit. The quantity o f GHGs avoided i s taken at 0.89 Kg C02/kWh, based
on the PCF DurbanLFGEmission ReductionStudy.

10.     The analysis identified a number o f candidate projects to be financed by the private sector
under REMT. The calculated ERRSwith environmental benefits range from 13 percent to 24
percent for small hydro projects, 15 percent to 38 percent for sugar bagasse projects, 18 percent
for a pulp andpaper project, and 31percent to 34 percent for landfill gas projects.

11.    For commercial solar water heating, in the absence o f any significant taxes or
government subsidies, the decision o f individual commercial establishments to purchase
these systems implies that they will enjoy savings over the conventional electric systems,
which in turn implies that there are savings for the country as a whole; that is, the projects
are justified on an economic basis. This is reinforced by the fact that a small number o f such
systems are already being bought and sold in South Africa without any government
interventions.



                                                               76

12.    An economic analysis o f a CSWH system was conducted. In this analysis, the
economic costs are the current costs prevailing in South Africa; it i s expected that costs will
decline inthe future as the scale o f the market increases. There are two types o f benefits:

       Local: Since the use o f CSWH instead o f conventional electricity is a form o f "fuel
       switching," the benefits are the costs avoided by switching; that is, the economic cost
       o f the electricity saved. Inthe CSWH case, this consists o f the generation plus network
       costs, and in South Afiica, Eskom's tariff i s the best available indicator o f these costs.
       For simplicity, the "demand charge" and the "energy charge" have been rolled into a
       single cost per kWh. It is estimated that this combined charge is 25 rand cents (3.62
       U.S.cents) per kWh. The economic cost of generation is expected to increase inthe
       next 3-5 years when Eskom would have to add generation capacity to meet peak
       demand.

   0   Global: The market value o f the carbon emission reductions (CERs) i s a measure o f
       global benefits, even though it i s recognized that, inpractice, it i s not yet feasible to sell
       these CERs because o f hightransaction costs. The CER price i s estimated to be US$4/ton
       o f coz.

13.    The economic analysis shows that, at today's CSWH costs and power tariffs, the CSWH
systems are marginally attractive, with an internal rate o f return o f 14 percent based only local
benefits, and 17 percent on adding global benefits. This i s consistent with the low level o f
CSWH market penetration, andindicates that CSWH cost reductions are necessary to make them
more attractive to individual end-users as well as the economy as a whole.




                                                77


                                      B.FINANCIALANALYSIS


14.     A standard financial model to calculate financial internal rate o f return (FIRR) has been
developed. The financial analysis is conducted from the perspective o f the implementing entity,
and the calculated FIRR is therefore a function o f the capital structure assumed. Capital costs
have been estimated by the sector technical experts at 2004 prices, including physical
contingencies, but excluding price contingencies. Capital costs are escalated by the applicable
inflation rate to the year o f assumed construction outlay. The model assumes loans at variable
rather than fixed rates. The current rate o fVAT is 14%.

15.     Inaddition, the projectsto befinanced willbescreenedbyprivatepromoters, commercial
lenders, external carbon fund financiers, and in some cases government agencies. The private
sector will only invest commercially feasible projects. The financial analysis identified a number
of financially viable small hydro, sugar bagasse, pulp andpaper, andlandfill gas projects, which
can be financed by the private sector under REMT.

16.     The CSWH investments supported under this project will involve the purchase o f these
systemsby individualcommercial customers fiom independentprivate sector vendors. It follows that
these investments will be viable from the viewpoint o fthe buyers and sellers, andthat the buyers will
have a strong incentive to maintaintheir systems over time.

17.     This project will not have any fiscal impacts on the government, apart from the counterpart
funds required for this project. Overall, the government's fiscal positionis sound, andthese expenses
willbewithinthe government's mediumterm expenditure framework (MTEF).

        SouthAfrica -Renewable EnergyMarket Transformation Project


TA and CapacityBuilding

 1.      The overall objective o f the project i s the creation and/or strengthening o f the
organizations and institutions that would help the government meet its renewable energy
target. The capacity areas covered would be the policy setting, promotion, regulation,
service provision, and monitoring and evaluation o f renewable energy power generation.
The agencies covered would include DME, NERSA, and potential project sponsors and
financiers.

2.       The project development objective i s to enhance environmental sustainability in
South Africa's energy sector by facilitating significant reduction in South Africa's GHG
emissions. DMEwill contract DBSA to be the implementingagent for the project.


Investments

3.       Commercialsolar water heating(CSWH). The project will support expansion
o f South Africa's nascent solar water heating industry by promoting installation o f
systems for solar water heating for commercial, institutional, and industrial applications.
This will be coordinated with a UNDP/GEFprogram aimed at the residentialmarket.

4.       There are already a few companies serving the CSWH market in South Africa.
However, without any subsidies or other incentives they face some barriers that make it
difficult for them to scale up. The near-commercial nature o f the CSWH presents good
prospects for rapid take-off duringthe project with GEF support.

5.       The project-supported solar water heatinginvestments will be installed inexisting
institutional, commercial, and industrial facilities, within the confines o f their facility
perimeters. In most cases, the solar arrays will be installed on rooftops o f existing
buildings, but ground mounting o f the arrays is possible. The associated water storage
tanks, pumps, water softening equipment, and so forth for the most part will be installed
inside existing buildings, but in any case will be in close proximity to the associated
(existing) institutional, commercial, or industrial uses o f the hot water. No new land
taking i s envisioned for the investments.

6.       Renewable energy power generation. This project is expected to trigger
significant private sector investments in renewable energy power generation. These
investments will befinanced outside of the REMT project by a combination of private
equity and debt, with debt financing facilitated by an output-based revenue stream
provided by external "carbonfunds" such as the PCF.




                                            80

Project Location

7.     Project-supported CSWH will be installed primarily inthe major cities, including
Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Capetown, but eligibility for the program is country-wide.


Safeguard Policies that Might Apply

8.     The TA and solar water heating investments in the project are not expected to
present any environmental or social risk. Solar water heating i s not a "listed activity"
with respect to South African environmental requirements, and therefore would not be
subject to the environmental screening or environmental assessment process. Since the
project does not involve any land taking, and the only construction will be within the
perimeter o f existing institutional, commercial, or industrial establishments, (and in fact,
mostly on rooftops), no social safeguards are expected to be triggered.

                       Annex 15: IncrementalCost Analysis
       South Africa -Renewable EnergyMarket Transformation Project


A. INTRODUCTION

 1.      The government's m i t e Paper on Renewable Energy (2003) sets the following
target for renewable energy:

         10,000 GWh (0.8 Mtoe) renewable energy contribution to final energy
         consumption by 2013, to be produced mainly from biomass, wind, solar and
         small-scale hydro. The renewable energy is to be utilized for power generation
         and non-electric technologies such as solar water heating and bio-fuels. This is
         approximately 4% (1,667 MW) of the estimated electricity demand by 2013
         (41,539).

2.       There are two broad sources that will contribute to this target:

     0   Renewable energy power generation. A small part o f this would be for own use,
         while the bulk o f it would for sale to thirdparties via Eskom's grid.

         Energy sources to replace electricity. Prominent in this category i s solar water
         heating, which is a direct substitutefor usingelectricity for water heating.

3.       Given South Africa's strong industrial and financial sectors and the high overall
level o f capacity in the government, a 10-year target o f 10,000 GWh may appear to be
easy for South Africa to achieve. On the contrary, this is an ambitious target, and there
remain significant barriers to meeting it as described below. As long as these barriers
remain, there is likely to be limitedprogress towardachieving this goal.

4.      Inprinciple, South Africa could take steps on its own to eliminate these barriers.
However, long years ofbeing cut off from international trends as well as an earlier policy
o f relying heavily on coal make it difficult for South Africa to move forward alone on
renewable energy. With this in mind, the government has requested assistance from the
World Bank/GEFinovercoming these barriers.

5.      For this purpose, the government intends to use the World Bank as a "knowledge
bank" and not as a lending institution, which is consistent with the overall relationship
between the government and the Bank so far. The key role o f GEF in this project is to
grant co-finance TA that would jumpstart the move towards the 10,000 GWh target by
eliminating the main barriers. There i s no need for GEF to finance the renewable energy
investments itself, as the lack o f funds to finance the costs o f renewable projects is not a
barrier inSouthAfrica.

6.      The technical feasibility o f achieving this target has been demonstrated in a
consultant study (Conningarth Economists, June 2004), which developed a "supply


                                               88

curve" o f renewable energy. The study examined specific projects indifferent sources o f
renewable energy, such as sugar cogeneration, solar water heating, pulp andpaper, wind,
and so forth. The supply curve derivedinthis study is shownbelow infigure A.15.1and
the detailed contribution o f each source towards the 10,000 GWhtarget is shown intable
A.15.1.

7.      Note that this aggregate supply curve includes solar water heating, which faces a
different competitive environment than the other sources. This is because water heating
competes, effectively, against the retail electricity tariff, whereas the other sources
compete against the wholesale electricity tariff, The implication i s that solar water
heating is likely to be more attractive than shown inthis aggregate supply curve.

8.      This supply curve should not be interpreted to mean that all the potential o f a
particular renewable resource will be fully used up by the GWh attributed to it. For
example, the 240 GWh contribution o f landfill gas (LFG) i s from seven "identified
projects" that have been studied in detail, and the additional contribution o f 600 GWh i s
from 57 sites that have been studied in lesser detail. A very conservative approach was
adopted for these 57 sites, and it i s quite possible that the true potential is twice the
estimated amount. A similar conservative approach has been used for the other resources
as well.

RenewableEnergy Power Generation

9.      While a number o f pilots have been proposed for renewable energy power
generation in South Africa, they are still at the advanced preparation stage, and have not
reached financial closure, including the proposed Darling Wind Farm. All o f them
represent "special cases," in the sense that there are unique factors that underlie the
projects. A common factor i s that none o f them are financially attractive on their own;
given Eskom's low-cost, coal-based power generation, all o f them rely on external funds
to be financially attractive. Nevertheless, perhaps two or three o f these will reach
financial closure inthe next few years with financial support from official or international
funds.

10.     Once a government, and particularly a government with the extent o f the
resources that the South African government commands, officially adopts a target, it
seems natural to presume that the achievement o f this target i s the baseline scenario, with
the implication that GEF funds should be used to go beyond this target. However, this i s
not the case in South Africa, where the government adopted the target with the
expectation that external funds would be available to help achieve the target. Inpart, this
expectation arose from the fact that, in the process o f preparing the white Paper on
Renewable Energy, DME and the World Bank had a lengthy dialog, during which the
government came to view the Bank as a knowledge bank as well as a conduit for external
funds.

11.     At the June 2004 Bonn International Conference on Renewable Energies, South
Africa reaffirmed its commitment to the goals set out in the white Paper on Renewable
Energy, and clearly laid out the expectation that the World Bank and GEF would be key
actors inachievingthe whitePaper goals, as shown by table A.15.2 below.

12.     As a result, the baseline scenario is that there will be insignificant progress
towards meeting the government's 10,000 GWhrenewable energytarget.

13.     The mainbarriers to scale-up are as follows:

    0   Lack o f policy and institutional framework for sale o f Dower into the main mid.
        The government has set up working groups to formulate plans for unbundling
        Eskom. This is expected to lead to the formation o f about six regional electricity
        distributing companies (REDS), about three generating companies, and a
        transmission company. Since these working groups do not have a mandate to
        specifically consider renewable energy, the government has requested Bank
        assistance inthis regard.

    0  Absence o f readily available, reliable, basic information about renewable energy
       resources. This information has the characteristics o f a "public good," which no
       individual developer has any incentive to develop, and therefore has to be
       developed with public resources.

   0   Developers' potential unfamiliarity with details o f the government's approach for
       promoting renewable energy and the nature and extent o f government's support
       available for it. The government's White Paper on Renewable Energy puts
       forward broad policy principles and strategies, which is enough to attract potential

         developers, but not enough to give them concrete guidelines about how to develop
         individual projects that are consistent with the overall policies.

    0    Lack o f adequate capacity and knowledge inofficial agencies, and lack o f private
         sector financial institutions that would finance renewable energy investments.
         While these agencies are generally competent and well-developed, the novelty o f
         renewable energy investments in a country that has historically relied on coal i s
         responsible for the lack o f capacity andknowledge.


CSWH

 14.     South Africa enjoys a very high level o f solar radiation-between                   4.5 and 6.5
kWm2 or between 16 and 23 millijoules/m2. It is a most promising country for
promotion o f solar water heating as a carbon avoidance strategy, because o f a unique mix
o f circumstances: highper capita use o f electricity for water heating (inturn a function o f
per capita income and, to some extent, low electricity prices and cold climate); near-total
reliance on coal for power generation to meet that electricity demand; and high levels o f
solar radiationinthe areas that use electricity for water heating.

 15.     A UNDP/GEF Medium Sized Project (GEF Project ID 805) has initiated a
process o f barrier removal to the adoption o f small, household-size solar water heaters.
Methods o f barrier removal include strengthening standards and testing regimes,
establishing codes o f practice for installation and service, and demonstration o f
technologies and financing mechanisms. The GEF project targets about 9,000 household-
size solar water heaters inperi-urban housing upgrades for low-income residents.

16.      A few firms in the CSWH industry3have managed to set themselves up without
external support or government subsidies, and are supplying a limitednumber o f systems
to institutional users such as hotels, hospitals, and hostels.

17.      Discussions with companies and potential customers as well as preliminary
financial analysis indicates that there i s a considerably large market potential for solar
water heating systems in the "commercialhnstitutional market," both in the main urban
centers and in more remote areas. These customers (for example, hospitals and hotels)
generally need relatively low-temperature (below boiling) hot water round the clock, and
frequently have the ability to finance conversions from, or supplements to, existing
electric water heaters. Inmost cases, these systems will help reduce the demand charge
that the commercial users pay to Eskombyreducingtheir peak electricity demand.

18.      The mainbarriersto scale-up are as follows:

         Lack o f recomized industry best practices. standards, and codes. The fledgling
         CSWH market in South Africa does not have established industry best practices,

 The term "commercial" as used here refers to the specific market segment inthe solar water heater
business. "Commercial" and "institutional" customers use larger systems, as distinguished from
"household" customers who use small systems.

       standards, and codes, and the knowledge o f the technology among key
       professional technical and business groups (such as designers, developers, and
       general contractors) in the potential value chain i s limited. Without well-
       established and understood practices and standards, it i s difficult for potential
       customers inthe value chain to make informed decisions. Apart from government
       standards, it i s possible that a voluntary or third-party rating o f systems may also
       be o fvalue.

     0 Potential customers' uneaseat doing business with the CSWH companies. CSWH
       companies are small-scale and have beenonly recently established, especially as
       compared with the main competitor, Eskom.


Government Strategy

19.    The government will set up the policy and institutional framework and financial
support schemes to meet its renewable energy target. The White Paper states the
following:

       "The amount o f renewable energy that is actually consumed within the next 10
       years will be a b c t i o n o f

       0   The incentives provided.
       0   The availability o f supportive international finance - donor and private - as
           well as Government funds, to enable implementation.
       0   The final operational structure o f the power sector and the ease o f accessing
           the national electricity grid and wheeling power to end-users.

(South Africa DME, 2003, WhitePaper on RenewableEnergy, p. 25)

20.    This statement explicitly recognizes the role o f donor international finance, such
as GEF funds to be provided under this project, inmeeting the 10,000 GWhtarget.

C.      Project Scenario

21.     In formal terms, the project has a limited scope and reach, as it provides only
funds for technical assistance. However, this TA is catalytic innature, and is designed to
help South Africa reach its 10,000 GWh goal. In other words, looking beyond the
specific outputs associated with technical assistance, the ultimate outcome is a jumpstart
and significant progress towards meeting the long-term target, which will be met many
years after this project i s over.

D.LESSONSLEARNED REFLECTEDINPROJECTDESIGN
                        AND

28.     Since there has been no significant experience with renewable energy power
generation in sub-Saharan Africa, the only available lessons are from experience inother
parts o f the world. GEF-one o f the prime supporters o f renewable energy power
generation-has    sponsored a number o f studies that review the worldwide experience,
including that in industrialized countries. The main lessons derived from these reviews
are as follows:

        Policies that promote production-based incentives rather than investment-based
        incentives are more likely to spur the best industry performance and
        sustainability.
    0   Power-sector regulatory policies for renewable energy should support IPPPPA
        frameworks that provide incentives and long-term stable tariffs for private power
        producers.
        Regulators need skills to understand the complex array o f policy, regulatory,
        technical, financing, and organizational factors that influence whether renewable
        energy projects are viable.

29.     Project design fully reflects these lessons. The regulatory framework to be
developed will create the appropriate incentives and market signals, capacity building
will be provided to various actors inthe supply chains for renewable energy generation,
and subsidies by GEF for CSWHwill follow the principles o foutput-based aid.
30.     The key features andlessons o f other relevantGEFprojects are given below.




                                             96

Wind Power

31.     India. During the 199Os, under the Renewable Resources Project, the GEF and
World Bank directly financed 41 MW o f wind turbine installations and 45 MW o f mini-
hydro capacity in India. The project also strengthened the capabilities o f the India
Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to successfully promote and finance
additional private-sector investments.

32.     GEF support for wind power occurred in parallel with the rapid market growth
that emerged in the mid-l990s, fbeled by favorable investment tax policies and a
supportive regulatory framework. As a result, and in keeping with international trends,
installed costs declined from around $1,20O/kW in 1991 to US$815-1,010/kW            in 1998.
Inthe 1990s, one-year 100percent investment tax depreciation provided largeeconomic
gains for installation o f wind farm capacity, regardless o f the electricity generation from
that capacity; as a result, by 2000, almost 1,200 MW o f wind capacity had been installed
in India, virtually all of that by the private sector. However, many wind turbines are
reportedly not operating at all, with no efforts made by the developers to repair them. A
key lesson i s that output-based incentives are preferable to investment-based incentives.

33.     China. The emerging experience from the World Bank/GEF Renewable Energy
Development project in China highlights the pressing need to address regulatory
frameworks and find ways to reduce risks to project developers. The project was
designed to finance four newly formed wind farm companies for construction o f 190MW
o f wind farms in Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Fujian, and Shanghai provinces. These
companies were to be jointly owned by the State Power Corporation and subsidiary
electric power utilities (at regional, provincial, or municipal levels) andwould sell power
to utilities under PPAs developed through the project. The costs o f wind-generated
electricity from these wind companies would be higher than those o f conventional
electricity generation, but utilities inthree provinces (Hebei, Fujian, and Shanghai) were
initially willing to purchase this wind power from the project developers, because the
added costs o f wind power were marginal relative to total utility revenue for these three
large utilities. This willingness to bear the higher costs disappeared after power sector
institutional changes. As a result, plans for 170 MW (out o f an original plan o f 190 MW)
o f wind capacity were cancelled. The general lesson suggested by this experience i s that
some explicit mechanism must be in place to finance the difference between renewable
energy and conventional power generation costs. Merely relying on the power utility's
willingness to bear the higher costs i s not a sound policy.

34.     Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, a significant private-sector wind-power industry has
emerged from new dialogue and policy frameworks promoted by a World Bank/GEF
project. The private sector installed a 20 MW wind farm andbegan operating it in 1997.
Apparently, early project preparation activities, including institutional and technical
feasibility studies, have engendered favorable perceptions andregulatory frameworks for
wind (including "iron clad" PPAs). Under the project, an additional 20 MW o f wind
power capacity has been installed.

35.     A key lesson from Costa Rica is that regulatory frameworks, technology
perceptions, and studies that address non-technical issues (and reduce non-technical
risks) may be more important than mitigation o f perceptions o f technical risk through
hardware demonstrations. This lesson i s similar to that suggested by the Mauritius project
described below.

36.     Mauritius. A World Bank/GEF Sugar Bio-Energy project indirectly catalyzed
dramatic changes in electricity generation in Mauritius. From 1994 to 1996, the project
dispersed US$6 million for efficiency investments in sugar mills to provide surplus
bagasse for power generation. The project also provided TA and technology
demonstrations to promote private/public sector cooperation inpower plant ventures and
evaluate ways to decrease the transport costs for bagasse and to optimize the use o f sugar
cane for power generation. This TA helped to formulate a framework for IPP
development and an administrative focal point for private/public sector partnership inIPP
development,

37.     Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, the World Bank/GEF Energy Services Delivery project
begunin 1997points to the difficult andtime-consuming nature o f evolving business and
regulatory models suitable to a given country and the flexibility needed to support
approaches that show promise. The project financed more than 21 MW o f small hydro by
IPPs, along with a developing regulatory framework, including standardized power-
purchase tariffs and contracts (PPAs). The key lesson form this project i s that the power
purchase tariff offered to IPPs must be carefilly structured so that tariffs have some
stability over time, and are able to pay for both the energy as well as the capacity that
they provide, recognizing that power generation from renewable sources can vary
significantly, dependingupon nature.


IndustrializedCountryExperience

38.     In 1998, with a view toward formulating lessons for developing countries, the
Bank's Climate Change Team sponsored a review o f the experience o f several
industrialized countries with renewable energy development. The principal findings o f
the review are as follows:

      Price-basedfeed-in laws, which require mandatory purchase o f renewable energy
      at a fixed price. These are used in Germany, Spain, and France. Feed-in laws
      produce high penetration rates in a short period, create local manufacturing
      opportunities, provide strong incentives for private investments, and can be cost
      effective ifthe tariff i s periodically andwisely adjusted. To date, feed-in laws have
      demonstrated the highest installationrates for renewable energy and are considered
      most desirable by investors given their price certainty.

      Quantity-based renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS), which require that a
      minimumshare o fpower or aminimumlevel o finstalled capacity ina givenregion
      mustbe met byrenewable energy. These are used inAustralia, Denmark, Italy, the
      Netherlands, and some U.S. states. RPS are good at reducing cost and price with
      competitive bidding, yet tend to favor least-cost technologies and established
      industryplayers unless separate technologytargets or tenders are put inplace. They
      are also more complex to design and administer than feed-in laws.

      A tendering mechanism, which involves government-sponsored competitive
      biddingprocesses for the acquisition o f renewable electricity. Long-term contracts
      are awarded to lowest priced projects. This i s used in the British Non-Fossil Fuel
      Obligation, Ireland, and California. Tendering policies are effective at reducing
      cost, but ensuring that signed contracts are realized is a key challenge.

39.     All three mandated market policies ensure the right for the power suppliers to
recover incremental costs o frenewable energy from consumers, andto be able to connect
to the grid. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. The types o f
instruments selected should be based on objectives, country conditions, and power sector
structure. There i s no single solution. The effectiveness o f a particular policy will rely on
how well it is designed and enforced. The South Africa government plans to adopt feed-
intariff lawto promoterenewable energy.

40.     A range o f financial incentives exists to level the playing field for renewable
energy investments. These incentives can decrease upfront capital costs through
subsidies, reduce CapitaVoperating costs through tax credits, improve revenue streams
with carbon credits, and provide financial support via loans and guarantees. Experience
demonstrates that output-based incentives are generally preferable to investment-based
incentives for grid-connected renewable energy. This is because the investment-based
mechanisms do not necessarily provide incentives to generate electricity or maintain the
performance o f the renewable energy plants once they are installed, whereas the output-
based incentives promote the desired outcome-generation         o f electricity from renewable
energy.

41.     The most frequent approaches for covering the incremental cost o f renewable
energy and the funding o f the various policy measures are passing the costs onto
consumers through a systems benefits charge (SBC), imposing a carbon tax on fossil fuel,
and setting up a dedicated hnd financed directly by the government or with donor
support.

42.    Project design fully reflects these lessons: the regulatory framework to be
developed will create the appropriate incentives and market signals, and capacity building
will beprovided to various actors inthe supply chains for renewable energy generation.
