2. The REMT project has two PDOs. PDO 1 is to establish policy and regulatory
   framework and PDO2 is to build institutional capacity for renewable energy
   development in South Africa. Activities under PDO1 have provided significant inputs
   to policy and regulatory guidance issued by the Government of Republic of South
   Africa on renewable energy. Activities under PDO2 have been focusing on
   workshops, (e.g., Solar Water Heating (SWH) and Concentrating Solar Power
   (CSP)), renewable energy resource information dissemination (e.g., REMT website),
   and the launch of the Matching Grants programme.

3. A Mid-Term Review was conducted in May 2011, based on the achievement of the
   REMT project and taking into account significant changes that have taken place in
   the South African and international renewable energy sectors since the REMT
   project’s inception. It concluded that the REMT should (i) shift the model to one
   supporting the need for “real time? advice under PDO 1; and (ii) consolidate and
   accelerate Performance and Matching Grant Programmes under PDO 2. In response
   to these needs, the proposed reallocation is necessary to strengthen the “real-time?
   policy support, “help-desk? function, Renewable Energy Power Generation (REPG)
   and Solar Water Heater Grants, and capacity building support. The following
   justifications are provided according to each category:

(a) Consultants' services (under Matching Grants): The reason for the 5.3% increase
    in the Consultants' services (under Matching Grants) is to reflect the rise of resources
    for the “help desk? to support developers, conduct due diligence prior to making
    awards, and etc. With the Grant programs now moving to implementation, a
    significant portion of these activities will shift to the “help desk? envisaged to
    facilitate the pre-investment activities for renewable energy investments. Sufficient
    human resources need to be dedicated under the “help desk? feature of the matching
    grant programs.

(b) Consultants’ services and goods (under Performance Grants): The 1.1% decrease
    in the Consultants’ services and goods (under Performance Grants) reflects 1 Solar
    Water Heater (SWH) Performance Grant contract from the first round MG, 3
    projected Renewable Energy Power Generation contracts at US$50, 000. The
    proposals that were received in the second round are likely to be turned down, which
    lead to the reduction of resources.

(c) Other Consultants’ services: The Mid-Term Review concludes that the REMT
    project should consolidate and accelerate Performance and Matching Grant
    Programmes under PDO 2. In response to this need, the proposed reduce of 8.2% in
    this category will be shifted to Category (a) to strengthen the “help-desk? function. In
    addition, the Mid-Term Review concluded that, under the PDO 1, the REMT project
    has largely contributed to a number of initiatives, including the review of the initial
    REFIT procurement and related standardized power purchase agreement (PPA), as
    well as the development of the National Solar Water Heating Framework (NSWHF)
    and draft Renewable Energy White Paper (REWP). The policy implementation for
    renewable energy is a fast-moving process and at this stage, the biggest value the
    REMT Project can provide under PDO 1 is to move to a “real time? mode of
    providing guidance as these initiatives move toward implementation. Therefore,
    US$2,413,964 will remain in this category and will continue its support on a “real
    time? support (Renewable Energy finance, legal/regulatory, solar PV specialist, wind
    specialist and SWH specialist) and consulting assignments for independent review of
    REMT projects.

(d) Training and Workshops: The 2% decrease in allocation is the proposed slight
    adjustment based on the actual disbursement to date US$81, 882, taking in account
    the activities planned under this category, such as assisting rural women to develop
    knowledge in maintaining solar systems.

(e) Unallocated: The under-budgeted operating costs are mainly responsible for the
    slight decrease of 1.6% under this category. The item (f) provides detailed
    explanation.

                                             5
(f) Operating Costs: The resolution of the procurement and financial monitoring issues
    has consumed a significant use of administrative resources. This budget resource
    looks especially depleted in light of the slow disbursement of matching DoE
    resources to the project. As at end-March 2011, the total project expenditure was
    USD 1, 093, 752. Of this, USD 516, 728 (or 47%) was spent towards the REMT
    Implementation Support Unit (ISU) operational expenses. The slow pace of
    disbursements, especially as a result of delays in commencing with the REMT
    Matching Grants programme, accounts for much of this unfavorable situation.
    Therefore, there is a pressing need to provide the operational costs to the REMT ISU
    to the end of the REMT project implementation, taking into account the effect of
    Matching Grants “help-desk? requirements on the ISU’s capacity. This will allow
    ISU to strengthen its human resources capacity in response to the requirements of the
    Matching Grants (e.g. analysis of applications and monitoring approved projects).
    This increased provision could be funded by re-allocating funds from other budget
    categories along with accelerated co-financing from DoE.

                         Extension of Closing Date
     SOUTH AFRICA — RENEWABLE ENERGY MARKET TRANSFORMATION
                              P073322

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for South Africa Renewable Energy Market Transformation
Project (REMT) (P073322/ IBRD****) will be extended from September 30, 2011 until
December 31, 2012.

2.      Project disbursements have been steadily increased since project effectiveness in
September 26, 2008, and disbursements total US$2, 531, 802.59 (42%) of US$6 million;
however, the current rate of disbursements remains below what was original expected.
The primary reason for this low-than-expected level of disbursement has been the
stretched procurement capacity of the REMT project Implementation Support Unit (ISU)
located at the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). It has slowed the start of
launching the Performance and Matching Grant Programmes, therefore, the disbursement
pace. The extension will enable the project to complete all the activities and achieve the
Project Development Objectives (PDO). Therefore, December 2012 is proposed as the
closing date of the REMT project.

3.     The REMT project is of very high strategic importance to the Government of
Republic of South Africa (RSA) because it was commissioned in response to a need to
support the Government of the Republic of South Africa in its drive to meet the
renewable energy target of 10,000 GWh by 2013 and to offset greenhouse gas emissions.

4.      A Mid-Term Review was conducted in May 2011, based on the achievement of
the REMT project and taking into account significant changes that have taken place in the
South African and international renewable energy sectors since the REMT project’s
inception. It concluded that (i) the project’s objectives continue to be achievable (ii) the
performance of the Borrower and the project implementation agency is satisfactory; (iii)
with sustained efforts by the ISU and support from the World Bank and the DBSA, the
ISU has substantially improved its procurement capacity. This is especially gratifying for
the Matching Grant and Performance grant components of the project. Therefore, The
Task Team believes that the proposed extension is realistic.
                                             7
5.      The team notes that: (i) neither the Bank in particular, nor Government of
Republic of South Africa, is subject to an ongoing suspension of disbursements; and (ii)
there is no pending audit and outstanding financial management or procurement issues.
The most recent audit report raises neither serious accountability nor internal control
issues.
