ROADS PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Hungary
Executing Agency:  Ministry of Transport, Communications & Water Management
Amount:           US$90 million equivalent
Terms:            15 years maturity with 5 years grace at the Bank's standard
variable rate
Proect
Objectives:       The principal objectives of the proposed project are to (a) enhance the
efficiency of public expenditure on roads by supporting continued
improvements in management, planning and programming techniques and
in selected technical areas, and by increasing the proportion of works
carried out by competitive contracting; (b) address the backlog of
rehabilitation works; and (c) improve road safety.
Project
Descriptin:       The project would include (a) road and bridge rehabilitation; (b) road
maintenance equipment to replace obsolete equipment for functions the
national roads administration will continue to perform itself; (c) a road
safety program; and (d) technical assistance and training, especially to
update standards and practices for road design, environmental protection,
pavement technology, and management systems.
Justification
and Risks:        As a result of severe budget constraints in the face of rapid traffic growth
throughout the 1980s, the condition of Hungary's national roads and
bridges has deteriorated. Rehabilitating roads and bridges will reduce
vehicle operating costs for users and avoid more costly reconstruction later
on.  The use of competitive tendering for this work will increase
efficiency and promote participation of the private sector. The road safety
component should as a minimum slow down the rapid rise in road deaths
which has taken place in recent years. Technical assistance and training
will strengthen institutional capacity and cost effectiveness in planning and
budgeting, environmental procedures, contract administration, design
standards, monitoring the effectiveness of roads expenditures and
improving specific technologies.



-ii-
Risks from inadequate project implementation are minimal; Hungary has
a good implementation record under the two previous transport projects.
The ERR is not very sensitive to the expected range of any cost overruns
and traffic shortfalls. In terms of the project's broader policy objectives,
the principal risk is that too many new projects will be started,
undermining the availability of local funds required to address the
rehabilitation backlog. This risk will be minimized by (a) annual Bank
reviews of total road expenditure and financing programs, inter alia to
ensure that no major new commitments are entered into unless they
produce an economic rate of return of at least 12%; and (b) obtaining
government's commitment to a core maintenance and rehabilitation
program.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
ROADS PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01      Hungary's diversified transport network serves its territory of 93,000 sq. km and
population of about 10.7 million, but is also important to intemational traffic. As a landlocked
country sharing borders with seven countries (see IBRD Map 24044), trunk routes and
intemational connections are of special concem to Hungary's transit function and its goal of
better integration into the world economy.
1.02      The transport system, with Budapest as its hub, consists of about 8,000 km of rail,
30,000 km of national and 76,000 km of local roads, 1,300 km of regularly navigable rivers and
canals, an international airport and a considerable oil and gas pipeline network. Railways and
roads are the backbone of the transport system, together carrying about 72% of total freight
traffic and 96% of passenger traffic (Tables 1 and 2). However, their respective roles have
changed dramatically over the last 20 years. In freight, road ton-km (tkm) trebled between 1970
and 1989 (though they have declined 20% since then, primarily reflecting macroeconomic
conditions). On the other hand rail tkm, after increasing modestly throughout the 1970s,
declined gradually until 1989, but since then have declined by 40%. Thus the road/rail modal
split in freight has changed from 23/77 in 1970 to 54/46 in 1991. The decline in rail traffic to
some degree is the result of temporary factors such as the macroeconomic situation in Hungary
and other former socialist countries, political instability in adjoining countries, and the disruption
in former CMEA trade. However, it mostly reflects more permanent structural changes, such
as increased road competition, the closing or down-sizing of uneconomic heavy industries, the
elimination of irrational transport movements, and the re-orientation of Hungary's long-term
trade relationships away from the rail-dominant former socialist countries to the more road-
oriented market economies of western Europe. While these structural changes are now well-
advanced, they are not complete, and rail freight traffic can be expected to decline further.
Road freight, on the other hand, will resume its long-term growth as the Hungarian economy
recovers.
1.03      In passenger traffic, rail's share of the public transport market (which itself has
declined in relation to total passenger traffic) has declined from 48% in 1970 to around 30%,
with most of the lost share going to road public transport (Table 2). One of the most
conspicuous transport developments during the last twenty years has been the rapid growth of
private transport: the number of passenger cars has increased at an annual average rate of 11 %
since 1970, reaching 1.9 million in 1990 (Table 3).



B. Structure of the Transport Industry
1.04      Until recently, the transport sector was dominated by state enterprises. Large state
enterprises still exist, most notably the Hungarian State Railways (MAV), the Hungarian Airline
(MALEV) which flies solely on international routes, and the Hungarian Shipping Company
(MAHART) which is in charge of all river ports and of the Hungarian deep sea and river fleets.
However, ancillary activities of MAV are being 'spun off" with a view to privatization (para.
1.11), and the government is exploring joint venture possibilities for MALEV.
1.05      In recent years, there has been considerable private investment in freight
forwarding, trucking, and personal transport. The former state monopoly in international
forwarding has been removed, and there are now six companies active in this field. Road freight
transport is performed by both professional (i.e., for hire) road transport companies and by
"own-account' trucks of non-transport enterprises. Formerly, all professional and most own
account transport was by state enterprises (including state farms) and cooperatives. The role of
the private sector in own account transport is increasing as the parent enterprises are privatized.
In professional transport, the proportion of tkm performed by private professional carriers is
growing rapidly (Table 1.1). To date, most of this has been due to new entrants. However, the
government plans to privatize the two large state road transport companies, Hungarocamion and
Volan, as soon as possible. Hungarocamion has been transformed into a joint stock company,
and is expected to be privatized by 1994. The 29 regional Volan companies have been
transformed into 300 limited liability companies, which will be privatized progressively as
market conditions allow.

1.06      In passenger transport, about 80% of bus passenger-kilometers (pkm) are carried by
state enterprises operating in urban centers and between towns and cities with the balance carried
out by "own-account' bus fleets. The dominance of state enterprises in bus transport is likely
to continue, at least for the time being. However, an increasing proportion of road pkm - now
about 60% - are carried by private cars and taxis, and about 70% of the latter are now privately
owned.

C. Transport Policy and Administration
1.07      The Ministry of Transport, Communications and Water Management (MTCWM)
(Chart 1) has overall responsibility for transport policy, planning and administration, including
supervision of the state transport enterprises.
1.08      The key features of Hungary's transport policy, formally endorsed by parliament,
are to:
(a)   rely primarily on the market mechanism rather than administrative measures
to allocate traffic among different transport modes;
(b)   "commercialize" state transport enterprises and strengthen their self-financing
capabilities;
(c)   encourage the development of private transport enterprises and competitive
market conditions in the sector;
(d)   halt further accumulation of the backlog in road pavement strengthening and
periodic maintenance and progressively increase budget allocations with the
objective of eliminating any backlog during the next decade; and
(e)   promote the development of international transport, especially transit traffic
by rail, exploiting the country's geopolitical situation;
Progress with items (a)-(c) is assessed in the following paras. Item (d), which is supported by
the proposed project, is discussed in paras. 2.21-.22.  Item  (e) is closely linked to
commercializing the railway, discussed in para. 1.12.
D. Sector Reforms
Progress to date
1.09      Hungary has made substantial progress over recent years in implementing sector
reforms. Entry to the road transport industry has been liberalized, especially since 1988, leading
to a 27% increase in the truck fleet from 1988 to 1990 (Table 3). Road freight tariffs have been
deregulated, and the level of cost recovery from road users has been increased significantly.
In accordance with a covenant under the ongoing Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-HU),
owners of heavy trucks now pay for their road costs (compared with a cost recovery ratio of
20% in 1987). Car owners pay substantially more than their road costs, thus making a
substantial payment for their "external" costs of congestion and pollution.



- 4 -
1.10      The former monopoly in international freight forwarding has been replaced by a
competitive regime (para. 1.05). International competitive bidding has been introduced for
major road works, and competitive local bidding (with the participation of foreign contractors
via joint ventures with commercialized former maintenance units) for about 60% of road
rehabilitation works. In real terms, subsidies to the Budapest Public Transport Company (BKV)
and MAV both have decreased by about 30% since 1987. BKV has cut staff 10% since mid-
1991, rationalized the organizational structure, replaced most senior managers, and has begun
implementing other recommendations of a Management and Organization Improvement Study
initiated under the ongoing Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-HU).'
1.11      In the face of a severe loss of traffic (Tables 1 and 2) which has not yet "bottomed
out" (para. 1.02), MAV needs to adjust to a smaller and more market-oriented role, especially
in freight. It has begun to implement economies. Since 1988, staff has been reduced by 17%
(more than half of which has taken place over the last 12 months) and aggregate materials, fuel
and labor costs have been reduced 20% in real terms. Catering and the Planning and Design
Institute are being privatized; eight locomotive and wagon workshops will be transformed into
limited companies for possible joint ventures, as will six track maintenance units. However,
these measures are not enough to offset the loss of earnings. Moreover, MAV is unable to
collect payments for much of the freight that it still carries, partly because of the liquidity
squeeze on many of its public sector clients, but also because of the economic and political
difficulties in surrounding countries which are transit clients. Trade accounts receivable doubled
between 1988 and 1990, and again during 1991. While MAV is taking various measures (e.g.,
requiring payment in advance) to address this problem, the mounting receivables and the failure
to implement economies commensurate with the loss of earnings have precipitated a financial
crisis in MAV. Accounts payable have increased at about the same rate as receivables, and by
the end of 1991 MAV was Ft9 billion (US$120 million) in arrears to the Social Security Fund.
During 1992-93 MAV will require a cash injection of US$200 million equivalent (over and
above its regular state subsidies of about US$90 million per year) merely to stabilize its financial
situation.
Agenda for future acdon
1.12      At the national level, clearly the most important outstanding task is to implement a
major restructuring of MAV. The Minister of Transport has been directed by the government
to submit a detailed restructuring plan during the first half of 1993. (The government has also
directed the Minister to make a series of short-term economies in the interim, which are being
implemented). Bank staff are working closely with the government on this issue, with a view
to developing a Bank lending operation to support the restructuring.
Financing of this study was taken over by EC PHARER



- 5 -
1.13       Apart from railway restructuring, the other priorities at the national level are to:
(a)    complete the privatization of the trucking industry (para. 1.05);
(b)    prevent inflation from eroding the recent accomplishment of an adequate
level of cost recovery from road users (para. 1.09); and
(c)    continue the progress in applying more rigorous economic and financial
analysis to investment decisions throughout the sector.
1.14       The privatization of trucking, along with other industries, is being assisted in part
by the recently approved Enterprise Reform Project (Loan 3459-HU). Cost recovery from road
users will be covenanted under the proposed project (para. 2.30). The groundwork for (c) is
to some extent being laid under the ongoing project, which has promoted the development of a
Pavement Management System (PMS) to be further improved under the proposed project, and
an improved costing system for MAV2. The Bank has also been promoting improvements in
decision analysis through informal sector work, especially by (i) demonstrating the application
of value engineering (e.g., to devise more economic construction standards, and make more use
of stage construction techniques), and (ii) analysing the comparative merits of private
concessions and conventional approaches to building motorways. Under the proposed project,
the Bank intends to continue these efforts, partly through a training/technical assistance
component, but also in the context of annual reviews of the road expenditure programs.
1.15       At the local level, the major challenge in transport is to identify priority
improvements in urban transport, which is now the responsibility of local government, and
devise a means of financing such improvements. Several studies are underway which will
address this issue for Budapest3. An appropriate financing scheme is likely to entail a
combination of improved cost recovery from public transport users (which is being pursued
under the ongoing project), as well as heavier charges on urban road users, which will have the
added benefit of deterring car use in the inner city area, at least to some degree. The Bank is
considering a separate project to follow up these issues.
2 Financing of the foreign asistance for this work ws also taken over by EC PHARE.
EBRD is financing a study to evaluate all existing proposals, and identify priorities EC PHARE is financing a study for an
environmentally friendly transport system for Budapest, and the City Council has commissioned a study of pay parking.

E. Transport Planning and Public Investment
1.16      Hungary has abandoned formal Five Year Investment Plans, and disbanded the
National Planning Office. MTCWM remains responsible for developing long and medium term
plans for national public expenditure in the sector, and for obtaining annual budgetary allocations
through the Ministry of Finance. Local govemments are responsible for planning and financing
public expenditure on transport at the local level, which now includes the Budapest Public
Transport Company (BKV), formerly a national state enterprise under MTCWM's predecessor.
MTCWM has devoted considerable effort to formulating long-term development plans (especially
in roads). However, budgetary uncertainties related to recent economic difficulties, along with
the MAV's financial problems (para. 1.11), have resulted in a substantial decline in transport
investment, and created great uncertainties about feasible levels of investment over the next 5
years. In particular, a rational railway investment program can be developed only after MAV's
future role has been clarified as part of the restructuring exercise (para. 1.12).

1.17      For national roads, an expenditure plan has been agreed with the Bank which, thanks
to the recent increases in road user charges and substantial input from the international banks,
will allow a considerable increase over recent levels, and a restoration of the 1981-85 level in
relation to GDP. This road expenditure plan (discussed further in para. 2.27), will be reviewed
annually with the Bank.



F. Transport and the Environment
1.18      Like most of the former socialist countries of central and eastern Europe, Hungary
has a number of transport-related environmental problems. The most significant are the
atmospheric pollution and noise nuisance from road transport operations. So far as atmospheric
pollution is concerned, a Bank-engaged consultant (financed from the US Trust Fund) determined
in 1990 that road vehicles account for 30-40% of the country's total emitted carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides and aromatic carbons, and 90% of the lead. Hungary has since taken several
important initiatives, including requiring all vehicles to undergo annual emissions inspections
from September 1991, modifying fuels (to reduce lead and sulphur levels)4 and introducing a
tax incentive program to encourage purchase of cars with catalytic converters and less polluting
engines, and appropriate retrofitting of existing vehicles. For the medium term, the most
effective measure will be to phase out leaded gasoline.
1.19      Noise problems, along with other factors such as visual intrusion, are being
addressed during construction and reconstruction activities. Although the Bank does not intend
to finance any new construction under the proposed project, it has reviewed Hungary's recently
revised procedures and standards for environmental assessment of roads projects and finds them
as stringent as any in the world (paras. 2.17-.18). However, there are some instances where
the standards could be met more cost-effectively or expeditiously, or where additional
environmental benefits could be obtained at minimal extra cost. Examples of areas for
improvement are: the design of noise barriers, the public consultation and dispute resolution
process, and modifications to urban roads to deter through traffic once bypasses have been
constructed. The proposed project will promote such improvements.
1.20      More generally, Hungary's transport policy provides for the promotion of
environmentally friendly modes like railways and combined transport. For railways, the most
important step is to establish a commercially viable and financially sound enterprise which is
able to focus its resources on markets with a promising future (such as longer-haul international
transit and combined transport), and does not dissipate them on maintaining a labor force,
network, rolling stock and other facilities in excess of its commercial requirements in Hungary's
new transport market. The Bank is supporting this restructuring effort (para. 1.12). Given
efficient basic railway services on the main routes, the private sector (or joint ventures) should
be able and willing to undertake most of the investment needed for combined transport
(terminals, specialized rolling stock, and containers, swap bodies, etc).
I The kad content of fuel in Hungpry, currently at .4 grams/liter (compared with .6 gams in 1965 and currently in some other former
socialist countries), winl be reduced to the EC standard of .15 grams by early 1993.

G. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.21      The first Transport (Rail/Road) Project (Loan 2557-HU, 1985, US$ 75 million)
provided assistance to railways (MAV), road infrastructure (the first phase of a ring road around
Budapest) and Hungarocamion, a parastatal trucking company. The Loan closed in September
1991, three months behind schedule; costs (in US $) were less than the appraisal estimate, and
the project achieved its principal objectives, although the railways' financial performance
deteriorated (due to substantial traffic losses associated with macroeconomic restructuring and
decline of trade within the former CMEA). The Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-HU,
1989, US$95 million) included follow-up assistance in the same three sub-sectors covered in the
first project and added some limited assistance to the Budapest Public Transport Company
(BKV). There were some initial delays in implementation (disbursement lag 51%), but all
components except the rail recycling plant are now proceeding satisfactorily. The rail recycling
plant has been affected by lack of counterpart funds for the local cost component, and the Bank
has agreed to the government's request that this component be reduced in size and the
corresponding loan amount be reallocated to other components with less requirement for local
funding.
1.22      The principal policy and institutional accomplishments of these two projects have
been:
(a)   the introduction of competitive bidding into road works, including periodic
maintenance, which has reduced costs by up to 20%;
(b)   the partial privatization of road maintenance units (a process which is
continuing);
(c)   the introduction of economic analysis into determining road expenditure
programs (including the development of a Pavement Management System
which could serve as a model for other countries in the region); and
(d)   the initiation of a more commercial approach to managing the railways and
urban public transport, though this is a slow process and much more remains
to be done.
1.23      The main lesson from the ongoing project is that railway reform cannot be
accomplished by "tinkering at the margin" with the existing organization, and that a substantial
restructuring is required (para. 1.12). Another lesson has been that the impact of training would
be increased if it is linked to specific institutional objectives, and forms part of an integrated
package with consulting services and technical assistance. This experience has been drawn on
in formulating the institutional component of the proposed project.

II. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01      The total Hungarian road network (Table 4) is divided into:
(a)  national roads (29,700km, 99% paved), which are the responsibility of the
Road Transport Department of MTCWM (Chart 1);
(b)  local public roads (about 75,700km, 32% paved), which are the responsibility
of the local governments; and
(c)  agricultural and forestry roads (about 52,000km and 31 % paved), which are
the responsibility of agricultural cooperatives and forestry organizations.
2.02      The length of paved national roads (excluding urban streets) has increased only
slightly since 1980 (Table 5). Priority has been given to widening narrow pavements, geometric
betterments, pavement reinforcement and similar modernization works on the existing road
network. Even so the rate of modernization and, in particular, pavement strengthening and
sealing has not kept pace with the demands of the growing vehicle fleet. The main roads of the
national road network radiate from Budapest (IBRD Map 24044), where six of the eight highway
bridges across the Danube in Hungary are to be found. The steady growth of in-city traffic and
transit traffic across the river has led to rapidly growing congestion in the city. Construction
of the M-0 Budapest motorway ringroad, the second 14 km section of which is currently under
construction with Bank financing under the Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-HU), will help
alleviate this problem. The M-0 will connect the motorways M-1, M-5 and M-7, bypassing
south of Budapest and providing an additional highway bridge across the Danube river. All
these motorways are important links in the Trans European Motorway (TEM) system, which will
eventually connect western and northern European countries with the Balkans and Middle East.
Completion of the Vienna-Budapest motorway (a total distance of 250km, of which 168km is
in Hungary) is being pursued by a bypass around the city of Gyor (in progress) and by a
proposed privately-financed toll road for the remaining 43km to the Austrian border.
B. Road Transport and Traffic
2.03     The structure of the road transport industry is discussed in paras. 1.05-.06. The
most conspicuous developments have been:



- 10-
(a)  the rapid growth of individual car ownership: an average annual rate of 11 %
since 1970 (Table 3);
(b)  the liberalization of the road freight industry (tariffs and entry conditions)
during the 1980s; and
(c)  the growing private sector role in professional transport: 70% of taxis are
now privately owned, and private carriers now account for 32% of road
freight (tkm), compared with 6% in 1985.
2.04      Traffic on the national road system grew at an average 5% per annum from 1960
to 1980, but has slowed to 3% during the 1980s as a result of the economic conditions. Traffic
on the trunk and main roads of the national system (7,000 of the total 30,000km) has grown
faster throughout, at 9% and 5% per annum, respectively, and 7% per annum from 1987-89.
These main roads have an average traffic of 7,400 vehicles per day, quite high for a system
which has only 350km of motorway or half motorway (i.e., one carriageway).
C. Traffic Monitoring, Regulation and Safety
2.05      Traffic data for planning and design are collected by annual programs of volume
counts and periodic origin-destination surveys. Traffic censuses were started in Hungary in the
1950's with about 100 census stations manned and operated on a regular basis, complemented
every 5 years by a larger census to cover all roads. Since 1980, more modem equipment has
been introduced. There are 400 stations where traffic is continuously monitored, and 4,000
stations covering all roads for the 5-year counts. At present, there are 200 counting sites mostly
on the main roads where regular one-week surveys are performed every month. Automatic
loops measuring vehicle speed and spacing are built into the pavement of every motorway, and
are gradually being built into other roads.
2.06      MTCWM operates weighing stations at 16 of the 25 truck points of entry into
Hungary. It also has 20 mobile weighing teams to control axle loads and total weights within
the country. Allowable axle loads and maximum truck weight conform to the TEM Council
requirements, while maximum vehicle dimensions conform to European council standards.
Trucks operating with higher axle loads pay a fee and are restricted to assigned routes. A
Ministerial Decree which came into force in November 1988 increased the charge for overweight
vehicles, primarily with the intention of protecting structures.
2.07      Hungary has one of the worst road safety records in Europe. In particular, the
incidence of fatalities is 2-4 times West European levels. Furthermore, it has deteriorated at an
alarming rate: accidents and fatalities in Hungary increased by 50% and 80% respectively



- 11 -
between 1987 and 1990 (much faster than the growth in vehicle-kIn), while they remained
basically stable throughout Western Europe. The deteriorating trend, which is common to all
categories of the national road system, levelled off in 1991 when vehicle-km actually declined
in response to macroeconomic conditions and increasing costs of vehicle ownership and
operation. Nevertheless, the problem needs to be addressed, and a Bank-sponsored survey of
road safety throughout Central and Eastem Europe has identified appropriate remedial measures,
which Hungary will incorporate in a Road Safety Program to be supported under the proposed
project.
D. Qrgization
2.08      MTCWM  has oversight responsibility for all transport modes as well as sole
responsibility for road transport regulation (apart from police enforcement responsibility) and
for managing the national road network, through its Road Transport Division (RTD -see Chart
1). Within RTD, the Road and Bridge Department formulates policy and budget for the existing
network, while the Development Department formulates future network development. The Road
Management Coordinating Directorate (RMCD) oversees national road construction and
maintenance activities which are directly managed by 19 Regional Directorates and 75 related
subordinate Maintenance Centers throughout Hungary. The Regional Directorates also provide
limited technical assistance to local authorities in the construction, improvement and maintenance
of rural, municipal, agricultural and forestry roads. Recently, a small Bureau for Motorways
in Concession was established to promote BOT concessions for the international arteries, starting
with completion of the MI motorway to the Austrian border (para. 2.02).
2.09      The Motor Vehicle Department within RTD is responsible for technical requirements
of vehicles, traffic regulations, international standardization, and behavioral aspects of road
safety. A separate Traffic Inspectorate, reporting directly to the State Secretary, administers
vehicle registration and roadworthiness inspections. Regulation of transport (e.g., conditions
of entry into the trucking industry, allocation of international permits) is carried out by the
Transport Coordination and Shipping Division. Traditionally, there have been no accounting
or cashier organizations within line ministries, their functions being carried out by the banks
through which their budgets are coursed.
E. Planning and Asset Monitoring
2.10      A comprehensive 10-20 Year Road Development Plan was prepared in 1991, after
extensive local consultation and using a multicriteria approach; the Plan has been approved by
the Parliament. The Plan identifies the road improvements needed to achieve and/or maintain
desired levels of service for the growing traffic volumes, which have been realistically projected.
It provides for (a) upgrading capacity on existing roads (adding new traffic lanes and



- 12 -
constructing bypasses at larger villages and towns), (b) constructing high speed motorways on
routes carrying international traffic (once traffic volumes justify such construction), and (c)
constructing some "short-cuts" (new connections between existing roads) where there is
sufficient traffic demand. The latter has assumed increasing importance in cases where traffic
can be diverted from overcrowded highways. Capacity is calculated in terms of passenger car
units (pcu) with heavy vehicles assigned a weight of 2.5 pcu's. Maximum acceptable traffic
volumes are given in Table 6. Design traffic is taken as the 50th or 100th highest hour of
forecast weekday traffic, depending on the importance of the road; more frequent weekend
traffic congestion generally is considered acceptable. These design principles are reasonable.
2.11      Apart from the Road Development Plan, which focusses on capacity augmentation,
the technical condition of the existing network - both roads and bridges - is being continuously
monitored by surveys first undertaken in 1979 and subsequently updated and improved. Survey
results, which are stored in a computerized data base, serve (along with traffic data) to identify
programs to maintain road sufficiency, including widening and pavement strengthening, which
together with road maintenance, accounts for a significant part of road expenditures (para. 2.26).
These surveys have been modemized under the Bank-assisted First and Second Transport
Projects, and the proposed project will support further development of the surveys themselves
as well as data processing procedures. Recent surveys indicate that arrears have been
accumulating in these road rehabilitation programs, and reversing this trend has become a
leading priority in the road sector (para. 2.27).
F. Engineering
2.12      For the past 30 years, all motorway and highway bridge engineering in Hungary has
been performed by UVATERV, a major engineering state enterprise, under contract to
MTCWM. This enterprise is currently undergoing a detailed evaluation of ownership and
staffing, with a view to restructuring it and seeking joint ventures with foreign consulting firms.
The quality of its highway engineering work is up to international standards and the company
has considerable experience, both in Hungary and abroad. An increasing number of smaller
companies are now involved in highway design.
2.13      Table 7 presents the main geometric standards in use. Those for motorways
conform to or surpass requirements established for the Trans European Motorways and in fact
there is scope for more cost-saving modifications to geometric standards, which will be
addressed under the project (para. 3.10). Pavement design methods are up to date, but there is
a need for greater consistency between pavement strengthening strategies and truckload
restrictions during the spring thaw. This too will be addressed under the project. Bridge design
loadings conform  to European practice.  Interchanges for limited access highways are
conventionally designed in accordance with western European practice to minimize land
acquisition. Technical specifications for construction and materials are satisfactory; under the



- 13 -
First Transport Project, they were extracted from a 17-volume set of national standards and, to
facilitate ICB, assembled for the first time as a single set of English-language specifications for
road works and bridge construction.
G. Construction
2.14      Until 1986, major road and bridge projects were constructed by companies
designated by MTCWM's predecessor Ministry from among four major state-owned construction
firms. For smaller projects, the Regional Directorate selected from among a dozen smaUer
companies. In 1986, ICB was introduced to Hungary for the Bank-assisted M-0 motorway
contract under the First Transport Project. Statutory Rule No. 19 of 1987 stipulated the general
use of competitive tendering, and since then all large road construction contracts, and an
increasing proportion of smaller rehabilitation contracts (para. 2.23) are being awarded via
competitive tendering. The large and small construction companies have aU been transformed
into joint ventures with foreign participation, leading to clear improvements in management,
equipment fleets and quality control.
2.15      MTCWM  has in the past contracted management and supervision of large
construction projects to UTIBER, an investment management company which specializes in
transportation projects. UTIBER was a state-owned company but in early 1991 was privatized.
MTCWM is now expected to diversify its use of management and supervisory consultants on
large projects. For smaller works, the Regional Directorates have the choice of managing the
project themselves, or contracting the management. Increasingly, management contracts are
being awarded through competitive procedures. A project manager's responsibilities include
all fieldwork in connection with expropriation and land acquisition, control of conformity with
plans, specifications, measurement of work quantities, approval of contractors invoices for
payments, and financial management. The manager is responsible for keeping project cost under
a stipulated limit (base cost plus a 10% contingency) and, within this limit, is authorized to make
minor design adjustments.
H. Environmental Procedures
2.16      Since 1985, Hungary has had regulations, recently strengthened, prescribing the
assessment of environmental impact of new road construction. The assessment must address (i)
land acquisition and resettlement issues; (ii) protection of air, water resources, landscape, plants
and animals, artwork and historic buildings; (iii) mitigation of noise and vibrations; and
(iv) management and disposal of construction wastes.
2.17      Obtaining local views as a part of land acquisition for new roads is a lengthy
procedure in Hungary. Approval is required from local councils, who consult their constituency,



- 14 -
and also from a special branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, if agricultural lands are affected.
Land acquisition cannot start unless these conditions have been met. Most land is acquired
according to mutually agreed contracts; where agreement cannot be reached, the Republic
expropriates the land; dissatisfied landowners may challenge the expropriation decree in court.
Displaced owners have the choice of having the authorities find new land and/or housing or
receiving money to find new property for themselves. After land is acquired there remains a
period of five months for the former owner to complete his use of the land, such as harvesting
crops.
2.18      Hungary's environmental protection requirements for new construction have been
even further strengthened recently. Regarding design, the requirements cover noise control,
protection of agricultural crops from vehicle fumes, and aesthetic considerations. In matters of
drainage there has long been strict controls tied into flood control policy and reclaimed (flood
protected) land. In addition, when groundwater is tapped for water supply purposes, restrictions
are imposed on land use and waste disposal in areas surrounding the wells. For construction
activitie, there are strict specifications regarding borrow pits, asphalt plants, the disposal of
construction wastes, dust protection and daily cleaning of haul roads. Annex 2 provides some
examples and document H 49095 on the Project File provides further details.  These
specifications are state-of-the-art, and in some instances (e.g., chimney height requirements for
asphalt plants) more stringent than prevailing best practice. Bank supervision missions for the
First and Second Transport projects, which included large construction works, found no
instances of non-adherence to environmental specifications.
2.19      Regarding vehicle  erations, Hungary recently has taken several measures to
reduce emissions (para. 1.18), and intends to progressively introduce EC standards.
I. Maintenance Programming and Implementation
2.20      Maintenance of national roads is effectively organized and well-managed, but has
been seriously under-funded in recent years. Even so, it has been undergoing continuous
improvement, by (i) implementing an increasing proportion of work through contractors and (ii)
modernizing and streamlining the maintenance functions remaining within the Roads and Bridges
Directorate. The maintenance of local roads is less standardized, and varies throughout the
country; the proposed project will provide some "seed money" to improve local roads
maintenance practices (para. 3.11).
2.21      Traditional practices for maintaining national roads have depended heavily on
preventative measures, particularly timely overlaying, strengthening and sealing of surfaces.
Since 1983, there has been a substantial real decline in funding for road maintenance and
pavement strengthening. For example, the average annual volume of strengthening works
declined from 880km in the 1970s to 650km during the early 1980s, and 380km during 1985-89.



- 15 -
In face of continuously growing traffic and steadily rising costs of maintenance operations,
RTD's maintenance managers are concentrating resources on the most heavily travelled roads
and seeking lower cost but possibly less durable solutions as stop gap measures, until more
resources can be provided. Between the mid 1970s and mid 1980s, the volume of surface
dressing increased 60% in an attempt to offset the reduced volume of road strengthening
overlays, but the subsequent budget cuts have forced reductions in the volume of this cheaper
work, too. In recent years, the volume of surface dressing has been half that carried out in the
mid 1980s. As a result, the surface condition of the network has deteriorated, as depicted in the
following graph. A recent Bank survey' determined that in 1989 24% of Hungary's national
roads (half of them with traffic over 1000 vpd) are 'uneven and distressed" and almost another
50% are "uneven with some distress".
2.22      Since 1989, with assistance under the ongoing Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-
HU), maintenance efforts have increased and measures introduced to improve the efficacy of
maintenance expenditures. In 1990, 500km of road strengthening were carried out, but this
declined to 230km in 1991 as a result of severe budgetary difficulties. The budget for 1992
provides for a 60% increase in pavement work compared with 1991, and the agreed expenditure
plan for 1993-96 provides for a further increase of 50% in real 'terms (para. 2.27) . This should
be sufficient to overcome arrears of strengthening work over a period of 10-12 years. A
"Synthesis Study" has been completed drawing together the principal conclusions from disparate
studies, and parts of a comprehensive pavement management system (PMS) have been developed
at both the national and regional level. Specific tools are being applied to calculate the economic
rates of return (ERRs) for pavement strengthening and other rehabilitation works, and thus guide
the allocation of funds. The Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM3) has been
calibrated to Hungarian conditions, and high output devices have been introduced to measure
pavement condition and provide input for a fully computerized data bank. All these initiatives
need to be drawn together into an integrated medium- and long- term strategy for optimizing
maintenance activities for alternative levels of maintenance funding.  At negotiations,
govemment agreed to complete this strategic plan by December 31, 1993.
2.23      MTCWM is progressively privatizing many maintenance-related activities. All large
asphalt plants and road strengthening units have already been privatized, usually with a foreign
joint venture partner, and all road strengthening work is now awarded by competitive tender,
which has yielded savings of about 20% in unit costs. Some activities of the maintenance
centers (e.g., line-marking) will be privatized over the next 12 months, while other more
technically sensitive areas will be privatized more gradually. Among these is surface dressing.
At negotiations, government agreed to increase the proportion of surface dressing executed by
contract from its current negligible level to 40% by 1995. For the time being, the MTCWM
maintenance centers will retain current (routine) and winter maintenance, as well as small scale
repair work.

2.24      The maintenance and repair of bridge has similarly suffered from lack of funds;
annual expenditures during the 1980s were only one-third of the warranted level. As a result,
45 % of the bridges of vital importance, and 25 % of all bridges on the main roads, are rated as
requiring urgent attention to structural parts and elements. A Bridge Rehabilitation and
Modernization Program to year 2000 has been prepared, which will be supported under the
proposed project. Expenditures on bridge rehabilitation will increase substantially under the
agreed expenditure plan for 1993-96 (para. 2.27).
J. Equipment and Workshops
2.25      RTD's equipment inventory lists about 10,500 units of equipment, plant, vehicles,
accessories and tools. About one-third are road vehicles and another third are equipment and
attachments used mostly for routine road maintenance and winter operations. The average age
of equipment is 9 years, and for some winter maintenance and specialized plant/accessories the
average age is 13-15 years. Furthermore, much of the equipment is of CMEA origin and thus
even more obsolete than the average age implies. Thus, even after allowing for the fact that
most periodic maintenance in future will be undertaken by contractors, RTD needs to undertake
a substantial replacement/modernization of equipment for the functions it will continue to
perform, namely routine and winter maintenance, especially as maintenance requirements are
rising due to both increased traffic volumes and more kilometers of aging pavements. The
Second Transport Project is currently supporting the purchase of (i) laboratory equipment for
quality control, (ii) axle load weighing devices, (iii) salt spreading equipment for winter
maintenance, and (iv) accessories for multipurpose vehicles. The proposed project will provide
follow-up finance for this modernization program.
K. Highway Expenditures and Financing
2.26      Recent trends in expenditures: Expenditures on national highways in 1990 and 1991
were about one third below the level of 1980-85 in real terms, but are expected to increase by
about 20% in 1992 (para. 1.16). Over the past three years, approximately 60% of the total has
been devoted to administering, maintaining, reconstructing and rehabilitating the existing
network, and about 40% to new development (planning, land acquisition and new construction).
This is an appropriate balance.
2.27      Planned future expditures: Average annual planned public expenditures2 for 1993-
96, summarized in Table 2.1, provide for a further real increase of almost 30% over 1992, to
levels which would represent 0.7% of forecast GDP, thus restoring the proportion which applied
in 1980-85. The distribution between administering and protecting the existing network,
/ GOH is presently cxploring the possibility of private financing of motorways through build-operate-transfer schemes (BOTs).



- 18 -
compared with new development, would remain unchanged at about 60/40. About half of
development expenditures would be to complete ongoing schemes, chief among which are the
Bank-assisted M-0 bypass of Budapest and the bypass of Gyor, which forms part of the Ml
motorway between Budapest and Vienna. Three-quarters of expenditure on new projects is also
for urban bypasses.
2.28          Financing Road Ependitures:  Since June 1989 all expenditure, both capital and
recurrent, on the national highway system has been financed from a Road Fund. At the
moment, almost 90% of the domestic income of the Road Fund comes from a special surcharge
of the price of fuel, recently increased to Ft6 per liter for both gasoline and diesel (compared
with Ft3.25 and FtO.7 respectively, in August 1991). The surcharge is modest compared with
the consumption tax of Ft40 and Ft20 per liter for gasoline and diesel respectively, proceeds
from which go into the government's general revenue. As indicated in Table 2.2, a newly
introduced weight-related vehicle tax will generate substantial revenues, especially from heavier
vehicles. This increase means that heavy vehicles now pay for their road costs, as required
under a covenant for the ongoing transport project (Loan 3032).

2.29              All Bank loans (including the proceeds from  the proposed Loan) are channelled
through the Road Fund, as is debt service. Table 2.2 presents, in current price terms, the
financing plan for the 1993-96 Road Expenditure Plan. EBRD and EIB are participating in the
Plan, financing urban bypasses and road rehabilitation and reconstruction).3 However, more
than 80% of the financing over the 4-year period will come from road users.

2.30        While the expenditure and financing plan are sound, there are inevitably
uncertainties regarding such future factors as the growth of the vehicle fleet and the level of
vehicle usage (which impact on revenues to the Road Fund), the rate of inflation, and the timing
of future foreign loans. To cover these uncertainties, and avoid them impacting on efforts to
protect the existing network, government agreed at negotiations:
(a)   to implement a core expenditure program comprising debt service, and the
maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of roads and bridges (refer to Table
2. 1);
(b)   that no 'major" (defined as the equivalent of US$5 million or more)
commitment will be entered into for the Ita1 (as distinct from the core)
program unless it yields an economic rate of return of at least 12%;
(c)   that MTCWM and the Bank will jointly review each year's toal expenditure
and financing program, in advance; and
(d)   to maintain a system of road user taxation which ensures that receipts from
each vehicle class reflect at least the road costs attributable to that vehicle
class.

m. THE PROJEC
A. Objectives
3.01      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a)   enhance the efficiency of public expenditure on roads by continuing recent
improvements in management, planning and programming techniques and
in selected technical areas, and by increasing the proportion of road works
carried out by competitive contracting;
(b)   to overcome the backlog of road and bridge rehabilitation work (paras. 2.21
and 2.23); and
(c)   improve road safety.
B. Description
3.02      The project components comprise:
(a)   road rehabilitation program;
(b)   bridge rehabilitation program;
(c)   road maintenance equipment;
(d)   a road safety program; and
(e)   institution-building technical assistance.
3.03      Road Rehabilitation Program. This program consists of elements selected from the
relevant part of the core expenditure program (para. 2.30 and Table 2.1) which are suitable for
Bank financing. It consists primarily of a coordinated package of works on road routes,
including:
(a)   pavement strengthening, with the thickness needed to meet the functions of
the specific route;
(b)   only thin asphalt layer or surface dressing where the pavement needs only
better impermeability;



-22-
(c)    some widening of narrow sections to standard width, where economically
justified;
(d)    safety blackspot treatment on sections of project routes where road accidents
could be avoided by low-cost works, for example at some dangerous
intersections;
(e)   improved road signs and safety barriers, and
(f)    essential bridge repair and/or rehabilitation works on the considered route.
The program may also include some sections to be strengthened only, on an urgent basis because
of the rate of pavement deterioration. The project-supported program would be coordinated with
a parallel EIB-financed program which is focussed more on new bypasses and capacity
improvements.
3.04       A short-list of principal routes for rehabilitation has been identified using the
following procedures. Initially, routes were selected for study on the basis of (i) the importance
of their function (connectivity in the network as a whole, or between county seats), (ii) minimum
traffic levels of 4,000 vehicles per day, and (iii) no major new construction (e.g., motorways)
planned nearby which would alter the function or divert traffic over the next 20 years. This
"long list" totalling some 2,000km was then subjected to detailed assessment of the load-bearing
capacity, the condition of pavement, and whether the pavement width was sub-standard (e.g.,
not consistent with contiguous sections carrying similar levels of traffic).' This physical
assessment identified 1,200km on 16 routes (see map) which require intervention, and these were
then subjected to preliminary economic evaluation to determine priorities. Ten routes totalling
about 700km (Table 8) have been selected as the provisional framework for the annual programs
to be supported under the project. However, there may be individual sections on the other
routes that yield higher rates of return than some of the sections included in the provisionally
identified 700km, if greater selectivity is exercised in the type and/or extent of improvement
contemplated. This will be determined after more detailed investigation. The program of works
for 1993 has been reviewed and agreed. The program for subsequent years will be determined
at the beginning of each year, after review by the Bank, to allow the program to be adapted to
the results of (a) annual road condition surveys and (b) more detailed investigations, including
improvements to be introduced in the economic analysis to reflect the benefits of road
rehabilitation by functional route, which avoids truck load restrictions during spring thaw on an
entire route just because a short section remains frost susceptible.
3.05       Bridge Rehabilitation Program. As with the road rehabilitation component, this
component consists of priority items selected from the corresponding part of the core expenditure
program. In addition to the bridge improvements which would be included in the route
I/ The width increases referred to here relate to minor increases in pavement width (e.g., from 65 to 7m) primarily for safety reasons,
and not to capacity-enhancing incrases such as adding extra lanes.



-23-
rehabilitation just described, 31 bridges have been provisionally selected (on the basis of
economic analysis) from the 8 year Bridge Rehabilitation and Modernization Program (para
2.24) for rehabilitation and some widening, for a total cost of Ftl,300 million or US$17 million.
As with the road component, the 1993 program has been reviewed and agreed to by the Bank,
while the program for subsequent years will be determined at the beginning of each year, after
review by the Bank. This will allow the program for later years to take advantage of
improvements to be introduced in Hungary's bridge management system and rehabilitation
strategies through the training/technical assistance component.
3.06      Road Maintenance Equipment. While RTD's equipment fleet is being reduced as
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance is progressively put out to contract, renewal is required
of the equipment used for routine (including winter) maintenance and for administrative
purposes, including the supervision of maintenance contracts. The project will finance:
(a)   66 multi-purpose vehicles for maintenance centers, to replace 20-year old
vehicles whose down-time and maintenance costs have become excessive,
and accessories (for snow-clearing, grass-mowing, sign cleaning, safety
barrier cleaning), to replace items with an average age of 13-16 years;
(b)   traffic counting and weighing devices; and
(c)   miscellaneous equipment such as computers, signalling equipment, and road
sweepers for urban roads.
Tlhe equipment will be accompanied by a national program to train maintenance center personnel
in use of the new items.
3.07      Road Safety Program. On the basis of the recently completed Bank-sponsored study
on Road Safety in Central and Eastern Europe (para. 2.07), Hungary is preparing an integrated
Road Safety Program, including improved institutional machinery (for coordinating the efforts
of the various agencies involved in road safety), improved public education and training, more
strict enforcement of traffic laws, and civil works. While the Program has yet to be finalized,
it has been possible to identify items suitable for financing under the project, namely:
(a)   the purchase of road safety equipment, including for example speed check
radar, and public education aids (US$5.6 million);
(b)   the treatment of isolated dangerous blackspots (US$5 million); and
(c)   training and technical assistance in developing appropriate institutional
arrangements, public education programs, and data bases.
The government will be required to finalize the Road Safety Program, as a condition for
disbursing funds from the relevant loan categories.



-24-
3.08      The safety improvements of roads included in the works packages under the road
rehabilitation component will be coordinated with but will not form part of this specific safety
component.
3.09      Institutional Development Technical Assistance (IDTA). The experience of the
training programs under the First and Second Transport Projects suggests that:
(a)   training abroad of senior and middle level managers and experts helped to
develop better awareness of current practices in Western countries, which
often contributed to the introduction of improvements in Hungarian practice;
but
(b)   if there is too great a variety of training trips, the potential impact may be
undermined if they are not integrated in a specific program of focussed
objectives for operational improvements; and
(c)   effective institutional improvement requires a balance between training,
consultant services, and technical assistance.
3.10      Drawing on this experience, this component will focus (about 80%) on Hungary's
five key institutional or techno-economic objectives in roads administration:
(a)    further developing the road management system (including pavement and
bridges), by enhancing the validity of the performance predictions for
adverse cold climate conditions, the estimation of user costs in light of
rapidly changing price structures while the economy is in transition, and the
methodology for prioritizing and optimizing project selection and standards;
(b)    improving environmental systems in the road sector, including an improved
legal and regulatory framework for environment assessment and public
consultation before expropriation, especially for new motorways and
bypasses;
(c)    training maintenance personnel in (i) adapting to the new environment in
which most periodic maintenance will be contracted out (e.g., bidding
procedures, contract supervision); and (ii) new, more cost effective
techniques for the maintenance functions that will continue to be performed
by maintenance centers;
(d)    updating key Hungarian standards (e.g., geometric standards) to obtain a
better balance between costs and performance, and to distinguish between
items that really need to be standardized and those that need only flexible



-25-
recommendations, in order to allow appropriate adaptation to local conditions
and budgetary constraints; and
(e)     increasing the lifetime of surface dressing.
3.11      Local Roads IDTA. As part of the broader political reform process, responsibility
for the 75,000km local road network has been devolved to local authorities, which number more
than 3,000 and vary considerably in their capacity to undertake this new responsibility. The
proposed project will finance consultants to:
(a)     review existing standards, specifications and procedures applicable to local
roads in the light of recent changed conditions, and to propose appropriate
revisions for discussion with Government and local authorities;
(b)     assess unit prices for the common local road maintenance and improvement
operations so as to prepare a schedule of prices, allowing for regional
variation as necessary;
(c)     propose a simple local roads databank, using previous MTCWM data so far
as practicable, which can be operated within the resources of a typical local
authority2, and which will provide a reasonable assessment of road usage
and condition so that appropriate remedial actions can be determined;
(d)     prepare a schedule of priority actions which will (i) alert local authorities to
those works which are urgent, and (ii) provide a ranking of other necessary
works so that an optimal work program can be drawn up within budgetary
constraints; and
(e)     propose and discuss with government means whereby the economic losses
caused by inadequate local road maintenance funding can be assessed and
compared with the extra costs of a correct level of maintenance.
2 It is not feasible to develop a databank geared to the capability of every local authority, some of which administer leas than 25km
of roads. The smaller local authorities would need to pool rsources and efforts in order to administer efficiently their roads
responsibilities.

C. Engineering
3.12     Detailed engineering for the road and bridge rehabilitation is prepared by various
organizations, including local road directorates, UVATERV and other design organizations (para
2.12) and is substantially completed for the 1993 programs. The detailed engineering for each
year's program will be finalized and reviewed by the Bank just prior to inviting bids, to take into
account the latest available information on deterioration. This procedure is followed under the
Second Transport Project and satisfactory designs have always been ready on time. The timetable
for finalizing all engineering documents was agreed at negotiations (Schedule 2).
D. Cost Estimate
3.13     The total project cost (including taxes and duties where applicable) is estimated to be
US$161.1 million. The direct and indirect foreign exchange component is estimated to be about
US$90.4 million or 55% of the total project cost. These project cost estimates were confirmed
with the government during negotiations.

During negotiations, the financing plan was reviewed and confirmed with the Govemment. The
grant financing has not yet been arranged, but expressions of interest have been received from
several sources.
F. Implementation
3.15    MTCWM's RTD would be responsible for managing project implementation and will
select the organizations responsible for directly managing road and bridge works, including the
preparation of bid documents, providing assistance in contractor qualification and bid evaluation
in addition to normal site supervision. RTD, with assistance from consultants when necessary,
would oversee and coordinate the Road Directorates in prioritizing and engineering the road and
bridge works to be financed under the proposed loan.
3.16    The proposed project completion date is December 31, 1996 and the loan closing date
would be June 30, 1997 to allow sufficient time for the release of security deposits on supply
contracts where performance guarantees are specified, and for effecting final payments for civil
works. A project implementation schedule (Schedule 2) was agreed at negotiations.
3.17    Progress in implementing the institutional improvements incorporated in the proposed
project will be monitored through the Bank's usual supervision activities and progress reports
to be prepared by the Government. The format of these reports was agreed during negotiations.



-28-
G. Procurement
3.18    Table 3.3 summarizes the procurement methods which will be used.
3.19    Civil work: All works would be awarded to post-qualified contractors using Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Hungary has
previous experience with LCB which was found satisfactory for similar road and minor bridge
rehabilitation under the ongoing Transport Project. There will be about 500 contracts, ranging
in size from about $50,000 to $5 million, mostly at the smaller end of the range; the average
value of contracts will be about $300,000 for roadworks and $600,000 for bridgeworks. The
small size and dispersed nature of these contracts would make them uninteresting to foreign
firms who, nonetheless, would not be excluded from competing should they wish to. In addition
all former State-owned road contractors, national and local ones, are now in joint ventures with
(or even sometimes owned by) foreign contractors.
3.20    Goods: All goods will be procured through ICB, except that goods estimated to cost
the equivalent of $300,000 per contract up to a total of $1 million equivalent may be procured
through international shopping. As demonstrated by experience under the ongoing project, the
borrower is capable of efficiently undertaldng this procurement in accordance with World Bank
guidelines.
3.21    Consultant services: All consultant services will be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The main tasks will be: (a) a three year service contract for pavement condition
monitoring (approximately $800,000); (b) separate small contracts for expert individuals in road
and bridge management systems, maintenance contract administration, updating of roads
standards, particular aspects of environmental procedures, and improving surface dressing
technology (total of approximately 40 man-months for a total cost of about $500,000); (c)
approximately $400,000 (40 man-months) for road safety; and (d) approximately 130 man-
months for various aspects of local roads technical assistance (para. 3.11), with a total value of
about $1 million. As the main focus of items (a), (b) and (c) is to modernize Hungarian
practice, these services are expected to be provided mainly by foreign consultants, with some
input (especially on (c)) from local consultants. Local consultants would be well-placed to
provide many of the services for (d), which largely consist of extending to the local level
techniques introduced over recent years at the national level.
3.22    Contract review: Because the bidding documents for road works are standardized, and
have been used satisfactorily under the ongoing project, there will be no prior review, but any
changes to the sank-approved standardized contracts will need to be cleared in advance with the
Bank. For bridge works, a standardized form of bidding document will be reviewed in advance
by the Bank, and any individual contract for more than US$3 million equivalent will be subject
to prior Bank review. Thus all works procurement (accounting for 75 % of total project costs)

will be on the basis of standardized bidding documents that have been subjected to prior review,
but most contract awards will be post reviewed on a random basis, reflecting the standardized
nature of the works contracts, and MTCWM's record for competent procurement under the two
previous projects. All procurement packages of goods for more than $500,000 and consultants
services of more than $100,000 will be subject to prior review; this will account for about 80%
of the value of contracts for goods and services. Other contracts for goods and services will be
subject to post review.
H. Environmental Impacts
3.23    The project has a B rating. Hungary's strict environmental regulations will mitigate
any potential negative impacts, which are likely to be minor. All civil works will be within
existing rights of way and involve no land acquisition.  Because the road works are
predominantly strengthening with only limited widening, there is little implication for earthwork
effects on slope stability and erosion, and to the extent that this issue arises existing procedures
in Hungary are state-of-the-art. Environmental regulations on other construction activities are
similarly strict (para. 2.18). Measures to mitigate any potential negative environmental effects
by adhering to these regulations are summarized in Annex 2. The project will have some
favorable effects. Improved road surfaces and bridges should lower vehicle emissions by
reducing the need for variations in vehicle speed, and the road safety component aims to reduce
accidents.
L. Disbursements
3.24    Disbursements will cover:
(a) 50% of contracts (net of VAT) for road works;
(b) 60% of contracts (net of VAT) for bridge rehabilitation;
(c) for equipment, 100% of foreign expenditures (C.I.F.), 100% of local expenditures
ex-factory or 75 % of local expenditures for other items procured locally ; and
(d) 100% of expenditures for consultants' services and training.

As a condition for disbursing from the categories relating to road safety, government will be
required to submit a Road Safety Program satisfactory to the Bank.
3.25   With the exception of contracts valued at the equivalent of US$300,000 or less, all
withdrawal applications will be fully documented. Disbursements against contracts valued at
$300,000 or less would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE).
Documentation to support expenditures financed under SOE would be maintained by the
Borrower in one location and made available for review by Bank representatives upon request
in addition to being audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank. These arrangements were
confirmed during loan negotiations.
3.26    To maintain an adequate flow of funds for eligible project expenditures with a
minimum of administrative delay, the Borrower will establish a Special Account (revolving fund)
at the NBH sufficient to cover up to 4 months of loan expenditures (i.e. about US$6 million).
Records of the Special Account proceeds and outlays would be available for review by Bank
supervision missions and subject to annual audit (para. 3.28). These arrangements were
confirmed during negotiations.
3.27    A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown in Table 9. This schedule, which is
based on disbursement performance for similar components under the ongoing Second Transport
Project, indicates a four and a half year disbursement period which is close to average
disbursement profile for projects in Hungary. The schedule was discussed and confirmed during
loan negotiations.

J. Rcgorting. Accounts and Audit
3.28    Arrangements for progress reports and the project completion report were agreed with
Government during negotiations and reflected in the agreed minutes. It was agreed that separate
accounts would be used to record all project funds and expenditures, and that these accounts as
well as the Special Account would be audited each year by auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
The accounts and the auditor's report thereon would be provided to the Bank within six months
of the end of the fiscal year. These arrangements were confirmed during negotiations.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATOlN
A. Introduction-
4.01       Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been calculated for the road and bridge
rehabilitation components, which account for 80% of total project costs including contingencies.
Costs and benefits have been converted to economic terms by deducting indirect taxes.
4.02       As with all transport projects, benefits are highly dispersed. The benefits which
have been incorporated in the ERR calculation are savings in vehicle operating costs from the
improved condition of roads and bridges. These savings accrue to intermediate users (trucks,
buses, and business use of passenger cars) and final consumers (private car users). Because the
truck and business sectors are competitive, most of the savings to these intermediate users can
be expected to be passed on to final consumers of the goods and services transported. Savings
in the cost of operating private cars accrue directly to those users. The ERRs are conservative
in that they ignore other benefits such as (i) savings to the public sector from avoiding more
expensive reconstruction or (in the case of bridges) replacement expenditures which would
become necessary at a later stage if the rehabilitation supported by the project is not carried out
and (ii) savings to transport operators, industry and agriculture from the elimination of truck
load restrictions during spring thaw after the route has been rehabilitated.
B. Methodology and Results
4.03       For the road rehabilitation component, the ERRs are calculated using modules of
the Pavement Management System (PMS, paras. 2.11 and 2.22), which is undergoing constant
refinement under the supervision of both Bank staff and consultants engaged by RMCD. The
benefits are calculated as the difference in vehicle operating costs with and without the project.
Vehicle operating costs without the project are forecast on the basis of a road deterioration
module of the PMS. Details of the methodology are available in the Project File. The resulting
ERRs for the routes which are likely to account for the bulk of the program supported by the
project are shown in Table 8. The weighted average ERR is 18%.
4.04       MTCWM has developed a similarly generally applied methodology for deriving
ERRs for bridge rehabilitation projects. The principal benefit is the avoidance of detours for
heavy vehicles, which are necessary in the "without project" case because of load limits that
need to be imposed because of the deteriorated bridge condition. In cases where the bridge
rehabilitation will avoid the need for reduced speed (e.g., because of improved surface or width)
compared with the road approaches, the resulting savings in fuel consumption from avoided
deceleration/acceleration are also computed. However, these are of minor significance compared
with the benefits from removing or reducing load restrictions. Details of the methodology are



- 34 -
available on the Project File. The weighted average ERR for the bridge rehabilitation
component is 28%.
4.05      The weighted average ERR for the road and bridge rehabilitation components
combined is about 20%.
C. Proect Risks
4.06      The specific project risks are minimal. Hungary has a good implementation record
under the two previous projects, and the sub-projects are all of a small scale (works usuaUy
completed within a year), so there is little risk of major implementation delays or cost overruns.
The above mentioned ERRs are based on modest assumptions of traffic growth (usually 5 % per
annum), so they are not sensitive to this assumption. The fact that the final annual programs
will be determined at the beginning of each year further minimizes risks, as it allows the
composition of the programs to be adjusted to any unexpected changes in the pace of road and
bridge deterioration.
4.07      The more substantial risks relate to broader sectoral issues, specifically that:
(a) Hungary will over-extend its road expenditure plans because of a perception
that it has to undertake substantial investment to "catch up" to Western
Europe; and
(b) that recent progress in obtaining an adequate financial contribution from road
users, especially heavy vehicles, might be undermined by resistance from the
trucking lobby to future increases that will be necessary to offset the effects
of inflation.
The strategy for minimizing these risks is discussed in para. 2.30.

V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01        During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following matters:
(a)   that Hungary would complete a strategic medium and long term maintenance plan
by December 31, 1993 (para. 2.22);
(b)   that the proportion of surface dressing work carried out by competitively awarded
contracts would be increased to 15% in 1993, 25% in 1994 and 40% in 1995
(para. 2.23);
(c)   a core road expenditure plan for 1993-96, criteria for adding new commitments,
and joint review in advance of each year's total expenditure and financing plan
(para. 2.30);
(d)   that Hungary will maintain a system of road user taxation which ensures that each
vehicle class pays the road costs attributable to it (para. 2.30);
(e)   details of the 1993 road and bridge rehabilitation programs, and arrangements for
the Bank's prior review of each subsequent year's program (paras. 3.04-.05);
(f)   that as a condition of disbursing any loan proceeds for road safety items, the
government shall submit an integrated Road Safety Program satisfactory to the
Bank (paras. 3.07, 3.24);
(g)   project cost estimates and financing plan (paras. 3.13 and .14);
(h)   arrangements and schedule for project implementation (paras. 3.15-.17);
(i)   procurement arrangements (paras. 3.18-.22);
(j)   the schedule of estimated disbursements, and disbursement arrangements including
a ceiling of US$300,000 on contracts to be treated by SOEs (paras. 3.25 and
.27);
(k)   establishment of a Special Account (para. 3.26); and
(1)   progress reports, project accounts, and auditing arrangements (para. 3.28).



- 36 -
5.02        Subject to these agreements, the project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to the Republic of Hungary of US$90 million equivalent at the standard variable interest rate,
for a term of 15 years including a grace period of either 3 or 5 years depending on the
repayment terms chosen by the borrower.
