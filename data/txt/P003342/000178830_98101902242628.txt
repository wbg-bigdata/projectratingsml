INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$21.0 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the development of
telecommunications service of the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(P&T). The whole proceeds would be relent to the P&T for 24 years including
a four year grace period, with interest rate at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        The latest economic report entitled "The Current Situation and
Prospects of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" (565a-BA) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 15, 1975. Country data
are provided in Annex I.
2.        Burma is the largest country in the south-east Asian mainland
and is rich in natural resources. However, much of this wealth is yet to
be developed and the per capita income of Burma is still well below $100.
Burma came out of the Second World War and the struggle for independence
in 1948, economically devastated and politically divided. The fifties
were a period of turbulence, both political and economic. When the pres-
ent Government came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify
the country and complete the social transformation of the economy which
had begun in the forties.
3.        After 11 years of government by the Revolutionary Council, a
Constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December 1973.
Parliament is vested with supreme executive, legislative and judicial
authority. The People's Councils, which extend down to village tracts,
are the primary means of governing the nation. During the recess of
Parliament, the Council of State exercises power on its behalf. On the
whole, there has been little change in Government personnel. The Burma
Socialist Program Party is the only authorized political party.
4.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the
attainment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a
problem, particularly in the hill and border areas, but there is probably
greater stability now than at any time since independence. Nationaliza-
tion of all major sectors with the exception of agriculture, has been



-2-
accomplished. Agrarian reform has given the peasants virtual ownership
of the land and eliminated major inequalities in the pattern of landhold-
ings. Successful efforts were also made to raise the standard of living
of a population of about 30 million by reducing inequalities in the dis-
tribution of income, keeping the prices of basic commodities stable and
widening the scope of education and health services.
5.        However, these achievements in social fields are endangered by
slow economic growth. From 1963-65 to 1972-74, average annual growth of
GDP was only 2.4% in real terms, i.e. hardly above population growth which
was 2.2%. Output of productive sectors was still more disappointing. The
stagnation of agricultural production (which accounts for 90% of total
export earnings), combined with the growth of population, has led to a
steady dwindling of the export surplus. This is vividly illustrated in
the case of rice which still accounts for nearly half of total exports.
Before the Second World War, Burma exported 3 million tons of rice a year;
in the early sixties this had dropped to 1.5-2 million tons. In 1973, the
volume of rice exports was a mere 250,000 tons.
6.        The volume of total exports had fallen by over 60% since the be-
ginning of the sixties and, due to unfavorable movements in the terms of
trade, the purchasing power of exports had fallen by over 70%. In 1974,
there was an improvement in the terms of trade which to some extent
cushioned the effect of the decline in the export volume. The resulting
foreign exchange constraint has deprived the industrial sector of essen-
tial imports of raw materials, spare parts and components. From 1963-65
to 1972-74, the volume of industrial production increased by an average
of less than 1% a year.
7.        The root of Burma's current economic difficulties lies in the
stagnation of agriculture brought about by Government's pricing policy and
investment decisions. As a means to ensure a given pattern of income
distribution, prices for compulsory delivery to the Government of many agri-
cultural commodities were set at a low level. Farmers, especially paddy
farmers, were left with little savings for maintenance and investment and
intensive methods of cultivation were discouraged. Inadequate private in-
vestment in agriculture was not offset by investments in the public sector.
Only 8% of public investment (equivalent to about 1.6% of net agricultural
output) was allocated to agriculture in 1973, against 16% in 1963. In
contrast, industry, which contributes 10% to GNP, received over a third of
public investment in 1973. In the Burmese context, industrialization at
the pace adopted was probably premature because it could only be based upon
a prosperous agricultural sector.
8.        Growing scarcities of domestically produced and imported goods
created a flourishing black market which led to increased unwillingness of
farmers to sell to the Government. This resulted in a widespread diversion
of goods - including those produced by public sector undertakings - from
the public sector distribution channels to the black market. Since official



- 3-
distribution agencies are supposed to be the main revenue earners for the
budget through the collection of indirect taxes and their operating sur-
pluses, this development eroded Government's tax base. The current revenue/
GNP ratio declined from about 18% in 1966/67, to 15.5% in 1969/70, and to
10.5% in 1974/75. The aggravation of the budgetary situation is best illus-
trated by the fact that in 1970/71 total Government revenue financed 75% of
total Government spending (current and capital expenditure), in 1972/73 60%,
and in 1974/75 only 50%, according to budget estimates. Gross domestic savings
came down from an average 10% of GNP recorded in early 70's to about 7.5% in
1974.
9.        Pricing, resource mobilization and resource allocation are the
three basic economic policy issues facing the Government. The Government is
well aware of the problems and has recently taken measures to solve them.
On pricing, the Government has been raising procurement prices of agricultural
commodities so as to narrow the gap between official and black market prices;
this has helped the Government to procure about 2.8 million tons of paddy in
1974/75 as compared with 1.5 million tons in 1973/74 and 1.2 million tons in
1972/73. In January 1975, the Government devalued its currency by 33%
against the US dollar. Reforms are being carried out in the organization
of the public sector undertakings; they are to be operated on a commercial
basis and receive financial autonomy so that they will perform better both
in financial and production terms.
10.       Resource mobilization in Burma is closely linked to the successful
implementation of the official price policy. The above mentioned reduction
of price distortions will help the Government regain control of trade and
therefore restore the tax base. The recent devaluation will allow the Gov-
ernment to raise more revenues on its external transactions. In addition,
the Government has decided to introduce a turn-over tax. The Government
also substantially increased interest rates on April 1, from 3.5% to 6-8%
per annum for saving deposits and up to 12% for loans to public enterprises.
As far as resource allocation is concerned, the 1974/75 budget has already
included an increase in the share of public investment to agriculture from
8% the previous year to 13%. It is Government's declared policy to give
agriculture greater priority.
11.       Substantial inflows of foreign assistance would considerably help
support further economic policy improvements. During the last five years
aid commitments have averaged $60 million a year. Total external debt as
of July 1974 was $482 million, including an undisbursed balance of about
$275 million. Despite this low indebtedness, debt service ratio is about
20% because of the fall in exports. In November 1974, Burma and the IMF
agreed to a stand-by credit of $38 million equivalent, of which $29 million
were withdrawn as of April 1975. Burma's gross foreign exchange reserves
were estimated at $173 million, in March 1975, equivalent to twelve months'
imports, if compared to the exceptionally low level of imports last year.
This favorable position is likely to be eroded quickly, with the large im-
ports program decided by the Government to bring about an improved balance
between supply and demand for consumer goods.



12.       Burma's development potential is appreciable.   The Burmese popula-
tion is well educated. Production potential in agriculture is excellent,
especially for paddy. Exploitation of forest wealth is under way and could
be expanded further. Mineral resources are not yet identified sufficiently,
but they are likely to be substantial. Off-shore crude oil exploration has
recently been stepped up with bilateral assistance. The Bank Group in close
cooperation with the IMF is pursuing discussions with the Government
regarding further improvement in economic policies which would considerably
help develop Burma's very promising potential for economic development.
The Burmese Government is now preparing a three year economic program which
will include new policies and measures aiming at more rapid economic growth.
The Government has already expressed its interest in having such program be
supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956, and
of IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961 the Bank made three loans totalling
$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon (Loan 140-BA) helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and
storage facilities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment.
Two loans (Loan 139-BA and Loan 274-BA) helped finance the postwar recon-
struction and dieselization of the railways. All three projects were satis-
factorily completed and the loans fully disbursed by FY68. No lending was
requested or made between 1962 and 1973. In June 1973, IDA made two credits
totalling $33.0 million, both for transportation projects. One credit
(Credit 413-BA) is helping to rehabilitate the inland waterways fleet, the
other (Credit 414-BA) is helping to finance the rehabilitation of the rail-
ways' assets and acquisition of locomotives and rolling stock. Implementa-
tion of both projects is proceeding satisfactorily. In June 1974, an IDA
credit of US$17.0 million was made for an irrigation project which provided
small irrigation pumps and minor flood embankments to increase the produc-
tion of rice and jute for export, and other crops (Credit 483-BA). In July
1974, IDA made a credit of US$24.0 million for a forestry project. This is
helping finance the rehabilitation and improvement of timber extraction to
increase foreign exchange earning (Credit 493-BA). IFC has made no invest-
ments in Burma, nor are any currently planned. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1975 and notes on
the execution of the four ongoing projects. In addition, the Bank is Exec-
uting Agency for a UNDP-financed survey for the improvement of navigational
channels in the Rangoon River.
14.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most
immediate constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diver-
sifying production for export in order to alleviate the critical shortage
of foreign exchange. To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary
emphasis on the development of the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors.
The Bank Group is also financing infrastructure improvements, such as



-5-
the transportation projects and the proposed telecommunications project,
mainly to rehabilitate the facilities whose inadequacy has been increasingly
impeding economic development.
15.       In addition to the present project, three projects are being pre-
pared in livestock, irrigation and agriculture. The livestock project would
provide facilities for livestock, dairy and pasture development including
veterinary and extension services. The irrigation project would consist of
the construction of an irrigation dam and a new irrigation system to service
140,000 acres of land in the dry zone of upper Burma; given the large size
of this project, co-financing will be required and the Bank Group has already
started exploring possibilities of co-financing arrangements with bilateral
sources of external aid. The agriculture project, which would be quick-yielding,
would help rehabilitation of paddy land in lower Burma through construction
and improvement of minor flood embankment, drainage channels, land clearing
and provision of small irrigation pumps. These projects are tentatively
scheduled for presentation to the Executive Directors in FY76. A UNDP-
financed pre-investment and investment assistance project is also about to
become operational; this, with the Bank as Executing Agency, would aim at
the development of a pipeline of projects in priority areas, suitable for
external assistance. For FY77, the Bank Group has under consideration a
mining project which would comprise rehabilitation and expansion of small-
scale tin and tungsten mining, a second forestry project, and a seed and
agriculture research project.
16.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 10% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 8% of debt service. In five years,
the Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to
15-20% and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
17.       The Government-owned Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(P&T) is responsible for the provision and operation of all local, trunk
and international public telecommunications in Burma. The small Posts
and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications is responsible for giving advice to the Minister on national
telecommunications policy, and for providing liaison with international
bodies such as the ITU. P&T is a well managed entity which will be able
to execute the proposed project. However, some weaknesses are evident in
their training program and accounting system. Both of these conditions
will be remedied during the project with the assistance of consultants
financed by UNDP and the United Kingdom under the Colombo Plan.
18.       Burma, with one telephone per 1,000 of population, ranks amongst
the IDA countries with lowest levels of service. Only in Rangoon are
there relatively modern automatic facilities but extension has fallen



- 6 -
well short of demand. Elsewhere only manual service is available using
obsolete and generally over-age plants. The trunk network is old, unreli-
able and its capacity inadequate.
19.       Rangoon is served by a network of five automatic exchanges which
use an earlier design crossbar switching system. The network has not been
extended for more than a decade and, although it has been well maintained,
the central city exchanges are overloaded in the busy periods as usage of
the limited available services has risen beyond design levels. Excessive
congestion is a recurrent feature causing poor service. As of December 31,
1973, there were 15,479 connected subscribers in Rangoon. Manual service
is provided in 131 other towns and as of December 31, 1973, there were 7,491
connected subscribers. The larger exchange and distribution networks which
serve the 12 most important towns, are old and unreliable, the latest of
these being 25 years old and four dated from before W4orld War II. The
remaining 119 towns are served by small manual exchanges of 100-lines
capacity or less which vary in vintage from pre-World War II to recent years.
20.       The present trunk network is based principally on old pole lines
which generally have been exploited with carrier systems to the limited
extent permitted by their design. The capacity of the network is inadequate
to meet the calling requirements of the present customers and delays are
normal and can often exceed one day. Transmission quality is poor due to
the age of plant and route breakdowns are frequent because of deterioration
due to age and also because of theft of copper wire from pole routes. The
service is thus very poor and unreliable.
21.       International telephone services are operated from the Rangoon
manual switchboard and connected with overseas stations by HF radio. Serv-
ice is largely restricted to the Rangoon area due to the poor quality of
the internal long distance network and the fact that the international
circuits are operated by HF radio.
22.       There are a total of 283 public telegraph offices throughout the
country and transmission of messages is largely over land line Morse sounder
circuits or through use of HF radio links. Overseas telegraph services
operate via a main route to Colombo which is kept open throughout the day
and at a fixed time schedule to Calcutta, Dacca, Karachi, Bangkok, Hong
Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Manila and Pyongyang. Telex service is restricted
to international service originating and terminating in the city of Rangoon
where a 50-line concentrator with three operating positions is installed.
PART IV - THiE PROJECT
23.       In May 1974, the Government of Burma requested IDA assistance in
financing the foreign exchange costs of its 1976-1979 program of telecom-
munications development. Following the visit of an identification mission



-7-
in June 1974, the project was appraised by a Bank mission in November/
December 1974. The mission's report, "Burma Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project" (No. 671-BA) dated
April 29, 1975, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III
24.       At negotiations held in Washington in April 1975, the Government
of Burma was represented by a delegation led by U Chit Moung, Deputy Minister
of Planning and Finance.
Description and Implementation
25.       The four-year project (FY1976-79) proposed for Bank Group lending
would be the first telecommunications lending in Burma and would comprise
P&T development program for that period. The project aims to meet part
of the urgent demand for new telephone connections; to improve the service
to be offered to existing and new subscribers by replacing worn-out equip-
ment and by expanding the trunk network; and to improve telegraph services
by upgrading the public telegram service and by introducing a national
telex service. The Government places high priority on this project as an
important measure to improve the efficiency of productive sectors.
26.       The project consists of:
(a) Installation of 17,000 line units of local
automatic exchange equipment;
(b) Installation of cable and associated distribu-
tion network equipment for 12,000 new direct
exchange lines and for upgrading 3,400 existing
lines connected to manual exchanges which are
to be converted to automatic;
(c) Provision of subscriber apparatus including
22,750 automatic telephone instruments;
(d) Installation of trunk transmission facilities,
including microwave systems interconnecting the
major centers;
(e) Installation of automatic switching centers for
Rangoon and Mandalay which will provide subscriber
trunk dialing to all centers having automatic
service;
(f) Installation of 120 telex and gentex exchange lines
and 80 telex and gentex subscriber units; and
(g) Construction vehicles and assorted machines.



27.       P&T which is the beneficiary of the proposed credit has the capa-
bility of planning, designing and executing the project. P&T's own staff
will install all local distribution networks, subscribers' apparatus and
open wire carrier sets. P&T's staff will assist in the installation of
the long distance transmission facilities, telephone exchange and telex
exchange under supervision of the suppliers' engineers. UNDP/ITU will
provide experts to assist principally with procurement of switching, radio
relay and multiplex equipment, and line plant.
28.       The levels of the tariffs are presently adequate and have produced
acceptable rates of return on past operations and have generated adequate
funds to meet the limited past expansion programs. P&T had no long-term
debt as of March 31, 1974. The financial plan of the project assumes tariff
increases in 1978 and 1979 and it estimates that internal generation will
produce 21% of the fund requirements. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to maintain tariffs at a level to produce a rate of return on average
net fixed assets in operation of not less than 10%. The Government also
agreed that P&T would not incur debt without the agreement of IDA unless the
net revenues cover the maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times.
Cost and Financing
29.       The total cost of the project is US$30.9 million, of which US$21.0
million is the foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA credit would
finance the entire foreign exchange component. The total proceeds of the
credit would be relent to P&T for a term of 24 years, including a four year
grace period and at an interest rate of 8-1/2% per annum. The local cost
of the project would be financed by P&T's internal generation ($6.7 million
equivalent) and local borrowing from the People's Bank ($3.2 million equiva-
lent).
Procurement and Disbursement
30.       Procurement of all the equipment to be financed by the credit
would be by international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines, with the exception of the following items (less than US$0.4 million)
which will be purchased for reasons of economy and standardization directly
from suppliers of existing equipment: 1,000 lines of switching equipment
to be added to the existing exchange unit in Rangoon; equipment to connect
the existing automatic equipment to the new equipment; and cable network
accessories.
31.       The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the CIF cost of
imported equipment and materials and the foreign exchange cost of services
and training. As the project is part of a continuing investment program,
it is proposed that any savings be made available after consultation with
IDA for the purchase of additional items of the same type.



-9-
Justification
32.       The present very inadequate telecommunications service is a major
bottleneck to the growth of productive sectors and is causing serious in-
efficiency in public administration and in essential economic services such
as transportation and distribution. Investment in telecommunications
facilities has been almost totally neglected for more than a decade. If
the proposed replacement of the backbone of the trunk network is not carried
out, the service will continue to deteriorate with the possibility that a
complete breakdown will occur within a few years. The project is the urgent,
minimum level of investment that Burma should undertake to lessen the severe
current communication handicap to economic development. The project would
improve the communications between the key distribution and production centers
in the main production area of the country from the Lower Burma to the
Upper dry zone, along the Irrawaddy River; agricultural production and
distribution (essentially rice) are concentrated in this area and vital
transportation activities and important industrial developments are carried
on along the Irrawaddy River. The project would increase the efficiency of
management in business enterprises and in public administration. In turn,
it would lead to increased productivity and lower capital requirements and
operating costs in most sectors. For example the project would improve the
efficiency of supporting services for the agriculture sector such as the
collection and distribution of agricultural commodities, the procurement of
basic inputs (seeds, fertilizer, fuel, spare parts) and agricultural ex-
tension. The transportation sector would benefit from the project by being
able to use the limited capacity of carriers (boats, trucks and locomotives)
more efficiently.
33.       The project is the least cost method of achieving service objective
and is technically and financially sound. The minimum estimate of the
internal economic rate of return based on expected revenue is 22%. Sensitivity
analysis indicates that even with an unfavorable combination of main para-
meters, the rate of return should not be less than 15%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Union of Burma
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Exec-
utive Directors separately.
35.       The special features described in paragraph 28 of this report are
reflected in Sections 4.05 and 4.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement.



- 10 -
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
