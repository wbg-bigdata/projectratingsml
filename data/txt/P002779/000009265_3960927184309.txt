MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A CASHEW AND COCONUT
TREECROPS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 19.4 miUlijn
(US$25.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help
financ- the 2nd phase of a long-term program to rehabilitate the cashew and
cocunu. adustries in Tanzania. The project would be financed in parallel
by the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) for US$6.3 million
equivalent and by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) for US$5.7 million
equivalent.
2.        Background.  Development of the agricultural sector, which
accounts for 40-50 percent of GNP, about 80 percent of exports, and over 80
percent of employment, is critical to the economy. However, for more than
a decade up to the mid-1980s, agriculture was neglected in Tanzania as the
Government favored urban industrial growth, based on extensive state
ownership and regulation of the economy. As a consequence, agricultural
output declined and the country was increasingly obliged to rely on
imports. In addition, agricultural exports, the country's main source of
foreign exchange earnings, fell steadily, contributing to the growing
balance of payments difficulties. The economy overall stagnated, leading
the Government to adopt an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in June, 1986.
Under the ERP, economic growth has resumed, particularly in the
agricultural sector.
3.        With assistance from IDA and other donors (including the
Netherlands, United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Finland,
Denmark, Sweden as well as the European Economic Community, the European
Investment Bank, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, the African Development
Bank, the African Development Fund, and the World Food Program), Tanzania
is pursuing a realistic strategy in the agricultural sector. This strategy
includes improvements in pricing and marketing policy, both for inputs and
outputs, and in agricultural services, e.g., research and extension,
marketing and distribution systems and credit. Emphasis is being placed on
producer incentives to encourage production of basic staples (grains
particularly) for domestic consumption and cash crops for export (tea,
coffee, cashew) and the local market (coconuts). Institutional
strengthening is in progress to improve the effectiveness of support
services. Smallholders including women are receiving increased attention
under the tevised strategy. IDA is assisting in the implementation of the
above strategy with projects in the areas of export rehabilitation,
marketing, credit, extension and research, and is helping the Government to
mobilize and coordinate donor assistance in support of this strategy.
4.   Since the 19i0's, production    cashews and coconuts has declined by
85Z due to technical problems, inappropriate pricing (averaging 30-40? of
the export parity price), poor marketing policies and lack of inputs.
Pilot research projects for both crops started towards the mid-1980's with
support from IDA (under Credits 801-TA & 1070-TA), the Federal Republic of
Germany and Italy. They succeeded in developing



- 2 -
chemical control methods for cashew powdery mlldew disease, pest control
methods, disease tolerant cashew planting materials and high yielding
coconut hybrids. Cn the basis of these achievements, the Government, with
IDA, ODA and FRG assistance, prepared the proposed Cashew and Coconut
Treecrops Project. Policy measures dealing with pricing and marketing,
designed to increase cashew and coconut prodaction and farm incomes, vere
introduced as part of the ERP and will be further developed under the
proposed project and the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program, now under
preparation. To overcome present input supply shortages, the project would
encourage involvement of local traders/importers to procure cashsw
production inputs, initially using credit from the Cooperative Rural
Development Bank tCRDB).
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project would fit into the
core program agreed between the Government and IDA to improve farmers'
services and rehabilitate major ezport crops. It would complement the
ongoing dialogue on agricultural marketing policy reforms; the export
rehabilitation, research and extension projects which are under
implementation: and would build on the results of IDA-supported pilot
projects for cashew and coconut development. Because of these investments
and its intensive policy dialogue, IDA is well placed to help the
Government implement the policy to carry out the neccessary institutional
and technical reforms to stimulate the development of the coconut and
cashewnut industries and to assist in mobilizing donor support for that
purpose.
6.        Proiect Obiect.ves.  The objectives are to achieve long term
growth by increasing the nationwide production of cashewnuts for export and
the production of coconuts for the domestic vegetable oil market byl
Ci) increasing institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock Development for treecrops research and development:
(ii) supporting the propagation and dissemination of higher yielding,
disease and drought-tolerant planting materialss and (iii) providing
training to research and extension staff and to farmers in particular, on
improved production practices: and (iv) providing credit to cashew traders
and farmers.
7.        Proiect Descriotion.  The project would includes  (i) expanded
cashew and coconut research to develop higher yielding, more disease and
drought-tolerant varieties/hybrids; (ii) the development and operation of
seven cashew developmert centers and three coconut seedfarms for the
propagation and dissemination of quality planting materials; (iii) the
training of extension and research staff and the dissemination of cashew
and coconut production packages; (iv) the management and coordination of
the cashewnut improvement and coconut development programs; (v) credit for
local traders and farmers to procure cashew production inputs; and (vi) a
pilot credit operation to provide investments to farmers for coconut or
cashewnut development. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$42.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.2
million (71Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Tanzania are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. Maps Nos. IBRD 20926
and 21494 showing the Project areas, and the Staff Appraisal Report No.
7681-TA, dated May 30, 1989 are attached.



8.        Agreed Actions.  At Negotiations IDA reached agreements with GOT
on the following matters as conditions for credit effectiveness:
(a) establishment of cashew and coconut management units to iplement the
Cashew Improvement Program (CIP) and the National joconut Development
Program (NCDP) and the appointment of their Coordi ators; (b) establishment
of separate cashew and coconut ProJect Accounts; (j) establishment of a
joint cashew and coconut Technical Coordinating C4imittee; and (d)
effectiveness of agreements with ODA and FRG to fitnance respectively the
cashew and coconut research components under the project. IDA also reached
agreements on: (e) the mid-term evaluation of project implementation and
GOT's recommendations on the institutional arrangement for treecrops
development; and (f) the announcement of an increased farmgate cashewnut
price to at least 502 of FCB price and the provision of a phased action
plan for the improvement of the marketing system for cashewnuts, acceptable
to IDA, by November 30, 1989.  And as conditions of divaursement:
(g) against the input support component, the GOT will execute a subsidiary
loan agreement with CRDB; and (h) for the pilot credit scheme, GOT will
execute the subsidiary loan agreement with CRDB and cause it to nominate
the credit coordinatsr.
9.        Benefits.  The project would benefit producers of cashewnuts and
coconuts directly as well as the national economy in general, through
increased cash income and increased vegetable oil production. Based on the
farm models, manday returns would increase from Tsh 60/day to Tsh 100-
170/day for cashew and to Tsh 200-300/day for coconut. Overall production
would be doubled in ten years time to 45,000 tons of cashew and one billion
coconuts per year. The balance of payments would thereby be improved by
higher cashewnut exports and lower edible oil imports. The project will
help integrate women farmers into the market economy because of their
direct involvement in the cashewnut and coconut industries. The
development of private input trade in remote areas and improvement of
cashewnut and coconut research and strengthening institutions will
represent important additional benefits.
10.       Risks.  The main risks would be lower than expected adoption
rates of improved cashew and coconut production packages and inadequate
producer prices. To minimize these risks the project provides for
technical assistance to facilitate attainment of research targets, and for
intensive professional and management training to ensure development of the
programs, by application of 'lessons learned' from the two pilot projects.
In regard to producer prices, agreement was reached that the cashew
farmgate price would be increased by November 30, 1989 to at least 502 of
the export price.
11.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of IDA and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
