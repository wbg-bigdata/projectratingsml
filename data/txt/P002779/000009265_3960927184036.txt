CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMAR'.
Borrower:             The United Republic of Tanzania
Beneficiaries:        Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development
(MALD) and Cooperative Rural Development Bank (CRDB)
Amount:               SDR 19.4 million (US$25.l million)
Terms:                Standard IDA, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Terms:      Of the US$25.1 million grant to MALD, US$3.3 million
would be on-lent to CRDB US$1.1 million for inpu'
supply support and US$2.2 million for a Credit Pilot
Scheme at a fixed interest rate of 8.4Z with a 10 year
maturity including 4 year grace period; foreign
exchange risk would be borne by CRDB.
Financing Plan:       Government            US$ 5.3 million
ODA                   US$ 6.3 million
FRG                   US$ 5.7 million
IDA                   TS$25.1 million
Total                 US$42.4 million
Project Objectives and Description. The objectives are to achieve long
term growth by increasing the national production of cashewnuts for export
and the production of coconuts for the domestic vegetable oil market. The
project would provide financing and technical assistance in support of:
(i) expanded cashew and coconut research breeding and selection to develop
higher yielding, more disease and drought-tolerant varieties/hybrids; (ii)
the development and operations of seven cashew development centers and
three coconut seedfarms for the propagation and dissemination of quality
planting materials; (iii) the production development through the training
of extension and research staff and the dissemination of cashew and coconut
production packages; (iv) the management and coordination of the cashewnut
improvement and coconut development programs; (v) the cashew input supply
and local marketing support; and (vi) strengthening credit facilities in
the southern cashewhtut production areas in the form of a pilot credit
scheme managed by CRDB.
Benefits and Risks. The project would benefit producers of cashewnuts and
coconuts directly as well as the national economy in general, through
increased cash income and increased vegetable oil prodluction. Based on the
various farm models manday returns would increase from Tsh 60/day to Tsh
100-170/day for cashew and tn Tsh 200-300/day for coconut. Overall
production would be doubled in ten years time to 45,000 tons of cashew and
one billion coconuts per year. The balance of payments would thereby



(ii)
be Improved by higher cashewnut exports and lower edible oil imports. The
project will help integrate women farmers into the market economy because
of their direct involvement in the cashewnut and coconut industries. The
de~velopment of private input trade in remote areas and improvement of
eashewnut and coconut research and development institutions will represent
important additional benefits. The main risks would be lower than expected
adoption rates of improved cashew and coconut production packages and
inadequate producer prices. To minimize these risks the project provides
for techrical assistance to facilitate attainment of research targets, and
for intensive professional and management training to ensure development of
the programs, by application of "lessons learned" from the two pilot
projects. In regard to producer prices, agreement was reached that the
cashew farmgate price would be increased by November 30, 1989 to at Least
501 of the export price.

TANZANIA
CASHEW AND COCONUT TREECROPS PROJECT
I AGRICULTURAL SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Project Genesis
1.01     In May 1987, IDA received a proposal for a follow-up phase of the
Tanzania National Coconut Development Program (NCDP) executed as a pilot
project under IDA Credit 1070-TA and cofinanced by the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG). The coconut pilot was extended until March 31, 1989. A
similar pilot project on cashew development under the Cashew Production
Improvement Pilot Project (CPIPP) was financed from the undisbursed balance
of IDA Credit 801-TA, to analyze the main causes of cashew production
decline since 1973 and recommend agronomic methods to reverse the decline.
The cashewnut pilot was extended to June 30, 1989 and is regarded as being
highly successful in bringing both cashew research and extension together.
A proposal for a follow-up phase of the cashew project was prepared by MALD
in March 1988 and presented to IDA in June 1988. Because of the similarity
in technical problems in both treecrops and the need to select, breed and
propagate disease tolerant nlanting materials for both crops, it was agreed
with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MALD) to appraise the two
proposals under one Cashew and Coconut Treecrops Project. The appraisal
was carried out by a joint IDA/ODA/FRG Mission, which visited Tanzania in
October 1988.
B. Main Country Characteristics
1.02     Tanzania mainland encompasses some 945,000 sq. km., and has an
estimated population of 22 6 million (1987). Agriculture is the most
important sector of its economy. With the exception of a small area of
private estates and parastatal operations, the country is characterized by
relatively small farm sizes. The majority of the farms are less than 5
ha., with the average holding being about 1.2 ha. Agricultural land is
underutilized and a considerable potential for incremental developr,ient
exists. The topography is varied and includes vast semi-arid plains,
plateaus and highlands. Precipitation is also varied, and presents
different regimes in different areas. The country is divided into nine
physiographic regions, subdivided into twenty agro-climatic areas. These
may be grouped into four main agroeconomic zonles of which the Coastal Zone
with 500-1000 mm/yr rainfall is the main area for cashew and coconut
production (see coastal rainfall IBRD maps Nos. 20927 and 20928 in Project
File). Administratively, Tanzania mainland is divided into 20 Regions, 110
Districts, 500 Divisions, and abcut 2,200 Wards, each encompassing 2-5
villages. Zanzibar is a semi autonomous Region under the Union of T2nzania
with a higher rainfall of over 1600mm/yr aAld consists of the islands of
Unguja and Pemba.
C. The Economy
1.03     In the late seventies, the Tanzania economy entered a period of
economic decline from which it is only now starting to recover. The



- 2 -
downturn wds caused in part by a series of external factors, including
success3ve droughts, the rapid increase in oil prices, the collapse of the
East African Community and the war with Jganda, and in part by weaknesses
in the management of the economy. These included inadequate incentives and
resource allocation to the agricultural sector, an overly ambitious and
uneconomic industrialization strategy, excessive administrative controls
over economic activity, and continued growth in the size of the public
sector without due regard to the limited financial and administrative
capacity available. Between 1978 and 1982, GDP grew by only 0.42 per
annum, with agriculturai and industrial output declining by 2.9Z and 16.6%
per annum, respectively. Inflation accelerated, the fiscal situation
deteriorated sharply with deficits averaging about 162 of GDP, and exports
and imports declined significantly. By 1982. import volumes were 32Z below
their 1978 level and 24Z below their level in the early 1970s. Throughout
the early 1980s, the economy continued to decline despite the introduction
of various adjustment programs.
1.04     Attempts at policy reforms in the early eighties proved too weak
to succeed. It was not until June 1986, with the introduction of the
Economic Recovery Program (ERP), that the reform measures became strong
enough to have a positive impact. Under the ERP, reforms have been
intrcduced in the areas of exchange rate, foreign exchange allocation,
trade policy, prices, fiscal and monetary policies, and interest rates, as
well as in the key sectors of agriculture, industry and transport. In
support of these measures: (i) an 18-month standby arrangement of SDR64.2
million was approved by the IMF on August 28, 1986; (ii) a Multi-sector
Rehabilitation Credit (MRC) was approved by the Bank on November 20, 1986,
which incorporated financing from IDA and the African Facility (about
US$100 million), and attracted Special Joint Financing (about US$50
million) by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom; (iii) a supplemental credit comprising US$30
million and US$26 million of IDA and Africa Facility financing,
respectively, was approved in January 1988 and attracted cofinancing of
US$4 million and 4 million Pounds Sterling from Saudi Arabia and the United
Kingdom, respectively; and (iv) an Industrial Rehabilitation and Trade
Adjustment Credit (IRTAC) was approved on December 13, 1988. An
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program to support improvements in
agricultural pricing and marketing policies is currently being prepared.

1.05     Agriculture is the largest sector in the Tanzanian economy.  It
provides 40-50% of GNP, about 80% of exports, and over 80% of employment.
The main cash crops are coffee, cotton, sisal, tobacco, tea, cashewnut,
pyrethrum and cloves, and main food crops are maize, sorghum, millet rice,
grain, legumes, cassava, banana, wheat, and sugarcane. Coconuts provide
about 40% of the vegetable oils and fats consumed in Tanzania. Smallholder
production (over 83% of total holdings) dominates the sector. Private
estate production is important in tea and sisal, and government estates
contribute to rice, wheat, sisal, sugar and meat production. Some areas of
Tanzania have relatively low rainfall and are, therefore, subject to



- 3 -
drought. However, ever, in areas of reliable rainfall, overall population
density is low (19 per sq. km.). Only about 6 million hi out of 39 million
ha of arable land are under cultivation.
(ii) Performance
1.06     Throughout the first decade following Independence, the farming
community was backed by a vigorous extension service, capable of extending
appropriate agro-technologies. Therefore, a rapid expansion of smallholder
export crops took place, and the volume of marketed coffee, cotton,
cashewnuts and tobacco doubled between 1960/61 and 1966/67 and doubled
again by 1973/74 for cashewnuts and tobacco. Self-sufficienc; in food-
grain production was achieved by the late 1960s. However, the adoption of
several new Government policies in the 1970s and early 1980s kincluding
villagization, dissolution of cooperatives, establishment of parastatal
export and food crop marketing monopolies, closure of private shops,
confinement of supply of agricultural inputs to a few agencies, and
encouragement of heavy indLstry at the expense of sii.allholder agri-culture)
led to a steep decline in export crop production and a stagnation in food
production not keeping up with population growth by the late 1970s and into
the current decade. Between 1978 and 1985, real agricultural GDP grew at
only 1.0% per annum, well below the population growth rate of 3.4% p.a.
Between 1976/77 and 1985/86 the production of nja'or export crops declined
by 8X per annum, and agricultural export revenues declined by 57Z from a
peak of US$426.1 million in 1977 to US$184.1 million in 1985, with
devastating effect on the national economy.
(iii) Government Policy and Strategy
1.07     The main objectives of the Government's agricultural policy are
achieving food self-suffic'.ency and improving national nutrition standards;
restoring agricultural exports to former peaks and beyond; and improving
rural living standards. To attain these objectives and to reverse the
disappointing performance of recent years, the Government has since 1986,
introduced major reforms in agricultural strategy within the Economic
Recovery Program (Para 1.03). In addition to a major devaluation and
continuing adjustment in the real exchange rate, which have benefitted the
producers of both food crops and export crops, the Government has: (a)
increased producer prices in real terms; (b) liberalized the marketing of
maize; (c) re-established cooperatives to take over many parastatals'
responsibilities for crop marketing; (d) liberalized the marketing of minor
export crops; (e) permitted several private tea and sisal estates and
cooperatives to export directly instead of through marketing boards; (f)
privatized several previously expropriated coffee, tea and sisal estates;
and (g) started to 'deconfine' input supply and distribution. These
measures have already led to increases in food grain supply, and the
improvement in export crop production incentives, together with favorable
weather, have restored cotton production to its previous level.
1.08     However, some critical bottlenecks to the recovery of agricultural
production and exports remain. These include: (a) the lack of foreign
exchange to finance the rehabilitation of agricultural enterprises; (b) the
inadequate capability of the banking system to channel term and seasonal
lending to the agricultural sector; (c) the serious deterioration of the



- 4 -
research and extension services; (d) the severe rural and trunk roads
transport constraints; (e) the persisting shortages and late delivery of
critical inputs, implements, and consumer goods; and (f) the land tenure
problems which tend to discourage long-term private on-farm investmnent and
employwent of farm labor. In the short-term, pricing, marketing and input
policy changes have had, and will continue having the greatest impact on
agricultural production. However, to sustain and expand production,
attention mu3t be given to ovexcoming the remaining constraints. The IDA
lending program, of which this project is a specific component, is designed
to help the Government in that task.
E. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MALD)
1.09     Between 1961 and 1985, there have been several changes in
Government policies affecting MALD. One major change occurred in 1972
during the decentralization of development-oriented sector, including
Agriculture and Livestock. During this period, many departments were
merged, and all de-elopment functions were vested with Regional Development
Directors. In 1983, the process was reversed to the pre-1972 situation,
with control, policy and managemenit guidance, and supervision carried out
by ot from headquarters. During the last 25 years, the agricultural
sector has been associated with a variety of other sectors. This is
reflected in changes in the Ministry's names: Agriculture, and Cooperative
Development; Agriculture, Forestry and Wildlife; Agriculture, Food and
Cooperatives; Agriculture, Natural Resources and Livestock Development; and
since 1983, Agriculture and Livestock Development. Major national policies
like villagization, dissolution of cooperatives, establishment of
parastatals and the like have influenced some of these changes. Moreover,
there have been internal organizational changes in MALD with respect to
Divisions and also within the main Divisions. KALD, which was set up in
1983, was last reorganized in 1985 when six divisions were formed, namely:
Agriculture; Livestock Development; Planning and Marketing; Irrigation
Development; Research and Training; and Manpower Development and
Administration. However, under the recently approved Extension
Rehabilitation Project both Divisions for Agriculture and Livestock will be
amalgamated into one Agricultural Extension Department. Likewise under the
new National Agricultural and Livestock Research Project (NALRP) the two
parastatals for crops and livestock research, the Tanzania Agricultural
Research Organization (TAFU) and Tanzania Livestock Research Organization
(TALIRO) have been amalgamated into one Research organization under the
Department for Research and Training of MAILD.
F. The Agriculture and Livestock Extension Services
1.10     MALD provides extension services at the village level through the
regional and district agricultural offices. The centralized system of
extension is intended to enable MALD to implement management and planning
of daily extension activities and to provide a satisfactory linkage between
research and extension. MALD is also responsible for identifying the type
and quantities of inputs required by farmers and for communicating with the
input supply institutions.  Recruitment of extension officers is done by
MALD which allocates extension staff to different regions through Regional



- 5- 
Agricultural and Livestock Development Officers (RALDO). The District
Agricultural and Livestock Development Officers (DALDO) decide on the
deployment of the extension staff in the villages of their district. Under
the N4ational Agricultural and Livestock Extension Rehabilitation Project,
the extension services will be strengthened, while under the proposed
Cashew and Coconut Treecrops Project improved planting materials together
with reconmmendations for mixed cashew and coconut tree and food crops
production systems will be generated for the Extension Services for
dissemination to farmers.
G. The Agricultural and Livestock Research Services
1.11      The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development is
responsible for policy formulation, coordination and budgetary control tor
all agricultural and livestock research, except that carried out by the
University and the private sector. While its research department has
virtual autonomy, its council and board is answerable to MALD.
1.12      The Department of Research and Training is responsible for:
formulating agricultural research policy and objectives; establishing
programs to fulfil cte objectives; and, controls and monitors the national
research efforts, by membership in parastatal boards, councils and progranr
coordinating land committees. It has not succeeded in this role,
particularly in providing liaison between MALD and the various research
institutions; among the different institutions themselves; and between
research and the MALD controlled extension services; or in program plannind
and introducing a system of priorities.  The Department's authority has
been inadequate for that purpose vis- -vis the amalgamated parastatals and
these shortcomings account for the modest performance of Tanzania research
in recent years.
1.13      The National Agricultural and Livestock Research Project (NALRP)
aims to remedy the Department's weak status while the proposed Cashew and
Coconut Treecrops Project will specifically strengthen production oriented
research in cashewnut at Naliendele's Agricultural Research Institute arnd
further strengthen production oriented coconut research as carried out
under the National Coconut Development Program at various sites in Zanzibar
and Mainland Tanzania, including the Chambezi Coconut Research Station.
H. Agricultural Marketing and Pricing
1.14      Prior to independence in 1961, Tanzania had a rural marketing
system operated by a network of itinerant tradcrs and rural shopkeepers,
who were supplied by, and delivered agricultural products to, wholesalers
who were mostly located in the major towns. It was a traditional trader
network, found worldwide in rural areas, whereby the traders deal in a
large variety of inputs required by farmers, including credit, and purchase
produce from them. Immediately after Independence, the internal marketing
of agricultural products in Tanzania was re-organized as a pyramidal three-
tier system with primary cooperative societies at the bottom, secondary
cooperative societies, called unions, in the middle, and the National
Agricultural Products Board (NAPB) at the top, established by the



Agricultural Products (control of marketing) Act of 1962. NAPB appointed
the Cooperative Unions and its affiliated primary cooperative societies as
its sole agents. Thus, from about 1964/65, when the NAPB and its
cooperative agencies were established, Tanzania's agricultural marketing
became essentially a compulsory single-channel system with primary village
societies as the only buyers and the NAPB as sole exporter or distributor
for local consumption. This system led to inefficiencies and to gradual
changes of marketing procedures, reducing sophistication and, most
significantly, reducing and often eliminating the incentive for farmers to
increase the quality of their products.
1.15     A new system we. introduced in 1973/74, based on what are now
called village societies. The task of collection and transportation of
agricultural produce was put in the hands of newly established crop
authorities. in essence, though, not much changed the marketing system
remained a compulsory single iIiannel system, with a village society as only
buyer and a crop authority as monopoly exporter and distributor for the
local market. The new system exhibited many of the weaknesses of the old
system, often in more pronounced form. The village societies were
cooperatives imposed from the top, instead of organically grown from the
grassroots up. Farmers' allegiance to these new societies was weak; so was
the discipline and authority of the new crop purchasing entities.
Officially set producer prices were determined as a residual after all
costs of the marketing system had been deducted from an assumed sales
price. The farmer was, thus, completely divorced from any marketing
signals that would provide incentives for crop production. Producer prices
were established with little or no attention to the impact of intercrop
competition. The important, market determined price-mechanism for resource
allocation was largely abandoned.
1.16     In 1985 the earlier three-tier marketing system, based on primary
societies and cooperative unions, was re-established. Marketing boards
replaced most of the crops authorities. In 1986 efforts were made to
diversify the maize marketing system away from a compulsory single channel
system to a system where other channels, based on private initiative, would
be allowed in parallel with the cooperatives channel. Gradually maize was
deconfined. At the same time, trade in the other direction, i.e. of
agricultural inputs and, most importantly, of consumer articles to rural
areas, was substantially freed as well. Presently, the process of
liberalization of trade of all agricultural products is continuing. A
proposed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program will support this process
of trade liberalization, including the local and international trade of
export crops like cashewnuts.
I.  IDA's Involvement, Sectoral Strategy and the Proposed Project
1.17     Between Independence and the late 1970s, agricultural projects
including integrated rural development programs, accounted for about 30% of
the Bank Group's lending program.  Assistance was provided for 18
agricultural and three rural development projects totalling of US$240
million in IDA credits and US$37 million in IBRD loans. By the end of
1980, it was apparent that: (a) production was falling well short of
projections that had been based on the early growth period; and (b) project



- 7 -
implementation problems, rather than being project-specific, were common to
the whole agricultural sector. Accordingly, the Bank Group stopped most
agricultural project lending, pending a careful reassessment of the sector.
After 1980, lending in the agricultural sector was substantially curtailed;
what remained was either for specific balance of payments support (Export
Rehabilitation Program, US$50 million under Credit 1133-TA), or technical
assistance (Third and Fourth Technical Assistance Projects US$12 million
under Credit 1206-TA, and US10 million under Credit 1524-TA).
1.18     The emphasis in previous IDA agricultural assistance efforts in
Tanzania was on crop-specific projects built around agricultural
parastatals and regional development authorities. IDA's support for
agricultural credit was channelled through the Cooperative and Rural
Development Bank (CRDB). In line with Government policy, few of these
projects provided financial assistance to private entrepreneurs in the
agricultural sector. Many of these projects are now recognized by the
Government and IDA as having been unsuccessful. The principal reasons for
this include lack of recurrent inputs due to the shortage of foreign
exchange, unfavorable macroeconomic and sectoral policies, and
mismanagement and politicization of parastatals. In additior., insufficient
funds, lack of trained technical staff, and managerial deficiencies have
been ubiquitous, affecting all agricultural projects. Disbursements lagged
and significant sums were cancelled upon the closing of projects. IDA s
agricultural portfolio was considerably reduced as a result of the four-
year lending hiatus and only seven agricultural projects are currently
under implementation, two of which have been totally redesigned including
the Cashew Pilot Project. Due to the closing of several problem projects,
the redesigning and streamlining of others and recent changes in the
overall policy environment, the quality of IDA's project portfolio has
improved considerably.
1.19     Presently, IDA's operational strategy in agriculture is to support
GOT's effort to significantly reform, rehabilitate, modernize and expand
the country's research, extension, input supply, marketing and credit
systems. A core program of institutional support for the Ministry of
Agriculture and CRDB is in place.
1.20     The core program includes support for the basic agricultural
services such as research, extension, market analysis, and planning.   Th.e
first two areas are supported under the National Agricultural and Livestock
Research Project (NALRP) and the National Agricultural and Livestock
Extension Rehabilitation Project (NALERP); the last two areas are being
supported through the ongoing Fourth Technical Assistance Project. With
the Government's recent changes in policy, the discretionarv aspect of the
Bank's strategy has also become active. A Multisector Rehabilitation
Credit (Cr.1741-TA) supporting, among other things, agricultural marketing
reforms, was approved in November 1986. In addition, an Agricultural
Export Rehabilitation Credit was approved by IDA in 1988, and an
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program is under preparation.
1.21     In the Coconut and Cashew subsectors, the Government's emphasis
has been on improving its technical services to farmers in suppurt of a
program aimed at restoring cashew production to its 1970s level and
increasing coconut oil production. Pilot research projects for bcch crops



- 8 -
were started in the early 1980s with support from credits 801-TA and 1070-
TA, and with cofinancing from Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG), respectively. The results of these projects, have been encouraging.
They have succeeded in developing chemical control methods for powdery
mildew and more disease tolerant materials for cashew and in the initial
breeding of higher yielding coconut hybrids. To build on these initial
successes, an expanded follow-up program of research, breeding, seedling
propagation and production development will be carried under thE proposed
Cashew and Coconut Treecrops Project. This project is an expansion of the
above pilot projects and complementary in strengthening basic research and
extension services (para 1.20).
J. The Role of the Donor Community
1.22     Many donors are supporting the agricultural sector in Tanzania.
The European Development Fund has been assisting coffee production and
processing since the late 1970s, while the UK and Netherlands Governments
are helping to rehabilitate the cotton industry.  Few cashewnut processing
factories were rehabilitated with Italian assistance. The UK Government
assists with recurrent 'non-confined' imports, and through the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, may help to rehabilitate selected coffee estates.
The World Food Program has for several years helped the recovery of the
sisal industry through its Food for Work Program. The European Investment
Bank (EIB) is supporting cotton ginnery rehabilitation and the EEC and the
Commonwealth Development Corporation, the cotton seed industry. Several
donors are providing fertilizer supplies needed in the country. Danida and
Finnida assist in the support of Cooperative Unions and have assisted in
the forestry sub-sector. In relation to this specific Treecrops Project,
the Federal Republic of Germany has supported the National Coconut
Development Program (NCDP) and will continue to do so in supporting coconut
research under the Project. The British Overseas Development
Administration will specifically support the Project's cashewnut research
at Naliendele's Agricultural Research Institute.
II. THE CASHEW'NUT SUB SECTOR
A. Background
2.01     Cashewnut is the main cash crop of southern Tanzania and is also
grown to a lesser extent in the Coast (Pwani and Mafia districts) and Tanga
Regions where it often is found in mixed stands with coconuts and food
crops (see map IBRD #20926). Cashewnut is predominantly grown by
smallholders, estimated at 280,000 farmer families, on some 400,000 ha with
32 million trees in sole or mixed crop production systems.  Large scale
private plantations total to about 2,000 ha in the Lindi and Mtwara
Regions. Reliable information on age of trees is not available, but little
effective replanting has taken place since 1974. Although the production
of cashewnuts has declined dramatically for various reasons by about 85Z
since 1973/74, from 145,000 tons to about '..,000 tons in 1987/88, it still
remains the most important export crop of Tanzania after coffee and cotton
and contributes 16 to 14% of all foreign exchange earnings. The average
cashew farmer has 1-2 ha of cashew trees, sometimes intercropped with food



- 9 -
crops, mainly cassava, grain staples and legumes. Yields vary considerably
from tree to tree, area to area, end year to year, depending on the crop
husbandry environment and the occurrence of powdery mildew (Oidium
anacardii). Individual tree yields vary from zero to over 40 kg per tree
per year. In a sample area where trees were treated with sulphur dust
against powdery mildew, the average yield was 11.3 kg/tree as compared with
around 1.1 kg/tree for the untreated trees. However, the presently
recommended sulphur dust doses do not financially justify wide scale
chemical control of powdery mildew by the farmer until producer prices are
increased to an adequate level (para 2.16). Moreover, not enough is known
about the long term environmental impact of sulphur use. Although it was
assumed that the Naliendele Cashewnut Research Station could provide
tolerant clonal seeds, .n reality farmers ended up with seedlings
genetically segregating and with very variable tolerances and production
potentials. Presently MALD through its Cashewnut Production Improvement
Pilot Project (CPIPP) is identifying trees with high levels of tolerance
which, after careful screening with assistance from ODA, will be
vegetatively propagated in nurseries and in farmers' fields with the
assistance of trained extension staff. It is expected that these tolerant
planting materials will be sufficiently available within 3 to 4 years, and
that subsequently sulphur dusting can be phased out. Methods of vegetative
propagation have already been tried out successfully, both by CPIPP and
Naliendele.
2.02     In the 1960s and 1970s, most nuts were exported raw to India for
further processing since processing capacity was limited to one factory
only. Since 1974, eleven additional processing factories were built for
the Cashewnut Authority of Tanzania (CATA) and most of the cashewnuts were
exported as decorticated nuts; cashewnut shell liquid (CNSL) was exported
as well. Only a small part (estimated at 10-15Z) of the produce was
consumed locally. The Tanzania Cashewnut Marketing Board (TCMB), formerly
CATA, is now the official buyer of nuts from the Cooperative Unions and
sole exporter. It also shares with the unions the management of the
factories.   Prospects for cashew on the world market remain good.  Selling
of Tanzanian Cashew kernel would present no major market problems.
Contrary to the past, when Tanzania was a main supplier, its current
production is only a modest 7 to 8 percent of the total world market
supply.
B. Cashewnut Production
2.03     The earliest recorded export figures for cashew nuts in Tanzania
date from 1938. Systematic production data are available as of 1945. As
the data in Table 2.01 show annual growth rates in production between 1945
and the early 70's were substantial; however from 1973/74 production
declined sharply from 145,000 tons to 16,400 tons in 1986/87.

2.04     Tanzania's main cashew production region is in the south, although
cashew is produced all along the coast (see map IBRD No. 20926). As such,
it is the central part of East African's coastal cashew production, which
extends from Malindi in Kenya to Maputo in Mozambique. In Tanzania's most
important region, in the south, cashew is grown to almost 500 km. inland,
on the Makonde plateau, and up to an altitude of about 800 meters above sea
level. Since the coastal plain proper is rather too humid for cashew, the
best growing conditions, and hence the best quality of nuts, are found
further inland. This phenomenon used to be recognized by the traders,
when, up to the middle 60's cashewnuts from Masasi and Nachingwea districts
in Mtwara region, and from Tunduru and Songea in Ruvuma region received the
highest prices. When production reached a peak, in the early 70's, the
production area was only half of the estimated 400,000 ha. presently under
cashew of which 702 was under single cropping, and the remainder under
intercropping, mainly with food crops and some oil crops.
2.05     Statistics on tree densities do not exist.  Spot observations
indicate that there are many single, isolated trees as well as stands with
densities that exceed the optimum 50 to 60 trees per ha. Many trees have
apparently sprung up spontaneously and are in heavy competition with the
natural vegetation. As a rule, weeding is carried out only when harvesting
begins. At the peak of production. in the middle 70's, yields per tree
typically ranged from 1 to 10 kg of nuts, with top performers yielding as
much as 40 kg, and average nationwide yields of about 4.5 kg per tree.
2.06     Cashewnut production in Tanzania, declined precipitous in the mid
70's (Table 2.01), due to an unfortunate combination of concurrent
circumstances. A fungus disease, Oidium mildew and an insect pest,
Helopeltis sp. began to be noticeable in the mid 70's, reaching
catastrophic proportions in the late 70's to early 80's. Just prior to the
first reported instances of Cidium, in 1973 and particularly in 1974,
Tanzania undertook a country-wide villagization program (Ujamaa) of farmers
who formerly lived scattered in the countryside. Farmer families were
relocated in newly constructed villages, where social services could be
provided efficiently. This relocation, had the effect of separating large
numbers of erstwhile cashew farmers from their trees, making nut collection
difficult to impossible. At the same time, producer prices for cashew in
real terms were decreased year after year, until they reached, in 1982/83,
a level that was only slightly more than half of what the price had been in
1970 (Table 2.02). Changes in the cashew marketing system that accompanied
the villagization program led to substantial delays in both nut collection
and payments. The collectivization of agriculture that accompanied the
villagization program led to serious disincentives for farmers to go to
former cashew producing areas and coJ'ect nuts on behalf of the village
cooperative.  This, a-id generalized forced abandomnent of a large number of
cashew trees, led to a rapid increase of weeds, uncontrolled growth of
spontaneously seeded cashew trees and other vegetation and, generally, to
reverting to bush of much of what previously had been cashew producing
areas.
2.07     By the mid 80's, production had declined to about 20% of its level
of ten years before. At that point, the government started the Cashewnut
Production Improvement Pilot Project (CPIPP) to identify the main causes of
cashewnut production decline and to design a strategy for its



- 13 -
rehabilitation. As a result, a production enhancing strategy to control
pow-dery mildew is being developed along two parallel lines. One addresses
the agronomic aspects of produc.ion, focusing on pest and disease treatment
in the short and medium term and the other on replanting with disease
tolerant, and hopefully resistant, varieties in the long run. The strategy
also calls for an increase in the producer price as a proportion of the
export parity price (para 2.16).
C. The Cashew Production Improvement
Pilot Project
(i) Introduction
2.08     The Cashew Production Improvement Pilot Project (CPIPP) was funded
with US$3.0 million dollers by IDA under the redesigned credit agreement of
Credit 801-TA. The pilot -las initiated in August 1985 and will be
completed by June 30, 1989. The primary objective of CPIPP was to
formulate and test several hypotheses in the cause of the decline in cashew
nut production, and provide a model for rehabilitation of the cashew
subsector. To meet this objective, support was provided to MALD to carry
out adaptive cashaw research; cashew development and extension; training
and to strengthen monitoring and evaluation. CPIPP was initiated in 6
districts i.l southern Tanzania to allow for a new intensive cashew based
farming system approach to be developed and tested and for experience to be
gained before expanding and moving into new areas.  The target of reaching
144 villages through the existing extension channels in the Region of
Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma was expanded to 200, gro,.ped into 50 clusters of
four villages per cluster.
(ii) Research
2.09     During the pilot period however, it became clear that the cashew
varieties recommended by the Naliendele Research Station were equally
affected by cashew powdery mildew disease (Oidium anacardi) and that an
intensive survey for more tolerant trees in farmers fields had to be
undertaken, and reliable planting materials established, before a
successful cashew nut production package can be recommended to farmers.
The initial results were successful but further research and development is
necessary. The objective of the proposed follow-up project phase will be
to select and propagate tolerant high yielding clonal material and to
prepare improved cashewnut production packages for the extension service to
pass on to cashewnut farmers. This requires further strengthening of the
cashewnut research at Naliendele, including breeding and selection,
establishment of poly-clonal seed garder. in the main cashewnut production
areas and training of subject matter specialists in improved cashew based
production systems.
(iii) Disease Tolerance
2.10     Early surveys of randomly selected villages in the field project
areas identified Oidium anacardii (powdery mildew) as the most important
factor to the production decline common to all trees. An Italian cashew
research project operating at Naliendele from 1979-84 had also identified



- 14 -
mildew as a major cashew disease and had formulated a control strategy
based on the use of chemical disease control measures with sulphur dust.
After a review of the materials released as seed from previously selected
disease tolerant mother trees at Naliendele, it was concluded that the
progeny of these trees was not true-to-type and had no guarantee of disease
resistance or yield performance. CPIPP therefore had no resistant material
for use in any proposed replanting program. A search for local trees
showing good performance and acceptable levels of tolerance to mildew was
first carried out in the 1986/87 season. A second phase started in 1987j88
and a number of promising trees were identified through farmer interviews
in 160 villages with subsequent evaluation of yield size, Jisease severity
and other criteria. In total 120 trees were identified for further
tolerance screening, which will be finalized with ODA assistance by mid-
1989, before the start of the proposed follow-up project. It is highly
probable that durable resistance to mildew will be found among locai
populatiorns of cashew, but it is more likely to be found among younger
trees. Disease scoring of inflorescence for mildew incidence is
notoriously difficult and young leaves under the canopy are more likely to
indicate relative resistance to mildew. Surveys for disease tolerant high
yielding trees was never done in the past and should be carried out on at
least a regular basis, during the next 4-6 years.
(iv) Chemical Control
2.11     Sulphur dust applied by motorized blowers at 0.5kg/tree for each
of seven applications at 14 day intervals from May was tested at 26
locations.  Mean yield increase was from 1.4kg/trees for uncreated trees to
11.6kg/tree on treated trees while well maintained trees yielded 22kg/tree
with sulphur treatment. These results confirmed that Odium control with
sulphur dusting gives substantial yield increases. Inputs of sulphur and
motorized blowers are provided under the pilot project .3 part of the
package for integrated crop development. The results of this program have
generated pressure from cashew farmers and political leaders for more
intensive sulphur spraying as they now realize their production problems
are soluble. However, problems of logistics, finance and environmental
hazard indicate that application of sulphur can only be regarded as a
temporary measure. Results from recent experiments at Naliendele show that
rates of application could probably be halved to 1.75kg/tree/year or even
lower in contiguously treated fields. Even so, sulphur dusting within the
project should be restricted to those fields where stands of cashew are
being thinned and intercropped to allow eventual replanting with resistant
material.
(v) Vegetative Propagation
2.12     Previously air-layering had been used in Tanzania for vegetative
propagation of cashew which is a labor intensive and inefficie,.t method.
Under the pilot project, in coordination with research, methods to top
graft and side graft with buds were successfully tested for the first time
in Tanzania. This break through will make it possible to rapidly multiply
true to type tolerant trees, a practice which is _ritical for an improved
tree planting program and the speedy introduction of high yielding clones
at farmers' fields.



- 15 -
(vi) Integrated Crop Development and Research Extension Linkages
2.13     To address the complex set of production problems, an integrated
package approach was designed to improve production on individual farmers'
fields and to demonstrate how to reclaim cashew groves. The village
cluster demonstration farms set up by the pilot project, include component
recommendations for clearing bush and thinning cashew to a suitable
density, inter planting tolerant seedlings, planting varieties of high
yielding annual crops to meet food production objectives and ease
maintenance tasks, the use of fertilizer on annual crops, and applying
sulphur dust on selected high yielding trees. The improvement of cashew
production is inextricably intertwined and dependent upon the flow of new
technologies from Naliendele's research program that help mitigate
technical limitations; the extension servie'e which disseminates information
about innovations and helps identify farmer problems; the supply of useful
inputs to rural-based small-scale producers in a timely fashion; and the
market arrangements for purchasing and transporting the nuts. In fact, it
is through these institutions that the Government attempts to combine its
interests with those of the farmers in order to achieve progress and
development. Through the pilot project, subject matter specialists train
village extension workers to assist the farmers in reclaiming their groves
and go into more intensive production systems.
D. Marketing and Pricing
2.14     Since Independence in 1961, cashewnut marketing in Tanzania has
been organized in the form of a compulsory single channel marketing system
with a cooperative structure at the base and a parastatal buying,
processing and exporting monopoly at the top. A combination of steadily
increasing costs and rents has made the marketing system progressively more
costly; during the last years it has absorbed more than 602 of cashew
export revenue.
2.15     Since 1985, when the cooperative system was reinstituted, the
farmer's sole outlets have been the primary societies. These in turn,
through the intermediary of second-tier cooperative unions, sell to the
Tanzania Cashew Marketing Board (TCMB). The latter is sole exporter and
processor. Producer prices are calculated as a residual, after all
budgeted costs of the combined cooperatives and TCMB costs have been
subtracted from an assumed export price. This system, which does not take
into account either inflation or the attractiveness of other crops, was
introduced in the early years of the villagization drive, i.e. around
1974/75. The producer price as a percent of export parity price has
declined from a high of 70% in the early seventies to a level of about 302
at present, which is unacceptably low considering the need to revi.talize
the cashew nut production (Table 2.02). Increased producer prices are an
essential ingredient of any package of developments designed to resuscitate
the ca hewnut industry. Such increases would have two major impacts; an
immediate increased farmer  ..ncentive to harvest all available nuts and two,
a significant improvement in the benefit cost ratio of the chemical disease
control program in the early stage of the Project. While prices would be
important towards a partial short term resuscitation of the cashewnut
industry, the long term solution however, is to increase tree yields from



- 16 -
its present low level through the selection of disease tolerant materials
due to the overriding effects of powdery mildew (para 2.10).
2.16     Marketing costs, both actual costs and rents obtained from the
system, are extraordinarily high. The margin obtained by the cooperative
part of the system is approximately 201 of the export price, less than half
of which are actual costs. TCMB's calculated margins are approximately 40Z
of the export price, but in reality are much higher. This is due to an
underestimation of the future export price and to inflation, which
generates windfall profits for TCMB with respect to prices that are
determined once a year and remain constant in nominal terms for 12 months.
In the event, net TCMB profits before taxes have been respectively 282 in
1985/86, 532 in 86/87 and 462 of the world market price in the first six
months of the past season, i.e. through March of 1988. Therefore. there is
more than sufficient room to pay the farmer a substantially higher price
for his cashewnuts. This would allow him to pay for production enhancing
procedures, such as disease and pest control and fertilization. It is also
clear that more than sufficient room exists to make cashew trade attractive
for the private sector. A strategy for improving cashewnut pricing and
marketing system is being developed under the proposed Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Program. The MALD has indicated already the need to adjust the
farmgate prices. At negotiation assurances were obtained from GOT that
cashew producer prices would be increased to at least 502 of the FOB price
and announced by November 30, 1989 and that a plan of action for the
improvement of the cashew marketing system will be provided by that date,
acceptable to IDA (para 8.02j).
E. Credit to Cashew Growers
2.17     Credit for inputs, normally in kind, is customarily provided
through the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (CRDB), Cooperative
Unions (CU) and Primary Societies (PS) channel. Through this system,
individual farmers' credit demand is aggregated at the PS and then at the
CUs level. After approval, funds are provided by CRDB for CUs to procure
and distribute inputs to producers. In line with the limited area
controlled by individual producers and the labor intensive nature of the
production process, credit requirements by cashew growers for purchasing
seasonal inputs and investment items, both for production of annual crops
and cashew, are relatively small. However, there are basic efficiency
issues affecting the operation of the credit-cum-input distribution by the
CUs, as the virtual monopoly of these regarding the sale of inputs on
credit to producers has a negative impact in the development of inputs
trade activities by the private sector. Alternative operational procedures
to solve these issues in the Mtwara and Lindi regions will be tested under
a proposed Pilot Credit Scheme, of the Project (paras 2.19 and 4.23).
Critical inputs and equipment for cashew production such as sulphur dust
and blowers are not available in the local market and access to foreign
exchange to procure these in the foreign market has been a pervasive issue
during implementation of the CPIPP. This constraint has been eased of
under CPIPP by assisting CRDB to prccu;e the foreign goods and direct
payment of the suppliers; alternative measures will be implemented under
this Project (para 4.22).

2.18     Increasing the effectiveness of agricultural credit to a large
proportion of Tanzania's smallholders is important for increasing the
uptake of technology, fostering agricultural growth and rural incomes. The
Cooperative Rural Development Bank (CRDB) efforts to serve farmers were
disappointing in the past, but have improved recently, increasing its
financial viability. High reliance on a relatively inefficient cooperative
system for the administration and management of credit to smallholders was
the main problem affecting the credit system. Experience to date indicates
that except for a few, most of the Cooperative Unions (CUs) performed
poorly, and that CRDB was unable to influence their financial discipline
and management and to compensate for their poor financial structure. Also,
CRDB had little or no interaction with end-users of credit at the Primary
Society (PSs) level; through this system CRDB had de-facto delegated
management of production credit to the CUs. Poor recovery performance was
further aggravated by the general inefficiency of the output marketing
system (cooperatives and parastatals) which resulted in late payments to
farmers and poor loan repayments to CRDB, causing overall credit shortage
and rationing.
2.19     Starting from early 1988, CRDB has taken significant steps to
overcome these constraints through the implementation of programs to
restructure its operations and financial basis. Assistance to this
endeavour is being provided through the Agricultural Export Rehabilitation
Project, Credit 1891-TA. Measures to solve the agricultural marketing
problems and related parastatals efficiency issues are the main thrust of
the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program (under prenaration).
Notvithstanding, additional efforts are required to improve performance of
the credit delivery system in the cashesv production areas.  In p'-t g cular,
revised credit procedures and institutional arrangements to bring CRDB
closer to farmers and to increase its accountability and that of the
cooperative system are urgently required. Under the proposed Project a
Pilot Credit Scheme would test and verify the above assumptions in the
cashew production areas of Mtwara and Lindi Regions (para 4.24)
F. Lessons Learned
2.20     Research and development of the cashewnut production improvement
pilot project have shown that there is substantial scope for productivity
increases of selected trees and replacement of non productive treestands by
powdery mildew tolerant higher yielding clones. In the short term (3-4
years) sulphur dusting of selected trees will increase cashewnut yields,
but this chemical control program should be interlinked with plantings of
young disease tolerant planting materials in alternate rows. Once the
young trees have grown up after (3-4 years), the remaining older trees will
be replaced by tolerant young seedlings. Initially, these tolerant
plantings will have to be vegetatively propagated, but in the follow-up
phase after 4 to 5 years of project implementation, high producing poly-
clonal seed gardens of tolerant clones should have been established and
produce quality seeds for direct planting. Intercropping with food and oil
crops in the early years will also be recommended to enable farmers to
increase their income and spread their risks. In the follow-up phase,
tolerant materials will be selected, propagated and disseminated to
.armers, while cashewnut subject matter specialists will further train



- 18 -
village extension staff in the integrated cashew based production systems.
In the cashew production areas, more credit will be made available by
supporting CRDB to provide better services in these areas, through a line
of credit and the testing of a pilot credit scheme.
III. THE COCONUT SUB SECTOR
A. Background and Production
3.01     Coconut is Doth a subsistence and cash crop of the coastal areas
of Tanzania and the islands of Mafia and Zanzibar (Unguja and Pemba) (see
map IBRD 121494). Coconuts are presently grown by some 600,000 farmers on
an estimated 240,000 ha with snme 22.4 million trees, producing some 530
million nuts per year. It is predominantly a smallholder crop and only
some 52 of the total area is under large plantations. Smallholders
invariably inter-crop coconuts with a range of annual and perennial crops.
It is estimated that there is a potential area of about 500,000 ha or
double its present area for coconut. Coconut yields have declined and are
generally low and vary widely depending upon soils, climate, standards of
maintenance, age of trees and incidence of pest and diseases. Insufficient
replanting in the past 15 years has further cont-ibuted to the production
decline. Latest estimates suggest the average annual yield to be around
26 nuts/palm while well managed hybrid trees on suitable soil can produce
around 65 nuts per year. In genera', the agricultural services for the
promotion of coconut production have been poor in the past.
3.02     Coconuts provide about 401 of the vegetable oils and fats consumed
in Tanzania; other oil crops meet anocther 30% of the requirements while
the remainder is imported. With the rapidJy increasing population, this
deficit would continue to exist unless the coconut supply is doubled by the
year 2010. This implies the importance of the crop in order to reduce
vegetable oil imports and save foreign exchange. Main products are the
fresh coconut which serves a variety of domestic uses (drir.k nut, home
produced vegetable oil and fat), and copra (fire-cureu or sub-dried coconut
meat) which is used for the industrial extraction of vegetable oil. The
oil is used for cooking, margarine, soap, etc. The residual copra cake is
an excellent animal feed. In addition, the coconut tree provides by-
products which are used as roofing and construction material, mats and
fuel.
B. The National Coconut Development Program and the Coconut Pilot Project
3.03     To offset further decline of the coconut industry, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock Development with the assistance of the Federal
Republic of Germany, established in 1979, the National Coconut Development
Program (NCDP). Technical assistance for the management of the program was
provided by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). The program
was intended co develop pest and disease control measures, examine the
potential for introducing improved varieties and production of quality
seednuts and disease and drought tolerant planting materials, train MALD's
extension staff in crop husbandry and support coconut field advisory
activities.

3.04     In 1981, activities were expanded with the assistance of an IDA
Credit (1070-TA) of SDR5.2 million for the "Coconut Pilot Project", to
include more infrastructure and research facilities in the progrram. The
pilot project was designed in close collaboration with NCDP to become an
integral part of the ongoing program. Breeding research and lay out of
seed gardens were done in cooperation with IRHO (Institut de Recherches
pour les Huiles et Oleagineux) in Ivory Coast. Finance was provided for
agronomy and crop rehabilitation trials; two seed farms, one in Zanzibar
and one in Mafia, for the production of PB 121 hybrid nuts, (West African
Tall x Malaysian Yellow Dwarf); technical assistance; training and
additional support to extension activities. The pilot project was quite
successful and terminated on Msach 31, 1989, but the present phase of the
national program would cou,tinue with the assistance of FRG until June 30,
1990, thus overlapping with the proposed project.
(i) Research
3.05     Major results have been achieved so far.  In field experiments the
good potential for successfully growing early producing and high yielding
hybrids in the wetter parts and disease free areas of Tanzania and the
advantages of weeding and intercropping was established, while
rehabilitation trials proved the great economic advantages of improved crop
husbandry practices. Disease research has greatly enhanced the
understanding of the Lethal Disease (LD) enabling the assessment of the
risk emanating from LD for planting activities; field trials have provided
tentative information on different levels of tolerance in varieties.
However, a cure for LD could not yet be identified. From research work on
pests, first answers are available on the control of the Rhinoceros beetle
and biological control work on the coreid bug (Pseudotheraptus wayi) is in
progress. Results from pest control and farming systems research, are
immediately channelled to the extension service. In breeding, the East
African Tall (EAT) has been screened, and promising strains for increased
production and drought tolerance were selected and planted in a first
breeders' collection. In the follow-up project, even more emphasize wi 1
have to be placed on drought tolerance, in particular in hybrids.
(ii) Seed Farms
3.06     Two farms were succesfully established in Zanzibar and Mafia, with
a total of 180 ha, for the production of hybrid seednuts and have reached
about 302 of the final capacity of about 1 million seed nuts per annum, to
be reached by 1995. On the seed farms, farm buildings, laboratories and
staff houses have been constructed under the pilot project. Operating
expenses of the seed farms are being reduced by introducing animal traction
for farm maintenance and transport.
(iii) Research Extension Linkages
3.07     NCDP does not have its own extension organization but makes use of
the general extension structure of MALD. The Coconut Production
Development Section (CPDS) of NCDP works in an intergrated wav in a subject
matter specialist function with the general extension services and covers 5
mainland regions (including the island of Mafia) with 25 districts and
Zanzibar with its 9 districts. Efficiency and effectiveness of the general



- 20 -
extension services is rather low but will be greatly improved during the
implementation of the National Agricultural and Livestock Extension
Rehabilitation Project. NCDP uses the rural broadcast radio system to
address a wider audience and is in the air once a month for 15 minutes.
CPDS cooperates with educational institutions and maintains direct contact
with decision makers, technicians and administrators on regional, district,
ward and village level. The spec4alist training of MALD extension officers
remains a priority in order to achieve a reasonable degree of area coverage
for the extension of production packages. Farmers field days in the
research trial areas, on-farm Fl hybrid demonstrations and on the seed
farms, have also proven to be successful. CPDS also assist farmers in
selecting the best EAT seed nuts from heap selections and advices public
village and private nurseries in the raising and selection of Fl hybrid
seedlings for sale to farmers and estate planting.
C.  Marketing and Pricing
3.08     On the main land of Tanzania, the markets for coconuts and its
products are completely free.  In spite of this free market, there is
little or no production of either copra or coir on the mainland as a result
of the high prices fetched for fresh nuts. The latter is due to the
severely depressed situation of the edible oil industry in Tanzania.  Many
years of price control over both raw material supply and finished products
have paralyzed what once was a thriving oil industry. Of the more than 3G
oil mills in Tanzania, capable of crushing a wide variety of oil seeds,
only 3 are currently in operation. Total yearly edible oil production in
Tanzania is now well under 10,000 tons, equivalent to a per capita
consumption well under 0.5 liter per annum, one of the lowest in the world.
Under this critical situation, fresh coconuts have increasingly replaced
edible oils in the local diet. Local freshnut prices are about 120Z above
the import parity price of the nut equivalent of copra. This reflects the
scarcity of fresh coconuts in the local market and the high consumer
preference for both freshnut consumption and its use as home processed
coconut oil. Locally processed coconut oil sells in the market at a
premium price over the fresh nut equivalent and also at a considerable
premium over imported substitute vegetable oils. Unless the situation in
Tanzania's edible oil sector changes fundamentally, and coconut production
levels are increased to those of the early 70s, it cannot be expected that
coconut prices would come down sufficiently to make production of copra,
and hence of coir, once again economically feasible.
3.09     The situation on the islands is different.  Tanzania's largest
coconut plantation, Mafia Coconuts Limited on Mafia island, does produce
copra, oil and coir, because there is simply no other market for the large
numbers of nuts produced. Trade in fresh nuts is free on Zanzibar, but the
trade of nuts off the islands of Zanzibar is for all intents and purposes
prohibited. Furthermore, the Zanzibarian government operates a buying
monopoly for copra, the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC), with
prices that, in constant terms, have steadily declined, to 302 of the 1970
price level.  Only 202 of the oil pressing capacity is being used in
Zanzibar.   The combination of market limitation to the islands and the
buying monopoly for copra have resulted in depressed prices for nuts on the
islands as compared with the mainland. Fresh nut prices on Zanzibar are



- 21 -
about one third of what they are on the mainland. It appears that the cost
of this consumer protection policy far exceeds its benefits. Also, and
contrary to the professed aim of the policy, Zanzibar's depressed copra
prices have not resulted in a thriving oil industry. Through NCDP. the
Government of Zanzibar has become aware of the problem and has recently
increased producer nut prices from TSh4 to TSh8 for each fresh coconut, and
for copra from TShlO to TSh25 per kg. This increase is not sufficient, but
is considered to be a short-term measure for further agricultural
production incentives.
D. Lessons Learned
3.10     Research and development of the coconut pilot project have shown
that there is substantial scope for both productivity increases of existing
palms and an expansion of the area under coconuts. The crop is attractive
to small scale farmers and commercial producers. In view of the shortage
of vegetable oils its development is of great urgency. On the other hand,
expansion is limited by the fact that certain areas along the coast have a
high incidence of Lethal Disease (LD) killing 20Z to 50Z of the trees over
the years, while other areas are more drought prone. None of the hybrids
with West African Tall as pollinator have shown sufficient tolerance to LD
or to drought. There is most probably more LD and drought tolerance
available in the indigenous environmentally adapted East African Tall palm.
Therefore, in the proposed Project, a greater emphasis will be placed on
the selection of outstanding East Africa, Tall palms in the diseased and
dryer coconut areas to identify the best producers for seed nuts and pollen
for further hybrid breeding. Also additional dwarf coconut varieties will
have to be imported and tested in the EAT hybridization program. In the
meantime, hybrid seed nut production on the Mafia and Zanzibar seed farms
should continue for the less droughz affected, non diseased coconut areas.
Village extension staft should be assisted in the selecticn of the best
seedling producing EAT's for the dryer areas and further trained in coconut
based production systems which include annual food crops as well. By
irnterplanting other annual and perennial crops in coconut groves, the
incidence of the worst coconut pest, the Pseudotheraptus wayi coreid bug,
is effectively reduced through biological control of the bug by the
majimoto ants (Oecophila longinoda). However, these leaf-weaver ants have
their own smaller enemies which in turn need to be controlled through
various means. Therefore, biological insect control work of the coreid bug
is of great importance and should continue since hybrid trees in closer
stands seem to be more prone to coreid bug attacks than taller wider
planted coconut trees with interc..ops.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale and Objectives
4.01     Tanzania is a country with a large agricultural potential
including cashew and coconut treecrops. However, it is essential to adopt
and generate new technologies to realize this potential. While Tanzania
can rely to some extent on the materials and findings of the various
international research centers and other more technologically advanced



- 22 -
countries, adoption to Tanzanian conditions will require improved research,
development and dissemination capability. GOT recognizes that both the
research and extension organization need to be strengthened in order to
generate and disseminate new technologies effectively. Under the National
Agricultural and Livestock Research Project and the National Agricultural
and Livestock Extension Rehabilitation Project. both services will be
strengthened. For the cashew and coconut industries, however, there was
not sufficient disease and drought- tolerant materials available, nor were
there any integrated production packages. Under the Cashewnut Production
Improvement Pilot Project (CPIPP) and Coconut Pilot Project, with bilateral
assistance from Italy and FRG respectively, new production technologies and
new coconut varieties were developed, but they still need to be further
tested because of the seriousness of the cashew powdery mildew and coconut
lethal disease and the fact that treecrops need a long term research
involvement and cannot be bred, tested and multiplied overnight. The
Cashew Pilot Project's objective was to find out the main causes of the
production decline from 1974 and what methods, technologies should be
developed to reverse the situation (para 2.08) The findings and experience
gained will form the basis of the proposed project. Cashew research will
be supported by ODA. Likewise, the Coconut project has proven that higher
yielding hybrids are acceptable to farmers particularly in non-drought
sensitive areas (para 3.04). For the disease and drought prone areas,
however, coconut breeding research has to continue under the proposed
project with FRG assistance to obtain better tolerance to adverse growing
conditions with the use of selected EAT's as father palms in the breeding
program and imports of additional dwarf types not yet available in the
breeding collection.
4.02     The aims of the propoced Project, which would be implemented along
the coasts, islands and in the South of Tanzania (see IBRD maps Nos. 20926
and 21494) would be to increase cashewnut exports and reduce vegetable oil
imports by increasing cashew and coconut production. Increased production
would be achieved through: (a) rehabilitation of old plantings; (b)
planting of disease tolerant clones (cashew) and improved hybrids and EAT
varieties (coconut); (c) introduction of improved crop husbpn,dzy practices
and basic inputs, including the use of chemical control of powdery mildew
in the first 3 to 4 years on selected cashewnut trees, and the inter
cropping of food, oil and leguminous crops; (d) expansion of coconut
plantings in the Mtwara coastal area; and (e) the provision of credit for
cashew and other farm inputs. The Project would continue to support
specific cashewnut and coconut research and agronomic adaptive trials fcr
pest and disease control, development of new tolerant clones (cashew) and
hybrids (coconuts) and assist in upgrading of cashew and coconut specific
research and extension services. Financial and institutional support to
strengthen CRDB and private traders in the credit delivery, cashew input
and marketing sectors would also be provided. The project would support
policy reforms in cashew, copra and coconut oil marketing and pricing
systems and facilitate monitoring and evaluation of project implementation
and its impact. It would provide assistance for a mid-term review to
decide on the need for establishing a Treecrops Institute during or at the
end of project implementation and for the preparation of two separate
national rehabilitation projects for cashew and coconut, including the
cashew and vegetable oil processing industries.

B. Project Description
4.03     The 6 year Cashew and Coconut Tree Crops Project, which will be
implemented by two separate cashew and coconut management units under the
overall responsibility of MALD, will provi.e financing and technical
assistance in support of:
(i)   cashew and coconut treecrops research to develop better
control measures for pests and diseases (through breeding
and selection), particularly for disease tolerance and
increased yield potential in cashew and for drought-
tolerance in coconut hybrids;
(ii)  the propagation of new improved planting materials through
the development and operation of seven Cashewnut Development
Centers (CDC), and a combined EAT disease testing and
multiplication coconut center and the operation of 2
existing coconut hybrid seedfarms in Mafia and Zanzibar;
(iii) production development through the dissemination of cashew
and coconut specific production packages including planting
materials by specific subject matter specialists who would
train MALDs existing extension and research staff and the
support of on-farm demonstrations of cashew and coconut
production packages;
(iv)  the management and coordination of the Cashewnut Improvement
Program (CIP) and the National Coconut Development Program
(NCDP);
(v)   the cashew input supply and marketing support through a line
of credit to CRDB and technical assistance for local
marketing support; and
(vi)  a pilot credit scheme to strengthen CRDB's credit facilities
in the southern cashewnut production areas of Mtwara and
Lindi.
Technical assistance will be provided by the British Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) for all aspects of cashewnut research at
Naliendele's research station, while the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
through its development agency Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammmen Arbeit
(GTZ), will continue to support all coconut research under the Technical
Cooperative Program for NCDP, the present phase of which ends on June 30,
1990. There will he a special emphasis on the training of counterpart
staff by all expert staff recruited under technical assistance.
C.  Detailed Features for Cashew Improvement Program (CIP)
Ci)  Research
4.04     The cashew research program will be production oriented to provide
technologies that are urgently needed to increase raw nut production. The



- 24 -
Cashewnut Program Coordinator and Naliendele's Research Team Leader are
both represented in the Technical Coordinating Committee (para 5.03) and
are responsible for direct coordination betweeii cashew research and
extension staff. Cashew research will be carried out at Naliendele's
Agricultural Research Institute under three basic programs: crop
protection, va8,' '1 improvement and agronomy. A small socio-economic
iesearch program o. bout US$300,000 complementary to the three basic
programs, will also be carried out (para 4.14). The British Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) will under a grant agreement with GOT
fully support the cashewnut research component including the provision of 4
specialists (Pathologist, Crop Protection Specialist, Breeder and Research
Development Agronomist/Team Leader), equipment, vehicles and funding for
the improvement of existing research facilities, houses, some of the
recurrent costs and overseas training to a total amount of US$6.0 million
equivalent, including price contingencies. Existing ODA housing and
workshop facilities at Mtwara will be made available in support of cashew
research.   The cashew research program, which is estimated at a total of
US$5.4 million, and the detailed research base costs are provided in the
Project File, Working Paper 1 and in Table 1 of Annex I. The grant
agreement with GOT for para_lel financing of the cashew research is a
condition of project effectiveness (para 8.01d)
4.05     Crop Protection.  The current measure used to control Oidium by
dusting trees with sulphur at 3.5kg/tree and seven applications must be
regarded as a very temporary measure. Not only is it expensive, but the
logistics of dusting large areas of cashew with sulphur and the likely
ensuing environmental problems, particularly an increase in soil acidity,
indicate that this is not a realistic option for controlling the disease
(see Project File, Working Paper 1, Annex D). However, some form of
chemical control will be required for 3 to 4 years to come until integrated
disease control practices involving the use of Oidium resistant cashew
plants are available.
4.06     A priority of the Crop Protection Team program will be to develop
environmentally safer and more efficient methods of chemical control by
investigating other fungicides, particularly the modern systemic compounds
and ultra low volume application techniques. A reduction in the dosage of
sulphur used appears to be an immediate measure which could help mitigate
the side effects. A better understanding of Oidium epidemiology will
enable the more efficient use and improved targeting of fungicides.
4.07     The tolerance and partial resistance to Oidium detected among
introduced and local cashew populations provides the basis for the long
term, sustainable answer to the Oidium problem.  Resistance is likely to
prove durable, but studies on the epidemiology and host/parasite relations
of the disease are necessary to confirm this and to ensure that vertical
race-specific resistance is not selected in the varietal improvement
program (see Project File, Working Paper 1, Annex A).
4.08     In order to enable a timely start of the varietal improvement
programme, it is necessary that the methodology of the rapid preliminary
screening technique is worked out beforehand and that large numbers of
candidate ortets (promising tolerant trees) identified from field surveys
are subjected to it   The primary objective of this will be to act as a



- 25 -
negative screen to eliminate susceptible material from further, more
detailed study. In addition, this technique will provide important basic
information on host/parasite relat'ons.
4.09     Under the Project, studies on the resistance mechanisms of the
various clones in the varietal improvement program and their performance
under field induced epidemic conditions will be evaluated. In addition,
the incidence and severity of the disease and pests will need to be
recorded to ensure that resistance to these potential problems is
incorporated.
4.10     Secondary objectives of the crop protection research program will
include monitoring the effects of crop protection chemicals on the
environment, including the effects on soil, cashew pollinators, predators
and parasites of Helopeltis.   Control of Helopeltis and associated die
back diseases may become a priority consideration after the Oidium problem
has been solved.
4.11     Varietal Improvement.  Initial emphasis of the Varietal
Improvement Team will be to breed for Oidium disease Lesistance or
tolerance but will soon change to combining resistance or tolerance with
higher yield potential (see Project File, Working Paper 1, Annex E for a
description of the advocated 'Accelerated Varietal Improvement System").
There is good reason to assume that a variety with a reasonable level of
resistance of tolerance can be produced after one year and a variety
combining this tolerance level with increased yield potential produced
after four years. Subsequent multiplication will also be rapid. Both
targets are ambitious, and demand high research efficiency and no
constraint in implementation. The two local plant breeders will be
assisted by a specialist familiar with recurrent mass selection techniques
suitable for rapid and progressive production of impruved varieties by
vegetative propagation. The vegetative propagation program, assisted by
FAO, will be essential to the proposed varietal improvement program and
should be an integral part of it. The varietal improvement team will also
be responsible for the establishment of poly-clonal seed gardens at the
various cashewnut development centers.
4.12     Agronomy.  ^-ily a moderate proportion of the effort of "he
Agronomy Team will be on routine agronomy research such as determining
optimum tree density per hectare in relationship to size and age of trees,
fertilizer, minimum tillage methods for soil improvement, and devising
cashew farming systems that combine annual food crops with cashew to
optimize returns to labor and land. The main effort of the Agronomy Team
will be directed to developing an integrated package of recommendations to
farmers (on disease control, improved varieties and cultural practices)
that works under the social and economic conditions of the farmer and the
research is to be regarded as complete only when farmers actually use the
recommendations.
4.13     All research staff will cooperate with extension staff and farmers
and have joint experiments on farmers fields but the Agronomy Team will
have the main responsibility for developing the already good research-
extension linkage which has been achieved by the Cashew Production
Improvement Pilot Project. The head of the Agronomy Team will be a senior



- 26 -
experienced research and development agronomist, who at the same time will
be team leader of the ODA team and responsible for coordinating all cashew
research activities. He will be a specialist in research-extension
linkages, and transfer of technology who will specifically cooperate with
the project's cashew production agronomist, including cooperation in
training and production of training materials.
4.14     Socio-Economics.  Under the CPIPP, the Planning and Economic Unit
has carried out some basic farm survey work in order to formulate and test
a number of hypotheses as to the cause of the decline in cashew production.
Although many factors have contributed to the decline (poor price
incentives, villagization, poor crop husbandry, poor pPfment and marketing
arrangements) the overriding cause found, was the pread of powdery mildew
(para 2.06). This work will be expanded under the research component of
the project through strengthening socio-economic research in the proposed
Farming System Research Program at Naliendele's Zonal Agricultural and
Livestock Research and Training Center. Technical assistance would be
provided by ODA to assist MALD in strengthening the socio-eco:uomic research
unit. The work of the unit would initially widen the scope of the farm
survey work carried out under CPIPP through socio-economic research on
current production patterns, cultural practices, incentives and
constraints. It is essential that research programes be designed in tandem
with a full analysis of incentives and constraints at the household level
so that technical research concentrates on options that are not only
practical, but also socially and economically acceptable to the farmer.
Socio-economic research would pay particular attention to the role of, and
opportunities for women in cashew production, identifying those constraints
that could prevent women from taking full advantage of the project
benefits. The socio-economic research team would work closely with the
Cashew Coordination Unit and with the coconut FSR unit in those areas where
cashew and coconut are grown together.
(ii) Planting Material Development
4.15     Cashew Development Centers.  In order to make new tolerant
planting materials from Naliendele rapidly available, 7 multipurpose
Cashewnut Development Centers (COCs) will be established, to produce clones
and scions initially, and improved polyclonal seeds at a later stage. The
Centers will also function as demonstrations, training grounds and
verification test sites for Naliendele's Cashew Research Program. The CDCs
will be strategically located in the major agro-ecological cashewnut
production areas and directly supplied with initial clonal planting
materials. Each Center will have some 16 ha for scionwood production (1
ha), for a clonal garden collection (l ha), for the establishment of a poly
clonal seed garden (6 ha), for breeding and screening purposes (2 ha), and
for training and demonstration purposes (6 ha). Two CDCs will be
established in project year 2 at Naliendele and in Newala. three in
project year 3 in Central Lindi region, Masasi/Nachingwea area and Pwani
district and two more in project year 4 at Tunduru/Ruvuma and Tanga region.
The establishment of tne last two CDCs will be subject to the mid-term
review results (para 5.11). In the first three to four yeats, scionwood
would be produced and delivered to village nurseries, where a number of
women and men will be trained to do the grafting on local rootstock either
at the village nursery or in farmers fields. Once the best tolerant clones



- 27 -
have been identified and the first polyclonal seed-gardens established by
year 4 or 5, improved seeds can be produced and distributed and the system
of grafting gradually phased out. Support fir the production of planting
materials in the 7 CDCs comprises of the financing of civil works for 7
CDCs, vehicles, farm equipment, materials and agricultural consumables,
training, travel and incremental O&M. Each CDC will be managed by a senior
cashew subject matter specialist who will live on site with an assistant
and provide advice and services to the cashew producing districts in his
region.  A 4 year technical assistance program for vegetative propagation
financed by IDA, and implemented by FAO is also provided. Total base costs
of the planting material production component is estimated at about US$3.9
million and shown in Table 2 of Annex I in the Project File.
(iii) Production Development
4.16     Demonstration, Training and Technology Development.  This
component comprises all those activities which are necessary to
successfully introduce with the assistance of Research new tolerant
planting materials from ,daliendele and the 7 Cashew Development Centers
(CDSs), together with more intensive cashew based production systems to
farmers in the main cashew production areas of the Southern Regions of
Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma and the Coastal Region. Support for this
subcomponent is for some rural housing-cum-office facilities (US$0.2
million) for a number of cashew subject matter specialists, vehicles and
ofLice equipment (US$1.4), materials and consumables (US$0.2 million), 6
man-years of technical assistance for a cashew production agronomist, 6
man-months of short-term consultancies, training funds for 3 MSc/BSc
candidates, study tours and local training and funds for incremental
salaries and services and operational travel allowanceb. Total base costs
of this component, including recurrent costs, are estimated at about US$3.3
million equivalent for 6 years. Detailed costs are provided in Table 2 of
Annex I in the Project File.
4.17     Demonstrations  of integrated more diversified cashew production
packages will be initiated in some 220 village clusters and monitored under
the Project with the assistance of research staff from Naliendele. Under
the original (CPIPP) pilot project, some 60 demonstrations had been carried
out successfully in the various districts of Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma.
These demonstrations will be modified according to the prevailing farming
system in the area of which some 26 farming systems with different crop
combinations have been identified for the Southern Tanzania cashew areas.
The integrated reclamation/replanting package has been designed to reclaim
old and neglected cashew groves and includes component reconmmendations for:
clearing bush; thinning of cashew stands to a suitable density;
interplanting of high yielding varieties of annual crops including cassava
to meet, food production objectives as well; easing maintenance tasks
through more rationalized management; using fertilizers on annual crops;
applying chemical disease control on selected tr~._   responsive to this
treatment; and establishing new tree plantings tolerant to powdery mildew
in areas where unproductive older cashewnut trees have been removed.
Another package has been prepared for the establishment of new cashew
groves with tolerant cashew trees planted in rows with intercropping of
annual food, oil and leguminous crops and the use of fertilizers on the
interplanted crops, which are rotated every year.



- 28 -
4.18     The integrated packages require substantial amounts of new inputs
and a change in farmers attitude towards cashew. Instead of viewing it as
a bush crop, it needs to be treated as a valuable horticultural crop using
scientifically verified multi-crop production technologies and crop
husbandry practices. The demonstration plots show all these aspects.
Establishment of demonstration plots and the responsibility of conducting
the demonstrations will rest with the District's Agricultural and Livestock
Officer (DALDO) and the District's Cashew Subject Hatter Specialist (SMS)
through the Village Extension Workers (VEW). Other recommended technical
packages will be obtained from the Regional Agricultural Development and
Livestock Officers (RALDO) who will work hand in hand with the Department
of Research and Training of MALD and the Cashew Improvement Program (CIP)
to fonmulate these packages. Basic support facilities and an experienced
production agronomist will be provided to establish the demonstrations in
the various cashewnut producing regions.
4.19     Training and Technology Development  The Cashew Improvement
Program (CIP) of the proposed Project will strengthen extension services
related to cashewnut based production systems. In particular, the program
is intended to improve extension impact by improving extension agent s
knowledge of cashewnut production, and promoting strategies for increasing
overall agricultural production under the NALERP project, under which a
Training and Visit (T&V) extension system will be introduced nationwide.
The technological packages recommended by the completed Cashew Improvement
Pilot Project (CIPP), as shown in the village cluster demonstration farms
and the introduction of new tolerant clones, will be   * main messages for
T&V in the cashewnut. production areas. In order to facilitate the
implementation of the NALERP project and to meet the proposed Project's
objectives, training support for cashew production specific extension,
including the provision of training materials already developed (see
Project File, Working Paper 1), will be provided by Naliendele's Research
Staff and the project's senior specialist staff. The training will involve
the CIP project's staff, SMS's, professional extension staff, senior
regional and district staff of other government departments, and interested
NGOs in the cashewnut production areas, trainers of the MALD's Agricultural
Training Institutes (MATls), VEWs, propagators/grafters and farmers. The
Project will coordinate cashew specific training abroad and that provided
by expatriate staff and visiting consuiltants.
(iv) Management and Coordination
4.20     The CIP Management and Coordination Unit (MCU) is responsible for
the overall coordination, planning and management of resources to ensure
that the cashew improvement program is successfully implemented. In
particular, the Unit will: (a) plan annual program activities in
coordination with Naliendele's Cashew Research Team and the Regional
Agricultural and Livestock Development Officers; (b) coordinate the
financial and manpower resources and training required to implement the
program; (c) provide and coordinate assistance to regions to develop and
implement annual cashew development plans and projects; (d) liaise with ODA
and other external agencies to ensure availability of the support and
timely implementation of the program; and (e) monitor and evaluate CIP
activities.

4.21     The MCU is responsible for the overall management and direction of
CIP. Its staff is provided by MALD from its regular Extension and Research
staff roster and staff already involved in the CPIPP pilot project. The
cashew coordinator will be supported by a deputy, both nominated with the
concurrence of IDA (paras 8.01a and 8.02a), a planning office, finance and
accounting office and an administration and general services office. The
planning office will be responsible for assisting Regions to develop cashew
improvement plans. It will coordinate annual plans and implement the
monitoring and evaluation of the program, prepare quarterly and annual
reports, maintain a data base on the cashew industry, develop a management
information system and coordinate consultancies, surveys and stud'ies. The
finance and accounting officer will be responsible for the preparation of
budgets, coordination of financial resources and keeping all cashew
improvement program accounts, including overall cashew research accounts
for ODA.   The administrative office is responsible for coordinating both
recruitment of personnel and payments, procurement, disbursements and
personnel emoluments. The general services branch in the administrative
office will be responsible for coordinating maintenance of project
equipment and buildings. It will also be responsible for supervising the
civil works components of the program. This will include substantial
construction in the initial years of the program.
4.22     Under the Project, the CIP Management and Coordination Unit will
be provided with: (i) housing, office and some office storage facilities
to the amJunt of US$1.2 million; (ii) vehicles and equipment including
office equipment and furniture to the amount of US$1.4 million; (iii) 12
man-years of long-term technical assistance, including the M&E specialist
and project financial controller and 12 man-months of short-term
consultancies, including assistance to review after three years of project
implementation the need for a future Treecrops Development Institute or
Unit within MALD and for the preparation of a follow-up National Cashew
Industry Rehabilitation Project including cashew processing facilities.
Adequate specialist training and travel budget, including incremental
managerial staff allowances to the amount of US$0.5 million will also be
provided. Total base costs of this component is US$5.1 million of which
US$2.6 million are investment costs for civil works and equipment.
Detailed costs are shown in Table 4 of Annex I in the Project File.
(v) Input Supply and Marketing Support.
4.23     The Project would assist the extension service in the provision of
technical advice to cashew growers for the development of both annual
intercrops and cashewnut production. Credit resources for beneficiaries
(individually or through the CUs/PSs system) to purchase inputs for the
production of annual crops, fertilizers, seeds and minor equipment, would
be made available through CRDB's regular credit operation. Availability of
these inputs in the local markets is generally adequate and producers would
purchase their requirements from local dealers or through the CUs/PSs
channel. However, as the implementation of the CIP indicates (para 2.17),
specialized inputs, particularly pesticides and small equipment required
for dusting to control powdery mildew, are not available locally and need
to be imported. The amount of foreign exchange required annually for these
purposes is relatively small. Nonetheless, until the liberalization
process is fully implemented and foreign exchange constraints eliminated,



- 30 -
it is difficult for local traders to obtain resources through the Forex
allocation system. Therefore, specific arrangements would be made, to
ensure availability of these inputs in the project areas. For this
purpose, the Project would make available to CRDB a Forex credit line of
US$1.1 million, an amount estimated to be required during the first three
year implementation period (Table 5 of Annex I in the Project File) for a
limited dusting program. (Annex II, Attachement I). CRDB would open a
credit line for licensed importers/traders to procure and distribute
sulphur dust, blowers and protective clothing, in the cashew production
areas. A technical assistance marketing/credit specialist will be provided
for 3 years in Mtwara to assist CRDB, the Primary Societies, the
Agricultural Input Supply Company (AISCO), private traders and farmers in
obtaining the necessary local credit and the foreign currency for the
importation of goods to the amount of US$50,000 equivalent per importer,
from the multi donor financed Open General License (OGL) Facility. In the
event that local traders/importers are noL sufficiently forthcoming, the
Project itself would undertake the importation. The specialist will also
assist in launching the Pilot Credit Scheme for the southern cashewnut
production areas. Total component base costs are estimated at US$1.6
million (Table 5, Annex I in Project File).
(vi) Pilot Credit Scheme
4.24     To test the demand and improve the credit situation in the cashew
production areas of Mtwara and Lindi Regions, a Pilot Credit Scheme (PCS)
would be launched by CRDB. The PCS component would test alternatives to
increase overall operational efficiency of the CRDB's credit system by
implementing measures to strengthen CRDB's lending capabilities, furthering
development of operational policies and procedures, and exploring
alternatives to lessen the risks associated with the expansion cf rural
lending. The implementation of the component would provide an opportunity
for thoroughly testing the lending, managerial and procedural requirements
in the main cashewnut production areas to be replicated later in the
envisaged Agricultural Credit Project. The PCS would provide resources to
the equivalent of US$2.2 million to test revised lending policies and
procedures affecting (i) CRDB's internal operation and credit management
procedures; and (ii) the integration and linkages of the credit system with
cooperatives, the input supply system, and extension services. In
particular, the component would test in selected CRDB's branch offices
alternatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the credit
delivery and management systems through the implementation of measures to:
(i) increase coverage of the credit system; (ii) improve CRDB's policies,
procedures and analytical capabilities; (iii) establish closer linkages
with primary cooperatives and the extension system; (iv) increase CRDB's
participation and operational responsibilities in the process of subloan
approval, supervision and portfolio recovery; and (v) de-link credit for
supply and distribution of inputs from production credit to farmers.
(Table 6 of Annex I in the Project File).

D. Detailed Features for National Coconut
Development Program (NCDP)
(i) Research
4.25     The Coconut Research Program as developed under the Coconut Pilot
Project (CPP) will be continued with up-dated work approaches and a
modified emphasis on a greater use of the East African Tall for possible
drought tolerance in the breeding and selection activities. For this
purpose, the old coconut station at Chambezi would be revived. The Coconut
Program Coordinator and the Research Team Leader are both represented in
the Technical Coordinating Committee (para 5.03) and are responsible for
direct coordination between coconut research and extension staff. The
agronomy research program will gradually be scaled down and its emphasis
shifted to on-farm varietal testing and demonstrations with the assistance
of extension agents and palm growers. The research program will continue
to be production oriented to increase coconut production in Zanzibar and on
the Mainland of Tanzania. The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), through
its development agency GTZ, will as in the past, and under a grant
agreement with GOT, fully support the coconut research component of the
Treecrops Project, including the provision of 4 long-term specialists
(breeder, entomologist, pathologist, farming systems specialist) of which
one will be the P.esearch Team Leader, short-term consultancies, some civil
works, research equipment and vehicles, farm inputs, part of the research
operating costs and overseas travel and training of counterpart staff to
the total amount of US$5.7 million dollars equivalent, including price
contingencies. Total coconut research base costs excluding EAT
research/multiplication is estimated at US$5.4 million. Detailed base
costs for research program components are provided in Tables 7-15 of Annex
I in the Project File. ExpF.triate specialists staff will only be in place
as long as their counterparts are away on training or need direct support
during the handing over transition stage. The grant agreement with GOT for
parallel financing of the Coconut Research is a condition for project
effectiveness (para 8.01d)
4.26     Agronomy Research.  This research component has already provided a
wealth of information on the effects of weeding, different spacings and the
beneficial effect of intercropping. The varietal testing program of
hybrids and EAT's will remain the most important activity, in particular,
vis-a-vis drought tolerance, early production and copra out turn. The
program will be closely coordinated with the pest and disease control
specialists for continued screening of pesticides, methods of application,
biological control methods and Lethal Disease tolerance. There will also
be a close link with the coconut based farming system research section on
fertilizer application of the interplanted crops rather than on the palm
tree itself.  Soil surveys and exploratory fertilizer trials, in new
potential coconut development areas need also to be carried out.  The
agronomy section will benefit from short-term consultancies, on-the-job
local counterpart training and some short-term overseas courses and study
tours. Total agronomy research program base costs, including recurrent
costs are estimated at US$900,000 equivalent for the Mainland program and
US$150,000 equivalent for the Zanzibar program. Cost details are shown in
Tables 7 and 8 of Annex I in the Project File.



- 32 -
4.27     Disease Research.   Lethal Disease (LD) is a serious threat to the
coconut industry of Mainland Tanzania, affecting already about 402 of the
coconut growing areas, alternated with disease free areas. The cause is a
mycoplasma-like-organism (MLO); its vector is unknown.  The only control
practically possible is breeding for resistance. Due to its similarity to
Lethal Yellowing Disease (LYD) in Jamaica, it was expected that the use of
the LYD resistant Malayan Yellow Dwarf (MYD) variety as mother tree in the
Tanzanian coconut breeding program would overcome the LD problem as well.
However, LD turned out to be different from the Jamaican LYD which was
brought under control with the use of MYD while none of the imported dwarf
or tall varieties have shown satisfactory resistance. Some local EAT
varieties do show good promise but their testing started only 3 years ago
and no conclusions can be drawn yet.
4.28     Therefore, new, genetically different varieties of dwarf and tall
coconuts will have to be imported and tested for their LD resistance.
Meanwhile, breeding for higher levels of resistance will be carried out in
the disease testing area of Kifumangao, by continued substitution of palms
that died from the disease by progeny of surviving hand pollinated palms of
the same variety. Gradually, the best performing varieties will be
selected and muitiplied. In this research program, close cooperation with
the Breeding Section is a must. Other research activities on vector
identification, transmission trials and epidemiology will be carried out at
the revived Chambezi Coconut Research Station. Research on control of
nursery aiseases such as Blast, Dry Bud Rot, and Leaf Spot will also
continue. The incumbent expatriate plant pathologist, would continue his
work in the initial years on the Project after which he would pay annual
visits to advise the local counterpart staff by then in place. Total base
costs for the disease control research program are estimated at US$650,000
equivalent. Cost details are shown in Table 9 of Arnex I in the Project
File.
4.29     Pest Research.  The major pests affecting coconut production in
Tanzania in descending order of importance are: the coreid bug
(Pseudotherapthus wayi), the Rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes monoceros) and the
coconut mite (Erophyes guerreronis). The coreid bug causes serious damage
to the young developing nuts (vidaka), in particular, in closer stands of
young trees. Chemical control is only possible in the first 5-10 years
when trees are still short and the flowers and young fruits can be reached.
Biological control with the red leaf-weaving "maji-moto' ants (Oecophylla
longinoda) shows to be very promising in controlling the coreid bugs
damage. However, a group of smaller black ants are predators of the
beneficial red ants and need to be controlled with chemical baits.
Research will be carried out on biology and laboratory rearing of the bug,
on chemical control in young trees and on biological control in combination
with intercropped perennial host plants like leafy fruit trees and
leguminous trees. Control of the Rhinoceros beetle can be done in young
trees by direct beetle-hooking, but is very cumbersome. Biological control
by releasing infected beetles with different strains of Baculovirus
oryctes) into beetle breeding sites has shown increasing levels of virus
infections and reduced beetle damage; however, definite conclusions can
not be drawn yet, requiring the continuation of this research project. The
coconut mite affected nuts become distorted and conitain less copra than
healthy ones. Chemical control is virtually impossible and no control



- 33 -
methods are known yet. Although research on control of the mite at this
stage will have only low priority, the development of its incidence and
damage should continue to be monitored. Total base costs of the pest
control research program, including technical assistance are estimated at
US$1.2 million for the Mainland and about US$100,000 for Zanzibar. Cost
details are shown in Tables 10 and 11 of Annex I in the Project File.
4.30     Breeding Research.  Based on the presence of LD lethal disease and
occurrence of drought, there are roughly four coconut growing conditions in
Tanzania for which different coconut varieties and hybrids are required.
These conditions are: (i) the LD-free, relatively humid areas of the
Islands of Zanzibar, Pemba and Mafia and certain parts of the mainland;
(ii) the LD diseased relatively moist areas of the mainland; (iii) the LD,
diseased, relatively dry areas on the mainland, and (iv) the LD free, but
rather marginal dry areas for coconut production. About 15X of the
pote,itial coconut area belongs to this last category. Under the previous
Coconut Pilot Project, the breeding program, although not intentionally,
mainly focussed on hybrid seed product.ion for the first growing condition
of a higher rainfall and LD-free environment mainly using the West Africa
Tall (WAT) and Malayan Yellow Dwarf (MYD) combination, known as hybrid
PB121 or MAWA. Another hybrid introduced under the breeding program is
CAMWA, a WATx Cameroun Red Dwarf (CRD) combination. Under the proposed
coconut development program, breeding research will now expand its prograrn
with breeding/selection of existing and newly imported planting materials
for the other three conditions as well. For the LD-diseased areas, an
expanded germ plasm collection of dwarf and tall coconut varieties will be
tested and selected for LD resistance characteristics. For the dryer,
mostly disease-free areas, greater use will be made of selected indi(genous
_AT varieties in the breeding program together with more drought tolerant
dwarfs like Brazilian Green Dwarf (BGD).
4.31     Breeding activies for the first growing condition of disease free,
relatively humid areas will continue on the hybrid seed farms of Zanzibar
and Mafia although at a lower production level than before.  The disease
testing and selection program for LD resistance under conditions (ii) and
(iii) has already started under the Disease Control Section at Kifumangao
but will be expanded for breeding purposes, while for the fourth condition,
which requires drought tolerance, the Chambezi Station will be further
upgraded for br2eding work with improved and elite EAT, including seea nut
production.  At this station agronomy and disease control research has been
carried out for several years already. The total base costs of this
breeding program is estimated at about US$1.0 million for Zanzibar and
Mafia to be financed by FRG and about US$0.8 million, for the Mainland to
be financed by IDA mostly new investments for facilities for breeding
research on EAT and multiplication of selected best tolerant types (para
4.36). Long-term technical assistance, short-term consultancies and
overseas training are also included. Cost details are provided in Tables
12 and 13 of Annex I in the Project File.
4.32     Coconut Based Farming Systems Research  Farming systems research
will combine agronomic, economic and social research aspects in studying
the appropriateness of technical improvements for the smallholder's coconut
production through on-farm-trials. Current and improved husbandry methods
as well as different coconut varieties will be compared and the farmers



- 34 -
response monitored and evaluated. The focal point of interest is to gain
insights relevant for coconut production but research emphasis is placed on
the interaction between the palms and other elements of the farm
organization such as cropping pattern, intercropping, animal husbandry, and
their competition for the farmer's resources. Such interactions have to be
analyzed in the context of natural and socio-environmental aspects, e.g.,
traditional/other land tenure systems, marketing, etc. The research will
be done on 80-100 farms, sampled on the basis of their representativeness
of smallholders in the major coconut areas. Reliable results can be
expected only after three to five years. Experience gained will help to
assess better the relevance of the project's other research activities.
The FSR research will closely cooperate with agronomy research, disease and
pest control research and extension. FSR research will also deal with
those areas, where both coconut and cashew are grown in mixed stands,
requiring coordination wich Naliendele's Cashew Research Program. The
Ccconut FSR program will also coordinate and cooperate with the Research
Department of MALD on more broader based farming systems research
activities  elsewhere *n the country.  Long-term and short-term techni.cal
assistance, counterpart training, vehicles and equipment and operational
budget will be provided to the estim&ted amount of total base cost of about
US$1.6 million for both Zanzibar and Mainland Tan,-ania. Detailed costs are
presented in Tables 14 and 15 of Annex I in the Project File.
(ii) Seed Nut Production
4.33     Both artificially pollinated hybrid and improved EAT seednuts will
be produced for the 60Z disease free coconut areas. Once LD tolerant
materials from the Disease and Breeding Research Programs become available
the seed nut production program will be further expanded to better serve
the 402 LD affected areas, which now rely on a mixture of locally selected
EAT types.
4.34     Zanzibar and Mafia Hybrid Seedfarms.  These farms, to a total of
180 ha, supply hybrid seed nuts to the LD free, relatively humid coconut
areas of the islands and mainland. They are well managed and well equipped
with facilities and machineries and planted with a wide variety of dwarf
mother trees and pollen producing tall father trees. Both stations produce
equally and have an annual capacity of some 0.5 million seed nuts, of which
presently about 302 are sold as seednuts to farmers, private and public
nurseries and estates. There is therefore a clear excess capacity at this
stage, which could change rapidly once the merits of hybrids (higher yields
and earliness) have been generally accepted by the farmers and they are
willing to pay higher seed nut prices than they have been used to. The
overall annual requirements for Tanzania at the end of the Project is
estimated at 1.4 million seednuts, mainly based on the assumptions that
because of age, 50Z of all existing coconut trees (22.4 million) need to be
replaced, and the coconut production area could be doubled from its present
240,000 ha area. (see para. 3.01) At present the demand for hybrids is
estimated to be about 201 of total requirement for replanting, but it is
expected that by 1995 this demand will increase to 60X, which can still be
satisfied by the two seedfarms without additional investments. Therefore,
initially, the two seedfarms will be maintained at one third of their
existing production capacity, but will immediately respond when annual
demands for hybrids increase.



-35 -
4.35     Most hybrids produced are the MAWAs, (MYD x WAT) and CAMWAs (CRD x
WAT) both with the same WAT pollinator introduced by IRHO from West Africa.
However, in the Project Coconut Development Program, more use will be made
of selected EATs as pollinator with MYD, MRD and CRD, depending on the
results from the ongoing breeding program's yield trials. For the disease
free, dryer areas the hybrid seed program will also include identified
drought tolerant dwarfs, such as the Brazilian Green Dwarf. Presently both
seedfarms are well managed by German Volunteers, while MALD counterpart
staff are under training. Once experienced local managers become
available, the management of the seedfarm will be handed over to them. The
overall base costs for six years are estimated at US$0.7 million for each
of the two seed farms which include both investment and recurrent costs
(Tables 16 and 17 of Annex I in the Project File). Revenues from the sales
of seednuts and fresh nuts will be ploughed back into the seedfarm
operation. Presently seednut prices are subsidized for about 50Z to
encourage the uptake of high quality seednuts; prices charged are from TSh
14 for EAT to TSh 24 for hybrids (Annex II)
4.36     EAT Research Breeding and Seednut Production.  EAT seed nut
selection is presently mainly dcne by the coconut extension staff from heap
selections of a mixture of locally selected EATs lr. the villages. Although
this system is an improvement over the farmers' method of at random
collection of germinated nuts, there is no guarantee for better production,
quality or tolerance to disease and drought. Under the ongoing disease and
breeding research programs, promising individual EAT palms and some groups
of EAT types with good characteristics have been identified. The production
of high quality improved seedlings from cross pollinated EATs is time
consuming and requires careful selection of high yielding mother trees,
selection of only the best 30-50Z seedlings in the nursery and culling all
the undesirable off-types when the palms start producing, such as poor
growth, late bearing, low yields, undesirable nut quality etc. After th*
establishment of an improved EAT seed garden, an intensive screening
program will be undertaken by the breeding research section to identify the
best elite EAT trees for inclusion in the hybrid breeding program as a
compatible pollinator with good combining ability with selected dwarfs and
as a possible donor for LD tolerance and/or drought resistance. The
progeny of the artificially pollinated elite EAT, would then provide elite
EAT seednuts which would be planted in an upgraded elite EAT seed block
which would then produce the elite EAT seednuts for farmers' use. Because
of the close interaction required between EAT breeding research and seednut
production, one or two combined EAT seedfarm-cum-breeding stations will be
established at Chambezi and more south, along the coast to a total of about
100 ha. The development of these facilities will be carried out under
research but financed by IDA at an estimated cost of about US$1.1 million,
including contingencies (Table 18 of Annex I in the Project File).
(iii) Production Development
4.37     Targets.  The Coconut Production Development Section (CPDS)  will
continue its subject matter specialist and local training functions within
MALD's overall extension structure (para 3.07) and provide the technical
packages for coconut development under the NALERP project. It will assist
smallholders, estates and interested NGOs in coconut rehabilitation,
replanting and expansion from an annual total of 0.35 million palms at the



- 36 -
start of the project to an estimated 1.40 million palms in 1995 at the
completion of the project. By that time, it is estimated that 601 of the
seednuts planted will be hybrids. In total some 4.1 million seedlings will
be provided during project implementation through CPDS and the field
extension services. A major task will be the training of local extension
field staff, coconut growers and private entrepreneurs in nursery
development and seedling selection.
4.38     Organization.  In order to deal with all the promotional aspects,
CPDS activities are carried out by three units at NCDPs head office:
Information and Training Unit (ITU), Nursery Development Unit (NDU) and a
smaller unit for Estates. All major coconut growing regions are
represented by an experienced MALD/NCDP officer to assist the respective
Regional Agricultural and Livestock Development Officer (RALDO) in
organizing coconut development work. The organization includes Zanzibar
where a branch office, integrated into the Zanzibar Department of
Agriculture caters for Pemba as well. Each regional coconut subject matter
specialist will obtain a complementary budget in line with his action plan
for farmers' field days, follow-up, coconut-growers' interest groups,
including smallholder seedling production for premiums and incentives,
nursery personnel training and extension worker training.
4.39     Training of Field Staff by the coconut program's Information and
Training Unit (ITU) will be carried out cadre-courses, for nursery
personnel and for organizing farmers' field-days:
(i)   Seventy MALD workers will be trained each year in two weeks
orientation courses to generate a better understanding of
the project purpose, progress of the program and
contribution expected from the participants besides
technical aspects;
(ii)  One week training courses will be organized for district
personnel and smallholders in raising and selection of
coconut seedlings; the number of participants will increase
from 50 in vear one to 80 in year three and remain constant
there after;
(iii) A 'mobile field unit' will collaborate with Regional and
District Agricultural and Livestock Development Officers
(RALDO and DALDOs) to organize a series of farmer's field
days, thereby training extension-workers on the job, and
inform and motivate coconut growers.
The numbers of events will increase from 115 in year one to 165 in year
six. All training events are budgeted under the respectlve RALDO regional
funds. The ITU is also responsible for the monitoring of the performance
of the coconut extension workers and the research-extension linkage with
the research section. Frequent refresher courses and on-the-job training
of MALD staff will ensure that information is dessiminated. CPDS will
continue to regularly process research findings.   To maintain contacts to
branches where telephone can not be relied on, radio-call will be installed
with a skeleton radio network of MALD to ensure fast exchange of
information on important matters.



- 37 -
4.40     Nursery Development  will be carried out by the Nursery
Development Unit which will be responsible for (i) the expansion of nursery
infrastructure; (ii) technical and management advice; (iii) identification
of resources; (iv) supplying quality seednuts and provide assistance in
hybrid seedling selection, and (v) provision of basic inputs and transport.
The project will not operate its own nurseries. It is envisaged that some
325 nurseries from small (<5000 seednuts/yr) to large (>20,000
seednuts/yr.) will be developed. Government village nurseries, other
public institutions like schools, and non-profit NGOs qualify for all types
of nursery assistance and grants. Private nurseries and estates will pay
for all inputs except for advisory services. The unit will maintain a
store at Dar es Salaam to supply tools, chemicals and materials which are
not normally available in the villages to coconut growers and to nurseries.
The supply of Fl hybrid seednuts, selection of EAT seednuts and the
organizing of transport of inputs are services against payment. These
services include the supply of grafting material, pruning knives, beetle
hooks, the delineation of diseased areas, site selection, inspection and
outlay of the nursery. Initially, there will be an element of subsidy in
all these services rendered. Normally subsidies and grants will cover not
more than 502 of total investment costs. Details for nursery development
are provided in Annex 4. of the National Coconut Development Program's
Preparation Report.
4.41     Training of Senior Staff  No expansion of CPDS staff is envisaged,
but because CPDS officers will have to make important technical decisions
and to negotiate terms of cooperation with senior officials in the regions
and districts, they will need a BSc or similar qualification. Therefore
various MSc (one year) and BSc or Diploma courses (3 years) are being
sponsored. Beneficiaries will remain under bond for four years after
completion of the course. A selected number of distLict officers will make
a study tour abroad to study coconut development.
4.42     The project provides support for specific coconut production
development activities requiring investments for a limited number of
vehicles, equipment, demonstration materials and labour inputs, training,
travel allowances and part of the recurrent costs, excluding wages and
salaries of established MALD staff pcsitions. Long-term technical
assistance for a senior coconut production agronomist and for short-term
consultancies have alsc been provided. Total base costs for the Coconut
Production Development Program, is about US$2.0 million for the Mainland
and US$0.4 million for Zanzibar. Costs are detailed in Tables 19 and 20 of
Annex I in the Project File.
(iv) Program Management and Coordination
4.43     Coordination.  The scope and management of the proposed coconut
development program will continue along the san.e lines as before under the
National Coconut Development Program (NCDP). Technical Assistance support
arrangement with GTZ will continue till June 30, 1990 when the ongoing FRG
bilateral aid phase for NCDP expires and a new phase would commence. By
that time, sufficient managerial counterpart staff will have been trained
and gained on-the-job experience to take over the overall coconut project
management on the Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar.



- 38 -
4.44     The National Coconut Development Program's Management and
Coordination Unit (MCU) is responsible for the overall coordination,
planning and management of resources to ensure that the NCDP is
successfully implemented. In particular, the MCU will: (a) plan annual
program activities in coordination with the coconut research sections, seed
farms, nursery extension and the regional and district extension services;
(b) coordinate the financial and manpower resources and training required
to implement the program; (c) provide and coordinate assistance to regions
to develop and implement annual coconut development plans and projects; (d)
liaise with GTZ and other external agencies to ensure the support
requirements and timely implementation of the program; and (e) monitor and
evaluate NCDP activities. The MCU is responsible for the overall
management and direction of NCDP. Its staff is provided by MALD from its
regular Extension and Research staff already in place under the on going
NCDP program. The Coconut Coordinator, will be nominated with the
concurrence of IDA (para 8.01a), and be supported by the Zanzibar Coconut
Coordinator, the planning section, finance and administration section and
the technical support services.
4.45     Planning, Finan:e and Administration.  The planning section would
carry out annual planning and reporting, studies on coconut sector
development, provide relevant information for private investments in
coconut development, provide services to other NCDP sections, maintain a
data base for the coconut industry, and a management information system,
coordinate consultancies, surveys and studies and do the monitoring and
evaluation. The finance and administrative office will be responsible for
keeping coconut development program accounts, including overall coconut
research accounts for GTZ and coordinating both recruitment of personnel
and payments, procurement, disbursements and personnel emoluments.
4.46     The Technical Support Services will be responsible for
coordinating maintenance of project equipment and buildings, assist in the
preparation of technical design activities and carry out limited basic
emergency repairs and maintenance of transport and equipment. Regular
maintenance and repairs will be contracted out to existing qualified
workshops in the coconut production areas, wherever available.
4.47     Under the Project the NCDP Management and Coordination Unit will
be provided with (i) vehicles, mainly for replacement, equipment and
materials to the amount of US$0.6 million; (ii) 8 man years of long term
technical assistance, including the overall financial controller and first
year's continuation for management support in Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar;
(iii) 35 man months of short term technical assistance for management
support, planning, studies and reviews, including assistance to review and
recommend after three year of project implementation: (a) the need for a
future Treecrops Development Institute; (b) the possibility of (semi)
privatizing of the seedfarms and (c) for the preparation of a follow-up
National Coconut Industry Rehabilitation Project including oil processing
facilities. Adequate specialist training and budget including incremental
managerial staff allowances for travel and other expenses to the amount of
US$0.4, million will also be provided. Except for incremental staff, all
other recurrent costs will be boriie by GOT. Total base costs of this
Coconut Management and Coordination component including planning is US$3.1



- 39 -
million. Detailed base costs are shown in Tables 21-24 of Annex I in the
Project File.
E. Treecrops Development Unit/Institute
4.48     It is envisaged that after three years of project implementation
the Ministry of Agriculture would have a clearer picture of the future
development of the Tanzania cashew and coconut industries and would be in a
better position to assess its needs through a special study carried out
during the mid-term review. A possible scenario would be that in year 4 a
Treecrops Development Unit would be established under the 1,ssistant
Commissioner for Crops Development, and if necessary help to establish a
Treecrops Development Institute or Authority at project completion. Such
an Institute or Authority would be dealing with all treecrops in the
country. Its overall mandate would be to stimulate the development of
commercial treecrops and assist the private sector in the establishment of
viable seedfarms, producing high quality planting materials and to set
guidelines for breeders rights and quality control. The Institute would be
autonomous and function as an Authority, financed mostly by the private
sector. Under the proposed project, technical assistance would be provided
after three years (coinciding with the Midterm Review, para 5.11) to review
the feasibility of such an Institute and prepare proposals for a gradual
integration of the hard core breeding and multiplication activities of the
two cashew and coconut subprojects under the supervision of one
organization (i.e. Institute) at the end of the project.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01     The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestoc' Development (MALD) would
be responsible for the Project. Considering that -he bulk of the coconut
development activities are being carried out in the wetter, Northern
Regions along the coast and islands, while the cashew development
activities are mostly in the drier, Southern Regions of Tanzania, two
separate management units will be set up, of which the coconut management
unit is already in place. Overall responsibility for project
implementation, management, recruitment, planning, budgeting, procurement,
monitoring and evaluation and reporting would rest with the two Program
Coordinators for the Cashew Improvement Program (CIP) and the National
Coconut Development Program (NCDP), whose appointments are a condition of
project effectiveness (paras 8.01a). Both Cashew and Coconut Coordinators
will report directly to the Principal Secretary of Agriculture through the
Commissioner for Agriculture and Livestock Development. The NCDP will
continue under the existing organizational management system with the
understanding that overall management responsibility would gradually be
handed over from GTZ to the incumbent counterpart Coconut Coordinator. The
Zanzibar Coconut Coordinator will be appointed by the Zanzibar Ministry of
Agriculture. The NCDP coordinator's appointment will be with the
concurrence of IDA (para 8.01a). The Cashew Improvement Program,
originating from the Cashew Production Improvement Pilot Project (CPIPP) in
Mtwara, will be managed and organized in a way similar to the Coconut



- 40 -
Development Program, requiring the appointment of the Cashew Coordinator
and the Deputy Cashew Coordinator for Mtwara, both with IDA's concurrence
(paras 8.0ia and 8.02a). Under supervision of the Cashew Coordinator, a
central office will be established in Mtwara with a small office in MALD
Dar-es-Salaam to support the field operations. Detailed description of the
CIP management and organization is provided in Annex III. Organograms for
the cashew and coconut development programs are provided in Charts 3 and 4
respectively. Chart 1 shows the new structure of MALD, and Chart 2 the
institutional integration of the two programs.
5.02     The Cashew and Coconut Component Coordinators will be assisted by
the ODA team leader for cashew research support and by the GTZ team leader
for coconut research support. The CIP will be executed with the assistance
of the IDA funded internationallv recruited M&E specialist/program advisor
(already in place), financial controller, with experience in international
procurement, production agronomist and horticulturist for vegetative
propagation (already in place). The NCDP will also have IDA funded
internationally recruited specialists: financial controller with experienc2
in international procurement (already in place), production agronomist
(already in place) and overall seedfarm manager. Both programs will
benefit from short term consultancies for training, crop specific advice,
planning and management. Separate program accounts will be maintainec and
audited accounts submitted to IDA.
5.03     Because of the social and economic importance of cashew and
coconut to Tanzania, a joint cashew and coconut Technical Coordinating
Committee (TCC) will be set up. MALD's existing Management Team, chaired
by the Principal Secretary (PS) and comprising all heads of Departments
will be the advisory body for the Project and set policies, review CIP and
NCDP progress and their annual work plans and budgets. They will meet as
often as required, but at least twice a year. The TCC will report to the
PS through its chairman. The Cashew and Coconut Coordinators in
conjunction with MALD's Department for Research and Training, will provide
the PS with an annual review of cashew and coconut research programs funde-d
under the project. The TCC will be chaired by the Commissioner for
Agriculture and Livestock Development. The committee members will be CIP
and NCDP Coordinators, including the Coconut Coordinator from Zanzibar;
MA;D's cashew and coconut research coordinators; the director of
Faliendele; ODA's cashew research team leader; GTZ's coconut research team
leader; the RALDO's, from regions where the project is operating; CRDB;
TCMB; and representatives of the Ministry of Local Government,
Cooperatives, Community Development and Marketing. Before presentation to
the advisory body, the TCC will annually review the cashew and coconut
development programs, the research programs and the support services
required by both programs from other agencies (e.g. extension, training,
marketing, input supply, credit, etc). The TCC will meet at least once
every six months; initially even more frequently on a crop by crop basis.
The establishment of the TCC is a condition of project effectiveness (para
8.0lc).
5.04     The Cashew Research Coordinating Committee (CRCC) established
under the CIPP pilot project with members from Naliendele's cashew researu<.
team and CIP's senior staff for field operations, will be expanded with t.he 
ODA cashew researchers and chaired by MALD's national cashew research



- 41 -
coordinator, nominated by the Commissioner of Research and Training. A
similar arrangement for coconut research with the Department for Research
and Training and NCDP will also co..tinue to operate as before.
B. Coordination and Integration with ongoing Research and Extension
Activities
5.05     Both cashew and coconut components of the project focus on
research and development of new tolerant, high yielding planting materials
to boost Tanzania's cashew export and reduce Tanzania's import of vegetable
oils. There is a close coordination and interaction between the component
research activities of the pro4ect and the national agricultural research
body. While the National Agricultural and Livestock Research Project
(NALRP) and the National Agricultural and Livestock Extension
Rehabilitation Project (NALERP) both will aim at improving general
conditions for agricultural research and extension in Tanzania, this
Project specifically deals with the improvement and development of the two
major cashew and coconut treecrops of the country which are vital to the
smallholders welfare, in particular in southern Tanzania, where cashew is
the only cash crop available to them. Both crops would remain important
componeats of the Research Master Plan to be developed under the NALRP
project. Breeding research results and agronomic testing in two pilot
projects have reached the stage that new technological packages, including
new planting materials can be offered to the Extension for dessimination to
the farmers. It is the role of the Tree Crops Project to make these
materials sufficiently available to the Extension Services and to train the
extension subject matter specialists to disseminate the cashew and coconut
production technologies to the farmers.
C. Annual Work Plans
5.06     Annual Work Plans would be prepared separately for both crops Dy
the Coordinators with the assistance of ODA for cashew and GTZ for coconut
development and reviewed annually by the advisory committee and IDA. These
work plans would help to organize project implementation and allow for
adequate monitoring of the progress. The plans would irclude: (a) a
review of project implementation in the previous year; (b) a detailed
description of work to be carried out in the forthcoming year including
objectives, staff and farmers training, monitoring and evaluation
activities, deployment of staff and equipment, construction plans, and
procurement schedules; (c) requirements for additional staff, and inputs;
(d) requirements and arrangements for technical assistance, and local and
foreign training; and (e) a budget and financing plan, including local and
foreign currency requirements. Assurances were obtained that starting in
1990, the Annual Work Plans would be submitted to IDA by March 1 of each
year and would be carried out, taking IDA comments into account. However,
for the first project year, the work plans would be submitted to IDA by
November 30, 1989. (para 8.02b).

D. Credit SuPply
5.07     Credit for cashew growers to procure seasonal inputs and small
equipment, individually or through the PSs, would be provided through CRDB.
Funds for the importation of sulphur, blowers and protective clothing would
be provided through a US$1.1 million line of credit to CRDB while other
agricultural inputs for farmers would be provided through the PCS of US$2.2
million. Although total credit demand for agricultural inputs is
relatively small, credit is not sufficiently available through CRDB's
normal lending program in the project areas. Additional resources would
therefore be made available in the Mtwara and Lindi regions through the
Pilot Credit Scheme (par& 5.09).
5.08     Critical Inputs for cashew production such as sulphur dust and
blowers are not available normally in the domestic market. An important
aspect of the Project would be the progressive involvement of local
traders/importers in the cashewnut production areas to procure cashew
production inputs. Resources to import these would be provided by CRDB
through a line of credit, of US$1.1 million equivalent to enable local
traders/importers to obtain Tanzanian shillings as counterpart funds to
avail themselves of foreign currency made available through the O.G.L.
facilitv of the ERP. The CIP Input Supply and Marketing Support Unit,
jointly with the CIP Planning Unit, would make an annual estimation of
requirements/stocks which would serve as a basis for CRBD's annual lending
program. The Project would be responsible for scrutinizing and approval of
the import applications by traders. Sub-loans to traders would be at
commercial rates, set by the Bank of Tanzania and reviewed periodically.
In the event that local traders/importers are not sufficiently forth
coming, the Project itself would undertake the importation as has been done
in the past under the CPIPP pilot project.
5.09     The Pilot Credit Scheme   Overall responsibility of the Pilot
Credit component would be with the Chief Manager - Development Banking of
CRDB. Day-to-day implementation, coordination and supervision
responsibilities would be borne by a qualified senior executive to be
appointed by CRDB on full-time basis as Pilot Credit Scheme Coordinator,
who would report to the General Manager - Development Banking through his
Assistant. The appointment of the Pilot Credit Scheme Coordinator, on
conditions satisfactory to IDA, is a condition of disbursement of the
component (para 8.03b) and agreed upon during negotiations.
5.10     While the main duty of the Pilot Credit Scheme Coordinator would
be to assist in implementing operational policies and procedures required
for the execution of this component, he would also assist in the
preparation of training programs for CRDB field staff and credit users;
assist in the design of the system to be utilized for monitoring and
evaluation of the project's progress and impact; and secure, through CRDB's
management, whatever additional resources are required for effect4ve
implementation of the component. The coordinator would also be directly
responsible for preparation of periodic reports on the project's financial
and physical progress for timely submission to CRDB's management and to
IDA. Project funds for the lending program would be managed by CRDB
through a revolving fund that would be established as a separate, interest
bearing bank account. CRDB would, maintain a separate account and use all



- 43 -
amounts received from project beneficiaries, which are not needed for
repayment of principal, and payment of interest and other charges under the
Subsidiary Agreement, for additional lending using a revolving fund to
smallholders through primary societies.
E. Mid-Term Project Review
5.11     A mid-term project review would be undertaken by MALD not later
than three years after credit effectiveness and jointly evaluated by MALD,
IDA, GTZ, and ODA. It is envisaged that the Midterm Review implemention
report would cover, among others, progress in: the production and
introduction of new improved planting materials in integrated prcduction
packages including annual crops; the development of the Chambezi EAT
breeding and multiplication center and the CDCs reviewing the need for the
last 2 CDCs; the consolidation of tree crop specific research activities;
the professional training of project research staff and subject matter
specialists; the adaption rates of the extended technological packages by
farmers; the evolution of incomes of the treecrop farming community and
especially women farmers; and progress in improving the marketing, credit
and input supply in the cashew growing areas of the southern regions,
including the effectiveness of the Pilot Credit Scheme in the Mtwara and
Lindi Regions. The report of the review which would be presented to IDA
within 3 1/2 years after project effectiveness, would also make through a
separate study, recommendations for: the establishment of a Treecrops
Development Unit or Institute at the end of the Project; privatization of
the cashew and coconut seedfarms; the need for preparing proposals for the
expansion and rehabilitation of both the cashew and coconut industries,
including their processing and recommendations for the participation of the
private sector in financing treecrops development. Assurances to that
effect and agreement that the Government would prepare a mid-term
evaluation report with terms of reference to be agreed with IDA, GTZ and
ODA were obtained at negotiations (para 8.02c). Technical assistance would
be provided to MALD to study the feasibility of a Treecrops Development
Institute (para 4.48). Based on the results of the mid-term review, the
Government, IDA, GTZ and ODA would agree on changes that may be needed to
improve Project implementation and impact (para 6.02d).
F. Reporting and Monitoring
5.12     The Planning Units of the two cashew and coconut development
managements would prepare six monthly progress reports, in a fotmat
acceptable to IDA, for monitoring the financial and physical progress of
the components. When installed and operating, the management information
systems would be the source of monitoring data. The periods covered by
these semi-annual reports should coincide as much as possible with the crop
specific cycles of planting, crop maintenance/production and harvest.
Copies of these reports should also be sent to IDA not later than two
months after the agreed end of each six monthly reporting period. In
addition, w4thin six months of closing of the Credit, MALD would prepare
and forward to IDA a Project Completion Report (PCR) which would deal with
all aspects of the cashew and coconut development programs and would
evaluate the benefits derived by treecrop farmers and the country as a



- 44 -
whole from adopting new planting materials and integrated crop production
packages. Assurances that these reporting procedures would be adopted were
obtained at negotiations (paras 8.02e and 8.02 f).
VI. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
6.01     Total project costs including contingencies are estimated at
TSh5,090,2 million (US$42.4 million) of which TSh3,622.9 million (US$30.2
million) or 711 would be foreign exchange cost and TShl,467.3 million
(US$12.2 million) or 29Z local costs. Of the total project costs, TSh
3,094.2 million or 612 is for the cashew improvement component including
credit for PCS and TShl,996.0 million or 391 for the coconut development
component. The cost estimates are based on October 1988 prices updated to
levels expected to prevail in July 1989. The GOT does not levy duties or
taxes on goods and Eervices procured by Government Ministries. Price
contingencies are calculated on base costs excluding the PCS credit
component and are compounded using the following annual rates; on local
costs 17.22 in PYl, 12.6Z in PY2, 10.3% in PY3, and 10% thereafter; and on
foreign costs 3Z in PYl, 3.52 in PY2, and 42 thereafter. Total
contingencies are equi-alent to 17.6Z of total costs or 212 of base costs.
Detailed project costs presented in Annex 1, Tables 1-5 and in the Project
File are summarized in Text Table 6.01.
B. Financing
6.02     Of the total project costs of US$42.4 million, the IDA would
finance US$25.1 million on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. The
IDA Credit would represent 59% of project costs and would be 67% of foreign
costs and 41% of local costs. ODA would finance US$6.3 million,
representing the total cost of the cashew research component, (excluding
local staff salaries) while FRG would finance $5.7 million of the project
costs applicable wholly to the coconut research component (excluding local
staff salaries). The contributions of ODA and FRG would be direct grants
representing approximately 1L- and 142 respectively of total project costs,
while the balance of US$5.3 million, representing about 122 of the project
costs, would be financed by GOT. Detailed analysis of the financing plan
by project components and summary accounts are presented in Annex I, Tables
6-7 of the SAR. The financing pJan is presented in Table 6.02 below:

6.03     Of the IDA Credit of US$25.1 million, GOT would on-lend to CRDB
under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank: (a) an amount of US$1.1 million in foreign exchange to be relent to
traders for the importation and distribution of sulphur dust, blowers and
protective clothing. The terms and conditions of the sub-loans would be
established by the Bank of Tanzania and reviewed periodically; for on-
lending to CRDB, GOT would charge a minimum rate of 8.4Z per annum, and
repayment of principal would be in 10 years, with a four year grace period.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne bi CRDB. Under the same terms and
conditions as under (a), IDA would provide (b) another amount of US$2.2
million for granting sub-loans to small farmers under the Pilot Credit
Scheme. The execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between GOT and CRDB
is a condition of disbursement of the proceeds of the credit for the input
support and Pilot Credit Scheme (paras 8.03a and 8.03b).
C. Procurement
6.04      Goods.   Vehicles, equipment and minor agricultural inputs
totalling US$7.4 million would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages
and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Qualiiying
domestic manufacturers under ICB would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 152 or the import duty whichever is lower. Pests and disease
control inputs valued at US$1.1 million will be procured under the line of
credit provided to the private sector through CRDB. The procurement will
be done on the basis of annual requirements by beneficiaries who will
follow established commercial practices for the procurement of sulphur
dust, blowers, and protective clothing, with a minimum of three quotations
from two or more geographic sources of origin. Procurement applications
would be scrutinized and approved by the Project Coordinator. The Pilot
Credit Scheme of US$2.2 million, for the purchase of seedlings, fertilizer,
pesticides and other agricultural inputs like farm tools, would be managed
and monitored by CRDB. Items would be obtained from local suppliers at
competitive prices. In addition, off-the-shelf items (mainly vehicle spare
parts, office equipment and minor agrictultural inputs) costing less than
$20,000 each and needed urgently for project implementation during the life
of the project, may be purchased by prudent shopping after obtaining at
least three price quotations. The total value of items purchased in this
way should not exceed US$750,000 without prior IDA Agreement.
6.05     Works.  Civil works valued at US$4.0 million consist of a number
of minor works and construction of office buildings and staff houses.
These facilities are scattered throughout the five regions of the Project
area and are therefore not likely to attract foreign bidders. These would
be procured in packages of about US$300,000 through local competitive
bidding procedures in which foreign bidders would have the opportunity to
participate. Local procedures have been reviewed by IDA for procure"tent of
goods and works and found satisfactory except for preference given to
parastatals, which would not be applied in this IDA-financed project.
6.06     Consultant services would be procured according to IDA Guidelines,
with qualifications, concract terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Other project expenditures such as staff salaries, travel and expense
allowances and other recurrent operating expenditures are not subject to



- 47 -
procurement procedures. Procurement of items financed by FRG and ODA would
be according to FRG and ODA procurement procedures. respectively.
6.07     IDA-financed contracts for more than iuS$100.000 equivalent for
goods and works would require IDA review of procurement documentation prior
to award of contract. This will cover 40z of value items financed by IDA
under this project. Other IDA financed contracts would be subject to post-
award review. The following Table 6.03 summarizes procurement methods for
different expenditures:

6.09     Disbursement for all expenditures would be against full
documentation except for expenditures class.1fied under Categories (vi),
(vii) and (ix), local training costs included in Category (iv), and for
contracts for goods, civil works and services costing less than US$20,000
each, which would be based on statements of expenditure. Supporting
documentation for statements of expenditure should be retained by the
borrower for review by IDA and independent auditors. The statements of
expenditure would be subject to special audit each year.
6.10     The disbu-sement period of seven years is less than the Bank
profile for Tanzanian Agricultural projects which is eight years with about
75Z being disbursed over the first seven years. The accelerated
disbursement over a shorter seven-year period is justified by the
employment of consultants to assist in financial management and
procurement. Projected completion and closing dates are Dec. 31, 1995, and
June 30, 1996, respectively. The estimated disbursement schedule for the
IDA Credit is as follows:

6.11     Special Accounts and Project Accounts.  To ensure that IDA funds
for the Project would be readily available to finance IDA's share of
eligible expenditures, two Special Accounts in US dollars (one for cashew
and the other for coconuts) would be established in the Bank of Tanzania,
which will open two accounts in US Dollars in a Commercial Bank (para
3.02g). On notification of the opening of the Special Accounts after
credit effectiveness, US$750,000 representing 3 to 4 months estimated
disbursements for the cashew improvement program and US$400,000
representing 3 to 4 months disbursements for the coconut development
program would be deposited into the two respective Special Accounts to be
used for meeting any expenditure to be financed by IDA. Further deposits
by IDA to replenish the two Special Accounts would be made against
withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents. The procedures
for establishing and replenishing the two Special Accounts were agreed witn
GOT at negotiations (para 8.02g).  In order to ensure adequate and timely
counterpart funding GOT will open a separate Project Account for the Cashew
Improvement Program similar to the one already established for the Coconut
Development Program under the NCDP.  GOT will pay its share of the Project
costs quarterly and in advance into the two respective Project Accounts in
accordance with the Public Expenditure Review.  The establishment of the
two Project Accounts by (July 1, 1989) is a condition of project
effectiveness (para 8.01b).



- 50 -
6.12     A third Special Account would be established for the Pilot Credit
Scheme and the credit component for the input of chemicals and equipment to
be implemented by CRDB under a subsidiary loan agreement and under terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para 8.02g).
E. Accounts and Audit
6.13     Separate accounts will be maintained for the two cashew and
coconut development programs and the PCS in accordance with sound and
consistent accounting principles and practices. Annual project accounts of
each sub-project and CRDBs credit account under the Project, including the
PCS will consist of a summarized statement of sources and application of
funds including the research component, and a summarized statement of the
special account. Project accounts including the special accounts and the
statements of expenditures used for claiming reimbursements will be
separately audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
During project implementation, the Project Management Units and CRDB will
be required to submit to IDA, within 9 months after the end of each fiscal
year, Tune 30, audited accounts and certified copies of the auditors'
reports. Agreements have been obtained during negotiations on these
arrangements (para 8.02h).
VII. BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY
A. Benefits and Justification
7.01     Benefits.  The proposed project is expected to improve the
delivery of improved treecrops production packages, including new planting
materials to a large portion of Tanzania's southern and coastal cashew and
coconut farming community which should lead to long term growth and
increases in yields for annual staple foods, vegetable oil and export of
cashewnuts. The project would thereby raise rural incomes and employment
and contribute towards the national objectives of self sufficieacy in
staple foods and increased export earnings from the agricultural sector.
Moreover, the project will help accelerate the integration of women in the
economy because of their immediate intolvement in the cashew and coconut
subsector.
7.02     Another benefit would be the institution building, by
consolidating cashew and coconut specific research and development capacity
through training, improving management and planning capacity, and
establishment of efficiently run cashew and coconut seed development
centers.
7.03     For cashew, average manday returns from the combined tree and
intercrop production would be about TSh 100/day for replanting and TSh
170/day for ned plantings.  For coconuts, the returns would be an average
between TSh 200 to 300/day for replanting and TSh 120 to 350 for new
planting depending on the use of EAT's or hybrids.  For both commodity-
producer groups, the marginal increases in disposable cash income would be
very large, with the consequent stimulus to the local economy. For
existing coconut producers, rehabilitation alone (i.e. no "investment" in



- 51 -
new trees, but rather improved cultivation practices) including fertilized
intercrops would increase an.aual cash incomes by over 6002 on average.
For cashew and coconuts, phased replanting of existing trees with improved
disease resistant varieties or higher yielding varieties will increase
farmers net cash incomes on average by about 6002 for cashews and by
between 5502 and 7002 for coconuts (Farm Income Tables, Annex II & III of
the Project File)
7.04     Because of the emphasis on research and development and the risks
and uncertainty involved with this research dependent project (see sections
below on Risks and Sustainability), the cost/benefit analysis of the
project has been examined on the basis of 1 ha farm models (Annex II), the
main models being 60? replacement and replanting; 1002 new planting; and in
the case of coconut a choice between EATs and hybrids. These models serve
as examples (of samples) of the possible range of activities and benefits
that would accrue to the country if the research is successful, and if the
agronomic practices developed therefrom are widely adopted by the farmers.
Under these assumptions it is expected that both cashew and coconut
production levels will be doubled in 10 years time. The economic cost of
the project investment has been represented in these farm models by the
economic cost of the planting material, provided to the farmers by the
project at a financial cost to the farmer.   The economic rates of return
(ERR) for the recommended agronomic packages are all substantial and well
above the minimum acceptable level on the basis of the tree crop production
alone. The following table summarizes the ERR including the returns from
the food intercropping;
Farm Model       Cashews & Intercrops  Coconuts & Intercrops
Replanting             70 to 1142         East African Tall    412
HYBRIDS                392
New Planting           87 to 10OZ         East African Tall    28 to 34Z
HYBRIDS                42 to 712
7.05     In financial terms the sulphur dusting program is not attractive
to the farmer, based on the 1988/89 farm gate price of TSh 40/kg of cashew
nuts and an estimated financial cost of TSh 258/tree per year, at the
present recommended rate of application. Assuming a reasonable IRR of 82,
farmgate nut prices should be about TSh 63/kg or 60-652 of the FOB Mtwara
price (AnnexII on Farm Models). However, in economic terms the benefits to
the country are large. The economic rate of return of the proposed level
of sulphur imports of about 300 tons/year is 482. The difference in the
returns to the individual farmer and to the economy are accounted for
primarily by the difference between the farm gate price and the export
parity price (paras 2.16 and 2.17), and to the additional costs of
financing now borne by the farmer and the sulphur distributors.
7.06     Sensitivity analyses to both variations in the international price
of the products, and in the yields, show that the returns do not fall below
acceptable levels, even at the extreme of a 502 decline in either price or
yields (Annex II). This indicates that the economies of the cashew and
coconut tree crops sectors permit these development programs to support a
high degree of risk in terms of the agronomic outcome of the research.



- 52 -
B.  Risks
7.07     The risks would be organizational and technological difficulties,
inadequate funding, and lower than expected adoption rates of impioved
cashew and coconut prcduction packages. To avoid problems on the first
count, the project is implemented as two separate components of which the
coconut component is already in existence and serves as a successful model
for the management of the cashew improvement program. The Project is also
supported by IDA, ODA and GTZ financed multi-disciplinary technical
assistance teams, which would help Tanzanian staff to carry out the
specific research targets of breeding and selection of tolerant planting
materials and to provide intensive professional and management training.
The assistance would continue long enough to help: (a) install improved
management systems, including financial control, accounting and management
information system, planning and recording systems, and (b) train local
staff to maintain and improve these systems, as necessary. On the second
count, assurances were obtained at negotiations that funds for cashew and
coconut development now provided by GOT would be increased as needed in
order to fully integrate all cashew and coconut tree crop specific research
and extension activities under GOT's regular research and extension budget
by the end of the project after six years (para 8.02i). On the third
count, the Project would benefit from the implementation of the IDA
financed research and extension rehabilitation projects, which would
greatly improve the general research and extension services. The
technological packages derived from the cashew and coconut specific
research programs would then be extended through an upgraded extension
ser"ice. In the meantime, the training of cashew and coconut subject
matter specialists would continue.
7.08     Some operational risks exist.  Civil work construction tends to
progress slowly as a result of delays in selecting contractors and/or
procurement of materials as well as poor supervision. Therefore, the
Cashew and Coconut Management Units would be adequately staffed, including
technical services personnel and would be able to obtain short term
specialist support to overcome the above mentioned problems, while special
efforts would be made during project supervision to assist in problem
solving.
C. Recurrent Costs and Sustainability
7.09     Both the cashew and coconut research and extension staff working
under the Project belong to the regular research and extension
organizations of MALD and would be redep.oyed after Project completion.
The emphasis on research and development in the project would provide major
institution building benefits and it is also envisaged that by increasing
the nut production capacity, the cashew and the coconut processing
industries and the private sector would play a greater role in the
rehabilitation of the cashew and coconut industry, including the
establishment of private seedfarms and joint ventures with foreign
investors. As for the recurrent costs the m;idterm review will examine the
feasibility of establishing a Treecrops Development institute or Authority
at the end of the Project to guarantee the availability of cashew, coconut
and other cormnercial treecrops know-how and improved planting material



- 53 -
sources. A small Treecrops Unit in MALD would then have regulatory
functions only, while through contributions from the private sector and/or
a cess on all export crops etc. the Treecrops Development Institute would
operate as an autonomous body responsible for all research and development
of treecrops in Tanzania. The amalgamation of the two cashew and coconut
core management units could be the first step to the establishment of such
an Institute (paras 4.47 and 5.11).
D. Environmental Effects
7.10     Technological packages to be extended under the project would be
based on agricultural practices which safeguard the delicate balance of
agro-ecosystems through sound integrated pest management practices,
including biological control of major pests and diseases and the use of
tolerant planting materials. These practices would only be carried out on
existing upland farms, leaving wet lands intact. In addition, the decision
to base the technical packages on treecrop-based production systems
including intercropping of annual crops on a rotational base would ensure
optimum soil productivity and improved conservation because of the foliage
cover provided by the cashew and coconut trees. The inclusion of fruit
trees in coconut farms to harbour the beneficial maji-moto ant colonies as
a biological control method of the coreid bug is an example of one of the
biological methods being applied. As for the short term cashew sulphur
dusting program the project recommends limited use of low rates for 3-4
years only and to be applied in contiguous blocks to increase its effect on
controlling the powdery mildew. This pL-.gram would be phased out once
sufficient disease tolerant planting materials have become available. The
cashew pest control research program at Naliendele is responsible for
finding better alternatives to sulphur, and to monitor the impact of long-
term sulphur use on the environment, in particular on the soil and on
cashew pollinators. Moreover, only Plemental sulphur is used, which is
known to be a safe pesticide with negligible toxicity to man and wild life,
while small quantities are required for plant and animal nutrition. In the
meantime, the breeding program will produce and multiply alternative
disease tolerant cashew planting materials which would not need any
spraying.
E. Focus on Women
7.11     Most women in the project area are farmers and contribute high
labor input in cultivation of cashew and coconut. In both the cashew and
coconut industries, they play vital roles in production, processing and
marketing. They almost entirely collect and process cashewnuts, and
prepare the copra oil. The project would directly benefit and enhance
opportunities for women by:  (a) providing a substantial amount of
resources on extension services to women farmers and recruiting women
extension staff; (b) using the marketing advisor provided under the project
to identify and train women entrepreneurs as potential traders; (c)
identifying and eliminating legal and institutional constraints that
inhibit women traders from having access to trading credit; and (d)
improving conditions and incentives for more women to engage in cashewnut
processing including home processing of assorted cashewnut by-products such



- 54 -
as cashew apples. The Project would also support regular workshops which
would train women to take advantage of various opportunities available to
them in coconut and cashewnut industries. The monitoring and evaluation
unit of the project would, among other things, devote its efforts to
identifying special constraints that may prevent women from taking full
advantage of Project benefits, for quick management action.

TANZANIA TREECROPS PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISk.. REPORT
PROJECT FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
FARM MODELS
Introduction
The investment feasibility of the Cashew and Coconut Development Programs
is tested through the financial and economic analysis of typical farmers'
investments at the field level. The farm models represent the productive
benefits from GOT's investments in research, extension, and infrastructure
through this project and the overall governmental development activities.
Because of the risks and uncertainty involved with this research dependent
project (see section of Project Risks), the cost/benefit analysis of the
project is presented on the basis of farm models. These models serve as
examples (of samples) of the possible range of activities and benefits that
would accrue to the country if the research is successful, and if the
agronomic practices developed therefrom are widely adopted by the farmers.
Because of these risks and uncertainties, no estimate can be made of the
full extent of the agronomic success of the research, and thus the level of
benefits, nor of the subsequent level of uptake of the agronomic
recommendations. For this reason no aggregated or nation-wide stream of
benefits can be assessed.
The investment by GOT in this development program is represented in the
farm models by the price (both financial and economic) charged for planting
material. These prices have been developed from an analysis of GOT's
direct investment in planting material supply and distribution facilities
(see Section on Planting Materials Supply). It is usual in agricultural
development projects that the project cost/benefit analysis is not
"charged' with such development expenses as research facilities investments
and operating expenses, the costs of the extension services, nor the
Ministry of Agriculture's general program administration and facilities
investments. Therefore this "cost recovery transfer price" for planting
material is an adequate representation of the aggregate project investment
costs that would be considered in a more usual project aggregated
cost/benefit analysis. The consequent individual farm model rates of
return represent the range of returns possible to the economy from GOT's
productive investment in this project.
The farm models are developed with, respectively, financial and economic
cost recovery prices for planting materials for:
-    financial returns, using constant 1988 farmgate prices for other
inputs and produce outputs, and
-    economic returns, using the farmgate equivalent economic prices
and costs, and with an economic price for farm family labor.
(The farm models are provided in Annex II and III of the Project File.

Section A: Cashew Development Program
Two basic farm models represent the expected cashew development activities:
-    newplantings of cashews with intercropping until the canopy
cover prevents further cultivation; and
-    replanting of old cashew, through removal of about 602 of the
existing trees, replacement plantings with cashews, and
intercropping until the canopy cover prevents further
cultivation, and further old tree removal with replacement
plantings.
Two subsidiary models are examined, relating only to the type of planting
material i.e. grafted seedlings (applicable only in the first 2 to 3 years
of the project) -- the "seedling" models, and seed plantings (applicable to
all planting after year 3) -- the "seed" models.
The fdrm models include farm activities in annual crop intercropping.
However, because these activities are confined to the early part of the
investment cycle on each farm, they distort the discounted cash flow
evaluation of the cashew investments. Therefore for the purposes of
assessing the benefits of GOT's investments in Cashew facilities, the
beneficial impact of the intercropping has been removed, and the impact
only of on-farm investment in cashews, and the consequent cashew incomes
and operating expenses, have been examined.
Farmgate Pricing of Cashew
Table 1 shows the current farmgate pricing structure for Cashew. The
Mission's marketing report refers to areas of cost inefficiencies in the
marketing chain, and thus Table 1 also shows the mission's assessment of an
"efficient" farmgate price. Depending on GOT policy to recover from the
farmers the capital investment of the cashew processing factories, the TCMB
margin could justifiably vary considerable from the minimum "efficiency"
case shown in this table. An alternative price is shown in the footnote
reflecting partial cost recovery of these investments. However, the
current farmgate price -- T.Sh.401kg -- has been used in the financial
models to reflect conservativness.
The economic farmgate equivalent is obtained by applying a set of SCF's to
the efficiency financial. costs. These economic farm models use an economic
price of T.Sh.100/kg., (see footnote to Table 1), testing for the mission-
assessed higher efficiency price of T.Sh.112/kg. through the sensitivity
analysis.

Financial Returns
Key assumptions: Aside from the farmgate price for cashews, discussed
above, the sensitivity test examines the impact on returns and net income
of an increase in the farm gate price at a level closer of the mission's
assessment of "efficiency" farmgate price. All other produce prices, and
input costs are based on current market prices.

Discounting for net present value (NPV) purposes is taken at a notional
indicator rate -- a real interest rate for return on investment capital of
152 p.a.
Results: Tables 2 & 3 following summarize the financial returns from the
four farm models. While the financial rates of return favor replanting
over new planting (when considering only the benefits and costs of the
cashew development), this does not take into consideration the extent of
the family labor involved.
New planting provides a higher income NPV, due primarily to the effect of
the full stand of 64 trees coming into production early. By comparison,
increasing cashew incomes is phased over the entire period, because of the
second and consequent replacement planting phases that commence only from
the fifth year (with income only from the eighth year). Here too the
extent of family labor is not reflected in the net present value of the
income stream.
The second portion of Table 2 therefore considered thie required family
labor as an investment, and the average return to a manday of labor is the
rate of return equivalent to a manday of invested labor. While returns tc
labor are well above the financial minimum wage of 60 T.Sh. daily for
cashew crops, intercropping falls below the minimum wage rate. On the
basis of analysis of the return to mandays of labor, the newplantings are
clearly more favorable than replanting (due primarily to the high labor
investment required in removal of old trees).
Also of significance is the comparatively poor return to labor of food
intercropping. This serves to indicate that while the agronomic
recommendation for intercropping will b- extended, if additional new land
is available, farmers may (rationally) prefer to expend their limited labor
on new plantings, and not intercrop. This will be modified by the
avail3bility of cash or food income from other sources of land or from
employment, at daily rates above the "intercropping wage rate", with which
to purchase foods.   If land or cash income is not available, then food
intercropping may take place, if insufficient food is not being produced on
the traditional food-lot close to family dwelling.

Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity analysis shows the positive impact
of any improvement in the farmgate price of cashews either as a result of
increasing efficiency of the internal marketing system, or as a consequence
of changing international cashew prices. Note that the +502 price increase
represents a T.Sh.60/kg farmgate price at current market prices. This is
the price level that the mission considers reasonable for the farmers to
receive today if the marketing system were operating competitively and
efficiently.
The sensitivity analysis, while presented in terms of cashew prices, would
be equivalent of the +50Z to -35Z variation in yield assumptions, and
therefore also for the same variation in volumes of production.
The replanting model is relatively more sensitive to the down-side decline
than the new planting model. However all IRR's are well over the minimum
acceptable real financial return on capital investment, set at an indicator
level of 15Z p.a.
Table 3 shows the sensitivity to the returns per manday of family labor.
Even at the low end of the cashew price range (or cashew yields), daily
returns are well above the minimum financial daily wage rate for new

plantings, and therefore well above the earnings rate of annual food
cropping (see Table 2). However, for replanting, at the low end of the
price or yield range, cashew becomes only a marginally better alternative
than food cropping on this same land (see Table 2).

Clearly from this sample approach based on the investigation of individual
farm models, the investment in cashew development is financially
worthwhile. The sensitivity to cashew farmgate price changes, or yields,
of the returns to investment and of returns to farm family labor both fall
within acceptable ranges. (Tables 3 & 4: see Charts 1 & 2).

Economic Returns
Key Price Assumotions:  The Standard Conversion factor (SCF) for all
foreign exchange has been assumed at 1.35. All local costs have been
assumed to have a SCF of 1.00, while the transport element has been
converted at a SCF of 1.35. The SCF's have been applied to the foreign
exchange and local cost components of all major cost and revenue items in
the conversion from financial to economic costs. The *efficient" economic
price of cashew nuts has been discussed above.
Results: Tables 5 summarizes the ecoromic rate for return for the four
farm models cashew income and costs only, assuming an economic cost of farm
family labor of the financial minimum wage. Any shadow pricing of this
wage at less than this minimum level increases the economic returns very
favorably (see economic farm models in attachment for details). Costs and
benefits from intercropping has been excluded, even though this provides
net benefits to the economy, in order to measure only the net benefits to
the economy from the Cashew investment program. The ERR of the base case,
i.e. an economic price of T.Sh.100/kg. (lower than the mission's assessed
efficiency price of T.Sh.112/kg) shows high returns to the economy,
providing compensation for the development risks involved, and the
development expenses not considered in the rate of return calculation.
Sensitivity Analysis: The rate of return is analyzed for a +35Z to -35Z
variation range for economic farmgate prices. The results for a similar
variation range for cashew yields would be the same.   The results show the
returns to be sufficiently robust to variations in these key parameters to
add a further level of confidence to this investment, excluding
considerations for the risk of research not providing the required
agronomic solutions. However, a 35Z decline in the expected yield (i.e.
for 10kg/tree to 6.5k3/tree) shows rates of return sufficiently above the
minimum acceptable investment level. This indicates that investment would
be worthwhile in cashews with even just partial agronomic success from the
research program, in terms of the productivity of the new planting
material.

ashew Rehabilitation -- The Returns to Sulphur Dusting
.side from replanting and new plantings of cashews, the program will
;upport rehabilitation of existing cashew stands, currently infected with
)owdery mildew, through sulphur dusting on a limited area for only four
fear on each stand. The project will import about 300 m.t. tons of sulphur
a year for treatment on both the replanted areas and for the rehabilitation
area. The rehabilitation area will be about 2000 ha. annually.
The Annex on Sulphur dusting provides the calculation for fully recovering
the financial and economic cost of delivering sulphur and a sulphur dusting
service to the farmer. For the financial and economic analysis it is
assumed that the full costs of the services will be recovered from the
farmer (i.e. that the sulphur dusting program will not be provided to the
farmers at a subsidized rate).
On a per tree basis the costs are as following:
financial cost       T.Sh. 258/tree per year
economic cost        T.Sh. 233/tree per year.
The lower economic cost is the net effect of higher economic costs of
imports (SCF=1.35, adjusted for local cost inputs at SCF=l), and a SCF=0
for financial charges in the system.
An individual dusting program limited to four year requires an annual
expenditure of about T.Sh.20,600 annually for total cost of T.Sh.82,500.
The financial returns per hectare to the farmer are shown in Table 6.

Therefore at the current farmgate price of T.Sh.40/kg for raw cashew nuts
the farmer will nor recover the costs of dusting an average tree stand of
80 trees per ha. For the farmer to be able to borrow for sulphur dusting
(2 23Z interest p.a.) and to just break even over the four year period will
require a farmgate price of T.Sh.75/kg (or 75Z of the current FOB Mtwara
price)l If he is self-financing, and can therefore expect to have a return
-- in real terms -- of over 82 p.a., farmgate prices will have to increase
to over T.Sh.63/kg.
However, in economic terms, the benefits to the country are large. The
economic rate of return of the proposed level of sulphur imports is 48Z.
(Table 7 provides the details.) The difference in the returns to the
individual farmer and to the economy are accounted for primarily by the
farmgate? price not being equivalent to export parity, and to the additional
costs of finance that the farmer and the sulphur distributors must bear.

B: The Coconut Development Program
rwo cultivar types are represents, in the farm models, Hybrids, and East
Africa Talls (EAT's). EAT's will be new planted and existing stands of
EAT's will be rehabilitated, with interplantings of either EAT's or
Hybrids.
Three basic farm models represent the expected coconut development
activities:
-    rehabilitation of existing EAT's with undergrowth clearing,
planting fruit trees as the host for the maiimoto ant (i.e for
biological control of coconut pests), and some intercropping
with and without fertilizers.
-    newplantings of coconut with intercropping (with and without
fertilizers) until the canopy cover prevents further
cultivation; and
-    replanting of old coconut, through removal of about 60Z of the
existing trees, replacement plantings with either EAT's or
Hybrids, and intercropping until the canopy cover prevents
further cultivation, with further old tree removal with
replacement plantings.
These models are provided in an Attachment.
Pricing of coconut
The marketing annex has presented the survey of current coconut prices and
the comparison of these prices with vegetable oil equivalents. Tab' 8
presents the import parity price calculation in both financial and economic
terms for coconut, based on projected international prices (Table 9).
It should be noted that the current market price of about T.Sh.15/nut is
just over 80Z of the economic import parity price, but is about 2302 of the
financial import parity price. This disparity reflects the current
scarcity of coconut in the local market, and the consumers' preference for
fresh nut consumption, and for home produced coconut oil over imported
substitute vegetable oils. Further, the absence of any significant
quantities of coconut for copra processing has all but caused the
processors to cease operating. Therefore there is no effective price
competition on the local market that uses the international copra price as
a benchmark. Locally processed coconut oil receives a price well in excess
of the import parity price for coconut oil, or the import parity price
equivalent for coconut oil locally produced from import copra.

lew seedlings are priced in the financial farm models at current market
:ates (about T.Sh.100 per seedling). This price is sufficient to provide a
zost recovery payment for seednuts to GOT seed farms (provided these farms
are operating at full capacity and selling all their production as seednuts
-- see Annex on planting materials). All other inputs are prices at
current market rates, and coconut produce marketed is priced at the current

Results:  The high returns to mandays of labor on rehabilitation reflects
the response o' the palms to decreased weed competition for nutrients, and
to the impact of biological control of pests and (through the majimoto ant)
on production. The response to fertilizer is also significant.
By contrast, comparative benefits for replanting old ETA's with new ETA's
gives very low returns to mandays required where no intercropping and thus
no fertilizer is applied.   Farmers may be prepared to adopt this strategy,
but the program's extension would serve the economy well to discourage such
an on-farm strategy, when additional effort with intercropping provides
such large marginal returns (i.e. an increase to T.Sh.lll/manday on

oconuts alone, and an additional average manday income of T.Sh.llO for the
ntercrop produce.)
'he financial results for replanting with hybrids instead of EAT's
Lillustrates significantly improved returns from the hybrids, due to earlier
3earing of the hybrids, denser planting and their overall higher per tree
yield. This result also depends on the mission's assumption that the
hybrids will be able to maintain steady yield levels in those areas of
Tanzania's environment that are not susceptible to drought. There is a
chance that the hybrids might show a higher annual variability of yield (in
a lagged response to past unfavorable climatic conditions) therefore giving
the hybrid returns more "uncertainty' than the long proven EAT's. Similarly
the newplantings with hybrids show significantly more favorable returns
than ETA newplantings.
For new planting the impact of fertilizers provides significant marginal
returns, as does the contribution of the intercrop to the net benefit
stream. However, unlike the EAT replanting case, even if intercropping
were not undertaken and no fertilizer therefore applied, the returns would
be sufficiently favorable to pursue this low input option.
A comparison (Table 11, Charts 5 & 6, below) of the sensitivity of these
returns to yield variations shows that even if the hybrids were
significantly more variable in their yields that EAT's the NPV's and other
financial indicators are consistently more favorable than for EAT's. For
example, where the hybrid yield drops to 50Z of the expected mature value
(i.e. to about 35 nuts/tree on average in the with fertilizer case) the
returns are about equivalent to replanted EAT's where the yield had only
dropped by just 5Z (i.e. to an average of about 38 nuts/tree). This
reflects higher density of planting of hybrids, and their earlier bearing.
A similar favorable comparison is evident from the sensitivity test of tht
new plantings. This 'robustness' and the wide latitude provided in the
yields for the hybrids serves to indicate the expected level of benefits
from the intrcduction of hybrids (into climatically suitable zones) is
worth the risks related to research and seed propagation investments.

rhe farm models were reassessed on the basis of economic pricing of inputs
and produce. Coconut sales were valued at the import parity price, and
farm family labor at the financial minimum wage. All other inputs were
valued at their financial market rate except for fertilizers to which the
froeign exchange SCF (1.35) was applied. The economic value of a seedling
at the nursery gate (or farmgate) was increased by an amount to reflect the
the economic ccst of seednut delivered from the project to the nursery.
This resulkts in a net SCF of 1.04 for the seedling.

xcept for the replanting of ETA's without fertilizer and no intercropping,
11 the other alternatives provide adequate to excellent ERR's. However,
*eplanting with ETA's and applying fertilizers to an intercrop falls on the
iargin of acceptable economic returns, if the value of the intercrop is not
:aken into account. In this case the intercrop's value provides
significant marginal benefits, supporting the argument previously made that
the coconut program's extension must stress intercropping and the use of
fertilizers on intercrops to provide the economy with an adequate return on
replanting of ETA's with selected ETA's -- expected to be the highest
volume of the coconut development activity under the program.
The comparison of Hybrid and ETA's economic return sensitivity to
variations in yield provides the same conclusion as did the financial
results. The higher density of hybrid planting, higher individual palm
yields, and early bearing, all compensate for some of the risk of high
levels of variability in Hybrid yields (see Table 13, Charts 7 & 8, below),
therefore justifying the investment in research and seedfa-ms.

CASHEW DEVELOPMF   PROGRAM
Sulphur Dusting Program - Cost assessment
The attached tables analyze the cost for imports of sulphur and sulphur
dusting equipment in terms of the cost per tree serviced. The economic
cost of this program, are also assessed.
To fully recover costs of all materials, depreciation of the equipment
(sulphur dusting equipment has been assessed to require replacement after 2
years!), and the financing charges for holding sulphur dust inventory and
machinery inventory, the farmer need to be charged T.Sh.258 per tree dusted
with 1.75kg of sulphur.
The issue is one of viability and cost recovery. Table 5 shows that at
T.Sh.40.kg of cashew the farmer does not recover his sulphur dusting costs.
However if the farm gate price is increased in real terms to T.Sh.60/kg
then sulphur dusting becomes a breakeven proposition. Any futher increase
in the farmgate price would provide the farmer with significant returns to
his sulphur expenditures. (See Table below)
Currently there is an expectation in Tanzania that sulphur dusting services
can be delivered to the farmer at about T.Sh.150/tree. This would involve
a subsidy, or that the cooperatives become involved to offer the service
"at cost." This would prevent the involvement of the private sector.
However, analysis of the actual costs of delivery do not indicate that at a
"breakeven" pricing the cooperatives could offer the service at prices more
than 10X to 15Z lower than the assessed T.Sh.258/tree. At these
"breakeven' sulphur dusting prices the farmer's minimum fargate price for
cashew would have to between 50 and 53 T.Sh./kg.
However for reasonable returns to the farmer for sulphur dusting a minimum
IRR of 82 to 1OZ should be expected, giving a farmgate price of about
T.Sh.63 to 65 per kg. (See Table below) Unless the dusting pricing issue
and the mechanism for the delivery of this service is satisfactorily
settled there may be little justification in supporting the import of the
dust and the blowers. Certainly if the service is expected to be offered
at about T.Sh.150/tree any private sector operator who has taken credit to
become involved in this effort will be unable to cover his costs or repay
his debts.

CASHEW AND COCONUT TREE CROPS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Planting Material Supplies
The attached tables analyses the costs of the development, investment and
operations of planting material propagation units for ca3hews and coconuts.
These cost/budget tables are utilized to derive unit transfer prices for
planting material assuming a reasonable return on investment of 15X.  This
approach has been adopted for both the financial and economic evaluation of
the planting material.
For Cashews, prices of grafted seedlings (which will be provided for the
first 3 years of the project only) and seeds have been derived. The
financial prices of these are:
seedlings             T.SH. 77.50 each
seed                  T.SH.  3.85 each, and with 3 seeds used for
each planting per expected tree, the tree
equivalent would be T.SH. 11.55
The market price for seed, normally sold for export is equivalent to about
T.Sh.0.20/nut. Therefore both the seedling and the seed will have to be
sold at prices considerably above 'market expectations' if the organization
is not to be subsidized.
For coconuts, the large investment in the Mafia and Zanzibar seed farms has
not been taken into account in determining a 'cost recovery' price.
However, additional investments and future operating expenses have been
fully included. Because of the large overcapacity of these two seed
production facilities and the expected initial low demand for hybrids,
pricing at the level of actual sale (the 'minimum' case tables) gives
prices for hybrids in excess of T.Sh.244 each from Zanzibar and about
T.Sh.100 from Mafia. Given that current prices for a seedling is about
T..Sh.100 each, these process cannot be charged to the farmer.
Evaluating the coconut seedfarms on the basis of the sale of all their
output as seednuts (the 'minimum' case dates), gives a seednut price of
about T.Sh.40 each. This price (and its economic pricing equivalent) have
been used in the farm models. However, using this price in reality implies
a very large subsidy for the seed farms.
Nevertheless, the farmer should not beAr the cost of a large over-capacity
operation that is being maintained for national strategy reasons to provide
for a buffer against natural disasters, disease outbreaks, etc. Therefore
some level of subsidy would be justified for the coconut hybrid seed
production facilities.

TANZANIA CASHEW AND COCONUT TREECROPS PROJECT
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CASHEW IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
1.   Coordinators Office  The Cashew Improvement Program (CIP) is headed
by a Coordinator.  He will report directly to the P. S. Agriculture.  His
office will be the focal point for the planning and management of the
country's efforts for the initial rehabilitation and expansion of the
cashew economy. To this end it will have the responsibility to:
a) develop the capacity and capability for economic strategy and
planning for cashew;
b) plan the cashew economy;
c) advise Government on cashew-relaced policies;
d) liaise with domestic and international agencies active in
cashew development;
e) plan specific development projects;
f) implement projects.
As a result of a strong office being established, a coordinated
and well planned development effort in cashew will be possible. The
institutional capacity to sustain the growth in the cashew industry,
initiated under the proposed project, will be achieved.
2.         In the initial years of the Cashew Improvement Program (CIP),
the Coordinator's Office will have three main tasks:
a) the establishment and operation of the Cashew Planning and
Economic Unit;
b) management of CIP implementation; and
c) advisory services to the Government on the cashew economy.
3.   CIP Implementation  The Coordinator will directly supervise and
manage CIP implementation in the southern and northern cashew regions and
be assisted by a deputy. The northern program will be comparatively small
and start at a later stage, while the southern CIP program has already a
broad base in Mtwara and staff prepared for the new project under the
Cashew Production Improvement Pilot Project.
The Coordinator's Office in its project implementation function,
will be responsible for:
- maintaining liaison with the Government agencies, including,
Agriculture, Research and Extension, Finance, Local
