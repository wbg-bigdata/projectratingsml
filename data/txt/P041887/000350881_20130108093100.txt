1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background. At the time of project appraisal, the path of economic
growth in Bangladesh was uncertain. As discussed in the Bangladesh Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for the period 1998-2001, it could either remain a desperately poor country or
become a nascent tiger economy, but it never managed to be either. Though better than in other
developing countries at that time, the country’s growth was too slow to have a significant impact
on poverty. Nearly 36 percent of the population remained below the poverty line for the very
poor; 53 percent below the poverty line for the poor. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB)
also was confronting severe challenges in overcoming the institutional constraints to pursuing
sound development activities. Despite a slowdown of population growth since independence
(1971), the population (70 million) was expected to rise over the next 30 years by 60 million.
The urban population had been growing at a rate of about 4.2 percent per annum. Until the early
1990s, this rapid growth was occurring mainly in the country’s four metropolitan areas (Dhaka,
Chittagong, Khulna, and Rajshahi). By the latter 1990s, smaller municipalities were experiencing
rapid growth rates as well.

Regardless of their size, all of the municipalities in Bangladesh at the time of project appraisal
were facing: (a) inadequate urban infrastructure services; (b) weak management and financial
capacity; (c) fragmentation of urban sector responsibilities among numerous central government
agencies; and (c) an increasing level of urban poverty and accompanying environmental
degradation. To respond to these issues, as highlighted in the CAS, the Bank aimed to assist the
country in improving the coverage and efficiency of basic urban services; support private sector
growth and urban poverty reduction through the formulation and implementation of appropriate
strategies for institutional and financial reforms in municipalities; and support fiscal
decentralization. In this context, the GOB with World Bank assistance designed the Bangladesh
Municipal Services Project (MSP) to address the weak institutional and financial capacities that
were undermining sustainable service delivery, and to promote sound urban management.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The World Bank’s involvement in the project was valuable for
several reasons. First, the Bank had supported the development of an urban strategy which
mapped the policy, institutional, and financial reforms necessary to underpin and sustain the
investments to be made in this sector, and thus improve municipal service delivery. Guided by
this strategy, the Bank also had experience supporting Bangladesh’s urban sector through one
urban development project, five water supply projects, and its continuing dialogue on key urban
development issues. Involvement in the MSP would offer the Bank the opportunity to lead and
shape the urban development agenda, particularly on policy reforms, and use its leverage to help
the GOB prepare and implement institutional and financial reforms likely to have maximum
impact. Lastly, the World Bank’s participation in the project would afford the Bank the
opportunity to apply its broad experience in the urban sector to help the GOB and donors
coordinate appropriate responses to the urban challenges in Bangladesh.




                                                1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original PDO was to improve environmental and infrastructure service delivery in urban
areas. Specifically, the project would: (a) strengthen the institutional capacity of selected
municipal corporations and secondary towns to plan, finance, implement, and operate urban
infrastructure services in an efficient and sustainable manner, (b) improve resource mobilization
and allocation, and fiscal discipline through the creation of an improved financing mechanism
for urban infrastructure investment; and (c) support the GOB and municipalities to reduce urban
poverty and improve environmental conditions of urban communities through the financing of
critical urban infrastructure and services. The original indicators that would be used to measure
progress in meeting these outcomes included:

(a) Number of municipalities able to plan, prioritize, and implement service improvements by
    the end of the project (Phase 1:16; Phase 2:40);
(b) Number of municipalities that completed management reform (Phase 1: 16; Phase 2: 40);
(c) Demand driven and cost recovery measures introduced for revenue generating sub-projects;
(d) Municipal Development Fund (MDF) created and operational for on-lending to
    municipalities;
(e) Municipal Performance Review Board established and operational by the end of Phase 1;
(f) Physical investments targeting poverty and environmental improvements implemented
    through community participation.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

The project was restructured three times to respond to two major floods in 2004 and 2007, and to
scale up the demand-driven MDF operations. In 2005, US$11 million was added to the project,
together with relocation of US$15 million from the BMDF component to the Flood Damage
Rehabilitation (FDR) component, in response to a major flood in September 2004. After another
severe flood in 2007, the Project was allocated an additional credit of SDR15.8 million (US$24.5
million) as part of the Bank’s Post Flood Recovery Assistance Program. In 2010, an Additional
Financing of US$42 million was approved to continue and scale up the project’s successful
program of infrastructure and capacity building support. Thus, overall, the project received
reallocations and additional funding three times for a total of US$77.5 million.

The PDO was not revised. The indicators were revised to reflect the additional financing. The
revised indicators are:

(a) Municipalities (183) able to plan, prioritize, and implement service improvements by end of
    project.
(b) Management reform in municipalities completed in 183 municipalities.
(c) Introduce demand driven and cost recovery measures; the target increased to 168
    municipalities.
(d) Streamline BMDF operations and strengthen coordination with LGED and other relevant
    agencies. This indicator was introduced under the AF of 2010 to replace the one requiring
    “MDF operational for on-lending to municipalities? and “Municipal Performance Review

                                               2
    Board established and operational? because these latter two targets had been achieved during
    the original investment.
(e) Add 150 more works packages targeting poverty and environmental improvements through
    community participation funded by BMDF. This indicator was introduced in the AF or 2010.
    At that time, 454 works packages had been completed with BMDF funding; the new target
    became 595 works packages.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

As described in the PAD, the main direct beneficiaries of the project would be: (a) the residents
of participating municipalities who would receive improved infrastructure services; and (b) staff
at both national and local levels, who would benefit from capacity building. The PAD also notes
that long-term project sustainability through community participation in the operation and
maintenance (O&M) of urban infrastructure would be achieved through the adoption of the
Participatory and Partnership Approach (PPA). This approach would encourage greater
involvement of women in planning and managing activities that would directly contribute to
improving their living conditions.

The entire municipal population, including the poor and women, would benefit from the
improved coverage of services as well as upgrades of the existing municipal infrastructure. The
PAD also notes that any improvements in service coverage and quality would have a
disproportionately positive impact on lower income groups because they were least likely to
have these services at the time of project preparation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The original project had seven components divided into two phases. The first phase included
civil works, equipment, and technical assistance (TA) to be implemented through the Local
Government Engineering Department (LGED). Physical investments would be financed
according to the traditional method of selecting investments for specific municipalities meeting
IDA requirements. The second phase would support a MDF that would finance civil works,
equipment, goods, and TA.

First Phase

Component 1 – Civil Works (US$35.8 million). This would include the following:

(a) Water Supply - rehabilitation of existing systems and equipment for O&M in 2 municipalities
as well as urgent works (e.g., rehabilitation of hydrants, valve chambers, and overhead tanks).
Khulna, which had the most severe water supply problems, would receive rehabilitation of 12 km
of the distribution system (the largest amount).

(b) Sanitation - construction of 47 public toilets (latrines and washing facilities for men and
women) in 15 municipalities, and a pilot small-bore sewerage program in Khulna. Communities
and/or the private sector would be involved in O&M of public toilets as well as the pilot
sewerage in Khulna through the PPA.

                                               3
(c) Roads and Drainage - upgrading and rehabilitation of existing road and drainage networks
and systems. The road improvements would include renovation of deteriorated roads; conversion
of earthen, gravel, or brick roads to bitumen roads; road widening; bridge renewal; and
construction of footpaths and culverts. Drainage improvements would include drain
reconstruction and conversion of earthen drains to brick-walled drains. This first phase would
include about 220 km road improvements and about 37 km of drainage improvements. A PPA
would be used in drain cleaning, and in carrying out a public awareness campaign about the need
to keep drains clear from solid waste.

(d) Bus and Truck Terminals- construction and rehabilitation of bus and truck terminals in all
participating city corporations and municipalities.

(e) Slum Improvement - pilots in Khulna and about five other municipalities. Physical
investments would include improved water supply, on-site sanitation, footpaths, and street
lighting. Slum communities would be organized with NGOs' assistance so they could identify
their own needs and priority investments programs. Communities would be actively involved in
planning, implementation, and O&M.

(f) Solid Waste Management - equipment for primary collection. A PPA would be used in
selecting sites for communal bins. Existing disposal sites would be improved in Khulna and
Rajshahi from open to controlled dumping. Municipalities without formal disposal sites would
receive technical assistance for identifying a suitable disposal site.

(g) Markets - upgrading and/or rehabilitation of 16 existing municipal markets in the
municipalities participating in this phase.

(h) Land Acquisition – to implement the bus/truck terminal and sanitation components.

Component 2 – Equipment (US$3.9 million). This component includes (a) solid waste
equipment to improve primary collection, including waste transport vehicles (tipping trucks and
trailers) in Khulnaand Rajshahi; and (b) motor vehicles and computers for personnel located in
the field, and computer equipment and consumables for support personnel at each pourashava.

Component 3 – Technical Assistance (US$ 7.9 million). This would include:

Institutional Development – most of the TA would aim at (i) strengthening and institutionalizing
the Pourashava Support Unit of LGED into a Municipal Support Unit (MSU) to support city
corporations and pourashavas; and (ii) creating a municipality performance monitoring unit
within the MSU to develop a municipality information data base and related applications systems.
The MSU would consist of: (a) a Central Support Unit located at LGED; (b) a City Corporation
Unit, located at the City Corporations; and (c) field advisors assigned to groups of 3 pourashavas.
In addition, a central Monitoring Unit would be set up, and consultants would be recruited for the
Central and City Corporation Support Units as well as for the Monitoring Unit to design and set
up systems and procedures and train MSU personnel.



                                                4
Municipal Data Base - TA would be provided to create and implement a municipal information
data base and related applications systems. The project also would finance the development of
the database/systems and related training and implementation.

Community Development and Participation - TA would be provided for (i) hiring NGOs to
develop a community participation program; (ii) conducting a workshop; and (iii) conducting a
micro-credit study. The project also would finance consultants in community participation
consultants to work with the MSU at various levels.

Municipal Development Fund - TA for establishing the Municipal Development Fund (MDF)
involving (i) preparation of the structure and incorporating the MDF as a legal entity; (ii)
establishing the management structure of the MDF, including defining the initial organization
structure, writing job descriptions, and assisting in recruiting suitable individuals to man key
positions; and (iii) drafting policies and procedures both for operational areas and for financial
management and accounting. Completion of all TA activities would be considered triggers for
the implementation of Phase II.

Studies – Phase I studies included: (i) Environmental Management Action Plans in Khulna and
Rajshahi for sanitation and solid waste management, and (ii) a hydrogeological investigation for
Khulna.

Project Implementation - TA for project management unit for design and construction
supervision for two years initially, to be extended as needed during the second phase.

Training - provided to MSU, LGED, and municipalities. Most training would be on-the-job in
accounting, planning, and management.

Project Staffing and Incremental O&M - additional staff for MSU and MDF as well as
incremental O&M costs for project assets and MSU operating costs.

Component 4 - Special Consideration (US$7.6 million). Also referred to as the Chittagong
Hill Tracts, Component 4 would finance physical investments in three municipalities (Rangamati,
Bandarban, and Khagrachari) which had lagged behind other municipalities in service provision
and urban development.

Component 5 - Flood Damage Rehabilitation (US$16.2 million). This component would
finance rehabilitation of municipalities affected by the 1998 floods. The rehabilitation work
would be determined upon completion of a needs assessment.

Second Phase

Component 6 - Municipal Development Fund (US$78.0 million). A Municipal Development
Fund (MDF) would be established at the beginning of Phase II to start operating at the beginning
of the third year of project execution. The Fund would finance municipal subprojects consisting
of civil works, equipment, goods, and technical assistance. It would be established as an



                                                5
autonomous agency, with resources provided through a US$70 million line of credit from IDA
and GOB contributions.

Component 7 – Technical Assistance (US$4.6 million). This includes (a) support to the MDF
specialists in sub-project appraisal, including technical review of proposals for compliance with
environmental, social, economic, and financial feasibility; (b) technical support to municipalities
to help them prepare sub-project proposals and FOAPs to make them eligible for MDF
financing; and (c) incremental O&M costs for the MDF and MSU during the first three years.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Although the components did not change, there were changes in funding and the project schedule
(see table below). As a result of severe flooding in 2004, and in view of LGED’s demonstrated
success in implementing the first phase of investment, US$15 million of the original credit was
reallocated from the BMDF component, along with US$11 million from another project, to the
Flood Damage Rehabilitation component to be used to restore critical communication and
transportation networks in the affected municipalities. At that time, the original closing date of
June 30, 2005 was extended to June 30, 2008. After another severe flood in 2007 and in
recognition of the good implementation performance under the original project, an AF of SDR
15.8 million (US$25 million equivalent) was approved in 2008 to help rehabilitate damaged
urban infrastructure as part of the Emergency 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance
Program. The funds were allocated to the MSP to be used to rehabilitate urban roads, bridges,
culverts, and drainage channels in flood-affected municipalities. Also at that time, the credit
closing date was extended from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2011 because activities were to be
scaled up and targets enhanced.

In 2010, there was another AF of SDR 27.8 million (US$42 million equivalent) to scale up
BMDF-financed improvements in urban infrastructure as well as to continue the municipal
financial and management capacity building under LGED. This new credit extended financing
for urban infrastructure improvements to an additional 170 towns and extended the municipal
capacity strengthening program to about 142 out of the 315 urban ULBs in the country. The AF
also tightened fiduciary controls and supported the development of a program of improvement in
urban infrastructure and institutional development over the medium term that would become the
basis of projects to be funded by the Bank or other agencies. In addition, the BMDF would
provide follow-up financing to 16 municipalities that made particularly good use of the first
financing and could carry out further investments, and MSU would continue its trouble shooting
for the 133 municipalities that had received support for capacity building. The AF also resulted
in another extension of the closing date to June 30, 2012.

Phase II-MDF in 2004 to the FDR component.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

QAG rating – Highly Satisfactory

QAG provided the highly satisfactory rating on QAE on the basis of the following main points.
First, the team made a serious effort to analyze the difficult institutional issues and came up with
the means for addressing them. QAG also noted that the project had benefited from an earlier
decision to delay project preparation in order to undertake urban sector work that provided the
core of the analysis and the proposed solutions as well as the time to build up support within the
country. QAG further acknowledged the serious effort made by the team to incorporate social
development issues in a sensitive, focused way that would help navigate the institutional and

                                                     7
bureaucratic difficulties, clear team commitment and support in LGED, and an understanding of
the risks taken and the appropriateness of the measures contained in the project to address them.
The ICR agrees with the points raised by QAG, but not the rating. The following are additional
factors that would support a satisfactory rating.

The design was appropriate to meet the project’s objectives. The project’s development
objectives were clear and the components were well designed to address them. The project
would address the (i) urgent need for basic urban services, particularly in small ULBs with low-
income areas, (ii) weak local government institutions through the provision of technical
assistance to improve the institutional and financial capacity of participating municipalities; (iii)
poor local resource mobilization and cost recovery through the establishment of a municipal
development fund and capacity building; (iv) prior neglect of the O&M aspects of infrastructure
by focusing on rehabilitation, and provision of technical assistance towards maintenance
activities; and (v) need to improve sustainability of services through a participatory and
partnership approach (PPA) in the planning, implementation, and O&M of these services.

The design took into account the Bank's experience with earlier urban projects worldwide and in
Bangladesh. The team responsible for project design was aware that many of the earlier multi-
sectoral urban projects that focused on poverty alleviation through investments in basic
infrastructure and housing included poorly integrated and ill-prepared components were too
complex to be properly implemented. The design took into account the need to simplify the
design, be realistic in determining small municipalities’ financial capacities, and emphasize
strengthening of their financial and institutional frameworks to help ensure sustainability.

Prior to the MSP, the Bank’s involvement with the urban sector in Bangladesh included the
Urban Development Project (approved in FY88), which focused on slum upgrading in Dhaka
and drainage improvements in Dhaka and Chittagong, and five IDA-financed urban water supply
projects. Although physical progress on the completed projects was satisfactory, the institutional
and financial performance was not adequate and the projects confronted problems related to land
acquisition, counterpart financing, and procurement. Based on the lessons from these earlier
projects, the design emphasized the need for: (a) generating broad stakeholder commitment and
interest; (b) establishing the willingness of the municipal authorities to borrow for the
improvements before funding would be committed, and (c) directing attention to such issues as
land acquisition, sub-project design, and procurement arrangements during project preparation.

Based on the lessons from the completed projects, the design also responded to the need to: (a)
achieve sustainable institutional and policy improvements by emphasizing underlying
institutional problems rather than on achieving specific institutional and financial targets; and (b)
establish a clear link between underlying problems, project objectives, and the project
components. These issues were addressed in the project mainly through the demand-driven
approach inherent in the BMDF.

Because the introduction of the BMDF represented the first time that such a fund would be
established in Bangladesh, an important lesson learned from experience in other countries was
that the sustainability of such a funding mechanism would depend on the creditworthiness of its
borrowers, and the need for a strong commercial orientation of the fund, which would operate
without political interference. Taking into account the weak capacity of the ULBs in Bangladesh,
                                                 8
however, the design incorporated a realistic approach to assessing eligibility by requiring a
participating ULB to prepare a Financial and Operational Action Plan (FOAP), which included
an assessment of capacity and a plan for improving the ULB’s financial standing so it could
sustain an investment in urban infrastructure. The design also took into account the need to
establish the BMDF as a commercially oriented, autonomous agency that would introduce
transparency and equity into resource allocation for urban infrastructure nationwide.

Project design took into account alternative approaches, the trade-offs between them, and the
rationale for the final decisions. The three alternative approaches included: traditional urban
lending versus the MDF approach, traditional grant financing versus loan grant financing mix,
and single project versus phased approach. Unlike the traditional approach with pre-selected
municipalities and components, introducing the MDF was considered optimal because the ULBs
applied for demand driven financing (and differed from the supply driven approach) for
providing long term and sustainable infrastructure financing and capacity building. The loan-
grant financing mix was considered preferable to traditional grant financing because it had the
potential for leveraging funds for greater cost recovery.

Project design benefitted from public participation and consideration of social issues. The
project took into account the results of a social assessment, and the possibility of causing
resentment on the part of the municipalities that are lagging in reforms to receive funding that
had traditionally come from the central government. To mitigate this risk, the BMDF would be
set up as an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Finance, with financing decisions made by
a Steering Committee/Board of Directors from different spectra of society. The design also
incorporated a PPA to help ensure ownership and the social sustainability of the project. The
design could have been improved if it included funds for carrying out beneficiary assessments
during project implementation to determine the extent to which the ultimate beneficiaries were
satisfied with the project-related processes and improvements.

Notwithstanding the above, the ICR team noted QAE issues that were not adequately addressed
during the design of the investment.

The main project outcome indicators were not clearly defined. Although the main PDO
objectives were well articulated, there could have been clearer definitions of the PDO indicators
such as “municipality is able to plan, prioritize, and implement service improvements by end of
project? and “management reform was completed.? With regard to the outcome relating to
support for reducing poverty and improving environmental conditions in urban communities
through community participation, it would be difficult to establish targets for these in the PAD
when a large part of the project’s physical investments would be demand driven and determined
only after the project was under implementation.

The design underestimated the time needed to establish and operationalize the BMDF. Based on
the original design, the BMDF was expected to be established as a legal entity with a clear
ownership and management structure, registered with all concerned agencies, and ready to
administer $78.0 million of project funds after two years of project implementation. The team
greatly underestimated the amount of time it would take to obtain all the necessary approvals and
financial flow arrangements for the MDF to be registered and operational.

                                               9
The design could have included mechanisms to better coordinate local capacity building with
BMDF investments throughout the entire project period. Better planned and programmed
technical assistance could have been available throughout the project to help ensure that the
ULBs that received funding would have the necessary capacity to adequately maintain them.

2.2 Implementation

The MSP had a 12-year implementation period. The project became effective on October 25,
1999 and closed on June 30, 2012, seven years after the original closing date. The total project
financing increased by $77.5 million during the 12-year period with three reallocations and
additional funding. Several factors influenced project performance and justified the need for
multiple project extensions. The three most important factors were: (a) the implementation
competence of LGED and successful implementation of Phase I investments; (b) the delay in
establishing and operationalizing the BMDF, and its subsequent success leading to an AF in
2010; and (c) massive floods in Bangladesh during the years 2000, 2004, and 2007 which led to
additional allocations of funds in 2004 and 2008 in order to respond to the urgent need to repair
damaged infrastructure. These and other factors are discussed below.

Phase I Performance. Despite initial start up delays, the implementation of Phase 1 investments
was carried out successfully. More than 95% of the original MSP components (LGED portion)
were completed by June 30, 2005, the original closing date. Capacity building through the
Municipal Support Unit (MSU) was set up within LGED and continued throughout the life of the
project to build institutional and financial capacities in the ULBs, and to assist municipalities in
meeting the eligibility criteria for project support. The good performance under Phase 1 reflected
LGED’s strong leadership which continued throughout project implementation. The strong
performance under Phase 1 and the need to address urgent repairs caused by the floods of 2000,
2004, and 2007 also led to additional project funding, which greatly increased the number of
activities to be led by LGED. Thus some of the original target dates could not be met.

BMDF Delay and Subsequent Performance. Although the Borrower was fully supportive of the
concept of BMDF during project preparation and appraisal, the Fund was not formally registered
until 2002, and not fully operational until 2004, three years behind the original schedule. The
main reasons for the delay related primarily to: (a) the fact that the government was in transition
in 2001 when the BMDF was expected to become operational, and the transitional government
put the decision to formally register the BMDF on hold until the new government took over; and
(b) the severe floods of 2000, which diverted the attention of the project staff to finance urgent
works to repair critical transportation and communications networks. Despite the start up delays
and its difficulties in securing good quality technical staff and consistent leadership, the BMDF
ultimately became an effective instrument for allocating funds to ULBs for critically needed
infrastructure improvements. This assistance would not have been available to many ULBs,
especially the small municipalities, if they continued to depend solely on the block grants
administered from the national governments.

As a result of BMDF’s successful operation, in 2010, US$42 million was added to the project to
help finance the scaling up of improvements in urban infrastructure as well as municipal

                                                10
financial and management capacity. At that time, the project was performing well. There were
significant benefits achieved in the participating municipalities as well as a strong demand for
additional support. The AF would help to extend the financing of urban infrastructure
improvements to some 170 towns, and extend the municipal capacity strengthening program to
about 183 municipalities (out of 315 urban local bodies in Bangladesh). The AF of 2010 also
would support development of the next generation of urban improvement programs and require
tightening of fiduciary controls.

By May 2010, practices adopted under the project for municipal institutional and infrastructure
development represented significant improvements, including: (a) greater authority and
responsibility of the municipalities in selecting and implementing the investments with matching
operational and financial plans, (b) substantial self and loan financing requirements, (c)
improved project evaluation and management, (d) improved municipal management and revenue
systems, and (e) improved procurement practices.

Demand for BMDF Financing. Throughout project implementation and after closing, there has
been a continuous demand for BMDF support for infrastructure projects, and sense of ownership
on the part of the participating ULBs and project communities. By the time of project closing,
there was a backlog of over 200 project proposals seeking funding.

Floods and Related Changes in Project Financing, Activities, and Schedule. Following the
serious flood and heavy rainfall during the 2004 monsoon, a joint decision was made by the
GOB and World Bank that urgent rehabilitation works in 67 flood-affected municipalities would
be undertaken with IDA support through a credit reallocation of US$15 million from BMDF to
LGED. The project also received a reallocation of US$11 million from the Private Sector
Infrastructure Development Project (Cr. 2995-BD). Accordingly, the DCA was amended and the
credit closing date was extended to June 30, 2008. In response to another flood crisis in 2007,
through the Emergency 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program, the MSP
received additional financing of US$25 million to support rehabilitation of urban roads, bridges,
culverts, and drainage channels in municipalities damaged by the floods. This AF was allocated
to MSP on the basis of LGED’s strong performance under Phase I. Through this, LGED again
demonstrated its effectiveness in expediting the urgent works needed to address critical flood
damage in numerous municipalities. The change also meant an extension of the closing date to
June 30, 2011. Finally, the AF of 2010 (US$42 million) was allocated to the MSP to allow the
BMDF and LGED to further strengthen their investment and capacity building programs. The
AF also supported the preparation of a follow up investment.

Mid-Term Review. The MTR (2002) provided a comprehensive assessment of progress toward
development objectives and implementation performance. While the review recognized that the
overall implementation of the project’s first phase was satisfactory, it raised serious concerns that
the project encountered what was then a two year delay in establishing the BMDF. The Bank
also noted in its review that it may have been overly optimistic given the country context, the
weak institutional capacity of municipalities, and inherent governance problems to expect
completion of all first phase investments, involving over 1,000 contracts within two years. Thus,
the main recommendations of the MTR were to revise some of the project outcomes and target



                                                 11
dates to take into account the delays. Also at that time, the procurement rating dropped from
satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory due to mis-procurement affecting six contracts.

Managing Project Risks. In June 2004, the IP rating for the project was downgraded to
unsatisfactory; progress toward achieving the PDO also was made unsatisfactory because the
BMDF was still not operational. By the end of 2004, however, progress in establishing the
BMDF was underway with the initial institutional arrangements in place. It had a core team of
staff headed by a Managing Director, and had advertised its program, inviting interested ULBs to
apply. It also had appointed two sets of consultants, one group to work with ULBs in proposing
investments for BMDF financing, and a second group to manage and supervise the BMDF-
funded works. By March 2005, MDF had set up lending operations with construction work
underway in 20 ULBs with adequate engineering supervision and quality control and fiduciary
safeguards in place. In addition, the MSU and BMDF agreed on a plan to cooperate in
developing ULB capacities, and set up the means to coordinate activities and update the plan.
With these results, project performance rating was upgraded to satisfactory in April 2005, and
the Bank approved a two year extension of the closing date.

During project implementation, there were only about 15 instances of mis-procurement out of a
total of approximately 2000. In Bangladesh, where there have been severe governance issues,
this relatively small number was not considered to be significant and reflected overall acceptable
performance. It is also noted that procurement under the BMDF component was implemented by
small municipalities with weak capacities and had no prior experiences with World Bank or
other IFI-financed projects. However, two new arrangements were put in place in the AF 2010
to improve governance in procurement and prevent or mitigate associated risks. These were: (a)
implementation of a procurement risk mitigation framework that would include preparing
quarterly reports on 45 procurement performance indicators, including fraud and corruption; and
(b) hiring a full time procurement officer under BMDF with good knowledge of national and
international procurement. Before the first procurement started, BMDF would ensure that each
participating municipality had a procurement focal person with appropriate training on national
procurement. BMDF also would retain a consultant team that included at least one procurement
specialist who would participate as a member in each bid evaluation committee.

Participatory Approach. Another factor contributing to the success of project implementation
was the Participatory and Partnership Approach (PPA) developed under the project and
implemented through four Partner Organizations (POs) initially in four regions. The POs
worked with the municipalities and local NGOs to establish ownership and participation in the
delivery of the sub-projects. Municipalities later developed their own capacity for PPA under
phase two. The strong ownership for the sub-projects on the part of the mayors and the local
community involved in selecting them can be expected to be a significant factor to ensure their
sustainability. Further, LGED supported community mobilization programs in municipalities to
motivate all actors (for example, ULB personnel, local elites, community leaders, urban
dwellers) to organize and mobilize resources for improving provision of municipal services and
to have community members participate in O&M for the urban infrastructure.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The PAD included a results framework with outcome indicators that could not all be
used for measuring how the project would achieve its PDO. For example, if the PDO aims at
improving urban environmental service delivery, the results framework would need to specify at
least one indicator with specific targets for some level of environmental improvement, or this
part of the PDO should have been omitted. The results table also could have been improved if it
contained indicators relating to project sustainability. Nonetheless, almost all of the intermediate
outcome indicators were measurable and the targets were generally realistic. Due to their
efficacy, many of these indicators were retained to monitor progress under the AF or 2010. In
fact, the results framework remained essentially the same for the AF of 2010 with two outcome
indicators replaced because they had been achieved under the original credit. However, the
remaining indicators, particularly those relating to municipal reform, could have been more
clearly articulated for the AF.

Implementation. LGED set up a national urban database to incorporate ULB-related data
collected from the field through 11 specific formats encompassing infrastructure, urban facilities,
and pertinent elements of revenue collection. The MSU also prepared progress reports on the
status of implementation of the FOAPs. The monitoring system set up at the national level
produced regular reports on investments linked to disbursement and the financial management
systems in ULBs. In addition, BMDF hired consultants to report on a monthly basis the status of
sub-projects. However, the system did not provide data relating to sub-project sustainability so it
would be clear where MSU capacity building for improved cost recovery and other aspects of
municipal management could be targeted.

Utilization. The PMU, BMDF, and Bank teams used project monitoring information as the
basis of their discussions during each implementation support mission. Specifically, they used
the information to identify areas of particular challenge and to identify measures to address them.
For example, the teams observed slow procurement of several major contracts and agreed on
actions (such as hiring more procurement officers under Bank-finance) to speed up the process.
The relevant institutions maintained detailed monitoring systems to ensure that all were aware of
any diversions from the schedule early on, and could take mitigating action as soon as possible.
In addition, the regularly collected data from different ULBs on municipal tax arrears owed by
different GOB and semi-government offices were aggregated at different points in time and
transmitted to the Ministry of Finance for allocation of appropriate funds for their settlement.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. All of the project’s safeguard requirements were fully met prior to
project approval, and prior to the implementation of the phase 2 investments. During project
implementation, however, both the social and environmental consultants hired by the project
were not monitoring safeguard compliance in a consistent manner.

OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment. The performance of the implementing agencies could have
been improved with regard to OP 4.01. Although the types of investments under the project (that
is, primarily rehabilitation of existing infrastructure) normally do not have significant negative

                                                13
environmental impacts, there was inconsistent monitoring of these sub-projects. For example,
BMDF’s consultants were asked to send environmental specialists to carry out random sample of
sub-projects to ensure that they had received the Department of Environment certification.
However, the Bank’s environmental safeguard specialist noted that the consultants did not carry
out a sufficient number of field trips, and the monitoring reports did not correspond to the
planned number of field visits. Nonetheless, there were no significant negative impacts reported,
and the environmental safeguard compliance has been rated satisfactory throughout the project.

OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement. Most municipalities implemented small scale infrastructure
sub-projects development with funding through the BMDF largely on the municipalities’ own
land. According to national laws, none of the subprojects were implemented on private land.
Nonetheless, both the World Bank’s specialist in social safeguards, and BMDF’s Social
Safeguard Specialist (Consultant) visited project sites periodically to ensure that the project was
in compliance. When issues were identified, they were resolved later by BMDF.

Procurement. Overall, procurement under the project has been satisfactory. All of the
procurements under the project were subject to compliance with the World Bank Procurement
Guidelines, which were unfamiliar to the municipal authorities. Thus, at the beginning of the
project, in some cases, there were deviations leading to cancellation of bids and re-bids. The
Bank team helped the borrower overcome this issue through orientation workshops and training
on World Bank Procurement Guidelines. The BMDF also provided training to ULBs in
procurement to meet World Bank rules.

Out of approximately 2,000 procurements, there were about 15 cases of mis-procurement. In
Bangladesh, where there are severe governance issues, this relatively small number of mis-
procurements reflects overall acceptable performance. Nonetheless, the performance was further
improved with the introduction of a Procurement Risk Framework (PRF) under the AF of 2010.
The PRF, which included 45 indicators, was relevant to the Bangladesh context and was applied
throughout the project period.

Audit. From time to time, project activities were audited by the Foreign Aided Project Audit
Directorate (FAPAD) under the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG), the
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) of Bangladesh. The project was also subject to audit by private
firms. During implementation of the project, the World Bank’s appointed external audit firms
(independent of LGED) two times to carry out a technical audit along with procurement and
financial management audits on a sample basis. In all cases, the findings were satisfactory.

Financial Management. Both the LGED and BMDF met their financial management obligations.
The required audit reports were sent to the Bank; where there were any objections or issues,
these entities were fully responsive. The Bank team’s FMS did not report any major problems
since the start of project implementation.

2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Due to the success of MSP, the Borrower is planning a follow up project to be implemented in
the country’s secondary cities, and the BMDF already has a list of more than 200 proposals for

                                                14
projects that need funding. A World Bank investment, currently under preparation, will continue
supporting subprojects aimed at improving urban services for the poor and providing more
targeted institutional capacity building to address sub-project sustainability and broader
governance issues. The investment also would assist the BMDF in planning for its longer term
sustainability after the project closes.

The MSU continues to provide technical assistance to municipalities through the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) financed support for capacity building under its Urban Governance
and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP). In addition, the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government intend to implement other municipal capacity
building support through the MSU. In addition, the Municipal Performance Review Committee
(MPRC) continues to review the performance of municipalities. After the MSP closed, other
development institutions are using the MPRC for performance reviews of the municipalities
included in the projects they support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO, design, and implementation of the MSP remain highly relevant to the current country
and global priorities as well as the Bank’s country assistance strategy at the time of project
appraisal (1998) and the most recent strategy covering the period 2011-2014. Cities in
Bangladesh continue to grow at a rapid rate and the ULBs throughout the country continue to
need support for planning, financing, implementing, and sustaining critically needed municipal
infrastructure and improvements in urban services. The reforms established under the project,
particularly with regard to the improved resource allocation for infrastructure investment in
municipalities through the BMDF, allowed ULBs that met certain criteria to obtain funds to
finance critically needed improvements that would not otherwise be available if they had to
continue to rely only on the block grants allocated to them by the national government. This
issue continues to be a priority for most ULBs around the country. The implementation
arrangements also continue to be highly relevant. LGED’s institutional and technical capacities
continue to be essential for supporting ULBs in planning and implementing urban infrastructure
services. BMDF is the most appropriate vehicle for allocating resources to eligible ULBS for
infrastructure investments around the country.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The MSP achieved its objective of improving environmental and infrastructure service delivery
in urban areas. Through the financing of infrastructure and urban service improvements, and
introduction of dedicated capacity building to selected municipalities, the participating ULBs are
now more capable of selecting and preparing priority investments, delivering urban services, and
contributing to an improved quality of life for the affected populations. They also have achieved
greater financial discipline and taken steps to improve cost recovery and other measures of good
governance, for example, through the participatory approach to identifying priority projects.
Most of the PDO and Intermediate outcomes were achieved as described below.



                                               15
PDO Indicators

(a) Strengthen the institutional capacity of selected municipal corporations and secondary
    towns to plan, finance, implement, and operate urban infrastructure services in an
    efficient and sustainable manner.

      By the end of the project, 183 ULBs had developed the capacity to plan, prioritize,
       and implement service improvements. This was achieved through the technical
       assistance provided to them in preparing the FOAPs (a requirement for project funding);
       the MSU Municipal Capacity Building Program support which was designed to help
       them prepare the plans and improve their institutional and financial capacity to ensure the
       sustainability of the project investments; and BMDF’s ongoing technical support during
       project implementation. The Indeed, the MSU program continues to deliver capacity
       building as part of the Government’s ongoing activities.

      Participating ULB officials are now able to carry out their municipal functions in a
       more efficient and sustainable manner. Through the capacity building and training
       programs provided by the MSU Municipal Capacity Building Program provided to 183
       ULBs, authorities and personnel, including ULB engineers and accountants, in the
       municipal corporations and secondary towns improved their capacities for carrying out
       procurement procedures, quality control of civil works, and accounts management. The
       capacity building encompassed: computerization and improved management of holding
       tax bills and records, municipal accounts, water supply bills and records, and trade
       license records; development of infrastructure inventories and preparation of base maps;
       and support for community mobilization activities as well as requisite hardware,
       equipment, and logistics. These inputs resulted in significant improvement in municipal
       services delivery, tax management, infrastructure planning, and O&M. For example,
       based on a 2012 survey of 102 mayors, 98 percent reported an increase in revenue
       income, development of staff capacity and skills, improved service delivery standards,
       and an increase in accountability and transparency. Among 57 water utility staff
       interviewed, moreover, 93 to 95 percent reported that they were able to deliver water bills
       on time, transparency increased due to collecting water bills through banks, and
       collection efficiency increased (see annex 5).

      Participating ULB officials obtained skills for project implementation. Through
       BMDF’s capacity building support, the mayors and ULB officials directly involved in
       sub-project preparation and implementation obtained skills needed for preparing tender
       documents, tender evaluation reports, and contracts; carrying out project implementation
       procedures; ensuring quality control; instituting new billing systems; implementing a
       social impact management framework; preparing an environmental impact monitoring
       format; and applying the procurement risk mitigation framework.

      Reform of tax collection systems was carried out in 142 ULBs. Computer software
       developed under the project, such as those designed for holding tax, water billing, trade
       licensing, and non-motorized vehicle management was transferred to city corporations
       and municipalities. A limited survey of municipal employees and residents confirm the
       benefit of the improvements in billing and tax collection (see annex 5). For example,
                                               16
       among 102 mayors surveyed, almost all recognized an increase in revenue, development
       of their staff’s capacity and skill, improved service delivery standards, and an increase in
       accountability and transparency. In addition, nearly all respondents (the paurashava
       authority, paurashava staff, and citizens) consider the MSU’s Municipal Capacity
       Building Program to be well-timed with beneficial effects. The paurashava holding tax
       revenue collection efficiency figures show that positive changes occurred in 80
       paurashavas out of 100 paurashavas after computerization. Water billing revenue
       collection efficiency also improved in 34 out of a total of 48 pourashavas. Before
       computerization, there was no infrastructure database or base maps in any of the
       paurashavas. Now there are 105 complete databases and 79 complete base maps out of
       133 paurashavas. Before the MSP, there was very little community-related support for
       paurashavas. Citizens’ awareness campaigns, formation of Town Level Coordination
       Committee, Ward Level Coordination Committee, and Community Based Organizations
       were started for the firm time under the MCBP.

      ULBs continue to improve in covering municipal service O&M. Although data were
       not collected to confirm the extent to which all the municipalities that received financing
       for their sub-projects are covering the O&M costs, available data indicate that as a result
       of the technical assistance provided to ULBs in demand driven and cost recovery
       measures in 162 municipalities, about half reported improvement in their post-
       computerization holding tax collection. Tax collection rates improved by 12.7% (pre-
       computerization was 45.68% compared to 58% post computerization efficiency), and
       water rates collection efficiency rose from 57% to 66% in 51 ULBs; the overall change
       was about 9%. After the project closed, the MSU has continued to provide capacity
       building under ADB’s UGIIP. Both JICA and the GOB also have plans to implement
       other municipal capacity building activities through the MSU, thus providing further
       support for municipalities in planning and implementing sustainable services.

       “Through the support from BMDF, we constructed roads, drains, and extended 4.5
       kilometers of water lines. We also installed energy saving bulbs for street lighting. As a
       result, we are able to extend services to more civic facilities. In return, people are paying
       taxes.? (Mayor, Tongi)

       “With funds from BMDF, we were able to purchase energy saving bulbs that reduced our
       energy costs by 40 percent.? (Mayor, Singra Municipality)

(b) Improve resource mobilization and allocation, and fiscal discipline through the creation
    of an improved financing mechanism for urban infrastructure investment.

      The BMDF was established in 2002 and fully operational in 2004. As a result of the
       project, the BMDF (licensed under the Companies Act of 1994) was officially registered
       in 2002, became operational in 2004, and subsequently appraised and financed 584 works
       packages for urban infrastructure and environmental improvements in 154 ULBs. To be
       eligible for funding, ULBs were required to meet the following criteria: availability of
       skilled engineers and accountants; rate of collection of tax at least 65%, initiation of a
       master plan/detailed area plan, and surplus revenue to contribute its own share. The

                                                17
    recipient ULB is required to contribute 10% of the total cost of the non-revenue
    generating investment and BMDF bears 90% of the sub-project cost. Of this 90%,
    BMDF provides 85% as a grant and 15% as a loan to the participating ULB. The
    recipient ULB is committed to repay the loan in 37 installments with a 1 year grace
    period. According to BMDF, the project achieved a 75% repayment rate.

   BMDF improved resource mobilization and allocation as well as fiscal discipline in
    participating municipalities. As a government owned company, BMDF continues to
    provide financial support through grants and loans to municipalities that meet certain
    qualification criteria with an emphasis on revenue collection and sound financial
    management. Unless the municipalities fulfill these requirements, they will not be able to
    borrow from the BMDF. To help establish financial discipline, ULBs that do not repay
    the loan would lose a portion of its block grant allocation. The BMDF, now de-linked
    from the project, has created a competitive environment in the field of local resource
    mobilization and financial discipline. With the creation of BMDF, a new funding window
    was opened for eligible municipalities. Prior to the establishment of the BMDF, many
    small and medium sized municipalities had no other option for securing funding but to
    rely on the block grants provided by the central government.

   During implementation of the AF of 2010, BMDF streamlined its operations. These
    included: (i) development of a standard project implementation methodology and
    prototypical designs for urban infrastructure; (ii) contribution and use of the design and
    implementation of a social impact mitigation framework, environmental impact
    management framework, procurement risk mitigation framework, and city-specific
    financial and operational action plans during project implementation; (iii) restructuring of
    staff salaries so as to retain core BMDF officials; (iv) arranging for the monitoring and
    supervision consultants to occupy the same offices as the BMDF officials which
    facilitated activities to ensure the quality of project works; and (v) rationalizing and
    updating BMDF service rules and policies (for example, travel advance policy,
    transportation rules, advance repayment rules).

   During implementation of the AF of 2010, BMDF strengthened its coordination with
    LGED and other relevant agencies. BMDF officials: (i) followed LGED schedules of
    rates in preparing estimated bills of quantities for bidding documents prior to project
    implementation; (ii) formally requested that the Chief Engineer of LGED provide
    facilities of their laboratories for testing construction materials; (iii) tested materials and
    workmanship in LGED laboratories; (iv) used help from the local Universities of
    Engineering & Technology, Science and Research Laboratories, Public Health
    Engineering Department as well as Department of Environment for testing materials and
    exchanging views regarding technical issues as and when required; (v) provided input to
    LGED in preparing the training module on preparing FOAPs; (vi) took an active part as
    resource persons in the training organized by the MSU of LGED; and (vii) jointly worked
    with LGED officials as members of procurement-related committees, when required.

    The Municipal Performance Review Committee (MPRC) was established in 2000 at
    the ministry level. Chaired by the Secretary of the Local Government Division, its main

                                              18
       purpose is to review the performance of the municipalities. As such, all development
       partners have and are continuing to use the MPRC for the performance review of the
       municipalities included in the projects they support.

(c) Support the GOB and municipalities to reduce urban poverty and improve
    environmental conditions of urban communities through the financing of critical urban
    infrastructure and services.

      The first phase of MSP investments financed critical urban infrastructure and
       services, all aimed at reducing urban poverty and improving environmental
       conditions. The project addressed an urgent need for basic services in the ULBs,
       particularly in low-income areas, and improvement in the quality of urban services by
       investing in the following under the first phase of MSP implementation under LGED:

       o 10 water supply wells replaced, 10 abandoned wells regenerated, 20 pump houses
         rehabilitated.
       o Rehabilitation of nearly 16 km of water distribution system, along with installation of
         2,500 domestic water flow meters.
       o Rehabilitation of 150 street hydrants and 54 hand pumps.
       o Rehabilitation of 1 overhead tank and construction of storage shade.
       o Rehabilitation of a water treatment plant and an iron removal plant.
       o Installation of 35 public toilets.
       o Construction of a 5 km small bore sewerage system
       o Upgrading and rehabilitation of about 250 km of urban roads
       o 40 km of drainage improvements (through drain reconstruction and/or conversion of
         earthen drains to brick-walled drains)
       o Construction and rehabilitation of 11 bus and truck terminals
       o Slum upgrading in Khulna that included 303 dug wells, construction of a 3,357 meter
         drain with footpath, roughly 7,300 meters of surface drain, a 16,852 meter footpath,
         and 540 meter landing approach
       o Provision of about 680 communal solid waste collection bins
       o Upgrading and/or rehabilitation of 19 kitchen markets
       o Acquisition of about 10.5 ha for implementing the bus/truck terminals and sanitation
         investments

      BMDF investments aimed at poverty alleviation and improved urban environmental
       conditions. They included:

       o   1,128 km of road were built or rehabilitated in 141 ULBs.
       o   260 km of drain were built or rehabilitated in 103 ULBs.
       o   211 kitchen markets were developed in 59 ULBs.
       o   173 km of water supply pipelines were installed in 24 ULBs.
       o   36 deep tube wells were constructed in 15 ULBs.
       o   Construction of water treatment plants in 2 ULBs.
       o   87 public toilets installed in a total of 36 ULBs.
       o   32 box culverts constructed in 13 ULBs.

                                              19
       o   24,960 sets of street lights added in 24 ULBs.
       o   9 bus/truck terminals established in 9 ULBs.
       o   15 community centers established in 14 ULBs.
       o   8 slaughterhouses built in 6 ULBs.
       o   7 office complex buildings built in 7 ULBs.

      Project beneficiaries and other stakeholders reported that the project-financed
       infrastructure improved their living environment and had benefits for their health
       and productivity. A qualitative evaluation carried out by Development Support Link
       (private company) in July 2007 showed that the project investments: (i) increased the
       value of trade and business (ii) increased prices of land (iii) generated employment (iv)
       increased enrollment of both boys and girls in the schools and colleges (v) supplied a
       large numbers of goods and commodities (vi) improved public health (vii) eliminated
       water logging in some areas (viii) decreased water-borne diseases, and (ix) improved the
       overall environment (see annex 5).

      Project implementation generated employment and prospects for further job
       creation. During implementation of the project, the adoption of labor intensive
       technology for construction works generated 13,500,000 days of short-term employment.
       In addition, the O&M of the assets created under the project is expected to create longer
       term jobs in O&M.

       “With funds from the BMDF, we constructed kitchen markets, and vegetable growers are
       getting reasonable prices and side by side revenue collection is also increased.? (Mayor,
       Lalmonirhat Municipality)

      The physical investments targeting poverty and environmental improvements
       incorporated a participatory planning approach to promote greater involvement of
       the residents in selecting and implementing priority investments. The participatory
       approach adopted by the project created a “sense of ownership? among project
       beneficiaries for the BMDF-financed sub-projects. Although one component specifically
       targeted slum conditions, most of the project investments in urban infrastructure aimed at
       poverty and improvement of the urban environment. BMDF’s investments also
       emphasized not only the physical development of the ULBs, but the socio-economic
       improvement of its inhabitants. For example, the improved road network would help
       people to move quickly, easily, and safely from one place to another and helped the
       municipality’s local economy, trade, and business. In providing community mobilization
       support to the municipalities, MSU helped to establish 67 town-level coordination
       committees, and 254 CBOs at the grassroots level.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

      The Municipal Development Fund was established on March 9, 2002 (Indicator 1.1).
      The Municipal Performance Review Committee was established on June 30, 1999
       ( Indicator 1.2)


                                              20
      The Municipal Support Unit was fully staffed and working by October 25, 1999
       (Indicator 1.3).
      The Partnership and Participatory Approach was designed, in agreement with the Bank,
       on September 30, 1999 (Indicator 1.4)
      All Phase I participating city corporations and municipalities implemented a Financial
       and Operational Action Plan (FOAP) by June 30, 2000 (Indicator 1.5)
      At least 40 other municipalities implemented a FOAP by June 30, 2004 (Indicator 1.6).
      Almost all planned physical investments (see Annex 2 for project outputs) were
       implemented under phase one by December 31, 2006 (Indicators 2.1 - 2.7).
      Under the AF 2010, by the end of the project, BMDF had worked with 154 out of the
       planned 168 municipalities and financed 595 sub-projects with a loan recovery rate of 75
       percent (New Indicator).
      Under the AF2010, by the end of the project, the MSU extended capacity building to 50
       additional municipalities, and of the 39 municipalities surveyed, the overall average
       increase in collection efficiency was 17.5 percent. Among these municipalities, 23 had
       holding tax collection rates in the 48 to 95 percent range (New Indicator); another 7
       municipalities had collection efficiency in the 40-47 percent range.

3.3 Efficiency

As discussed above, the civil works undertaken under the project’s first and second phase
included road construction, water supply, sanitation, drainage, bus and truck terminals, slum
improvement, solid waste management improvements, and markets. The project also included
technical and institutional support activities. In the case of civil works under phase 1, the ICR
team was not able to assess the benefits because adequate data were not available on the outputs
and associated economic and technical parameters. Because the benefits of the project-financed
technical assistance and institutional support are not quantifiable, an economic analysis was not
attempted for these investments. For the phase two investments in civil works, however, it was
possible to carry out an economic analysis for selected investments in roads, roadside drainage,
and bus terminals given the availability of data. Annex 3 summarizes the overall results of the
economic analysis carried out for the ICR.

Measures of Economic Efficiency. The analysis relates the project costs to the economic value
stream of benefits from the specific project investments. In the case of roads, the benefits
included savings in vehicle operating costs, savings in travel time and travel costs, and the
indirect benefits from the economy-wide multiplier impacts of wage incomes from construction-
related expenditures for the civil works. In the case of roadside drainage, the analysis considered
the revenues from user charges and the multiplier impacts of wage incomes for the civil works.
As in the case of roads, the benefits of the bus terminals include savings in vehicle operating
costs, savings in travel time and travel costs, and additional revenues from the improved bus
terminals. The summary of estimated benefit-cost ratios and the Economic Rates of Returns
(ERRs) on investments are presented in the table below.




                                                21
                 Summary of Measures of Economic Efficiency of Investment

Investment                             Economic Rate of Return                 Benefit-Cost Ratio
Roads                                        27 to 30.6                                2.3
Roadside drainage                                22                                    1.5
Bus terminals                                    23                                   1.65

The analysis shows that the project yielded modest returns measured in terms of benefit-cost ratios, ERRs,
and Net Present Values of cost and benefit streams. In the case of roadside drains, there are also indirect
benefits such as reduced damage to the roads and consequent savings in road repairs, improved road
transport efficiency in monsoon seasons, and the environmental and health benefits of adequate drainage.
Indirect economic benefits are not included in this analysis because we do not have data on these benefits.
However, it may be noted that accounting for such benefits will significantly improve the measures of
economic efficiency.

The benefits from the technical and institutional support provided under this project were not estimated
because such benefits are not quantifiable. Further, there were multiple civil works and investments under
the project in two phases, including the Additional Financing of 2008 and 2010. Because we did not have
data to estimate the benefits from each of these investments, it was not possible to estimate measures of
economic efficiency for the entire project. Nonetheless, the PAD provided estimates of expected rates of
return on investments in roads, drainage, and bus terminals. Our results are in agreement with those
estimates for the specific investments analyzed.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Achievement of the objectives of MSP is rated satisfactory. The project’s objectives, design, and
implementation arrangement remain highly relevant. Rapid urbanization continues in Bangladesh,
overwhelming the capacities of most cities to provide the infrastructure and services to ensure
the health, safety, and productivity of their populations. The continuing demand for BMDF
support and the overall success of the BMDF concept under the MSP demonstrate that the
project continues to be relevant. Further, the project substantially achieved its original intended
outcomes, and most of the intermediate indicators were met or exceeded with regard to
institutional reform, establishing and operating the BMDF, and the physical investments.
Although it was not possible to estimate measures of economic efficiency for the entire project,
the results of an economic analysis carried out for a sample of investments in roads, drainage,
and bus terminals were all positive. They show that these investments were efficient, and
generated ERRS as high as 30 percent, which are in agreement with the estimates in the PAD.
High relevance and satisfactory achievement of objectives justifies an overall outcome rating of
satisfactory for the MSP.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project aimed to alleviate poverty through investments in sub-projects that improved
environmental conditions, especially for the poor. The project also had positive impacts on

                                                   22
women. During the operation of various facilities financed by the project (for example, kitchen
markets, bus/truck terminals, public toilets, solid waste management systems), there was scope
for increasing women’s employment. Over the longer term, it is envisaged that women will be
employed in facility maintenance works. In addition, the selection of sub-projects involved a
participatory approach through which both women and men were afforded equal opportunity to
express their views and preferences in determining investment priorities. The participatory
process by which ULB selected sub-projects for BMDF financing also contributed to project
ownership and the perception on the part of citizens that the local authorities cared about its
constituency and considered their views in investment decision making.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project initiated reforms in ULBs initially to make them eligible for BMDF financing and to
help establish the financial discipline needed to sustain the investment. The institutional
strengthening under the project resulted in among other areas of municipal management,
significant improvements in tax collection, computerization of tax records and water records,
management of accounting reports, mapping, and community mobilization to support project
planning and implementation. Throughout the project and after it closed, the MSU continued its
capacity building for establishing longer-term institutional development. According to the LGED,
the project resulted in “a change in mindset? on the part of the municipal authorities. Prior to
project implementation, the municipal authorities focused mainly on their investment needs.
Mayors are now seeking capacity building for broader improvements in municipal governance.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project demonstrated successful donor harmonization. Both ADB and the World Bank used
the same MSU to deliver capacity building. The MSU continues its capacity building function
through the implementation of the ADB-financed Urban Governance and Infrastructure
Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A full beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshop was not carried out. However, the MSU
carried out a survey in 2012 to evaluate the effectiveness of its Municipal Capacity Building
Program. Overall, the findings showed that the project had a highly positive effect on all
stakeholders. Nearly all mayors and councilors recognized an increase in revenue income,
development of their staff’s capacity and skill, improved service delivery standard, and increase
in accountability and transparency. Annex 5 summarizes some of the most important findings.

In 2007, the BMDF contracted Development Support Link to carry out a qualitative impact
evaluation of the MSP. The methodologies used for the evaluation included focus group
discussions with target beneficiaries in six municipalities and key informant interviews with the
local elite, members of civil society, and other stakeholders. The evaluation showed that the
project investments: (i) increased the value of trade and business (ii) increased prices of land (iii)
generated employment (iv) increased enrolment of both boys and girls in the schools and
colleges (v) supplied a large numbers of goods and commodities (vi) improved public health (vii)


                                                 23
eliminated water logging in some areas (viii) decreased water-borne diseases, and (ix) improved
the overall environment (see annex 5 for more detailed findings).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is rated moderate. The BMDF demonstrated that its operations
continue, and that it is committed to improving the commercial aspects of its operations. The
MSU also continues to provide technical assistance and training to ULBs. The Bank’s continuing
engagement will help ensure that the capacity building carried out under MSP can provide a
foundation for continued support and strengthening so the municipalities can continue to
effectively deliver and sustain the investments in urban infrastructure.

The benefits of the capacity building support of the project are likely to be sustained, although
challenges remain. Staff in most ULBs will continue to need training and mentoring in financial
management, procurement, contract management, urban and strategic planning, human resources
management, communications, and information management.

Sustainability of the infrastructure and services financed by the project is likely to vary by city
size and level of development. While some of the larger ULBs have reported good cost recovery
and income through the income generating infrastructure (for example, kitchen markets and
community centers), it is less certain that the non-income generating investments would have the
same results (for example, maintenance of roads). Support to further improve operations and
maintenance would need to be continued through the ADB project or a new World Bank project.

Another main concern relates to the sustainability of the operations of the BMDF. It will be
important for the new investment to assist the BMDF in mobilizing increasing amounts of own
source revenue and securing its longer term sustainability. At the time of this writing, however,
a new World Bank investment under preparation will address this concern.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s overall performance was satisfactory with regard to the basic design of the project.
The team considered alternative approaches and lessons learned from investments worldwide
and in Bangladesh, appropriately evaluated the risks, and ensured that there was an investment
program well prepared to implement under the first phase as soon as the credit became effective.
The team also was realistic in determining the eligibility criteria for project support. However,
the rating is lower than the QAG rating because some of the outcome indicators were not



                                                24
measurable, and the team significantly underestimated the amount of time it would take before
the BMDF would be fully operational.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was closely supervised throughout much of its history. The Bank averaged two full
supervision missions per year and provided ongoing support by local staff, including an urban
specialist (who later became the task team leader), as well as the financial, procurement, and
environmental and social safeguard specialists who were able to provide hands on support from
the country office. The task team also fielded specialists in municipal funds and institutional
capacity building to address issues associated with the BMDF.

The implementing agencies reported general satisfaction with the Bank’s supervision; however,
during the latter years, concerns were raised regarding the timeliness of the Bank’s responses to
project financing issues. Regarding fiduciary matters during project implementation, close
attention by the Bank’s procurement specialist helped to avoid mis-procurements through the
introduction of a Procurement Risk Mitigation Framework which include 45 indicators that both
the LGED and BMDF were required to monitor. The local team’s support was continuous and
very strong. The specialist held monthly meetings to discuss and resolve any procurement issues.

Although the investments were not expected to have any significant environmental or social
impacts, the teams could have provided closer supervision of safeguard issues, especially
compliance with OP 4.12. During the long implementation period, the task teams also could
have assigned greater priority to ensuring that adequate capacity building was made available to
all participating ULBs to help establish effective cost recovery for the investment, improving the
results frameworks and project monitoring, and requesting periodic beneficiary assessments.

Because the project implementation period extended over a period of 12 years, the project had
several changes in task team leaders. However, this did not cause significant problems, mainly
because the principal team members largely remained on the team. Project ISR ratings have been
realistic and honest in reflecting situations on the ground. Supervision could have been improved
if it modified the results framework to clarify the indicators.

Although a QAG review during the early years of project implementation rated the Bank’s
supervision as being moderately unsatisfactory due largely to its handling of the borrower’s
delay in establishing and operationalizing the BMDF, the ICR team’s view is that the Bank team
has been championing and actively supporting the borrower in establishing and operationalizing
the BMDF, even though various difficulties were confronted during the process Given the
subsequent success of the project and BMDF, and based on a review of available ISR documents
and aide memoires, as well as discussions with former and current team members, the ICR team
does not view the MU rating as being highly relevant for this ICR.




                                               25
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating of moderately satisfactory is based on the team’s good performance in supporting the
design of and supervising a high risk, high reward project that would directly address the key
issues confronting the urban sector in Bangladesh while introducing a new mechanism for
promoting transparency in resource allocation to municipalities and encouraging greater
discipline on the part of the country’s municipalities for identifying and sustaining priority
infrastructure investments. However, the team was less effective in establishing a well designed
results framework with outcomes and targets that could be measured, and ensuring that the
project was establishing the necessary conditions at the municipal level for sub-project
sustainability. During the extended period of project implementation, the Bank should have
assigned greater attention to these issues and the need for beneficiary assessment. As noted by
BMDF, moreover, the Bank team could have provided more timely responses to BMDF
questions related to sub-project financing issues; its late responses caused delays during the latter
part of project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The GOB remained committed to the objectives of the project. Although changes in government
leadership stalled progress in operationalizing the BMDF by about three years, support for this
new entity was never an issue. This was especially evident in June 2007, when the
Government/BMDF Board appointed a full time managing director, despite having to deal with
the civic unrest occurring in the country associated with the election process. This demonstrated
the Government’s ongoing interest in the project, and the Board’s capacity to act in the Fund’s
best interest. The GOB also provided counterpart funds as needed throughout most of the project
implementation period.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

LGED provided consistently strong leadership throughout the 12 years of project implementation.
The implementation of phase one investments and technical assistance were implemented largely
on schedule, and the department was able to redirect its attention as required to accommodate the
various changes in project activities and financing to address the urgent need to repair
infrastructure damaged by the floods of 2000, 2004, and 2007. In large part, the delays in project
implementation occurred primarily as a result of the floods and the success of LGED in
responding quickly and ably to direct the additional funds to the urgently needed investments.
The relatively good performance with regard to procurement is also notable.



                                                 26
Despite the delays in operationalizing the BMDF, this new entity introduced in a country that
was highly centralized, became an effective instrument for changing the way resources would be
allocated to municipalities of all sizes around the country. As the project progressed, the BMDF
added improvements in various aspects of project management with the recruitment of additional
professional staff, and preparation of an adequate social impact assessment framework. The main
concerns for BMDF was the need for more highly qualified staff to provide the necessary
technical support to the ULBs in preparing good project proposals and supervising quality
control. In this regard, its operations could have been better coordinated with those of LGED
and made better use of LGED’s technical staff.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The GOB demonstrated its overall support for the project throughout the implementation of the
original credit and subsequent AFs, and LGED provided strong and effective management of the
first phase of investment, subsequent investments to address the periodic floods, and the MSU.
Moreover, the project was complex and involved introduction of a new entity that would change
the manner in which resources would be allocated to cities for infrastructure improvements.
Although there was a delay in establishing and operationalizing the BMDF, its ultimate
performance demonstrated that it would possible to introduce reform in Bangladesh and
implement a large number of contracts in many cities around the country. In many cases, the
funding was made to small and medium sized cities that would not otherwise have access to the
funding for infrastructure improvements.

6. Lessons Learned

Allow sufficient time for a new institution to be established, especially when it accompanies
a major policy reform. Project design and implementation should take into account realistic
time frames when a new institution will be created for financing municipal projects. In the case
of MSP, setting up and operationalizing the MDF took about three years longer than originally
planned. Project extension, together with the Bank’s continued intensive support, in the end
allowed BMDF to be fully functional as originally envisaged. One lesson is that the Bank should
be patient and persistent in supporting this type of policy reform.

The MDF model in supporting ULB infrastructure investments was effective and should be
continued with stronger technical support. The model used in Bangladesh introduced a
relative simple approach to supporting ULBs by giving them maximum flexibility in determining
their own project priorities, calling the tender, selecting contractors, and maintaining quality
during implementation. However, the model could be strengthened if higher quality technical
support was more widely available for assisting the municipalities on preparing good project
proposals and engineering designs, and monitoring the works. If there is a follow up project, the
LGED, which has high quality technical staff and capacity to monitor sub-projects, should have a
more active role in BMDF operations by supporting the ULBs in project design and supervision,
and providing continued capacity building.



                                               27
Introducing a municipal fund where there are small cities with weak financial systems
requires realistic eligibility criteria for participating municipalities and ample institutional
capacity building to allow them to participate and sustain their investments. None of the
small municipalities that were able to benefit from the project could have met eligibility criteria
often used in other countries where Bank projects have supported municipal development funds.
The criteria established under this project required the municipalities to assess their financial
situation, demonstrate a tax collection rate of at least 60 percent, prepare a financial and
operational plan (FOAP), and demonstrate commitment to its implementation. The use of these
criteria allowed many ULBs that would not otherwise have access to credit, obtain funds for
priority infrastructure investments and improvements in governance and fiduciary management.
The inclusion of the capacity building under LGED helped to ensure that the participating
municipalities not only would qualify for funding but would start to build capacity for O&M. If
there is a follow-up project, the capacity building should be broadened to provide technical
assistance and training to the ULBs that are implementing project-financed infrastructure
improvements to improve their governance structures and policies related to O&M.

Closer coordination between BMDF and LGED in providing institutional strengthening
and technical support would strengthen BMDF operations. During the implementation of
MSP, the MSU capacity building provided to ULBs was made available to all ULBs. While all
could benefit from this support, a follow up investment should ensure closer coordination
between MSU capacity building and BMDF sub-project financing to ensure that the
municipalities receiving assistance for the investment projects are provided with the support
needed to ensure quality control for the physical investments and to sustain the improvements.

The MSU was an effective vehicle for delivering and coordinating technical and
institutional support to municipalities assisted by the World Bank and other donors. After
the project closed, other donors continued to use or plan to use this entity to build on the capacity
building provided under the MSP. To ensure consistency in the approach, which has been
successful in the Bangladesh context, any new investments in the urban sector should aim at
implementing its capacity building program through the MSU.

Including a disaster risk management (or contingent emergency response) component in
projects where there is a high risk of flooding and other natural disasters facilitates an
emergency response. For projects implemented in countries such as Bangladesh, where there is
high risk of flooding, project designs should include a contingent emergency response
component (0 cost) that can be put into operation immediately in case of an emergency, without
the need for formal project restructuring. Following the floods of 2004 and 2007, the MSP was
one of the instruments for the emergency assistance. Having the Flood Damage Rehabilitation
component in place facilitated the implementation of the additional financing without the need
for formal restructuring to allow LGED to respond quickly in addressing the damage to critical
transportation and communication networks.

Using the Participatory and Partnership Approach (PPA) built project ownership. The
participatory approach to identifying priority infrastructure investments proved to be successful
because it encouraged greater community involvement and partnership in delivering services
such as community water supply, solid waste management, and sanitation; and created a “sense

                                                 28
of ownership? among the stakeholders that will help to ensure project sustainability. This
approach also helped to promote trust on the part of the population toward their local
government. The participatory approach could be been more effective if there were periodic
beneficiary assessments used to determine the extent to which the PPA was effective, whether
the project was meeting stakeholder expectations, and what measures could be introduced to
maximize project benefits.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background

The project was implemented in two phases and had seven components. Phase one had five
components which were investments in civil works, equipment, technical assistance, physical
investments, and flood damage rehabilitation. The civil works component included financing for
water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage, bus and truck terminals, slum improvement, solid waste
management, markets, and land acquisition. The investments under the second component
included solid waste equipment in Khulnaa and Rajshahi, and motor vehicles and computers for
support personnel in each Pourashava. The third component provided technical assistance for
institutional development, municipal database development, community development and
participation, municipal development fund, technical studies, project implementation, staffing,
and training. The fourth component (also referred to as the Chittagong Hill Tracts Component)
financed physical investments in three municipalities (Rangamati, Bandarban, and Khagrachari)
which were lagging behind other municipalities in service provision and urban development.
Component 5 supported rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure in municipalities affected by the
1998 floods.

Phase two of the project had two components. The first component was the Municipal
Development Fund to finance civil works, equipments, goods, and technical assistance. The
second component provided technical assistance by providing technical support to the MDF
specialists and municipalities and incremental O&M support and MSU during the initial years.

Most of these technical assistance and institutional development investments are not amenable to
economic analysis because the benefits could not be estimated in monetary units. However, it is
possible to quantify the benefits of the civil works investments. Thus, economic analysis was
conducted for a sample of investments in roads, water supply and sanitation, and bus terminals
for which adequate data are available.

1.     Economic Analysis of Investment in Road Development

The project consisted of more than 160 roads in the participating cities and pourashavas
(municipalities), some of which were very small investments. The small road projects usually
involved resurfacing of roads. The economic analysis however was conducted for two roads for
which adequate data on vehicle traffic, vehicle operating costs, travel time, and other relevant
data are available. The two roads analyzed are Kahn Bahadur Road in Pabna Pourashava and the
Line Road in Rangamatti Pourashava.

The economic benefits from investment in roads are savings in vehicle operating costs, savings
from decreased travel time due to improved road conditions for all types of motorized and non-
motorized vehicles, and other indirect benefits including economy wide impacts from additional
job creation and multiplier impacts. Direct benefits from the investment in roads include
reduction in travel costs and other indirect economic benefits. The savings in travel costs include
reduction in vehicle operating costs and savings from reduced travel times. The indirect
economic benefits include economy wide multiplier impacts of spending in road development
though employment generation and consumption of construction materials.

1.1    Methodology and Data

Methodology

In order to estimate the benefits from the investment in roads, we estimated the savings in
vehicle operating costs, travel times and travel costs saved, and the indirect economic benefits of
the project. For this analysis, let q1 be the traffic volume in the road before the project and q2 the
traffic volume after the investment in the road, and let VOC1 and VOC2 be the Vehicle Operating
Costs (VOC) before and after the project, respectively. Similarly, let TOT1 and TOT2 be the
Travel Time Costs before and after the project and T1 and T2 the number of travelers using the
road before and after the project. Thus, the savings in vehicle operating cost is:

VOCSav= q1*(VOC2-VOC1) + 0.5*(q2-q1)*(VOC2-VOC1) = (VOC2-VOC1)*0.5(q1+ q2).

In addition to the savings in VOC, the investment in roads reduces travel times and thus there is
a savings in travel costs. Let r represent the average vehicle occupancy per vehicle, T1 the travel
time before investment, T2 the travel time after road investment, and w the average wage rate.
Thus, the reduced travel costs associated with reduction in travel time is:

TTSav= r*q1*w*(T1-T2)+0.5*r(q2-q1)( (T1-T2)) = (T1-T2)*0.5*r(q1+q2).

The net benefits from the investment in roads becomes

Net Benefit = VOCSav + TTSav + IB +Economy wide impacts,

where VOCSav is the savings in vehicle operating costs, TTSav is the savings in travel time, and
IB is the economy wide benefits arising from spending in road development. In order to estimate
the indirect economy-wide benefits, it is assumed that spending in road construction creates
employment and generates demand of materials in the economy and hence will have multiplier
impacts on the economy.

Data

Traffic volume: Traffic count data for 12 hours was collected on the roads, which was converted
to 24 hour traffic using factors of 35% for market days and 20% for non-market days. Average
annual vehicle traffic is obtained by assuming wet season to be 17 weeks in a year and traffic
during dry season to be 20% higher than in the wet season. In order to conduct the field surveys,
a set of questions was prepared and one person in each station along the road was stationed in
each road to collect information on traffic flow for all vehicles in both directions. Data on traffic
volumes was provided by the implementing agency.

Vehicle operating cost: Vehicle operating costs (VOC) were calculated for all class/types of
vehicles motorized and non-motorized at different levels of road roughness ranging from good to
bad and earthen roads. For motorized roads, data for calculating operating costs were derived
from interviews with bus and truck operators, vehicle body builders and vehicle traders. Data on
vehicle operating cost was provided by the implementing agency

                                                 65
Travel time costs: Travel time costs were estimated based on the average vehicle occupancy for
each type of vehicle using available information from road surveys provided by the
implementing agency, and are comparable to the available information from the Bank financed
Rural Roads Project.

Indirect benefits: The indirect benefits are economy-wide impacts from employment and
spending in road and other construction materials used. Such indirect benefits include the
multiplier impacts of wage income of construction workers generated from the road
construction/reconstruction program as well as from additional economic activities resulting
from linked businesses including suppliers of construction goods and services and employment
opportunities created in the services sector. In order to compute the multiplier impacts of wage
income and construction expenditures and other impacts on the economy, a multiplier of 1.08
was used in this analysis1.

In order to convert financial costs to economic costs, the standard conversion of 0.9 is used.
Annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are assumed to be 0.5 percent of the total
capital costs. In addition to the annual O&M costs, it is assumed that additional road repairs may
be required once every five years to keep the roads in good condition. Such repairs are assumed
to cost about 3 percent of the capital cost every five years. The traffic volume in the road is
assumed to grow at an annual rate of 2 percent for all modes of transport. The life of the road is
assumed to be 20 years with adequate maintenance repairs. In order to account for the
unemployment and under-employment, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.87 is used for skilled
labor and 0.67 for unskilled labor.

1.2.    Project Costs, Benefits, and Economic Efficiency
The initial investment in the roads was Taka 34.07 million for the Kahn Bahadur road in Pabna
Pourashava and Takka 41.9 million for the Police Line Road in Rangamatti Pourashava. The
base case scenario assumes that all kinds of traffic in the roads will increase at an annual rate of
2 percent. A 2 percent increase in traffic volume is reasonable because the economy is expected
to grow by about 6 percent and population at 1.2 percent. Under the base case scenario, the
results (Table A3.1) show that the investment in the Kahn Bahadur Road yields modest returns in
terms of benefit-cost ratio (2.34) and Net Present Value of cost and benefit streams and Internal
Rates of Return (30.6%). Investment in the Line Road in Rangamatti Pourashava also yielded
similar results with a benefit-cost ratio at 2.2 and Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at 27 percent.

The above results could be affected by changes in traffic volume on the roads. Hence, sensitivity
analysis was done under two alternative scenarios. The first scenario assumes a 3 percent annual
increase in traffic volume for all modes of transport, a plausible scenario given the economic

1
  The multiplier was arrived at as 1/(1-x*y*z) where x is the percentage of new income the consumer and business
will spend; y is the percentage of consumer expenditures made in the state/region; and z is the percentage of
business expenditure made in the state/region. We have assumed that the values of x, y and z to be 0.4, 0.5 and 0.4
respectively (Income multipliers in Economic Impact Analysis, Guide Z-108, New Mexico State University.
www.aces.nmsu.edu)


                                                        66
growth and increase in disposable incomes. The second scenario assumes that the traffic volume
stays the same throughout the project life because there could be some diversion of traffic when
other parallel roads are constructed.

The results of the sensitivity analysis show that even under a conservative assumption of zero
traffic growth, the measures of economic efficiency are modest. Because the traffic volume
increases, the benefit-cost ratio and the Economic Rates of Return rose, as expected.

The above results show that based on the economic analysis of the two roads for which data are
available, the investment in roads yielded modest economic returns. These returns are
comparable to the ex-ante estimates of rates of return on the roads in Nilphamari and Joypurhat,
as presented in the PAD. It may be noted that under the Municipal Services Project numerous
roads of different classes have been constructed. Because the ICR team has neither the relevant
data on all of the different roads financed nor a representative sample of road investments, an
aggregation of the measures of economic efficiency of road investments under the project is not
attempted here. However, the results of the economic analysis for the two roads show high
levels of economic efficiency in road investments under the project.

2.     Economic Analysis of Investment in Drainage

The objectives of improved drainage facilities were to mitigate urban degradation and to improve
health conditions. In addition to the above direct benefits, the drainage investments reduced
flooding of the roads during the monsoon season and thus increased road capacities. Thus, these
investments resulted in improved reliability of the roads in the monsoon season, and also reduced
the road maintenance costs of the roads because proper drainage reduced deterioration and
damage to the roads from stagnant water. In order to estimate the project benefits we have only
data on direct benefits in the form of payments by households for drainage services. Because we
do not have data on indirect benefits such as reduced maintenance costs and damages to the
roads such benefits are not included in this analysis.


2.1    Data and Methods




                                               67
In addition to the investment costs, we have assumed that the annual O&M costs are 5 percent of
the investment costs. We have also assumed that the drainage systems may require repairs and
some minor reconstruction works in every five years. The costs of such repairs and
reconstruction are assumed to be about 15 percent of the investment costs.

On the benefit side, the direct benefits from the drainage investments are the charges paid by the
beneficiaries and thus the revenues from the drainage services provided to the beneficiaries. In
addition to these direct benefits, there are a number of indirect benefits such as reduced urban
degradation and improved health outcomes, reduced flooding of roads and thus damages to the
roads, and an increase in road capacity. We do not have data to estimate these indirect benefits
and hence is not included in the economic analysis.

2.2.       Project Costs, Benefits, and Economic Efficiency

Economic analysis of the investment in the Pabna roadside drain for which we have data is
presented below2. The initial investment in the Pabna roadside drain was Taka 9.78 million. In
addition to the investment costs, the O&M costs and costs of repairs are also considered (see
section 2.1). Under the base case scenario, the user charges are assumed to increase at an annual
rate of 4 percent and the life of the investment is assumed to be 20 years with necessary repairs
in every five years.

Measures of economic efficiency under a base case scenario and two alternative (sensitivity
analysis) scenarios are presented in table 2.

             Table 2. Measures of economic efficiency for investments in roadside drains:
                                  base case and sensitivity analysis

of benefits (000 $)
Benefit: Cost         1.52                          1.77                            1.36

The base case scenario assumes that the user charges increase at an annual rate of 4 percent. The
results show modest returns to investment with an Internal Rate of Return of 23 percent and
benefit-cost ratio of 1.52. Note that the above estimates do not include indirect economic
benefits like reduced damage to the roads from drainage, improved urban environment, and
health and environmental benefits from the drainage3. Including such indirect economic benefits

Services Project.

in the benefit computations will significantly improve the measures of economic efficiency
because flooding and improper drainage and the consequent economic impacts are major
problems in Bangladesh.

The results of the sensitivity analysis support the above results. Scenario 1 considers the case
when the number of beneficiaries and the user charges increase by 2 percent and 4 percent,
respectively. An alternative scenario 2 considers the case when the user charges alone increase
by 2 percent on annual basis. These results show that even under conservative assumption of 2
percent increase in user charges, the returns to investment are positive with a benefit-cost ratio
above 1 and an Economic Rate of Return at 21 percent.

The rate of return on drainage investments estimated at the time of project development (as
presented in the PAD) used the beneficiaries’ willingness to pay measures. These estimates
yielded an Economic Rate of Return at 22 percent. This estimate also did not consider indirect
economic benefits such as savings in road maintenance costs and the environmental and health
benefits of improved drainage. Our estimates of the rates of return are very close the ex-ante
results reported in the PAD, although the methods used are different.

3.    Economic Analysis of Investment in Bus Terminals

Investments in bus terminals included redesign of the terminals to provide more bus bays, paving,
drainage, sites for ticket kiosks, passenger waiting areas, and other facilities. The benefits from
such investments in the bus terminals included improved traffic management, lower turnaround
times, and reduced congestion in and around terminal facilities, improved passenger access, and
better facilities for passengers.

3.1   Data and Methods

In order to compute the economic benefits from these investments, we estimated the savings in
vehicle operating costs for the buses operating in these terminals, and the savings from reduced
passenger travel time costs that result from reduced delays for the buses. In order to estimate the
benefits from the bus terminals, we used the methodology similar to the one used in the case of
investment in roads. Data on traffic volume at the terminals before and after investment, vehicle
operating costs with and without the investment, savings in travel times with the investment, and
other indirect savings are used to compute the benefits from the bus terminals.

a.     Costs, Benefits, and Economic efficiency

Economic analysis of the investment in the bus terminal in Mymensingh Pourashava was
conducted4. The total capital investment in the Bus Terminal was Taka 13.93 million over a
period of four years. In addition to the investment costs, the O&M costs and costs of repairs are
also considered (see section 2.1). Under the base case scenario, the user charges are assumed to

                                                       69
increase at an annual rate of 4 percent and the life of the investment is assumed to be 20 years
with necessary repairs every five years.

Measures of economic efficiency under a base case scenario and two alternative (sensitivity
analysis) scenarios are presented in the Table 3. The base case scenario assumes that the number
of buses using the improved bus terminal increases at an annual rate of 2 percent and the vehicles
and passengers will save their vehicle operating costs and travel expenses including reduced
travel times. The Internal Economic Rate of Return and the benefit-cost ratio under the above
base case scenario were 23 percent and 1.63, respectively. These results are comparable to the
estimated rates of return at project initiation presented in the PAD.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted under two alternative scenarios. The first scenario considers
the case when the number of vehicles using the improved terminal goes up at annual rate of 4
percent and the second scenario considers a more conservative case of one percent increase in
number of vehicles using the terminal.

The team only had sufficient data on one bus terminal constructed under Phase two of the project
to conduct economic analysis. The results suggest positive returns to investment in the terminal.

4.   Economic Analysis of Water Supply Investments

The project supported multiple investments in water supply sub-projects. The major water supply
investments involved replacement of existing wells, improvement of distribution systems,
replacement of pumps and motors, flow meters, steel hydrants, hand pumps, pipes and valves.
These investments improved the efficiency of water distribution systems and reduced water
losses and thus reduced non-revenue water. Thus, the benefits water supply investments are
increased efficiency of water supply systems, reduction in water losses, and thus increased
revenue from water distribution. Because the team did not have sufficient data to estimate the
benefits of the investments in water supply, it was not possible to attempt the economic analysis
for these investments.

5.   Fiscal Impact Analysis

The sustainability of the project depends on municipalities’ capacities to efficiently manage,
operate, and maintain the assets created under the project, to continue to deliver urban services,
and to mobilize local resources to finance these services. The project’s design required

                                                70
municipalities to prepare Financial and Operational Action Plans (FOAPs) as pre-requisites to
obtain project support for urban infrastructure. It is envisaged that the project and investments
will be sustainable with the firm commitment and ownership of the government and
municipalities in following the agreed FOAPs. Moreover, technical assistance related to
institutional and financial capacity improvement was also provided to the participating
municipalities to help ensure project sustainability. Finally, the participatory approach was used
to create a sense of “ownership? among stakeholders to help ensure project sustainability.

6.   Conclusion

The objectives of the project were to strengthen the institutional capacity of selected city
corporations and secondary towns to plan, finance, implement, operate, and maintain urban
infrastructure services in an efficient and sustainable manner; improve resource allocation and
financial discipline through the creation of an improved financing mechanism for urban
infrastructure; and reduce urban poverty and improve environmental conditions of urban
communities through financing of the critical urban infrastructure and services.

The civil works undertaken as part of the project related to water supply, drainage, small bore
sewerage systems, urban roads, sanitation, solid waste management, bus/ truck terminals,
markets, slum upgrading, landing ghats, twin pit latrines; water supply components, and flood
rehabilitation works of the urban infrastructures damaged in 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2007. As
such, the project helped improve deficient urban services by investing in physical infrastructure
and by strengthening the institutional and financial capacity of the participating municipalities.

The project also provided technical support to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity
of municipalities. The capacity building support included: (i) computerization and improved
management of Holding Tax bills and records, municipal accounts, water supply bills and
records, Trade License records; (iii) the development of an Infrastructure Inventory and
preparation of base maps; and (iii) support to community mobilization. In addition, the project
supported training (both classroom and hands-on) to municipal mayors, officers and staff on
procurement, engineering, accounting, and planning. The project also provided municipalities
with requisite hardware and equipment. All of these inputs resulted in significant improvement in
municipal service delivery, tax management, infrastructure planning, O&M, and computerized
records. As a result, the municipalities are now more efficient, effective, and sustainable.

Economic analysis of selected investments in roads, bus terminals, and roadside drainage
systems show that these investments were efficient with internal rates of return as high as around
30 percent. As the municipalities in Bangladesh were facing inadequate urban infrastructure
services, weak management and financial capacity of municipalities, fragmentation of urban
sector responsibilities and an increasing level of urban poverty and accompanying environmental
degradation Bank’s investment in this project is fully justified in the light of positive results of
the economic analysis of selected investments.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The following summarizes the findings from two evaluations involving qualitative analysis of
beneficiary and other stakeholder inputs.

In May 2012, the Municipal Support Unit (MSU) of the Municipal Services Project (MSP)
carried out a limited survey to determine the efficacy of the Municipal Capacity Building
Program (MCBP). The survey involved a set of questionnaires administered to mayors,
councilors, and paurashava staff (tax, water, trade license, accounting, and engineering sections)
and citizens that were involved in the MSU program. The rationale for the MCBP was to
improve the paurashavas’ revenue-collection capacities by automating their taxes, water supply
bills, trade licenses, and other relevant sections. The components of the MCBP included:

   Computerization and improved management of tax records;
   Computerization and improved management of accounting reports;
   Infrastructure database development and base map preparation; and
   Community mobilization support to municipalities.
   Computerization and improved management of water records; and
   Computerization and improved management of trade license records.
   Computerization of non-motorized vehicle.

Survey Highlights

2.1 Mayors (102) and Councilors (103): Nearly all mayors and councilors recognized an
increase in revenue income, development of their staff’s capacity and skill, improved service
delivery standard and increase in accountability and transparency. Only 2 mayors and 1
councilor said that they wanted to revert to the previous (manual) system.

Paurashava Staff

Tax Section (96 tax section staff interviewed): The majority of tax section staff indicated the
following:

       Tax demand-collection procedures have become easier (96%);
       Preparing tax billing is less time consuming (97%);
       Possible to deliver tax bills to taxpayers on time (92%);
       Transparency has increased due to collecting tax through banks (91%);
       Collection efficiency has increased (93%);
       Reports on tax demand-collection are easily available (94%); and
       Taxpayers are happy with computerized tax billing (91%).
       Efficiency has increased after using the tax billing software (99%).

Almost 40% of respondents reported that they were facing problems in using the new tax billing
software; 99% said that they would not want to revert to the old system.


                                               74
Water Section (57 water section staff interviewed): The majority of water section staff indicated
the following:

      Water demand-collection procedures have become easier (93%);
      It has been possible to prepare water billing in less time (93%);
      It has been possible to deliver water bills to customers on time (93%);
      Transparency has increased due to collecting water bills through banks (95%);
      Collection efficiency has increased (90%);
      Reports on water demand-collection are easily available (81%) and
      Customers are happy with computerized water billing (90%).

Although over 60% of respondents reported that they were facing problems in using the water
billing software, almost 100% (99%) said that they would not want to revert to the old systems of
water billing.

Trade License Section (69 trade license staff interviewed): The majority of trade license staff
indicated the following:

      Trade demand-collection procedures have become easier (74%);
      It has been possible to prepare license billing in less time (74%);
      It has been possible to deliver license bills to license holders on time (67%);
      Transparency has increased due to collecting license bill through banks (70%);
      License holders are happy with computerized trade licensing billing (67%).

According to the survey, 50% of respondents reported that they were facing problems using the
trade licensing software, but 96% said that they would not want to revert to old systems of trade
license billing.

Account Section (96 accounting staff interviewed): The majority of accounting staff indicated
the following:

      Transparency has increased or will increase in accounting (96%);
      Efficiency has increased after using the accounting software (97%);

Based on the survey, 93% of respondents said that they use the Municipal Accounting Software
(MAS); roughly the same percentage said that they did not want to revert to old systems of
accounts keeping.

2.3 Pourashava Citizens (93 citizens interviewed): The majority (95%) of the citizens surveyed
reported that they knew that LGED was helping their paurashava perform collection activities by
providing computers. The majority (90%) did receive computerized tax/water/trade license bills
from their pourashava and of these, all felt that this was convenient. The majority felt that:
     Bill payment through the banks is a good venture (99%);
     Banking transactions will bring transparency (100%);

                                               75
       Quick service delivery will be possible if all paurashava functions are performed through
        computers (99%).

Summary of Findings

The survey demonstrated that nearly all respondents – the paurashava authority, paurashava staff
and citizens – consider the MCRP to be a well-timed program with beneficial effects.
Participating paurashavas do not want to return to manual systems and now additional
paurashavas want to be included in the program. The paurashavas also indicated that they would
want to the program to continue (through LGED).

The paurashava holding tax revenue collection efficiency figures show that positive changes
occurred in 80 paurashavas, negative changes in 18 paurashavas, and no change in only 2 out of
100 paurashavas after post computerization.

Water billing revenue collection efficiency figures have also improved in 34 pourashavas (out of
a total of 48 pourashavas).

Before computerization, there was no infrastructure database or base maps in any of the
paurashavas. Now there are 105 complete databases and 79 complete base maps; 12 partially
complete databases and 22 partially complete base maps in 133 paurashavas.

Before the MSP, there was very little community-related support for paurashavas. Citizens’
awareness campaigns, formation of Town Level Coordination Committee, Ward Level
Coordination Committee, and Community Based Organizations started first under the MCBP.

Finally, the majority of respondents believed that they had no opportunity for training before the
program. The MSU initiated comprehensive professional improvement training programs for
paurashava employees in addition to core trainings (e.g. basic computer training, software
operation and maintenance training, field survey training, etc.). Through the program, the MSU
provided:

       4,472 days of core training (e.g. basic computer training on tax, accounts, water, trade
        license; software operation training; four-day initial survey training, etc.) for 864
        employees in 50 new paurashavas.
       2,169 days of refresher training for 225 employees in 130 old paurashavas.
       3,810 days of additional training (e.g. quality control and supervision, double entry
        accounting, orientation on software, etc.) for 876 employees.

If there had been more time, a more comprehensive survey would have ensured a higher pool of
respondents. However, the trends suggest that mayors, councilors, pourashava staff and citizens
all perceive the MCBP to have significantly enhanced their municipality’s ability to collect taxes,
water bills and trade licenses; improved transparency; and increased overall efficiency.

Impact Evaluation

The following is a short summary of the findings and lessons from a qualitative evaluation study
entitled ‘Impact Evaluation of Six Project Municipalities?. The study was financed and
commissioned by the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund and conducted by the
Development Support Link (DSL) from June 1-30, 2007.

At the time, BMDF had financed 100 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and, upon successful
completion of the first phase of the project, 13 ULBs were approved to implement the second
phase development activities. The objective of the evaluation was to assess the impacts of
specific phase I project components in six municipalities (Narsingdi, Noapara, Chapai
Nawabganj, Gazipur, Meherpur, Choumuhani).

Methodology

The six municipalities were selected by BMDF to ensure geographic variation. All major
stakeholders, including project beneficiaries, local elite, NGO officials, ward commissioners,
retailers, and buyers were represented. The methodologies used for collecting data and
information included:

      Literature Review – reviewing secondary sources of information such as project
       documents, sub-project appraisal report, MIS/performance data, etc.;
      Focus Group Discussions;
      Key Informant Interviews – with local elite and members of civil society;
      SWOT Analysis; and
      Observation – key service facilities created, developed or renovated.

The Field Research Officers (FROs) and Field Coordinator (FC) participated in a two-day
training on the questionnaires and methodology of the evaluation study. There were three
separate questionnaires targeting three separate groups: (a) civil society doctor, teacher, NGO
official, ward commissioner, deed writer; (b) market wholesalers, retailers, and buyers; and (c)
beneficiaries. The FROs and FC were also provided an observation checklist for the impact
evaluation study.

Findings

The following summarizes the main findings of the study. The municipalities included in the
evaluation of each of the key findings are indicated next to each project component.

Roads – (all six select municipalities)
    ‘Good’ – no water logging, no mud;
    Road widened with footpath – pedestrian mobility increased, more transport on road;
    Increase in employment;
    Increase in enrollment in schools and colleges;
    Increase in land value, with the highest values along the road;


                                              77
          o Narsingdi: Increase to Taka 30,000 to 60,000, depending on the distance to the
            road.
          o Noapara: Increase to Taka 15,000 to 30,000. Several respondents indicated that
            the increase in land value might not have been attributable to road improvements
            only since land values had been increasing on their own.
          o Chapai Nawabganj: Increase to Taka 5,000 to 20,000. The majority of
            respondents said that the percent increase in land values had increased once roads
            were improved.
          o Gazipur: Increase to Taka 20,000 to 70,000. All respondents reported that land
            values increased on both sides of improved roads.
          o Meherpur: Increase to Taka 30,000 to 50,000.
          o Choumuhani: Increase to Taka 70,000 to 100,000.

      Easy movement of patients;
      Decrease in transportation cost of both people and goods in some places and increased
       cost in other places;
      Increase in volume of trade and business; and
      No one was displaced and no adverse ecological/environmental impact.

Drains – (Narsingdi, Chapai Nawabganj, Gazipur, Meherpur, Choumuhani)

      Water does not clog, water logging has declined;
      Generally, bad odor does not spread;
      In some places, mosquitos have increased but they have decreased overall. Incidences of
       malaria and dengue have also decreased;
      Water flows away easily – garbage is often piled up to hinder the flow of water;
      Improved environmental conditions; and
      No loss of land by individuals – increase in land value.

Public Toilet – (Chapai Nawabganj)

      Many knew about the public toilets in the municipality;
      Decrease in indiscriminate defecation and urination;
      Decrease in odor from roadside open latrines and urinals;
      Decrease in air pollution;
      Decrease in incidence of intestinal diseases;
      Overall improvement in environment; and
      Quality of toilet ranges between ‘good’ and ‘moderately good’ – water supply in toilet is
       through a piped supply system.

Kitchen Market: (Meherpur)

      Permanent shops have been built;
      No risk of being soaked in the rain or of losing any goods;
      Increase in supply of goods and commodities;

                                               78
      Buying and selling continue until late at night – volume of trade has increased;
      Increase in employment opportunities;
      Decline in bad odor;
      Improved kitchen market drainage and environmental conditions;
      Market is not large enough, resulting in congestion of buyer and sellers and leaving
       inadequate space for farmers to stockpile goods; and
      Mosquitos breed in the market drains.

Water Supply (pipeline and production tube well): (Meherpur)

      The majority of people drink from the water supply;
      Water quality is “moderately good? to “very good?;
      No reported arsenic content;
      Source of supply water is production tube well; and
      Decrease in incidences of water-borne diseases.

Key Recommendations

Based on the findings of this limited evaluation, the main recommendations included the
following:

      Roads and drains should be improved before all other improvements (water supply,
       public toilets, kitchen market, etc.) are made to maximize benefits.
      The development work, especially the work on the drains, should have been supported by
       an awareness campaign on proper solid waste disposal to avoid blocking drains.
      In addition to the awareness campaigns, local level committees should be formed to help
       raise awareness about the importance of the project components to development goals
       and to improving environmental conditions.
      Release of funds should be expedited to ensure a timely start to the work.

Summaries of Project Completion Reports Prepared by LGED and BMDF

LGED: Phase I of Municipal Services Project

1.1 Background

Bangladesh experienced the highest growth rate in Asia, a growth rate of about 4.2% per annum,
during the last decade of 20th century. At that time, the urban population was estimated to be
about 25 million, or roughly 20% of the total national population of about 120 million. Although
this rapid urbanization was mainly limited to the four metropolitan cities of Dhaka, Chittagong,
Khulna, Rajshahi, the smaller municipalities also started experiencing high growth rates. As a
result, the GOB’s interventions had sought to both prevent the deterioration of service delivery in
larger cities and forestall service deterioration in rapidly growing secondary cities. The main
issues facing the urban sector in Bangladesh were (i) inadequate urban infrastructure services,
fueled by rapid urban growth; (ii) weak financial and management capacity of municipalities;
and (iii) an increasing level of urban poverty and environmental degradation. In the above
circumstances, the GOB requested the World Bank to provide financing for a feasibility study in
support of the Municipal Services Project (hereafter referred to as “MSP?).

Accordingly, in 1993, the GOB approved a Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (TA credit
No. 2393 BD) for a Municipal Services Project (MSP). Under the TA, Mott Macdonald Ltd.,
Louis Burger International Inc., Engineering and Planning Consultants LTD, AQUA Consultant
& Associates Ltd. Consultant & Associates Ltd. undertook a detailed feasibility study for
preparing the MSP. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) of the Local
Government Division under M/O LGRD & Co-operatives, acted as the Executing Agency (EA)
for the TA project.

Two City Corporations (Khulna & Rajshahi) and 14 Pourashavas (Mongla, Satkhira, Narail,
Chuadanga, Patuakhali, Pirojepur, Gopalgonj, Dinajpur, Sayedpur, Nilphamari, Parbattipur,
Kurigram, Joypurhat, Naogaon) were selected based on pre-specified criteria for inclusion in the
MSP.

IDA fielded the Pre-appraisal Mission and the Appraisal Mission on the MSP in March and in
June-July of 1998, respectively. During the negotiation of the project it was agreed that three
Chittagong Hill Tracts Pourashavas (Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban) would be included
in the project. These three pourashavas were selected because they had so far lagged behind
other municipalities in service provision and urban development.

In September and October of 1998, the country was severely affected by a devastating flood,
resulting in heavy damage to urban infrastructure. During project negotiation, IDA agreed to
include a “Flood Damage Rehabilitation? component in the MSP to finance the rehabilitation
efforts of all the municipalities that had been affected by the 1998 flood.




                                                80
Negotiation for the credit of the project was held at the World Bank, in Washington D.C. from
December 14, 1998 to December 18, 1998. The credit agreement was signed on April 26, 1999
with the date of effectiveness for the credit set for October 25, 1999. The Project Concept Paper
(PCP) was discussed in an Inter-ministerial Meeting (Pre-ECNEC) on December 03, 1998.
Subsequently, the PCP was approved in the ECNEC meeting held on March 03, 1999. The 1st
and the 2nd revised PPs were approved by ECNEC on May 29, 2002 and December 12, 2005
respectively and the 3rd one was approved in ECNEC meeting on January 30, 2008.

During the execution of the project, a second devastating flood resulted in acute damage in the
southwestern part of the country in 2000. Upon the consent of the World Bank the Flood
Disaster Relief (FDR) component was expanded to incorporate the FDR 2000 to restore
communication and transportation networks in the affected pourashavas. After a third flood, in
2004, the World Bank allocated an additional US $26 million, which was also incorporated in
this project. After a fourth flood, in 2007, the World Bank provided an additional US $25 million.

1.2 Justification/Adequacy

Urban services improved substantially through the MSP due to investment in physical
infrastructure, institutional strengthening, investment in improving the financial capacity of
municipalities, and provision of technical support to municipalities. Sector issues addressed by
the project include: (i) urgent need for basic services, particularly in low-income areas, addressed
through implementation of the physical investment program in the project; (ii) weak local
government institutions, addressed through the provision of technical assistance to improve the
institutional and financial capacity of municipalities; (iii) improved sustainability to service
provision through the involvement of the community and other stakeholders, addressed through a
participatory and partnership approach.

In 1999, an Urban Management Policy Statement was issued by the Local Government Division,
which stated the GOB’s policy and principles towards urban management. A Municipal
Performance Review Committee (MPRC) was established at the ministry level, chaired by the
Secretary of the Local Government Division, to support institutional development efforts. The
project also supported institutional development through the creation and operation of Municipal
Support Unit (MSU). It provided technical assistance and training for the development of
management information systems and revenue enhancement measures in municipalities and city-
corporations. The capacity building support included (i) computerization and improved
management of Holding Tax bills and records, municipal accounts, water supply bills and
records, and Trade License records; (ii) development of Infrastructure Inventory and preparation
of base maps; and (iii) community mobilization support.

The establishment of the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund (BMDF) was one of the
most important components of MSP. BMDF was established as an independent entity under the
Company Act 1994, administered by the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance.

The project’s coverage of basic service provision, institutional strengthening, establishment of
new financing mechanism, and policy reform make it a unique and justified project.



                                                81
1.3 Objectives

The principal objective of the project was to improve environmental conditions, physical
infrastructure and municipal service delivery. The specific objectives of the project were to:

   Strengthen the institutional capacity of selected city corporations and secondary towns to
    plan, finance, implement, operate, and maintain urban infrastructure services in an efficient
    and sustainable manner;
   Improve resource allocation and financial discipline through the creation of an improved
    financing mechanism for urban infrastructure; and
   Reduce urban poverty and improve environmental conditions of urban communities through
    financing of the critical urban infrastructure and services.

1.4 Project Revisions

Reasons for First Revision

1. The original Project Concept Paper (PCP) and Project Paper (PP) were prepared on the basis
of Draft Project Appraisal Document (PAD). During the Credit Negotiation some changes were
made that include mainly (i) increased scope of physical works, and (ii) increased amount of
IDA credit.

2. The project did not become effective until October 1999, despite the fact that the feasibility
study was completed in 1995. Due to this long gap, during field verification, the consultants
found that many of the originally recommended schemes had either already been implemented
by the City Corporations/Pourashavas with alternative source of financing, or the scope of works
had changed considerably. In view of this, there was a need for re-selection of some new
schemes.

3. During Credit Negotiation, upon a request from the GOB, a flood (1998) rehabilitation
component with an IDA credit allocation of $16.2 million USD was included in the project for
which, at that point of time, no assessment was in place. After the commencement of the project,
a substantial amount of time was required by the consultant to carry out the country-wide flood-
damage assessment task.

4. During Credit Negotiation, upon a request from the GOB, three pourashavas of the Chittagong
Hill Tracts region were included in the project. At that time, the scope of work was not defined.
Afterwards, the feasibility study and identification of schemes in these pourashavas were carried
out through a participatory and partnership approach (PPA).

5. There had been some modifications as regards to the structure, tires, and positions in the MSU
through amendment of the DCA.

6. To address the above issues, the first revision of the project was made and subsequently
approved by the ECNEC on May 29, 2002. During this revision the benefit due to variation in
the exchange-rate was also taken into account.

                                               82
Reasons for Second Revision

1. One of the most important components of the MSP was the establishment of the Bangladesh
Municipal Development Fund (BMDF). The BMDF was incorporated as an independent entity,
under the Companies Act 1994. In the original DCA, the allocation of IDA portion of the credit
to “BMDF? and “Other than BMDF portion (i.e. LGED portion)? was not shown separately. The
DCA was later amended to separate out the allocation for these two components. This was the
prime reason of second revision.

2. The south-western region of the country was seriously affected by flood in 2000. To
rehabilitate the damaged structures, following consent from the World Bank, the US$4.5 million
was reallocated within the MSP budget. This Rehabilitation works had also been included in the
2nd revision.

3. Following the decision of the Local Government Division and subsequent consent from the
World Bank towards the government’s “Total Sanitation Program,? three pourashavas of
Chittagong Hill Tracts region were incorporated in this project.

4. A portion of flood (2004) damage rehabilitation works for the affected pourashavas was
included in this project. The World Bank allocated US$26 million for this rehabilitation works.

5. Some adjustments of physical and financial targets had been made on the basis of actual
requirement and also in light of the agreements reached with the World Bank supervision
missions from time to time.

6. The advantage out of variation in exchange-rate was taken into account.

Reasons for Third Revision

1. The World Bank agreed to provide US$27 million for rehabilitation of a portion of the
municipal infrastructures damaged by the 2007 flood. Following a number of meetings between
the World Bank and GOB (ERD), it was decided to channel this assistance through the ongoing
MSP so that the rehabilitation work could start quickly. This was the prime reason for the third
revision.

2. Out of the total World Bank assistance of US$27 million for the Flood Damage Rehabilitation
(FDR) 2007 component, US$25 million of additional financing was added to the MSP and US$2
million was reallocated within the MSP (as per decision between ERD and World Bank). Some
internal adjustment was necessary in order to make US$2 million available from within MSP,
another major reason for this proposed revision. In addition, some adjustments to the physical
and financial targets were made on the basis of actual requirements. The variation in exchange
rate was not taken into account.




                                               83
2.1 Project Rationale

The Physical Planning, Water Supply and Housing (PPWS&H) Sector of the Planning
Commission of Bangladesh covers a broad range of activities, which include:

   Delivery of basic services to the Pourashavas, including slum dwellers;
   Provision of safe drinking water, sewerage, and sanitation facilities;
   Development of basic infrastructure and services;
   Combating environmental degradation.

Therefore, the civil work activities undertaken within the Municipal Services Project – related to
water supply; drainage; small bore sewerage system; urban roads; sanitation; solid waste
management; bus/ truck terminals; markets; slum upgrading; landing ghats; twin pit latrine;
water supply components; and flood rehabilitation works of the urban infrastructures damaged in
1998, 2000, 2004, and 2007 – were very much in line with Sector activities.

The project also helped improve deficient urban services by investing in physical infrastructure
and by strengthening institutional and financial capacity of municipalities. Sector issues
addressed by the project include:

   Urgent need for basic services, particularly in low-income areas, through the implementation
    of the physical investment program in the project;
   Weak local government institutions through provision of technical assistance to improve the
    institutional and financial capacity of municipalities;
   Improved service provision sustainability by engaging community and stakeholder
    involvement through a participatory and partnership approach.

Moreover, the rehabilitation program mainly covered the smaller pourashavas, which typically
have a greater majority of poor or low income residents. Restoration of transport networks and
commercial facilities had a great impact on employment and was crucial to restoring their
livelihood. In addition, the improvements in the drainage system and water supply had a
considerable impact on improving general environmental conditions and pourashava residents’
health and well-being.

The project also provided technical support to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity
of municipalities. The capacity building support included: (i) computerization and improved
management of Holding Tax bills and records, municipal accounts, water supply bills and
records, Trade License records; (iii) the development of an Infrastructure Inventory and
preparation of base maps; and (iii) support to community mobilization. In addition, the project
supported training (both classroom and hands-on) to municipal mayors, officers and staff on
procurement, engineering, accounting, planning etc. The project also provided municipalities
with requisite hardware and equipment. All these inputs resulted in significant improvement in
municipal service delivery, tax management, infrastructure planning, O&M, and computerized
records. As a result, the municipalities are now more efficient, effective and sustainable.



                                               84
3. Project Identification

A detailed feasibility study was carried out and supported through the Project Preparatory
Technical Assistance. The locations of the project were identified based on specific criteria,
including population growth rate, economic growth potential, present deficiencies, local
institutional and financial capacity, and potential for growth in local revenues.

An IDA Project Preparation Mission visited Bangladesh in September and October of 1997. It
was then decided that the schemes identified in the feasibility study would be included in the
project, provided that the selected municipalities met the criteria for economic, financial, and
administrative feasibility, and were committed to improving O&M and financial management
capacity.

3.1 Project Preparation

In 1993, the GOB approved a Project Preparatory Technical Assistance under TA credit No.-
2393 BD for the Municipal Services Project (MSP). Under this TA, a detailed feasibility study
was undertaken in preparation for the MSP. The study examined several indicators – including
population growth rate, economic growth potential, present deficiencies, local institutional and
financial capacity, and potential for growth in local revenues as well as to establish specific
selection criteria for project locations. Two City Corporations (Khulna and Rajshahi) and
fourteen pourashavas (Mongla, Satkhira, Narail, Chuadanga, Patuakhali, Pirojepur, Gopalgonj,
Dinajpur, Sayedpur, Nilphamari, Parbattipur, Kurigram, Joypurhat, Naogaon) were selected
based on the criteria. During the appraisal in June and July of 1998, three Chittagong Hill Tracts
Pourashavas (Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban) were also included in the project.

Credit negotiations took place during December 14-18, 1998 but a credit agreement was not
reached until April 26, 1999. The credit became effective on October 25, 1999, with a loan
disbursement of SDR 76.190 million. The conditions of the loan were:

   Commitment charge at a rate of 0.5% per annum on the principal amount of the Credit.
   Service charge at a rate of 0.75% per annum on the principal amount of the Credit.
   Commitment charges and Service charges are due on February 1 and August 1 of each year.
   Grace period of 5 years.
   Payment of the principal amount of the Credit will be through semiannual installments on
    February 1 and August 1 starting from August 1, 2009 and ending on February 1, 2039.

3.3 Project Approval

The Project Concept Paper (PCP) was prepared and discussed in an Inter-ministerial Meeting
(Pre-ECNEC) on December 03, 1998. Subsequently, the PCP was approved in the ECNEC
meeting held on March 03, 1999. The 1st and the 2nd revised Project Papers were approved by
ECNEC on May 29, 2002 and December 12, 2005, respectively. The 3rd revision was approved
in ECNEC meeting on January 30, 2008.



                                               85
4. Project Evaluation

Understanding of Beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of the project do not have a detailed
understanding of the overall objective of the project but do understand the benefits of reduced
transportation cost, better marketing facilities, improved solid waste management, sanitation, and
water supply. They also clearly experience the benefits of the municipalities’ computerized
billing systems.

Direct and Indirect Impacts. The impacts of the project can be organized into direct and indirect
impacts. Direct impacts include improvements in urban service delivery and institutional
strengthening and capacity building of the City Corporations and Pourashavas. The indirect
impacts of the project include an urban environment, better health and higher employment
generation. In addition, given that the project was jointly implemented by LGED and
participating municipalities/City-Corporations with assistance from high level consultants (both
foreign and local), it has familiarized municipal staff with advanced methodology and techniques
of civil works.

Technology Transfer: Computer software developed under the project regarding holding tax,
water billing, trade license, non-motorized vehicle management etc. was transferred to
participating City Corporations and Pourashavas.

Employment Generation. 1.35 million employment days were generated during project
implementation. Maintenance and operation activities create additional long-term employment
opportunities.

Possibility of self-employment: The project created the potential for self-employment through the
improvement of kitchen markets, mini super market, bus/truck terminals, and landing ghats.

Employment opportunities for women: During the operation of various facilities created under
the project (like kitchen market, bus/truck terminal, public toilets, and solid waste management),
it is expected that there will be increased opportunity for women’s employment. Moreover, in the
long run, women could be employed in the maintenance works.

Women’s participation in development: The selection of sub-projects adopted a participatory
approach to ensure participation by both men and women.

Probable Impact on Socio-Economic activity: The project achieved several socioeconomic
benefits. Construction of roads and culverts ensure better accessibility and a decrease in vehicle
operating costs and incidence of road accidents. It also increases the opportunities of small
business and auto rickshaw driving, health care and schooling facilities. Drains constructed
through the project improved wastewater disposal and the environment. Public toilets and the
solid waste components also contributed to improvement of the urban environment. Construction
of bus/truck terminals increase the number of passengers and cargos in road transportation and
create opportunities for increased income from driving, business and other related services. The
slum development component improved living conditions and service delivery and increased
employment potential in the slums. Furthermore, institutional strengthening measures increased

                                               86
revenue generation and enabled the urban local bodies to better implement and maintain urban
infrastructure facilities. Finally, the establishment of the Bangladesh Municipal Development
Fund reduced the dependence of ULBs on Central Government.

Impact on environment: Avoidance and mitigation measures were incorporated in sub-project
designing and bidding documents to reduce environmental impacts. Improved solid waste
management and provision of public toilets have substantial improved environmental conditions
and public health. Provision of cross- and storm-water drainage also reduced water-logging,
which has also improved the environmental situation.

Sustainability of the project: The sustainability of the project depends on municipalities’
capacities to efficiently manage, operate and maintain the assets have been created under the
project, to continue to deliver urban services, and to mobilize local resources to finance these
services. The project’s design involved preparation of financial and operational action plans as
pre-requisites to help ensure sustainability. Moreover, technical assistance, related to institutional
and financial capacity improvement, was also provided to the participating municipalities to help
ensure project sustainability. Finally, the participatory approach was used to create a sense of
‘ownership’ among stakeholders to help ensure project sustainability.

Contribution to poverty alleviation/reduction: Poverty alleviation has been partially addressed
through investment in physical infrastructure, including: (a) water supply; (b) drainage; (c) urban
roads; (d) sanitation; (e) solid waste management; (f) bus and truck terminals; (g) markets; (h)
slum upgrading; (i) landing ghat; (j) twin pit latrine; (k) water supply components; and (l)
rehabilitation works of the urban infrastructures damaged in the 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2007
floods. The productivity of the city population, particularly of the poor, has significantly
increased as a consequence of better living environment and better public health. The civil works
components of the project also created employment opportunities for the poor.

5. Problems Encountered During Implementation

Procurement: All procurement was subject to compliance with the World Bank Procurement
Guidelines. The municipal authorities’ lack of familiarity with the Guidelines resulted in
deviations in procurement that ultimately led to cancellation of bids and re-bids. The problem
was overcome through orientation workshops and training on the Guidelines.

Natural calamity: During implementation, the project faced three severe floods (2000, 2004, and
2007) that damaged much of the infrastructure built under the project. These were rehabilitated
through incorporation of additional financing for Flood Damage Rehabilitation Programs.

Design formulation/ approval: The project was approved in 1999, two years after it had been
designed. As a result of the long time lapse, some of the road schemes proposed in the feasibility
report were no longer valid because they had been built or rehabilitated with other sources of
funding. The issue was resolved by revising the scheme list in consultation with municipal
authorities. In addition, the scope of the FDR 1998 works and three CHT municipalities was not
included in the feasibility report. These two major components were included during credit
negotiation of the project. As a result, it was not possible to start these two components

                                                 87
immediately after the approval of the project. The schemes were adapted with the help of the
D&S Consultant and by engaging the community through the Participatory and Partnership
Approach (PPA) .

Time and Cost Over-run: There was a 150% increase in time and a 23% increase in overall cost
compared to the original project cost and time due to inclusion of additional resources to
rehabilitate the infrastructures damaged by Flood 2000, 2004, and 2007.

6. Remarks and Recommendations of the Project Director

The project has been completed successfully within the GOB approved time (June 2010) though
the IDA credit is still alive (credit closing: June 2011). During implementation, the project
received an excellent level of co-operation and support from both the World Bank and GOB
entities like the Planning Commission, IMED, Finance Division, Local Government Division,
and participating urban local governments.

Through the investment program, the municipalities received invaluable support to
improve/rehabilitate their infrastructure, including services to the urban poor. Establishment of
the BMDF introduced a new financing mechanism for municipal infrastructure. The technical
assistance packages brought remarkable changes in municipal management in terms of
computerization, skills enhancement, and logistical support. Many of the municipal staff, both
engineering and non-engineering, received formal training from this project for the first time.
The FDR programs were extremely helpful for the 204 municipalities (most of them are smaller
and weaker) who could not rehabilitate the damage infrastructures without project support. The
majority of the smaller municipalities received project support for the first time.

All of the above-mentioned activities were carried out well, and resulted in significant benefits as
well as strong demand for additional support. Therefore, scaling up and replication of similar
activities through new projects/programs are essential. To properly maintain the infrastructure
developed through this project, it is critical for the municipalities to mobilize more local
resources and for the central government to provide more support, particularly to the smaller and
institutionally weaker municipalities.

7. Remarks and Comments of Agency Head

The MSP is one of the main World Bank-assisted projects in the urban sector that has been
successfully completed within the approved time giving remarkable benefits to the selected
municipalities and city-corporations as well as the city dwellers. In the context of continuing
rapid urbanization, similar projects/programs need to be undertaken.

LGED: Additional Financing Cr. No. 4761 BD

1.1 Background

In view of the successes and significant benefits of the main MSP (Cr 3177, and 3177-1), and
also considering the large unmet demands, there was a request from the GoB to the World Bank
to provide financial support for another investment project MSP-II. In response to the request an
additional financing (Cr. No. 4761) amounting to US$42.0 million was arranged by the World
Bank to:

   Continue infrastructure building support through Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund
    (BMDF);
   Continue capacity building support through Municipal Support Unit (MSU), created in
    LGED under MSP; and
   Prepare a follow-on project.

Out of the total additional financing, US$37.9 million was allocated to BMDF to finance pre-
apprised urban infrastructures. The remaining US$4.1 million was allocated to LGED to extend
the ongoing municipal capacity strengthening program from 92 municipalities to 142
municipalities, and to prepare a follow-on project.

This report covers only the LGED part.

The government approved a separate Technical Assistance Project (TAP) for LGED portion
(US$4.1 million) with a time period January 2011 to December 2012. Officially, the TAP is still
‘on-going’ as per the government’s Annual Development Program (ADP 2012-13), although the
credit was closed on June 30, 2012. Because the TAP is on-going, the GOB’s official Project
Completion Report (PCR) will be prepared after December 2012. However this report is to be
considered as ‘final’ for the ICR Mission because there will not be any additional project
activities after June 30, 2012.

1.2 Objectives

   Help the urban local governments in the field of institutional development and capacity
    building; and
   Support the preparation of a follow-on project.

2. Expected Output

Capacity Building and Institutional Development
 Computerization of tax records, accounts records and water billing in 50 more municipalities
   (in addition to present coverage – 92 municipalities);
 Computerized inventory and mapping of municipal infrastructure in 50 more municipalities
   (in addition to present coverage – 92 municipalities);



                                               89
   Improved institutional capacity and management reform in 50 more municipalities (in
    addition to present coverage – 92 municipalities) with expected increase in tax collections;
    and
   Increased number of trained municipal staff (from 7,405 to 8,400)

3. Preparing a Follow-on Project

   Module A: An improved framework for selecting, designing, and implementing priority
    interventions for municipal development;
   Module B: Infrastructure and institutional development programs for different types of urban
    development situations in a sample of about 20-25 municipalities; and
   Module C: Detailed plans for infrastructure and institutional development subprojects in
    about 25 towns for initial implementation.

4. Progress

Capacity Building and Institutional Development activities (training + equipment + logistics) in
50 municipalities have been done as planned.

       Allocation             : $1.60 million USD
       Actual expenditure     : $1.54 million USD

In preparing a follow-on project, it was initially planned that it will be carried out through three
(3) separate modules. Later, in view of the limited time, ‘Module C’ was merged with ‘Module B’
in consultation with the World Bank. Accordingly, the scope of works of the new ‘Module B’
was revised.

Module A was delivered with three outputs: (a) ‘Analysis of Issues and Options’, (b) Advisory
Notes to the Government, (c) Urban Development Program Guidelines. Module B was delivered
with two outputs: (a) Municipal Development Plans for 25 towns, and (b) Sub-project Feasibility
Reports of 25 towns for initial investment. The works of the two modules have been completed.

Module A:

       Allocation             : $0.30 million USD
       Actual expenditure     : $0.29 million USD

Module B:

       Allocation             : $1.60 million USD
       Actual expenditure     : $1.18 million USD

[Note: the expenditure was less than the allocation due to the reduced scope of work after
merging Module B and C.]



                                                90
Related to Incremental Operating Cost:

       Allocation            : $0.60 million USD
       Actual expenditure    : $0.14 million USD

[The expenditure was less than the allocation because expenditures against some of the staff-
positions in the MSU were borne by the Asian Development Bank.]

   Improve resource allocation and fiscal discipline; and
   Support government efforts to reduce urban poverty and conserve urban environment.

1.2 ULB Selection Criteria

   Availability of skilled engineers and accountants;
   Rate of collection of tax is at least 65% at the minimum;
   Initiative for preparation of Master Plan/ Detail Area Plan (DAP); and

1.3 Eligible Sectors for Funding: roads, drains, sanitation, municipal solid waste management,
office complexes, traffic management, water supply, bus and truck terminals, kitchen markets,
children parks, community centers, and street lighting.

1.4 Project Development
 The BMDF developed an assessment based on the demand for infrastructure improvements
    by the ULBs;
 BMDF prepared the Preliminary Development Project Proforma (PDPP);
 BMDF processed the PDPP through the World Bank and the Financial Institutions Division
    of the Ministry of Finance;
 The World Bank and the Financial Institutions Division forwarded the PDPP to the Ministry
    of Planning for administrative approval;
 Once the PDPP was approved by the Ministry of Planning, it was forwarded to the Economic
    Relations Division (ERD), which searched for donors;
 ERD formally approved the PDPP and sought financial and technical assistance from
    development partners of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB);
 Once the fund was assured, a formal agreement was signed between ERD (on behalf of
    GOB) and the respective development partner/donor;
 A second formal agreement was signed between the World Bank, the Financial Institutions
    Division and BMDF;
 The development partner/donor released fund according to the terms and conditions laid
    down in the agreement.

1.5 Sub-Project Development
 The BMDF invited appraisal proposals from the ULBs for sub-projects. At the same time, it
    hired consultants through an open tender process;
 BMDF reviewed and adjusted the appraisal reports;
 Participating ULBs opened an escrow account with a scheduled bank and deposited 10% of
    the total sub-project costs as a matching contribution;

                                               92
   The BMDF and each municipality made an agreement in a prescribed manner;
   The ULB invited open tenders for a bid to work under Public Procurement Rules and World
    Bank guidelines;
   The tender documents were examined and evaluated by ULB level committees;
   If approved by the committee, the Bid Evaluation Report (BER) was forwarded to BMDF;
   The World Bank and/or BMDF examined the BER to ensure compliance with all legal
    requirements;
   If found acceptable, BMDF sent the bid documents back to the ULB to make a Contract
    Agreement with the Contractor performing the work;
   Development work in the field was supervised by municipal engineers, with some assistance
    from hired consultants;
   The contractors were paid on the recommendation of the consultants after satisfaction of the
    BMDF.

The Mayors of each ULB acted as Project Managers for all civil works in their area. They were
responsible for maintaining all records of the project implementation process and anything
related to financial matters. Supervision, quality control, bill checking, and recommendation for
payment were carried out through outsourcing. BMDF officials visited the sites regularly to
monitor the progress of work as per the schedule and specification.

1.6 Financing Policy: 85% of BMDF funding is grant-based whereas the remaining 15% is
dispersed as loans. The financing policy of BMDF is unique in nature. The GOB receives loans
from its development partners through a standard bilateral agreement in which the Economic
Relations Division represents the GoB. Then BMDF goes for a subsequent agreement with the
GoB, calling it Subsidiary Loan and Grant Agreement. BMDF reviews the appraisal reports of
the ULBs and then allocates fund to the ULBs while taking into consideration the amount of
grant and the demand of the ULB. The sub-project packages constitute a blend of grants (76.5%),
loans (13.5%), and the municipality's own contribution (10.0%) for any infrastructural project.

In order to start a project, 10% of the project cost has to be deposited as a matching contribution
with an escrow account, which is to be operated by the recipient ULB. BMDF bears the
remaining 90% of the project cost. Of this 90%, 85% is given as a grant and 15% is given as a
loan to the ULB. BMDF transfers money to the escrow account against the bill(s) of work
submitted by the recipient ULB for payment to the contractors. The recipient ULB is committed
to repaying the loan in 37 installments with a one-year grace period, thereby paying off the entire
loan in 10 years. The repayment of ULBs to BMDF is satisfactory.

2.1 Implementation

BMDF successfully completed 454 and 141 sub-projects under IDA credit Nos. 3177-BD and
4761-BD, respectively, with allocations of US$63 million and US$40 million, respectively. The
combined loan total of US$103 million covered 595 sub-projects in 154 ULBs, including seven
City Corporations. The BMDF also completed a study on municipal solid waste management in
four cities.


                                                93
BMDF took advantage of an unexpected change in the conversion rate when the US$1 rose from
BDT 69 (2010) to BDT (Bangladeshi Taka) 79.95 (2012), the year of receiving the allocation
under Cr. No 4761-BD by immediately implementing 17 subprojects with the money saved.

100% works under Cr. No. 3177-BD were completed but a portion of the Lama Water Treatment
Plant was carried over to, and completed under, Cr. No 4761-BD. Of the US$63 million allotted
under Cr. No 3177-BD, only about US$61.25 million was disbursed. Of the US$38.5 million
allotted under Cr. No 4761-BD, roughly US$38.25 million was disbursed.

Financial and Operational Action Plans (FOAPs) were prepared for 154 ULBs, for improving
their financial and operational management.

The following table describes the output of the work carried out through the BMDF.

                                Component-wise volume of work:

                        Buildings

2.2 Operational Experience

The ULBs required technical staff to help implement subprojects under the BMDF. Those with
previous experience working on BMDF projects were very effective because they understood the
standard required by BMDF for implementing projects under a World Bank credit. Unfortunately,
not all ULBs had technical staff with previous experience with BMDF. Thus, BMDF tried to
improve awareness of the BMDF standard by training field engineers during the initial stage of
project implementation.

A training module was developed and supplemented by lectures by professionals in the
respective fields, including World Bank experts. The training substantially improved the
understanding of the field engineers.


                                              94
The LGED also facilitated training for ULB accountants and finance officers to ensure that the
fund dispersals were in accordance to financial guidelines. The training module was based on the
requirements in the Financial and Operational Action Plan (FOAP), which was part of the
agreement between the BMDF and ULBs. The LGED shared knowledge with the BDF to
improve the design of the training module. The training helped the ULB account offices deal
with financial matters as required by IDA.

The process of hiring consultants also resulted in setbacks to the project. In some cases,
consulting firms paid consultants only half of what had been originally advertised, usually
because the consultants were unqualified. Given the short project cycles of subprojects, it did not
make sense to fire and hire new consultants so agencies dealt with inadequately qualified
consultants. The problem was further exacerbated when several field level consultants left during
the final phases, leaving no time to fill these vacant positions. The team leader’s lack of
experience resulted in inadequate team management, ultimately leading to sub-par
implementation of the project.

In most cases, the quality of work could not be checked in time due to dependency on other
departments’ (e.g. LGED, university) quality control laboratories. A smaller quality control
laboratory at the BMDF office and the City Corporation offices could have significantly
streamlined this process.

Implementation Experience

BMDF provided training to ULB and municipal engineers. Appointment of Senior Municipal
Engineers, Municipal Engineers and Junior Municipal Engineers was done in consultation with
the Consulting Firm. The country was divided into two zones and different sub-zones for
convenience of proper supervision. There were 2 zones and 10 sub-zones during the project
under Cr. No. 4761-BD.

Senior structural engineers of the M&S Consultants were authorized to make changes to the
design when deemed necessary. The changes were then to be approved by BMDF. World Bank
funding disbursement was delayed due to a delay in the signing of the Subsidiary Grant and Loan
Agreement between the World Bank and Financial Institutions Division.

The price of construction material was suddenly increased by an abnormal amount from August
2011 to January 2012. This increase in price delayed the completion of work.

2.3 Assessment of Outcomes

Improved institutional capacity. The Municipal Support Unit (MSU) of the LGED was
responsible for building the institutional capacity of the ULBs. A substantial amount of IDA
funds was allocated to MSU to conduct training programs for the municipal staff. MSU
organized training programs on procurement procedures, civil works quality control, and
accounts management for ULB engineers and accountants. In addition, BMDF organized
training programs on preparation of tender documents, tender evaluation reports, contract
agreements, implementation procedures, quality control, billing system, implementation of social
impact management framework (SIMF), environmental impact monitoring format (EIMF), and
                                                95
procurement risk mitigation framework (PRMF) for ULB officials and mayors directly involved
in subproject preparation and implementation. These training programs improved the
institutional capacity of the ULBs.

Improved resource allocation. BMDF allocated US$103 million to 154 ULBs under two credits.
Seven City Corporations, 78 A-class, 49 B-class and 29 C-class municipalities participated in the
program. Depending on its class and size, each municipality usually received BDT 0.80 million
to 0.40 million from the government under the Annual Development Program (ADP) for
infrastructure development. This was inadequate for necessary infrastructure improvement. The
BMDF compensated for these gaps by providing additional financial and technical support. In a
single fiscal year, the BMDF provided BDT 10 million to 20 million under the IDA credits.

Reduction of urban poverty. A study by the Development Support Link (DSL) found that, as a
result of the infrastructural improvements, participating municipalities experienced increases in
trade and business, employment, and land values; improved transportation; and improved public
health due to safer drinking water, installation of sanitary public toilets, hygienic vegetable
markets and slaughter houses and proper waste water drainage. The combination of the resulting
economic growth and the improved municipal service delivery enabled the ULBs to successfully
raise holding and property taxes, thereby increasing municipal income. This allowed ULBs to
successfully make loan payments and helped to ensure their eventual financial independence.

3. Evaluation

Evaluation of ULB performance: Several ULBs were unable to meet the requirement of standard
design and preparation of the Draft Bidding Document because they lacked the necessary
technical capacity. As a result, BMDF had to modify many elements at the time of
implementation. Had there been Appraisal Consultants these documents could have been
prepared on time.

Evaluation of World Bank performance: The World Bank ensured timely execution of the
subprojects. World Bank personnel met BMDF senior officials nearly every month to ensure that
the sub-projects were being implemented on time. They also helped maintained consistent
oversight to guarantee transparent implementation, free from corruption, and effectively dealt
with any problems that arose.

We had some concern over slow-decision making from the World-Bank counterparts. At the start
of the project, one visiting mission advised BMDF to drop 17 sub-projects on apprehension that
they would not be completed on time. The BMDF reviewed the project plans and found that it
would be possible to complete the sub-projects on time. Although it immediately submitted this
finding to the World Bank, the Bank took roughly one month to re-approve these projects.
Unfortunately, the sub-projects became costlier for the BMDF over the 30-day lag due to a
number of reasons (e.g. change in conversion rates, increase in construction materials).




                                               96
4. Lessons Learned

1. The window for procurement procedure and implementation of project was only 15 months.
   Twenty months would have been a more appropriate window for a project with so many sub-
   components.
2. Sudden price escalation of construction materials and man-power (e.g. bitumen, Mild Steel
   Rod, stone chips, sand, bricks and labor) hindered project implementation. Any logical
   enhancement of contract price against any abnormal rise of price of construction materials
   with no fault of the contractor could help ensure smooth completion of project.
3. The time required for sub-project preparation and procurement (i.e. signing the sub-project
   appraisal report, time for tendering, bid evaluation and award to contracts) was insufficient.
   Some ULBs failed to complete the total procurement process within this timeframe and the
   BMDF took extra time to correct some of the documents. Eight months for preparation and
   procurement, with an additional 12 months for project implementation, is required.
4. BMDF used money saved from the conversion rate to successfully implement 17 sub-
   projects within 90 days. BMDF could have 15% additional sub-projects ready at hand to
   quickly implement in similar situations in which sub-project funding suddenly becomes
   available.
5. The consultants managed and supervised the civil works whereas the ULBs oversaw the
   design. This system of splitting up the management, design and supervision often created
   communication gaps and ultimately slowed down project execution. Some sub-projects were
   undertaken without pre-work survey. Consultants could be appointed before receiving the
   Sub-project Appraisal Report (SPAR) so that they can examine sub-projects at the initial
   stages.
6. Implementation guidelines were not flexible and sometimes found to be irrelevant with time.
   Guidelines for implementation should be updated along with new project.
7. There was not enough technical support throughout the project. There were only 12
   municipal engineers available for monitoring and supervising 141 sub-projects in 65 ULBs
   over a time span of 15 months. Sufficient technical staff should be appointed at the beginning.
8. Designing project components was challenging because many ULBs lacked engineers with
   design capacity. BMDF had to hire a design consultant, in addition to M&S Consultants, for
   proper implementation of the projects. This kind of requirement could be taken care of at the
   initial stage to save time and ensure better performance.
9. Appointment of consultants was delayed, thereby resulting in delays in management and
   supervision. Timely hiring of consultants could overcome this inconvenience.
10. Changes in the conversion rate from USD to BTD should be considered at project planning
    stage.
11. The price of construction materials was high during the implementation period, thereby
    increasing the cost of implementation. Many contractors faced complications due to price
    escalation.




                                               97
5. Future Operation of the Project

The BMDF prepared a Preliminary Development Project Proforma (PDPP) for carrying out
development activities of the ULBs in Bangladesh. The projects are designed to address a broad
range of issues in development, such as municipal income generation, solid waste management,
solar streetlight, infrastructure maintenance, and digitalization of ULBs, etc. The Government of
Bangladesh approved the project proposals and donors are being searched for financial assistance.
These projects are expected to improve to the overall living condition of the urban people and
strengthen the capacity of ULBs for reducing urban poverty.

BMDF is planning to expand its operation to effectively deal with the challenge of urban poverty,
climate change, environmental degradation, scarcity of electricity, and inadequate municipal
solid waste management, among other issues. BMDF is developing project pro-forma in different
fields such as physical infrastructure development, maintenance of existing infrastructure, urban
solid waste management, solar energy, digitalization, capacity building of ULBs, environmental
preservation, urban health care, and water supply and sanitation.

A shortage of municipal technical staff, performance of consultants, and depending on material
tests on other agencies led us to recommend the following:
   The Local Government Division of the GOB should hire an adequate number of ULB
    engineers so that they will not need to transfer any during implementation of work under
    IDA credit.
   Borrower could be allowed to hire consultant on an individual basis following World Bank
    guidelines.
   The ULBs located at the divisional headquarters could be provided with mini laboratory to
    facilitate carrying out basic tests of the civil works done within the jurisdiction.
   The scope of monitoring of the IDA funded project through proper maintenance should be
    incorporated in the new project design.
