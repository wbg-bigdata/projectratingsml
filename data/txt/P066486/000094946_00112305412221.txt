A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project development objectives are to: (i) improve mother and child health through more integrated
delivery of child survival, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS services, increasing the efficiency of the
Government in delivering these services and maintaining the accomplishments of Kenya!s population
program; (ii) slow the increase in IHV prevalence rates; and (iii) create an enabling environment for
decentralized managed delivery of child survival, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS services to and within
districts.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The indicators below do not constitute targets, as baseline values for many of the indicators still have to be
established through a baseline study during the first months of the project. For those indicators for which
baseline values are available, targets are reflected in Annex 1. In view of the limited perspectives for
macro-economic growth in Kenya in the near future and the anticipated impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis, the
worse of which is still to come, care has been taken to avoid setting overly-ambitious targets. Quantitative
indicators will be collected through samnple district expenditure reviews and through existing mechanisms as
much as possible, while three service delivery surveys will complement these with qualitative information.
The Reproductive Health/Integrated Management of Children Illnesses (IMCI) component will be assessed
using the following indicators: (i) Infant Mortality Rate (IMR); (ii) Child Mortality Rate (CMR); (iii)
vaccination coverage statistics; (iv) percentage of births attended by qualified health workers; (v) Total
Fertility Rate (TFR); (vi) contraceptive prevalence rates, by age, per district; and (vii) median age of first
sexual intercourse.
The ability of the Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)/HIV/AIDS component to fulfill its development
objectives will be measured by the following indicators: (i) HIV prevalence rates by age and gender; (ii)
median age of first sexual intercourse; (iii) condom use by age, marital status and type of partner; and (iv)
percentage of all blood units that have been screened for HIV before transfusion.
The decentralization conponent will be assessed in two ways. First, the degree to which improved health
outcomes can be achieved through decentralized delivery of health care services will be assessed by the
health indicators listed above. Second, the degree to which these achievements are linked to
decentralization will be assessed by the: (i) percentage of the MoH non-salary recurrent budget that is
made available to districts; (ii) district actual expenditures as a percentage of their budget allocations; (iii)
percentage of the district budget [Government of Kenya (GoK) and development partners (DPs)] that is
controlled locally; (iv) percentage of health facilities that have pro-poor exemption mechanisms in place
and functioning for user charges; (v) percentage of user charges that is retained at the level of the Nairobi
health facilities; and (v) qualitative assessments of intended beneficiaries' perceptions through service
delivery surveys.
While reducing matemal mortality is one of the objectives of the Reproductive Health (RH) component, the
Matemal Mortality Rate (MMR) is an indicator that is very difficult to measure and interpret exactly
because of the small sample sizes used and the consequently large Confidence Intervals of the measure.
The widely accepted proxy indicator for MMR -- "percentage of births attended to by qualified health
workers" -- therefore figures among the impact indicators, and not among the output indicators.

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 18391 KE          Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/24/98
The project supports the strategic choices as elaborated in the CAS, and in keeping with the key strategic
imperatives of the National Health Sector Strategic Plan (NHSSP) 1999-2004, by supporting the
improvement of economic governance and public sector performance by facilitating Kenyan-led
reforms, with a view to promoting rural and human development. Greater decentralization of health
service functions brings management closer to the intended beneficiaries, with consequent opportunities to
improve accountability and transparency. The decentralization component of the project will be the main
vehicle for the implementation of the decentralization strategy of the Ministry of Health (MoH). It will
include activities at Central, Provincial and District levels, aimed at establishing new organizational,
financial, Human Resource and logistics management anangements and systems that will devolve authority
to District and Hospital levels for the management of service delivery functions and strengthen the capacity
of Central and Provincial level for policy and planning, monitoring performance and regulation.
Experience shows that local boards and authorities are more circumspect in the management of resources,
especially if these are locally generated. An evaluation of Kenya's cost sharing program funded by the
United States Agency for Intemnational Development (USAID), which is largely administered by districts,
indicates that improvements in resource allocation and efficiency are most likely to occur when increased
responsibility and authority are given to Iccal managers (MSH 1996).
The project will support strategies to better target public subsidies to the poor and vulnerable by: (i)
assisting the MoH in defining and applying poverty-focused criteria for resource allocations to districts;
(ii) facilitating the focus for public subsidies on essential and basic services; (iii) introducing District
Health Expenditure Reviews as a tool for district managers to improve their targeting of resources to
cost-effective and poverty-focused interventions within districts; and (iv) facilitating the transparency in the
management of public resources, including the policy and implementation of exemption schemes for the
poor and vulnerable.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
GoK's Strategy for International Development Association (IDA) Support to Implementation of
National HIV/AIDS Strategy
As in other African countries, HIV/AIDS has become a development crisis in Kenya. In 1990, the adult
(15-49 years) HIV prevalence was estimated at 5.8 percent. This prevalence rate has been growing at an
average of 11 percent per year, thus reaching 13.9 percent in 1999. Under this scenario, the number of
Kenyans infected with HIV/AIDS would reach 3 million by 2010. This implies that the number of
cumulative AIDS deaths would be as high as 2.7 million by 2005. Given that 80 percent of these deaths
are expected to occur among the population aged 15 to 49, some studies have estimated that the gross
domestic product (GDP) in year 2015 could be 14.5 percent lower than in a baseline scenario without
AIDS, while income per capita could drop by as much as 10 percent. Conservative estimates of GDP
losses for the period 2000-2020 range between 12 percent and 16 percent (in present value). These losses
occur not only as the labor force shrinks and labor productivity falls (a one percentage point increase in the
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate could be associated with an 8 percent reduction in labor productivity), but also
because it becomes socially optimal to reduce the savings rate of the economy and slowdown the
accumulation of capital. Hence, the savings rate of the economy in year 2015 is expected to drop by more
than 12 percent. Bank staff calculations suggest that even in the case of conservative estimates about
potential benefits and pessimistic views about costs, Kenyan policymakers should target sharp reductions in
- 3 -



the short-run. These reductions approximate 20 percent of the current prevalence rate and are close to the
maximum reduction that could be achieved, given today's number of HlV-infected individuals.
The GoK is taking a two-pronged approach to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as reflected in the two IDA
projects that have been designed to support this strategy. Given its experience with previous AIDS-related
projects financed by various donors, the multi-sectoral infrastructure that has been established to tackle
AIDS as a development issue, and the growing political commitment to address the issue, Kenya was
uniquely positioned to be the among the first countries to develop a truly multi-sectoral AIDS project -- the
Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project, which was approved by the World Bank (WB) Board in
September, 2000. That project was designed to deal with the non-medical aspects of the National
HIV/AIDS Strategy and to be implemented by the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) under the
Office of the President. Support provided to the Ministry of Health under this project will focus on its
incremental role in providing support to other ministries. The Decentralized Reproductive Health & AIDS
(DARE) Project will focus on the medical aspects of the response more traditionally associated with the
MoH. Why not combine these into a single project? The decision to prepare separate projects was based
on the need for continued, reliable supply of medical goods and services to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic
through vertical support to the MoH and the desire for a bolder, more aggressive, horizontal approach to
pursuing HIV/AIDS as a multi-sectoral development issue. It would not be possible to achieve the
objectives of both under a single project. The Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project is the first of
its kind, both for IDA and for Kenya, in that it comprises a horizontal operation involving multiple
ministries and led by the Office of the President. While it was felt that the strong structure of the NACC
and its satellites in the various ministries provided a solid infrastructure for this bold endeavor, it is a
horizontal structure with a specific mandate to address the development crisis associated with H1V/AIDS.
In the Kenyan context, it would not be appropriate to channel support for the vertical, health-specific
response by the MoH through that structure. Therefore, it was agreed that the medical aspect of the
Govemment's strategy would be best addressed through a separate project, implemented solely by the
MoH, which would seek to build on the achievements of past projects. This approach also allows the MoH
to pursue its objective of increased efficiency through better integration of these efforts into the broader
health sector operations, moving away from the more "projectized" implementation which has characterized
past efforts.
Overview of Health Sector and Sector Strategy
Shifting to this focus on the health sector as a whole, Kenya had built a health sector which performed
relatively well compared to neighboring countries by the 1970s, and some of the country's health indicators
were among the best in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as an IMR of 62 in 1985. However, the health sector
has been in decline since the late 1980s, both in terms of the services provided and the health of the Kenyan
populace. Mainly due to the economic govemance issues covered in the CAS, an impressive service
network of over 3,000 health facilities and more than 25,000 trained health workers is no longer capable of
sustaining the previously-realized gains in infant and child mortality and life expectancy. In fact, the 1998
Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) revealed that infant and child mortality have increased,
resulting in a 46 percent rise in Under-5 mortality since 1989. Life expectancy has decreased from 59 in
1991 to an estimated 47.6 in 1998 (US Census Bureau). The reasons for these trends include the
expanding HIV/AIDS epidemic, the poor management of health facilities, allocative and technical
inefficiencies, under-funding of the sector, and a declining socio-economic situation.
These trends substantiate even further the need for basic organizational reform of the MoH and for the
implementation of strategic plans for HIV/AIDS, IMCI and RH in order to achieve its stated health goals.
Key lessons from previous MoHIWB Projects (Health Rehabilitation, Population IV and STI) also
highlighted priority areas for action within the NHSSP framework.

The long-term vision of the MoH has been defined in the GoK document, "Health Policy Framework
1994". It states that an improvement of the health status of all Kenyans will be achieved through the
implementation of six strategic imperatives: (i) to ensure the equitable allocation of government resources
to reduce disparities in health status; (ii) to increase the cost-effectiveness of resource allocation and use;
(iii) to continue to manage population growth; (iv) to enhance the regulatory role of the Government in all
aspects of health care provision; (v) to create an enabling environment for increased private sector and
community involvement in health service provision and financing; and (vi) to increase and diversify per
capita financial flows to the health sector.
Though implementation has not yet progressed significantly, the MoH has undertaken a Health Sector
Reform Program with support of the donor community. Decentralization features prominently on the
agenda of the reform program, and progress made in this regard to date includes the provision of Health
Care Services Funds where 75 percent of the revenues generated are utilized by the collecting facility and
25 percent directed to the source districts to support Primary Health Care (PHC) activities. The issuance
of Authority to Incur Expenditures (ALE), related to funds generated through cost-sharing, has been
delegated to the provincial level and District Health Management Boards (DHMBs) have been empowered
to superintend the management of the cost-sharing and exchequer funds and the overall delivery of district
health services. While previous efforts to promote decentralization have mainly been directed towards
capacity building in technical and managerial areas, the project specifically supports fiscal decentralization
and the creation of partnerships between the public sector, civil society and the private sector.
The strategic choice to support decentralization of health service delivery management responds to the need
to improve accountability and transparency. At the same time, it will create the opportunity for district
managers to be more responsive to local needs, in terms of the type of services offered, the mechanisms by
which these services are delivered, and the quality concems raised by the local population.
While the govemment's commitment to aggressively respond to the WIV/AIDS challenge on a multi-sectoral
level has not been as strong as it should have been in the past, recent developments have brought evidence
that this commitment is growing. The issue has been given increased visibility by the top political
leadership, and an NACC has been put in place to coordinate a national, multi-sectoral response to the
epidemic. The National AIDS Strategy (Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1997) was passed by Parliament in
September, 1997, and the National HIV/AIDS and STD Control Program (NASCOP) has finalized its
strategic plan. Furthermore, the efforts financed by donors and the IDA-financed STI Project have yielded
some impressive accomplishments: (i) chances for transmission of WHV through blood transfusions have
been drastically curtailed as 98 percent of the country's blood supply is now screened for HIV; (ii)
awareness has been raised such that 38.6 percent of the population can now name at least two important
methods of preventing WHV infection; and (iii) social marketing and Information Education and
Communication (IEC) efforts have resulted in an increased distribution of condoms from 2.4 million in
1995 to an estimated 80 million in 1999.
As mentioned above, the Government has applied for a US$ 50 million IDA Credit (the Kenya HIV/AIDS
Disaster Response Project) under the multi-country, multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Project, which was
approved in September 2000. This Project will, in contrast to the HIV/AIDS component under the DARE
Project, be implemented across various sectors and ministries and focus on the non-medical aspects of the
response to the epidemic with a focus on the support to community driven initiatives. This horizontal
approach is in contrast to the vertical approach taken by DARE, which focuses exclusively on the medical
response to the epidemic by MoH in greater depth than would have been possible under the multi-sectoral
operation. The two prjects will be complementary and be implemented in parallel.
While some reproductive health indicators have declined along with general health indicators over the last
decade, Kenya's population program has achieved significant impact which must be sustained. Since 1979,
- 5-



the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has decreased from 7.9 to 4.7 children per woman, the Population Growth
Rate (PGR) has declined from 3.6 to 2.6 percent, and the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) among
married women has increased from 7 percent to 39 percent (31 percent for modem methods). A significant
challenge of any future support to this subsector will be to better integrate and coordinate the delivery of
reproductive health services, as well as the relevant divisions within the Ministry, with those for
STI/HIV/AIDS.
Of particular concem to the MoH is the increase in infant and child mortality, resulting in a 46 percent rise
in Under-5 mortality since 1989. Childhood mortality in Kenya is largely due to malaria, pneumonia,
diarrhea, measles and malnutrition, and mostly a combination of two or more of these diseases. The
evidence that a large proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing countries and in
Kenya is caused by just five conditions does not in itself argue for an integrated approach to management
of childhood illness. However, most sick children present with signs and symptoms related to more than
one of these conditions and this overlap means that a single diagnosis may be neither possible nor
appropriate. IMCI is a broad strategy, encompassing interventions at home and in the health facility (HF)
which aims to reduce childhood death, illness and disability and to contribute to improved growth and
development. The strategy combines improved management of childhood illness with aspects of nutrition,
immunization and several other important influences on child health, including matemal health. The core
intervention is the integrated case management of the five most important causes of childhood deaths.
However, the combination of interventionis may be modified to include other important conditions.
The IMCI strategy has been accepted by the GoK and appears in the NHSSP as one of the essential clinical
and public health care packages. The project will support the MoH in its implementation with the aim of
including all the programns in the strategy. The implementation will start in three districts, i.e., Kijiado,
Vihiga and Embu.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The MoH realizes that significant improvement in service delivery can only be achieved when the
implementation of its strategies in the technical areas are combined with organizational reform. The project
supports that vision and its strategic objectives are aligned to the objectives of the NHSSP, the Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy and the District Focus for Rural Development Framework in that the purpose
is to create an enabling environment for the decentralized management of integrated
HIV/AIDS/Tuberculosis (TB), child survival and RH services within districts. There are three main
components, two of which relate to health services improvement, HIV/AIDS and RH, and an institutional
strengthening component on decentralization. The two health service delivery components cover activities
in five of six high priority packages identified in the NHSSP with RH covering Expanded Program of
Immunization (EPI), IMCI and malaria, as well as women's health issues (including safer motherhood) and
family planning (FP). The resources provided through the project and the workplans that will be
implemented are consistent with the Kenya HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and the National Plan for
Reproductive Health.
The lead component of the project is the decentralization component, the content of which is based on the
Decentralization Action Plan 2000-2002 from the Mombasa Decentralization Workshop, March 2000. It
includes activities in four areas which were identified in the NHSSP, as well as experience gained in
previous MoH/WB health projects and include: organizational restructuring and systems development;
planning and budgeting; drug supply and distribution logistics reform; and health care financing. The
outcome of improving structures, systems and skills will be manifested by improved performance of the
districts in ensuring the availability of high quality health services for their constituencies, with incentives
for providing for the poor -- and ultimately improving the health status of the people of Kenya.

The DARE Project forms part of the MoH's overall Health Sector Program and will be complementary to
the GoK health budget, and to other development partners' projects and inputs into the Health Sector. As
much as possible, the MoH has sought to optimize application and use of resources from this project by
minimizing duplication and using mechanisms and approaches that have shown to be cost-effective in
previous projects with the World Bank, such as:
(i)    The project seeks to support the government in achieving its long term vision by addressing the
current deterioration in the health status of Kenyans.
(ii)   In order to reduce disparities in health status, GoK and the Bank agreed that the criteria for public
health sector budgetary allocations to individual districts will be reviewed and adjusted to reflect
population levels, poverty and vulnerability indices, and burden of disease measures. While the
Ministry continues to define the most appropriate weights for the individual criteria, it is realized
that the adoption and application of these newly elaborated criteria constitutes a major change from
the current practice (see Annex 4) and will only be feasible when introduced gradually. An agreed
plan to make the gradual transition from current to new resource allocation practice was agreed at
Appraisal, and the details will be elaborated as part of the project implementation plan. In
addition, the project specifically targets children, adolescents and women.
(iii)   Cost-effectiveness of resource allocation and use will be promoted by facilitating results-oriented
planning and management at district level, by improving govemance, and by focusing on
high-priority interventions.
(iv)   Decentralization is the Ministry's key strategy to improve service delivery. It requires the
government to have clear policies, strategic directions and monitoring mechanisms. The project
envisages to support the Ministry in the creation of an enabling environment for effective
decentralization and in financial and technical monitoring of public sector performance.
(v)    The complementary Bank-supported multi-sectoral H1V/AIDS project (the Kenya HIV/AIDS
Disaster Response Project) has been designed to specifically and boldly address the non-medical
aspects of the national response to the HIV epidemic, building partnerships between various
government and non-govemment agencies, the private sector and local communities, leaving the
DARE Project to focus solely on support to MoH in addressing the medical aspects of the national
response.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
Overview
The project supports the MoH's focus on the interrelationship between the institutional arrangements and the
quality of health service delivery, realizing that improvement in service delivery can only be achieved when
the implementation of its strategies in the technical areas are combined with organizational reform. The
project therefore combines an organizational reform component with two high-priority service delivery
components, providing the opportunity to closely monitor the effects of reform on service delivery
performance. The project consists of program support as it provides additional resources for priority
programs of the MoH, and project specific structures and mechanisms are avoided to the extent possible.
This project is first and foremost an intervention to support the health sector, and it should be clearly
understood that the HIV/AIDS component will provide essential support to the MoH in addressing the most
pressing health issue in the country. This support will be complementary to that provided under the
multi-sectoral AIDS Project, which is wholly non-medical in focus.

Decentralization
This component will support the Govemment in implementing its decentralization policy by improving
mechanisms for fiscal decentralization, building capacity at district level for results-oriented planning and
financial management, and piloting greater degrees of decentralized managerial and fiscal control in the
districts while promoting transparency and both technical and financial accountability. Reforms aimed at
improving institutional and operational support to the districts, such as the restructuring of the Medical
Supplies Coordinating Unit (MSCU) and the support to revolving drug funds in the periphery, will be
addressed under this component. Involvement by, and feedback to, local communities in the management of
health services will be promoted to improve the appropriateness and transparency of public service delivery.
Taking into consideration the capacity limitations to support and monitor the decentralization program, the
Ministry has decided to proceed in a phased manner, selecting eight "Phase 1" districts, one in each province,
for support under the DARE Project, while another six districts will receive support through a Swedish
Intemational Development Authority (SIDA)-financed project. The key aspect of this program in these 14
districts is the increased decentralization of planning and management of resources, as all non-wage recurrent
GoK funds will be allocated to these districts as a rationalized budget comprising a maximum of 9 line items
in the district health budget. Additional IDA/SIDA funds will complement GoK funds in these grants (See
Annex 2 for criteria for grant eligibility and terms). This is a fundamental change from the current system, in
which the center allocates the district budget to a large number of over-specified line items in a relatively
inflexible system which makes reallocation across line items by districts difficult, thus impairing the districts'
ability to respond to their own unique and evolving needs. The District Workplan Approach embodied in
"Phase 1" Decentralization is depicted in Figure 1.

To address the need for increased capacity at the districts in order for district-level staff to be able to fulfill
their new responsibilities, the Ministry has prepared a comprehensive 4-week health management program.
Over the next 18 months, all relevant district staff from these 14 districts, as well as additional districts as
"Phase I Decentralization" is rolled out further, will be provided this training through the Kenya Medical
Training College (KMTC). This intensified and expanded "Phase I" program also includes provisions for:
(i) the establishment of stakeholder forums at district level and further refinement of the institutional
arrangements at district and sub-district level; (ii) intensive monitoring of health expenditures through
District Health Expenditure Reviews; (iii) delegation of the responsibility for drug procurement; (iv)
improved human resource management; (v) the strengthening of referral systems, and (vi) increased
autonomy for district hospitals. The development of comprehensive, resource based and outcome oriented
workplans, as well a performance appraisal system will be supported as instruments to monitor and
evaluate performance. As the decentralization agenda develops further and lessons are leamed in the
process, other related activities may be considered for support in these "Phase 1" districts.
HIWAIDS
This component will focus on the medical aspects of the GoK's response to the epidemic as distinct from
the multi-sectoral Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project, which will provide support to the NACC in
addressing AIDS as a national development issue and provide no support to medical interventions. As
previously discussed, the decision was made to support the response through these two separate projects
due to the GoK and Bank's shared objectives of: (i) shielding the essential health-specific interventions, for
which the GoK and the Bank have a track record of support through previous projects, from the higher
risks associated with the bold multi-sectoral approach of the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project; and (ii)
better integrating these health-specific interventions into the broader operations of the health sector,
reducing duplication of effort with such areas as RH. Activities supported under the HIV/AIDS
component include interventions intended to expand and intensify the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic
and aimed at advocacy and awareness, preventing new infections (behavior modeling interventions, condom
use, blood safety, school education programs, voluntary counseling and testing, etc.) and mitigating the
impact of the epidemic by supporting those infected and affected. The procurement of condoms, drugs for
opportunistic infection and HIV test material will be supported under this component. Gender aspects and
the specific vulnerability of women, adolescents and the poor will receive special emphasis through the
guidelines for the elaboration of district workplans. Support to the implementation of district workplans, as
a major area of emphasis, is designed to accommodate flexibility in responding to changes in the
operational, social and/or epidemiological situation. These workplans are expected to accommodate
district-level contracting with non-governmental organizations (NGO)/community-based organizations
(CBOs) to provide services.
This component will be implemented in parallel with the Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project,
which will support the transformation of Kenya's response to the epidemic into a national, multi-sectoral
endeavor. Specifically, that project targets the institutional strengthening for the coordination of the
various initiatives through the NACC, and predominantly supports non-medical aspects of the response to
the WHV epidemic. It also has a major component that aims to support community driven initiatives.
In addition, the Department for Intemational Development, UK (DflD) will provide GBP 26 million
(approx. US$ 40 million) in parallel financing through the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care (HAPAC) II
Project, which will support the effective implementation of Kenya's National AIDS Strategy. HAPAC I
has supported the development of the GoK's HV/AIDS Strategic Plan and played a role in improving
donor coordination, as well as strengthening the institutional framework for HV/AIDS activities in Kenya.
-9-



In addition to working towards the GoK target of stabilization of HIV prevalence at 15% by 2002 and a
reduction to 10% by 2010, HAPAC II aims to: (i) support the entrenchment and prioritization of
HIV/AIDS in the Medium Tenn Expenditure Framework (MTEF)/budgetary process for all relevant
ministries; (ii) ensure that all districts/constituencies have sufficient funds to implement the strategy; and
(iii) support progress toward the GoK target of 25% reduction in HIV-incidence among 15-24 year olds by
2005. It is envisioned that HAPAC II will achieve these objectives by: (i) developing capacity within GoK
to budget for, coordinate and implement HIV/AIDS interventions outlined in the National AIDS Strategic
Plan; (ii) supporting the effective implementation of the advocacy and behavior change component of the
Strategic Plan; and (iii) facilitating and inforning the implementation of the care and support component of
the Strategic Plan. Contingent on progress against these indicators, it is envisioned that the latter years of
the project will provide financing directly through budget support.
USAID will concurrently provide financing through its continued support of the Trust Condom Social
Marketing Prograrn managed by Population Services Intemational (PSI). The program's success is
indicated by the consistent increase in Trust sales and by its popularity as the condom of choice among
young people. USAID has also provided invaluable support to the MoH in the fonnulation of an overall
condom strategy. DflD will also provide support to the Trust program through the financing of
approximately US$ 1 million in condoms over the next four years. In addition, the German Technical
Co-operation (GTZ) plans to continue its support towards the Community Based Distribution of condoms
and the branding of GoK-procured condoms.
Reproductive Health
Under this component, issues will be addressed that relate to reproductive health in its broader concept,
including family planning, safe motherhood, women's status, child survival and sexually-transmitted
infections. This component builds on the National Reproductive Health Strategy and its Implementation
Plan, elaborated and disseminated with support from the IDA-financed Fourth Population Project. District
plans have been developed and the project will provide support for training, including the conduct of
matemal death audits, procurement of essential inputs (FP commodities, drugs, and equipment) and IEC.
Special emphasis will be put on the provision of services for the youth. Elements under this component
include support for (the gradual introduction of) IMCI, including malaria and micro-nutrient related
activities, as well as the procurement of a limited amount of drugs and equipment.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
Criteria for resource allocation are currentiy predominantly based on historic patterns. The project will
support the transition from this practice towards a system whereby resources are allocated according to
objective, transparent, poverty-focused, and rational criteria. For the geographic distribution of resources
to individual districts, a district resource allocation formula will be introduced, weighted for poverty,
children under 5, women of reproductive age, the number of health facilities, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. In
addition, the project will assist the MoH in targeting public subsidies to those essential and high priority
services, identified in the NHSSP, from which the poor are likely to benefit most.
The policy of decentralization and its institutional implications comprise an essential and pivotal
component of this project. In the past, the decentralization policy has resulted in the transfer of functions
and responsibilities to district level, without effective fiscal decentralization. Under the DARE Project,
reforms in support of decentralization will include the provision of greater managerial and fiscal control to
the districts, creating the environment for increased autonomy for District Health Management Teams and
Boards (DHMTs)/(DHMBs) to allocate resources, still within the framework of nationally-formulated
policies and strategies. The establishment and functioning of stakeholder for a at district level will be
supported, aimed to increase transparency in the financing and management of health service delivery
activities.
To date, the problem of meager allocation of funds to districts and facilities has been compounded by the
over-specification by the center of the categories of expenditure. Reallocation across categories proved
nearly impossible, as it would require trav-Aing to Nairobi and navigating the MoH bureaucracy for the
necessary approvals. It was, therefore, agreed with both the MoH and Ministry of Finance and Planning
(MoFP) during the pre-appraisal mission that the dozens of categories would be reduced to 9 for budgeting
purposes, thus providing staff on the ground increased flexibility and discretion over the use of funds. This
will be implemented first in the Phase I Decentralization districts (see project description), and
subsequently in all districts beginning in FY2001-2002.
Capacity building for equitable, transparent and efficient resource management will be supported as part of
the Decentralization component. Training and supervision of the DHMBs and Health Facility Committees
(HFCs) will go along with organizational restructuring and systems development. The findings from the
Phase I Participatory Study highlighted an insufficient involvement of local communities in
decision-making processes conceming health service management. Improved representation in the various
Boards and Committees, with increased transparency through adequate reporting and feedback
mechanisms, will be pursued, as well as improved information sharing on the purpose, process and contents
of decentralization. The project will seek the active participation of communities to guide, monitor and
evaluate service delivery.
The efforts to involve NGOs, CBOs, religious organizations (ROs) and the private sector in the
implementation of the STI Project have not resulted in a substantial and effective partnership between these
organizations and the public sector. At the same time, it is clear that the public sector will not be able to
provide the care and support needed, especially for those affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In order to
increase the capacity of the sector to respond to increasing demands, the project will encourage districts to
seek opportunities and modalities to improve and expand the partnership with NGOs/CBOs/ROs. Within
the context of the district workplans the financing of proposals from such partners related to HIV/AIDS as
well as RH, will be facilitated under simplified arrangements in the form of Grant-in-Aid.
- 11 -



While the above-mentioned aspects of the decentralization process will be supported in relation to all
districts, an intensified and expanded decentralization program will be established in fourteen "Phase I"
districts, one in each province to be supported under the DARE Project and an additional eight districts
under a SIDA-financed project. This intensified and expanded program includes provisions for: (i) the
establishment of stakeholder forums at district level and further refinement of the institutional arrangements
at district and sub-district level; (ii) intensive monitoring of health expenditures through District Health
Expenditure Reviews; (iii) delegation of the responsibility for drug procurement; (iv) improved human
resource management; (v) the strengthening of referral systems; and (vi) increased autonomy for district
hospitals.
3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits
(i)   Improved mother-child health, as reflected in matemal mortality, infant mortality, child mortality.
(ii)   Reduced risk of HIV infection and better health care for those infected.
(iii)  Delayed sexual debut of adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, and the consequent reduction in
RH and STI/HIV/AIDS risks to the same.
(iv)   Sustained success of the Population Program, as indicated by PGR, TFR and CPR.
(v)   Reduction in risk posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic will translate into improved economic growth
and development.
(vi)   Redesigned system of district budgetary allocations and the involvement of rural health facility
committees at the most peripheral level of the health system pyramid will enhance health service
delivery to the rural poor.
(vii)  Improved economic govemance through increased accountability and increased transparency in
decentralized management of resources and health service delivery.
Target Population
(i)    Rural poor: They will benefit from increased equity under decentralized health care delivery
system through improved implementation of exemption mechanisms.
(ii)    Women of reproductive age: Their reproductive health will be maintained and improved.
(iii)   Mothers and Children under 5: The decline in Mother and Child Health will be reversed.
(iv)   Adolescents, with particular emphasis on adolescent girls: They will be targeted for education to
enable them to make safer decisions about their sexual health, including delaying sexual debut
and/or employing safer sex methods. Girls will be particularly targeted due to the high
seroprevalence rate among adolescent girls.
(v)    All sexually active adolescents and adults: By slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS, risk to all
sexually active Kenyans will be reduced; by increasing awareness and providing information for
safer sexual choices, all will be better able to protect themselves against STI/HIV/AIDS.
(vi)   STIIHIV/AIDS patients and affected households: They will receive better care and support.
(vii)   District and local level health personnel: They will be provided training to better prepare them for
their new roles and responsibilities under a decentralized health care delivery system, and these new
roles and responsibilities will better equip them to address the health needs of their patients.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
A. General
Implementation arrangements will seek to enhance appropriate GoK institutional capacity, at district,
provincial and central level. The MoH will be accountable for the decentralization process and the
performance of the health service delivery-related components of the project. District Medical Officers
(DMOs) of Health will be responsible for the implementation of the decentralization policy at district level
and for the implementation of the district workplans supported by the project. Funds will be advanced to
project-specific Ledger Accounts as sub-accounts of District Reimbursement Development Accounts.
Funds will be used against eligible expenditure categories for activities that have been included in annual
district workplans. The DHMBs and Health Facility Committees (HFCs) will be responsible for the
oversight of project implementation at district and sub-district level. The implementation of central level
activities (coordination activities, reforms, central procurement) will be the responsibility of the MoH,
through the Division of Primary Health Care (DPHC), the Health Sector Reform Secretariat (HSRS) and
the NASCOP in the MoH.
Figure 2 below illustrates the institutional and implementation arrangements. Within the scope of this
project, these reflect the transitional management framework to support the MoH in operationalizing its
proposed decentralized framework and the proposed new MoH in the NHSSP. It is proposed, therefore,
that the HSRS of the Ministerial Reform Committee (MRC) be responsible for coordinating the Project.
While it is noted that the HSRS is, itself, a transitional structure with no line responsibility, the nature of
the Project does not lend itself to fit within any of the existing departments or divisions of the MoH.
Since the Project is not a comprehensive Health Sector Reform Program, a DARE Project Steering
Committee (DSC) will be established as a subcommittee of the MRC. The Director of Medical Services
(DMS) will chair the DSC, with the HSRS acting as Secretariat. Component Coordinators will be
appointed, within the department/divisions that have the operational responsibility for the respective
components. In addition, an overall Project Coordinator will be appointed to ensure synchronization of the
components and will be responsible, as part of the MRC, for the achievement of the broader development
objectives of the Project. [Terms of Reference for Component Coordinators and Project Coordinator
contained in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP)}.
As distinct from the role of the MRC, the role of the DSC will be to supervise the progress of the Project
and to ensure that there are clear accountability mechanisms for the resources provided through the project.
The DSC will comprise the Project Coordinator, the Component Coordinators, the Director of NACC, the
MoH Senior Personnel Officer (SPPO) and/or a representative from the Directorate of Personnel
Management (DPM), the MoH Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and/or a representative from the Treasury,
and Ministry of Local Govemment (MoLG). Given the reform nature of the Project, the DSC will be
responsible for bringing to the MRC appropriate policy issues for their approval and elaboration and to
also provide linkages to DPM and the Treasury on policy issues related to personnel and finance.
Within the decentralization component, planning mechanisms will be established at the Central, Provincial
and District levels. These will be developed jointly with all stakeholders and refined in the fourteen Phase I
decentralization districts which have been selected using the new resource allocation criteria. Using a
phased approach to implementation will ensure that management capacities at all levels are not
overwhelmed by the transition period, when many managers will be playing dual roles as authority is being
devolved. As a first step, the HSRS will convene a Decentralization Task Force (DTF) to ensure the
relevance and integration of the three components to the needs of the districts (Refer PIP Annex 3: TORs
- 13 -



DTF). The DTF will comprise:
(i)   the HSRS,
(ii)   Provincial Medical Officers (3);
(iii)   District Medical Officers (5) for the Phase I Districts;
(iv)   The Division Heads for Family Health and the AIDS Control Unit
In addition, the HSRS, with the PMOs, will support the Phase I Districts to establish District Health
Stakeholder Forums in order to widen the input to the planning process in the Districts (Refer PIP Annex
4: ToRs District Health Stakeholder Forums).
In order for the HSRS to fulfill this project coordination role as well as its more critical role of custodian of
the NHSSP, it will be important that its capacity be strengthened both technically and administratively.
This needs to be done so as to ensure the appropriate support to the transformation process of the Central
MoH as its devolves more and more authority to the Districts. The appropriate strategy would entail the
HSRS assuming technical and project management responsibilities until such time as the Provinces or the
appropriate Central MoH capacity is built to take over the normative policy and regulatory roles, as
outlined in the new structure and role of the MoH. This will be provided by a mixture of resident technical
skill in the HSRS and intermittent consultant support as needed. (Refer PIP Annex 6: Action Plan for
Strengthening the capacity of the HSRS).
Given the complex and diverse nature of the project, both in terms of its process and developmental
approach, a team approach will be taken to providing the technical support required for implementation.
This will reduce the administrative workload of the HSRS and ensure coherence and consistency of the
technical advice. Technical consultants, international and national will be provided through the technical
support tearn under the management of a Technical Support Team Leader (TSTL) who is accountable to
the Project Coordinator or the Head of the HSRS. The Team Leader will support the HSRS to ensure that
the technical input is relevant, timely and of high quality. (Refer PIP Annex 2: ToRs for TSTL)
In summary, these management arrangements together with the approach of strengthening the capacity of
the HSRS works towards the achievement of the institutional strengthening and reform of the entire MoH.
Whilst decentralization focuses on empowerment of the Districts for service delivery, it is as equally
important to develop the roles of the Provinces and Central MoH in its leadership and regulatory role in the
interests of all people in Kenya, particularly the poorer communities. The arrangements therefore ensure
not merely the project accountability mechanisms but also actively support the Ministry in operationalizing
the roles agreed for each level, which are elaborated in the following section.

B. Financial Management
The HSRS of the Ministry of Health will be responsible for overall prjc mnget,icluding: (i)
I                           roject maaeet In
monitoring the progress of the project; (ii) coordinating project activities; (ill) establishing and maintaining
financial management and procurement systems; (iv) the elaboration and submission of Project
Management Reports (P'MR); including physical, financial and procurement implementation progress; and
(v) liaison with the World Bank and other partners.
Effective project management is essential to monitor thle achievement of project inputs, outputs, and
impact, as well as to provide financial accountability with due diligence to economy, and to conduct
transparent procurement procedures in the award of contracts. The head of the HSRS, in conjunction with
the Head of Accounting Unit in the MoH, will be responsible for ensurnng that financial management and
reporting procedures for the project will be acceptable to the Bank. The Head of Accounting Unit will be
responsible for the entire financial management, accounting, and disbursement fiuctions of the project,
including payments through the Special Account, maintain accounts and make payments for eligible
expenditures.
A financial management consultant was provided through the HAPAC Project to help the Sr Project
develop a viable financial management system including comprehensive manual of financial procedures,
Chart of Accounts, and a fully integrated project accounting structure, using appropriate accounting
software. These will be modified and adapted for the DARE project. In addition, the Extemal Resources
Section, MoH, will be strengthened to provide project accounting support to the HSRS, and a suitably
qualified and expernenced accountant identified to handle the DARE project accounting functions.
- 15 -



The accounting system will provide data to measure performance when linked to the output of the project.
To this end the Chart of Accounts developed for the STI project will be modified for DARE to ensure
availability of information required and consistency in account classification. The Chart of accounts will
be developed in a way that allows project costs to be directly related to specific work activities and outputs
of the project, and consistency with eligible expenditure categories as reflected in Schedule I of the Credit
Agreement. In addition, the manual of financial procedures is to include a description of internal control
and accounting system, management and flow of funds, documentation and reporting requirements and
formats, budgetary process, procurement procedures, etc., for use by project management and other
stakeholders. The manual of financial procedures and chart of accounts will be ready by Credit
Effectiveness.
Flow of Funds
To facilitate the flow of funds to the project (central ministry, provinces, districts and Nairobi area
facilities) the Borrower will open bank accounts as follows:
(i)    a Special Account in US Dollars for IDA funds (to be managed by MoFP);
(ii)    Project Accounts in Kenyan Shillings (KES) for Counterpart funds and eligible local expenditures.
Transfers from the Special Account will be deposited in these accounts in accordance with project
objectives. Transfers to the Districts will also be made from this account, but will be channeled
through the District Reimbursement system.
Transfer of funds to Nairobi area facilities will be through the imprest system; following submission of
request for funds based on approved work plans, together with accountability for previous advances, if any.
Once the necessary documentation is reviewed and approved by the Project Coordinator, funds will be
transferred from the Project Account to the facilities by issuing a check or bank transfer. Details on
surrender of imprests issued to the facilities and accountability of the funds will be included in the Manual
of Financial Procedures.
The Ministry has made steady progress in the implementation of the Treasury Circular No. 3 of March
2000 regarding the flow of funds to districts under the STI Project and project-specific accounts have been
opened in all districts. Similarly, funds under the DARE Project will be transferred to the district accounts
through the District Reimbursement procedure, in accordance with the Treasury Circular. The Ministry of
Health will submit Exchequer Requisitions to Treasury, based on the Workplans for the central ministry
and districts, to facilitate up-front release of funds from the Off-Shore Special Account. These funds will
be accounted for through submission of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) on a monthly basis.
Audit Arrangements
In order to comply with Bank reporting requirements, annual Financial Statements and Audits for the
project will be subject to audit by independent auditors, and submitted to the Bank within six months after
the end of the fiscal year. Annual audits will cover the Bank requirements for audit of the project accounts
and review of intemal control systems, inter-alia, for reliability of PMRs; as well as review of the SOE.
Audit reports on project financial statements, will include separate audit opinion on the Special Account
and SoE, as well as a Management Letter.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation
In implementing the DARE project, the progress made and the extent to which project objectives are met
will be assessed through three main approaches: (i) assessing project implementation status through
activity indicator targets and benchmarks, with a focus on the timing and sequencing of activities; (ii)
assessment of flow of benefits to targeted users and beneficiaries of services; and (iii) overall project
impact on health of beneficiaries.
The DARE project will be monitored at three organizational levels: district, provincial and national. The
district level will particularly focus on monitoring implementation of the specific activities set out in district
annual workplans in terms of sequencing, timing and resource use. The district level will also generate the
necessary data for review at the two higher levels. This information will be provided on a regular basis to
the Provincial level which will in tum provide the necessary support and take corrective action for districts.
The provincial level will then transmit summary reports to the national level for quarterly, semi-annual and
annual reviews. The provincial level will also work closely with the Decentralization Task Force to ensure
that lessons learnt among the 14 Phase 1 (8 IDA and 6 SIDA) decentralization districts are taken into
account in further rolling-out the decentralization process.
The DARE Coordinator, working closely with component coordinators, will review reports received at
national level and compile summary quarterly and semi-annual reports for the Steering Committee. The
semi-annual report discussed and reviewed by the DARE Steering Committee will form the basis of IDA
semi-annual reviews. These reviews will further be enriched by information generated from district annual
reports.
Furthermore, the monitoring and evaluation of DARE, particularly the HIV/AIDS component, will be
coordinated with that of the Kenya HI-V/AIDS Disaster Response Project. This will be necessary not only
because both project are expected to improve HIV/AIDS-related indicators, but also to monitor and
evaluate the success of this two-pronged, two project approach.
Instruments for Monitoring and Evaluation
For project impact assessment studies and surveys on availability, utilization and quality of services, on the
one hand, and utilization of resources on the other hand, will be conducted periodically to complement
information derived from regular Health Information System (HIS) and annual district reports. To assess
the flow and utilization of resources, the conduct of district health expenditure reviews has been piloted and
finalized in three districts and will be conducted in all Phase 1 districts. At the middle of the project life
(after two years), the information generated from quarterly, monthly and annual reviews, and from surveys
and studies will provide the basis for a mid-term project review. This stage will be critical in steering the
project to ensure it achieves its overall objectives. In the final year of the project, a major assessment of
impact will be carried out, to evaluate success in meeting overall project objectives. Both the mid-term and
end of project evaluation will provide useful information for strategic action.
The following constitute the summary indicators project implementation, process and impact of the
program:
(i)    Project ImMlementation Indicators
*   The percentage of Credit Proceeds disbursed to finance district work plans, compared to the
allocations, per district
*   The number of district work plans with substantive input from DHMBs, Rural HFCs and
Stakeholder Forums
*   The number of stock-outs of condoms and HIV tests for blood safety, during the project period
- 17-

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP)
This was previously under preparation. Although many of the justifications for such an approach remain
valid and it is envisioned as the vehicle for IDA support to the health sector subsequent to this project, this
alternative was rejected for the reason that the time still required for preparation of a health SWAP does
not correspond with the urgency required to respond to current trends and developments. Partner
stakeholders in the preparation of a health SWAP have communicated similar concems and endorsed the
DARE project concept. However, as a longer-term strategy, the Bank will remain engaged in the
preparation of a health SWAP, mainly through economic and sector work (ESW)/analytical and advisory
activities (AAA), and more specifically, through the elaboration of the NHSSP and an appropriate
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. In addition, it is anticipated that the DARE Project will
significantly support the development of a SWAP, by assisting the Govemment putting in place credible
financial mechanisms, effective service delivery options, and implementing the NHSSP.
STI II and Population V Projects [(Sector Investment Loans (SILs)J
Another alternative would have been to address the urgent health needs through a second STI Project and a
Fifth Population Project. This would not accommodate the decentralization agenda as an instrument for
health services to have more impact, nor would it contribute toward the development of a SWAP. In
addition, it would be contrary to the need to increase the coordination and integration between NASCOP
and the DPHC. Finally, it would be a perpetuation of the "business-as-usual" attitude which has been
- 18 -



documented to have had unsatisfactory outcomes in all IDA's previous health and population projects in
Kenya. Such a compartmentalized, project-focused approach would run contrary to the lessons learned
from earlier operations.
HIVIAIDS Project to Encompass both Medical and Non-Medical Aspects (combining the Kenya
HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project and the HIV/AIDS Component of DARE)
As discussed earlier, it was decided that the health-specific HIV/AIDS interventions would better fit into a
vertical health project, leaving the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project to take a horizontal approach
focusing solely on the multi-sectoral non-medical aspects. Thus, there are several reasons why this
approach was rejected. Firstly, it would have still resulted in two projects. IDA support was required
through a health credit to support the MoH is implementing its National Health Sector Strategic Plan, and
the Decentralization aspects were vital to addressing the CAS-related goal of improved economic
govemance in the health sector. Projects supported under the Bank's multi-country HIV/AIDS umbrella
operation must have a more specific focus on AIDS; furthermore, it would be unwise to develop such a
complicated project as to incorporate the multi-sectoral aspect of the AIDS response, the health aspect, and
the broader needs of the health sector.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Main lessons learned from the two recently- closed projects (Cr. 21 10-KE, Fourth Population Project; and
Cr. 23 10-KE, Health Rehabilitation Project) and from the project currently under implementation (Cr.
2686-KE, Sexually-Transmitted Infections Project) include:
(i)    Stakeholder Consultation. Key stakeholders, particularly those with an important role in
implementation. should be involved from project identification, through preparation and appraisal,
and throughout implementation. This need is being addressed through the Participation Action
Plan and the broad participation in project preparation, as detailed elsewhere in this document.
(ii)    Monitorable Indicators. Clearly defined performance indicators should be agreed upon at
appraisal to ensure effective and timely implementation, and to enable proper monitoring. Annual
workplans/implementation plans also contribute to the depth and quality of supervision.
Monitorable indicators have been included in Annex 1 and will continue to be refined. A rolling
two-year implementation plan/workplan will be used by the projcct.
(iii)   Procurement, Contract Management and Logistics. The employment of an independent
- 20 -



procurement agency should be considered whenever appropriate. The Bank and the GoK have
agreed to employ a procurement agent for all IDA-financed procurement under the project. In
addition, past expenrence has shown the need for more intense supervision at the contract stage
(after IDA's "no-objection" is given) to ensure timely completion of the procurement. Finally, large
IDA-financed procurements in recent years have revealed a need for better planning and capacity
building in logistics and supplies management (post-delivery of goods). A logistics management
consultancy has already been floated and will be awarded for this purpose under the project.
(iv)   Financial Management. The inuroduction of a streamlined payment procedure, establishment of a
payment application (PA) tracking system, and regular reporting on the performance of the system
have been agreed and implemented. An action plan, with agreed outcomes, to address the financial
management system within the MoH has been agreed upon, and progress to date is satisfactory.
Finally, as has been the case across IDA's Kenya portfolio, past experience has demonstrated a
need to ensure a timely flow of funds to the project and, in cases of decentralized activities, on
down to the districts. The MoFP has recently released a circular intended to address this issue.
MoH has implemented this circular under the STI Project, reviewed its effectiveness, and issued
recommendations for its strengthening.
(v)    Importance of Close Monitoring and Supervision. The experience of the projects in the health
portfolio clearly demonstrates the direct relationship between intensified supervision and
implementation progress. The achievements of the final years of implementation of the Fourth
Population Project and the Health Rehabilitation Project, and the improved relationship with the
Borrower are largely due to intensified supervision by IDA, and this intense supervision will be
carried over onto this project.
(vi)   Counterpart Funds. A further rationalization of the GoK's portfolio of projects, consistent with
the Bank's CAS, is required, as evidenced by the implementation delays caused by the
unavailability of the required GoK counterpart funding.
(vii)   Civil Works. Problems with civil works in previous projects have prevented them from
significantly contributing to the fulfillment of those projects' development objectives. No major
civil works are planned under this project. Any minor needs that might arise due to the projecfs
community-level focus would be handled through community-based procurement and management.
(viii)  Training. Training under previous projects proved overly-costly relative to the benefits, and was
not managed in a rational manner. No overseas training is envisioned under this project, and the
planned training will be directly related to the project's district focus and planned in a manner
consistent with the capacity needs of the relevant cadres of staff.
(ix)   Donor Coordination. Donor coordination should be maintained throughout project
implementation, particularly with regard to procurement planning, policy, common implementation
constraints, and project restructuring. This should include a diligent effort on the part of the
Borrower to coordinate IDA-financed goods and services with those provided by donors, thus
ensuring an efficient, prioritized response to the country's needs. There must also be sufficient
communication and consultation within the MoH regarding the goods and services to be procured.
Given the project's envisioned role in advancing the country's health sector reform agenda, ongoing
coordination will take place within the framework of the Health Sector Reform working group and
regular IDA-donor meetings. The more comprehensive focus on health care delivery, both in terms
of the increased coordination and integration within MoH and the decentralization of planning and
resources, will address the problem of earlier projects with regard to insufficient intra-Ministry
consultation and coordination on procurement decisions.
- 21 -



(x)    Inter-Dependence of Components. When the ability of one component to achieve its objectives is
dependent on the success of another component, the relationship between the components must be
considered at appraisal and throughout implementation, with particular attention to: (a) timing of
activities in one component relative to those in the other; (b) relative degrees of preparation; (c)
relative levels of capacity; and (d) susceptibility of each component to risks relative to the other.
Given the comprehensive, integrated nature of this project, failure in one component would hinder
the others. Therefore, particular care has been taken during preparation and appraisal to ensure a
consistent level of preparedness and to ensure that the necessary capacity is in place at all levels.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The policy of decentralization features prominently in the 1994 Policy Framework Paper. Although it has
taken a considerable time to make progress in this area, recent developments indicate a renewed
commitment to decentralization. These developments include the issuing of legal notices and ministerial
circulars establishing DHMB, District Hospital Boards and Rural HFC; defining the legal framework for
fiscal decentralization and devolution, and the MoH Decentralization Workshop in Mombassa in March
2000. In addition, the MoFP has shown to be responsive to the analysis of the Task Force, exploring the
problems related to the flow of funds to the districts, by issuing Treasury Circular No. 3/2000 aimed at
assuring the availability of funds at district level. As a positive evaluation of the new arrangements was a
condition for negotiations, reasonable assurances have been obtained for the proper functioning of
arrangements for the flow of funds to districts. Commitment and ownership with regard to the
decentralization issue has recently been further demonstrated by the decision, at the Ministry's initiative, to
pilot a next stage in decentralization, devolution, by providing block grants to fourteen districts.
Kenya's Parliament has adopted the National Policy on HIV/AIDS in 1997, as reflected in the Sessional
Paper on AIDS, and the NASCOP has elaborated its HIV/AIDS strategy. These documents provide the
strategic guidance for the district workplans that will be supported through this project. Kenya's
leadership, from the Head of State to the private and religious organizations, speak out on the HIV/AIDS
issue more frequently than ever before, and the FY2000/200 1 budget estimates include significant support
to the NACC. The private sector, religious organizations, NGO community, network of people living with
HIV/AIDS and various government agencies are represented in the Council.
Kenya endorsed the Reproductive Health Agenda as elaborated during the 1994 International Conference
on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. As a result, and in order to incorporate other
reproductive health issues into Kenya's population program, the GoK brought together experts to draft a
new National Reproductive Health Strategy. This strategy has now been elaborated, and implementation at
district level is on-going in selected districts with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) support. The
strategy and implementation plan were developed with active participation by all Provincial and District
Health Teams, a process that was finalized in 1998 and supported under the Fourth Population Project.
Similarly, the MoH has adopted the IMCI strategy and has chosen three districts for the initial phase of
introducing this approach.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The project builds upon the experience and knowledge gained from previous projects (Health Rehabilitation
and Population I-IV), ongoing projects (STI) and sector work conducted by the MoH, the Bank and
bilateral donors. Specific studies and documents include: (i) the Bank's CAS which brought out the issue
of governance as a major constraint to effective development; (ii) the Bank's involvement in the efforts to
improve financial management and fiscal decentralization under the STI Project; (iii) the development of
the NHSSP and the preparations for the elaboration of a MTEF; and (iv) the Budget Analysis Study, the

The lessons learned from granting autonomy to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) will be relevant under
the decentralization component when facilitating the autonomy for provincial and distnrct hospitals.
Experience with decentralization issues in other countries, like Zambia and Uganda, is an advantage of the
Bank that the Borrower has shown appreciation for and would like to exploit. Donor agencies have pointed
to the relative advantage of the Bank in facilitating changes related to government structures and
procedures.
Finally, the Bank has taken the lead in the re-orientation of the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic from a
medical issue to a development one. The launch in Nairobi of the Bank's regional AIDS strategy, "
Intensifying Acrion Against AIDS in Africa", was well received by both the Govemment and the private
sector, as well as by the bilateral and multilateral donors. Through the Bank's regional "AIDS Campaign
Team" (ACTafrica) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Bank is well
positioned to make regional issues and experiences available to the project. In addition, the STI Project has
been re-worked since its Mid-Tenn Review to concentrate on the creation of an enabling environment for
the expansion of the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The project would build on the recognized
achievements in this area.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
* Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
Not all the interventions supported by the project are amenable for a cost-benefit analysis. The conducted
analysis applied only to the following three interventions:
(i)    condom distribution    NPV = US$ 911 million, IRR= 42%
(ii)   blood safety         NPV = US$ 60 million, IRR = 30.7%
(iii)   safe motherhoodNPV = US$ 12 million, IRR = 86%
In the case of the IMCI subcomponent, benefits remain unknown. The World Health Organization (WHO)
is currently conducting several studies to estimate these benefits. The Bank's assessment was limited to the
start-up cost of the intervention in three districts. This includes the implementation of six IMCI training
courses per district (each including 20 health workers), and six follow-ups to health facilities. In addition,
10 facilitators and 10 district supervisors will be trained in each district. Thus, a total of 420 health
workers will be trained. The cost per health worker is estimated at close to US$ 1,5 00. The intervention
will potentially benefit a total of 233,000 children. While expected benefits remain unknown, there are
reasons for optimism. First, the therapeutic and preventive elements that make IMCI are accepted
practices. Second, preliminary studies suggest that the training provided through IMCI does change the
behavior of health workers (see Annex 4).
Districts Work Plans. The project allocates over US$ 17 million to finance district inibatives. The
distribution of these resources across districts will be based on a close set of social and economic
indicators. Given that the use of resources will be fully determined by districts, it is unknown at this time
which are the specific interventions that will be targeted. However, health sector indicators show that the
interventions supported, cover some of the main causes of death in Kenya. The data also show that the
shares of expenditures for the conditions supported by the project are low relative to their contribution to
the burden of disease. Thus, the allocations promoted by the project are likely to increase levels of
- 23 -



efficiency in the use of resources within the health sector (see Annex 4).
In terms of the decentralization component, there have not been studies, to our knowledge, relating
decentralization indicators to health outcome indicators. This complicates the assessment of potential
economic benefits. Analysis suggests that fiscal decentralization is associated with improvements in health
indicators such as the infant mortality rates. However, there are four basic pre-conditions: (i) the
management capacity of the receiving government; (ii) the existence of regional planning practices; (iii) the
existence of transfer mechanisms from rich regions to poor regions; and (iv) strong leadership from MoH
(see Annex 4).
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV-US$ million; FRR= % (see Ainex 4)
Flow of Resources to Districts. The experience of the STI project, as well as other IDA-financed projects
in other sectors, with regard to the flow of resources to districts has been unsatisfactory. In 1998, this
situation resulted in the GoK establishing a MoFP-led Task Force to examine the issue, and the
recommendations of that task force led to, among other efforts, a treasury circular designed to ease the flow
of funds to projects at the district level. When that circular proved ineffective, a revised circular was
issued in March 2000. The GoK has provided reasonable assurances on the effectiveness of the new
mechanisms by submitting to IDA an evaluation of the experiences under the STI Project during the first
six months since the implementation of the circular. Based on this evaluation, recommendations have been
formulated for the improvement of the mechanism, and these have been incorporated into the project's
financial management action plan. The effectiveness in the long run will depend, to a great extent, on the
provisions for timely reimbursement mechanisms. As part of the decentralization component, it is expected
that benchmarks will be established regarding the percentage of funds that flow to the districts, and the
MoH has already initiated, as discussed elsewhere in this document, a plan to pilot increased decentralized
managerial and financial control in eight districts. The timely release of project funds from the MoH
Project Account to the district project accounts will be addressed as a covenant in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA).
Flow of Resources to Project Accounts. Due to the GoK's policy of prohibiting management of foreign
exchange accounts by line-ministries and the unsatisfactory management of these accounts by the Ministry
of Finance and Planning, implementation of current projects across IDA's Kenya portfolio have been
constrained by the slow flow of funds from the Special Account to the project. This resulted in virtually no
IDA resources being disbursed in the first quarter of FY 1999-2000. Given that this defeats the purpose of
the Special Account and poses a risk to project implementation, IDA is pursuing, on a portfolio-wide basis,
a permanent solution to this problem. As an interim measure, the treasury circular mentioned in the above
paragraph provides for local-currency project accounts (which draw from the project Special Accounts) to
be established to provide for line-ministries' project financing needs. MoH has established such an account
for the STI Project, and its effectiveness has been assessed as satisfactory. The timely release of project
funds from Treasury to the MoH project will be addressed as a covenant in the DCA.
Financial Managemnent. The ICRs for recently-closed projects in the Kenyan health sector have all
highlighted the weaknesses in the MoH's financial management. Consequently, preparation of the DARE
project has focused heavily on financial management within MoH and developing an Action Plan to
address the shortcomings prior to project effectiveness. The financial management action plan is available
in the project files. Overall progress against this Action Plan has been assessed as satisfactory.
DistrictlLocal Financial Capacity. The Borrower, the Bank, and other development partners have
- 24 -



developed, as part of the Decentralization Action Plan, a schedule to improve the capacity of districts (and
other local "points" of decentralization), facilities, etc., to fulfill the roles and responsibilities that will be
assigned to them under the decentralization component. The implementation of this action plan is
anticipated to bring the relevant capacity up to the necessary levels.
Criteria for Budget Allocation to Districts. In order to ensure that the project, particularly the
decentralization component and district workplans, are able to achieve the development objectives, IDA has
focused during preparation on the need for transparent, rational criteria for the allocation of MoH budget to
districts. The current system is highly inequitable and completely lacking in transparency. A set of limited
criteria has been adopted by the MoH and endorsed by IDA. The appraisal mission has reviewed the
MoH's proposed weighing of those criteria and plan for the implementation of these criteria in the budget
process. It is expected that they will begin to be phased in for the allocation of the GoK funds in FY200 1.
These criteria have already formed the basis for the selection of the eight Phase 1 decentralization districts,
and will be the basis for the allocation of credit funds to districts for district workplans beginning with the
first year of the project.
Increased Flexibility in Management of Funds by Districts and Facilities. To date, the problem of
meager allocation of funds to districts and facilities has been compounded by the over-specification by the
center of the categories of expenditure. Reallocation across categories proved nearly impossible, as it
would require traveling to Nairobi and navigating the MoH bureaucracy for the necessary approvals. It
was, therefore, agreed with both the MoH and MoFP during the pre-appraisal mission that the dozens of
categories would be reduced to 9 for budgeting purposes, thus providing staff on the ground increased
flexibility and discretion over the use of funds. This will first be implemented in the Phase I districts and
subsequently rolled out to all districts.
Financing of Autonomous InstitutionslKNH. The MoH's plans for decentralization includes the
autonomization of provincial hospitals based on the experience of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) --
with some facilities already undergoing the transition, During preparation, IDA addressed the issue of the
over-reliance of KNEI on the central MoH budget and an agreement was reached with MoH to reduce this
reliance by reducing KNHls share of the MoH recurrent budget from over 15 percent to 12 percent by the
end of 2003, and to 10 percent by 2005. Also, with regard to the conversion of other facilities to
autonomous institutions, MoH has decided not to increase the current level of budgetary support to tertiary
and provincial hospitals during the coming four ycars.
Sustainable Financing of Population Supplies. The Fourth Population Project Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) made the point that the GoK had done little to address the need for a sustainable
supply of contraceptive supplies at a time when their need was growing and donor funds were expected to
shrink. In order to ensure that the new project contributes toward the desired sustainability, there have
been discussions during preparation with the GoK and development paitners on the specific actions/policies
that will lead to a more sustainable financing of essential inputs. These discussions and the GoK's adoption
of the MTEF both point to the need for improved planning and coordination, and the Ministry -- along with
its development partners -- have begun the process of formulating a commodities strategy which is expected
to guide the Ministry in this planning and coordination in a consistent, prioritized, and transparent wayv
GoK Financing of the Battle Against HIV/AIDS. So far, the GoK financing of NASCOP and other
HIV/AIDS activities has been inadequate, with an excessive reliance on donor funds. Funds were included
in FY1999-2000 budget for the establishment of the NACC, and this body was indeed established.
Further, significant funds were included in the FY2000-2001 budget for the administration of NACC.
However, the GoK's commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS as reflected in its financing of NACC,
- 25 -



NASCOP, and other HIV/AIDS efforts will continue to be monitored. This discussion has also been taken
up in the context of the proposed Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Credit (PRSSC) and the
multi-sectoral Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project.
Fiscal Impact:
The fiscal impacts of the DARE project are relatively minor, in part because disbursements per year
represent a small share (4 percent) of the health budget. More than 20 percent of the project's budget will
be used to respond to the increasing need for resources to procure condoms and HIV rapid test kits, without
generating recurrent costs. An additional nearly 30 percent will be allocated to district HIV/AIDS/RH and
workplans and provincial decentralization workplans. The restrictions on these funds will prevent their use
on capital items likely to incur significant -ecurrent expenditures. The remaining funds will be allocated to
reproductive health and IMCI, research, and capacity building. Recurrent costs from this allocation are
expected to be less than 20 percent of the project's annual expenditure on these items, which represents less
than 1 percent of the MoH budget.
Nonetheless, the GoK will continue to face the challenge of financing the supply of condoms,
HIV/AIDS/STI/TB test kits and other essential supplies. Given that the DARE project is expected to
increase the speed at which information about HIV/AIDS diffuses through the population, the demand for
these commodities and associated subsidies will also increase (see Annex 4A for an econometric analysis of
the demand for condoms). Table I in Annex 4 summarizes the fiscal impacts of the DARE project as well
as the expected level of subsidies. The fundamental assumption to construct the table is that, within the
medium-term expenditure framework, health sector expenditures will remain constant in real terms. Given
an economic growth rate of 1.4 percent per year, the share of total government expenditures is expected to
decrease.
3. Technical:
The technical components that will be supported by the project all have a strong tcchnical underpinning,
achieved through elaborate processes of analyses, and policy and strategy formulations. The umbrella
NHSSP as well as the strategic plans for RH, HIV/AIDS and IMCI have all been elaborated and
extensively reviewed. The WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, EU, and numerous bilateral partners (USAID,
DFID, GTZ, SIDA, CIDA, among others) have provided technical assistance and are likely to remain
involved in efforts to improve the technical aspects of the relevant programs.
Capacity Building and Training Packages. A clear definition of functions, roles, and responsibilities for
the various implementing agencies must be agreed upon with the various stakeholders before meaningful
details can be elaborated that specify the capacity building components of the project. During the
preparation of the project, consensus has been sought on the roles and responsibilities of the various
categories of organizations and staff, the applicable minimum required skills and training levels, and the
training packages that will be offered to those organizations and staff that do not meet those minimum
requirements. This process is expected to continue throughout the project period with a view to remain
focused on improving performance. Particular attention will be given to capacity building needs associated
with the decentralization and devolution aspects of the project. The main focus of all capacity building
activities will be staff below the central level, with the principal mode of training envisioned being local
training specifically related to the identified capacity needs; no overseas or degree training is envisioned
under this project. As an alternative, options of in-service training and the use of distance learning tools
will be explored.
Performance of Districts. One of the risks associated with decentralization relates to the ability to hold
- 26 -



provincial and district personnel accountable for outcomes, in particular given their limited authority over
staff. Recent changes in personnel regulations grant increased authority over personnel at those levels;
however, guidelines and training for field offices need to be prepared in order for them to be able to
maximize the benefits of these changes. In addition, the annual performance review mechanism is being
amended to be more consistent with the principles of Decentralization. The issue of how to respond to
non-performing districts was discussed with the central Ministry and Provincial Medical Officers. It was
agreed that, in such circumstances, the Provincial Medical Officers would assist the districts in analyzing
the reasons for non-performance and in elaborating a plan of action to address the constraints. Disciplinary
action will be taken where appropriate and possibilities will be explored to minimize a high tum-over of
staff, and reward good performance.
Deliveries Attended to by Qualified Staff. The project aims to increase the percentage of deliveries
attended to by qualified staff as the major intervention to decrease matemal mortality. Options to achieve
this aim include, among others, training of (insufficiently qualified) staff, redistribution of qualified staff,
increasing the utilization of existing facilities, improving communication and referral systems, and the
upgrading of health facilities. With the assistance of the Provincial Medical Officers, the project will
encourage a system of maternal death audits with a view to assisting districts in choosing the most
appropriate mix of options.
Selection of Drugs for Opportunistic Infections, STIs, Malaria, Upper Respiratory Infections, HIV
Test Kits. etc. Throughout the implementation of the project, consensus will be sought arnong all
stakeholders on the selection of the most appropriate drugs and HIV test material in order to harmonize the
specifications of basic input requirements. Established guidelines and WVO recommendations will be
followed as much as possible.
Medium-Term Procurement Planning. Procurement of major inputs such as condoms, vaccines, drugs,
family planning commodities and test kits, will be based on medium-term (three to five years) requirement
forecasts and expenditure plans. This would involve the establishment of a resource envelope, including
the contributions from the GoK and the major donors. The MoH has taken the lead in this exercise during
project preparation with a view to building on it and arriving at a more comprehensive medium-term
expenditure framework for the whole sector. These are expected to result in a medium-term
pharmaceutical procurement plan coordinating inputs from all development partners and the GoK, and this
planning will be complemented by a focus on sustainability of supply particularly with regard to family
planning commodities.
Parent-To-Child Transmission (PTCT) of HIV. Various options for the prevention of PTCT do exist,
including schemes that require the use of anti-retrovirals and abstinence from breast-feeding. Since many
questions remain to be answered about the ultimate benefits of these options and the need to provide care
for mothers, the project will only consider pilot schemes for the prevention of PTCT in the context of
district workplans. However, in view of the rapid development of alternatives, changes during the course
of project implementation may have to be considered.
NGO/CBO/ROs. The efforts to involve NGOs, CBOs, ROs and the private sector in the implementation
of the STI Project have not resulted in a substantial and effective partnership between these organizations
and the public sector. At the same time, it is clear that the public sector will not be able to provide the care
and support needed, especially for those affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In order to increase the
capacity of the sector to respond to increasing demands, the project will encourage districts to seek
opportunities and modalities to improve and expand the partnership with NGOs/CBOs/ROs. Based on
workplans of such partners, and upon review and approval by the DHMB, financial support can be
- 27 -



provided through the Grant-in-Aid mechanism.
4. Institutional:
An assessment of the institutions and organizations that may be involved in the implementation of the
project has been conducted. Its findings were consistent with the results of Phase 1 of the Participation
Action Plan, indicating that very little interaction exists between the various health boards/committees and
civil society. It reinforced that the DARE team was correct in placing systemic reform at the front of the
project preparation agenda, echoing much of what IDA has been raising with the GoK. The report stated
that the institutional capacity to implement the project was constrained by poor financial management,
weak accountability, failure to involve district and facility-levels in decision-making, and lack of
coordination among departments.
The institutional assessment provided recommendations on ways and means to improve or create an
effective interface between civil society and the public service from the institutional and organizational
perspective. The monitoring and evaluation activities under the project, and the related final phases of the
Participation Action Plan, incorporate these recommendations into the plan for district surveys and
stakeholder assessments to be conducted as part of routine monitoring of the project. In addition, the
significant role of NGO/CBOs under DARE in strengthening the links between civil society and the public
health sector will be also address these issues. Three contracts have been tendered -- and are ready to sign
at Effectiveness-- which will contract out key implementation activities under the HIV/AIDS Component to
NGOs at the national level. In addition, the district workplans supported by the HIV/AIDS and RH
components will be able to finance small contracts to NGO/CBOs at the district level. Lessons from
similar arrangements under the STI Project point to several issues which needed to be addressed under
DARE: the need for increased transparency and clear guidelines for districts in financing NGO/CBOs.
The transparency issue is being addressed presently, in preparation for Effectiveness, by involving DHMBs
in the formulation and approval of TORs for the activities to be contracted out to NGO/CBOs. Also, the
HSRS, within the central Ministry, is formulating guidelines which will be disseminated to districts for
their use in formulating workplans.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The HSRS has been a weak spot within the Ministry, resulting in slow implementation of the country's
health sector reform program. Much of the issue was related to attempts by HSRS to overstretch its
mandate as a secretariat and actually manage the implementation of reforms. The new leadership has
inspired confidence that these weaknesses are being addressed, and HSRS should be better positioned to
play a strong role in the new project. Progress has been made, though it remains clear that the HSRS still
requires additional support to coordinate among the various departments/divisions. While the proposed
project management arrangements address this to a degree, the MoH has recognized the need for the HSRS
to play a stronger role in effectively coordinating GoK and DP inputs in taking forward the
Decentralization agenda. Therefore, parallel to the preparation of this project, the Ministry has drafted a
Strategy for Strengthening the Capacity of the HSRS which, consistent with IDA's institutional assessment,
identifies the technical expertise, skills, and experience required by HSRS. It contains a specific action
plan for strengthening the HSRS, including (i) steps to be taken by MoH leadership in supporting the unit
and (ii) the appropriate composition of the HSRS and a Technical Support Team. The Ministry has thus
specifically requested that the DflD provide flexible technical assistance support to strengthen the capacity
of the HSRS to effectively carry out these functions. DflD has enthusiastically responded to this request
and will take the opportunity to work in close collaboration with the World Bank in terms ofjoint
monitoring of the respective IDA-financed and DfID-financed inputs. Finally, the recently-completed legal
review identified the legal and regulatory constraints to the envisioned reforms, including decentralization.
An action plan to address these issues was expected to have been formulated by this point, but the HSRS
- 28 -



has been unable to produce it. Given that the limited reforms envisioned under this project have been
pursued in parallel to this process, this delay does not negatively impact the DARE project. However, the
project and task team will continue to support the process as a necessary step towards the future envisioned
support to the MoH's health sector reform program.
With regard to the ST1/HIV/AIDS component, the long-delayed formation of the NACC is now underway.
The NACC was named in December 1999, and a Secretariat is now being recruited. Concurrently, staff
for AIDS Control Units (ACUs) in several ministries are also being recruited, with roles and
responsibilities clearly delineated. As thc achievement of the objectives pursued under the DARE project
also depend on the extent to which an enabling environment has been created for behavior change, the
effectiveness of the response to the epidemic beyond the health sector, as co-ordinated by the NACC, will
be crucial for the success of the HIV/AIDS component under this project. While this multi-sectoral
response is more closely linked to the Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project, the two projects will be
implemented and monitored in parallel, given that the success of each will further the objectives of both.
NASCOP's capacity to govem the MoH-specific response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic also needs to be
strengthened. WVhile it was initially a department within the MoH, it became a division under the
Department of Preventive and Promotive Health Services in 1997. Access by the program manager to the
MoHWs top leadership consequently became more restricted, and budget allocations to the division came
exclusively through the recurrent budget. Although the STI Project was set up to function within
NASCOP and under its leadership, the fact that access, if any, to project funds was merely indirect, caused
the national program to be disregarded as an important partner in the dialogue. Support through a
management consultancy arrangement, financed by DflD, has similarly failed in strengthening NASCOP's
position. It is necessary to take concrete steps to better position, equip, and mandate NASCOP to fulfill its
role in an effective campaign against the HIV epidemic. While these steps are envisioned under the DARE
Project, it was determined that it would place too much administrative strain on this unit to force it to
unnecessarily coordinate its health-specific activities through the context of the multi-sector AIDS project.
Therefore, having a separate HIV/AIDS component under the DARE project will enable the unit to focus
on building capacity while implementing its activities in a familiar manner, with less risk, and enabling it to
focus on better integrating its functions within MoH.
Another institutional weakness relates to the DPHC. This largely donor-supported division of the MoH has
been severely disconnected from the rest of the Ministry, often operating in a manner akin to a donor
Project Implementation Unit. Supervision of IDA-financed activities under this division has been
unsatisfactory in the past, and the preparation of this project demonstrated that this unit threatens to be the
weak link in the project. Efforts throughout preparation to focus on increased coordination and integration
between the DPHC and NASCOP have been unsuccessful, and areas of responsibility that required
collaboration (such as condoms) have largely been transferred to NASCOP. Although the MoH is
committed to address these shortcomings, the final project design will provide for a diminished role for this
unit at the center. The implementation of this component will focus mostly on district-level implementation
of workplans and centralized procurement to be coordinated by the procurement agent. Meanwhile, the
MoH continues to work with IDA and other stakeholders to effect the desired improvements that relate to
this unit.

4.2 Project management:
The proposed project management arrangements have been devised to address the constraints detailed
above to the extent possible. These arrangements are detailed earlier in this document in Section C.4
"Institutional and Implementation Arrangements" and depicted in the accompanying Figure 1.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Due to a lack of capacity to manage procurement under IDA guidelines and a history of corrupt
procurement practices, IDA initiated the hiring of a procurement agent in 1996 for the three IDA health
projects then under supervision. Given that this arrangement proved successful and continues to contribute
to implementation success under the STI Project, and that procurement has not been defined as a core
function of the government, it has been agreed that a procurement agent will be employed to manage all
procurement under the DARE Project as well. The contract for the procurement agent under the STI
project has been amended to include procurement activities initiated during the preparation period. It is
expected that all major tenders will have been floated prior to Effectiveness and that it will not be necessary
to float a new tender for these services. The large quantity of IDA-financed procurement in the sector in
recent years has revealed a need to focus on logistics management, and the management and distribution of
these supplies has not always been satisfactory. The current procurement agent has stepped in to fill these
needs on an ad hoc basis, but a better planned, more strategic arrangement is necessary to build capacity
for these functions and, in the interim, fulfill the function. A tender has been floated and evaluated for a
logistics management contract, and will be awarded once the project becomes effective.
The project does include limited support for the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA), the
restructured and autonomous Medical Supplies Coordinating Unit (MSCU). The performance of this unit
in the past has been unsatisfactory, and a decision was made that it could not be entrusted with the
procurement and distribution of IDA-financed goods. It is hoped that the restructured KEMSA will be able
to fulfill this role, and the new project support will contribute toward this end. However, at the present
time, despite the issuance of a legal notice announcing KEMSA to be autonomous, actual progress toward
the restructuring is plagued with delays and a lack of coherent vision for the new agency. Most of the
support under the credit will be contingent on the completion of a satisfactory business plan for KEMSA.
A Procurement Capacity Assessment was prepared for this project. A summary of the findings of that
assessment appear in Annex 6.
4.4 Financial management issues:
Overall the project will satisfy the Banks' ninimum financial management requirements, but with risks
limited to general capacity shortcomings that have been experienced in the Implementing Ministry (MoH),
- 32 -



that have in the past resulted in errors, omissions, miscalculations, late submission of financial statements,
and financial statements that do not reach acceptable standards. Successful implementation of the
financial management action plan (see project files) will allow the project to satisfy the Bank's minimum
requirements under OP/BP1O.02. The Financial management system will be able to produce a Project
Financial Statement, including Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds, Uses of Funds by Project
Component, Project Account Reconciliation Statement, Cash Withdrawal Statement, and Cash Forecast.
The Chart of Accounts will facilitate the presentation of summary expenditures by Component, Activity
and Disbursement Category.
As part of actions required to meet requirements for PMR-based Disbursement, a dedicated project
accounting system to be used by the project will be developed. The project accounting structure will be
fully integrated to reflect the type of project, sources of funds, and the relevant expense accounts, broken
down into various types of expenditures for the project.
Project Planning and Budgeting. The project financial management system will be documented in the
Manual of Financial Procedures, covering Financial Policies and Procedures; Accounting and Intemal
Control Systems; Budgeting System; Procurement and Contract Administration and Monitoring System;
Financial Reporting; Flow of Funds; and Auditing Arrangements. The Manual will contain statements and
explanations of the project's budgetary policies and procedures; describing responsibilities for budget
preparation, adoption, execution, monitori ig and reporting.
Disbursements, Replenishments and Documentation. Although it would have been desirable to have
PMR-based Disbursement from the beginning of the Project, there is not in place a financial management
system that can provide the information required by the World Bank for the LACI-based Project
Management Reporting (PMR) disbursement mechanism. Thus, in the short-term, existing disbursement
procedures, as outlined in the World Bank's Disbursement Handbook, i.e. Direct Payment, Reimbursement
and Special Commitment (if appropriate), will be followed. A financial management action plan was
discussed and agreed with the MoH. Successful implementation of the action plan will ensure that the
Bank's minimum financial management requirements will be met; and facilitate the introduction of
PMR-based Disbursement within 18 months of Credit effectiveness. During the transition period
disbursement of funds would be made against Withdrawal Applications with full documentation or against
SOEs submitted by the borrower. This action plan is available in the project files.
5. Environmental:                  Environmental Category: C (Not Required)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EM P preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The proper treatment and disposal of medical and hazardous waste by hospital and health clinic staff is an
issue that requires increased attention. This is particularly true for material that may harbor HIV or
Hepatitis B virus, such as needles, syringes, gloves and other waste that may contain blood products.
Inappropriate handling of such materials constitute a risk not only for those involved in waste handling, but
also for those outside the health profession who become exposed to this waste, not infrequently children.
The MoH, in partnership with USAID, DflID, DANIDA and the World Bank, is anticipating a
comprehensive review of the medical supply system and the problem of medical waste treatment and
disposal will feature prominently in both the assessment and the related policy dialogue. In parallel to
centrally elaborated waste management guidelines, there will be an explicit effort to involve DHMBs,
Hospital Management Boards and Rural HFCs in addressing any constraints to their application.

N/A
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Gender is a key issue in all components of the DARE Project.
HIV/AIDS. There is an extremely high seroprevalence rate among women, particularly young women in
Kenya. The DARE Project aims to reverse this trend by targeting women with resources through
institutions that are close to them.
Reproductive Health. This component will target mother-and-child health by focusing on women of
reproductive age and expectant mothers, and increasing the accessibility of these services to women
recognizing the influence that women have on child health. The impact of these interventions will be
measured through gender disaggregated performance indicators.
Decentralization. The other important issue to the achievement of project objectives has to do with the
inclusion of communities (including women) in the health-care management. In preparation of the DARE
Project, the GoK commissioned a study, FASI 1999, to gather views from stakeholders at the community
level from geographically-different areas. Lack of community involvement in determining their needs,
management of health-care facilities and lack of information on services available were cited as
contributing factors to lack of accountability on the part of health providers, general resource
mismanagement and poor quality of services.
Through implementation of the decentralized program, the necessary interface between communities and
public health services will be emphasized. The MoH must exarnine the membership of all management
structures -- these must be open to communities and allow inclusion of those whom they elect to represent
them. Promotion of community participation will improve transparency in systems and accountability of
funds, and will make health workers more accountable to the communities in the delivery of services.
A related and significant issue is accessibility of resources, coverage and equitable distribution of resources
to the poor and vulnerable in both the rural and urban areas (47 percent of Kenyans fall below poverty
line). In order to reduce vulnerability and maximize impact on these groups, a new pro-poor criteria in
allocation of resources to the district will be adopted. This criteria is based on five indicators: total
population, share of population under five, share of population of women in reproductive age, share of
population below the poverty line, and AIDS prevalence. In the urban areas of Nairobi, support will go to
facilities in the low-income slum areas where the poor reside.

6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
There has been good consultation with various stakeholders in the design and preparation of the DARE
Project through consultative workshops and seminars. This process began back in 1994 with the
formulation of various GoK health sector documents that have provided information useful to the design of
this project (1994 Kenya Health Policy Framnework, 1999-2000 Health Sector Strategic Plan, 1999
National Poverty Eradication Plan, 1997- 2010 National Reproductive Health Strategy, 1999 Reproductive
Health Needs Assessment - preliminary and 1997 HlV/AIDS Session Paper). As part of project
preparation, a Participatory Study was undertaken to capture views of various stakeholders in three
Districts in Kenya (FASI 1999). This inclusive stakeholder engagement will be maintained during
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of DARE along the following participation map:

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
During preparation of the DARE Project, an NGOs/CBOS working group was convened by the MoH to
advise on how to effectively engage NGOs/CBOs and ROs. The report of this group was informative:
those organizations that are able to mobilize or have resources of their own will be encouraged to
co-finance and also provide technical support for various activities.
For those NGOs/CBOs who will collaborate in the implementation of the DARE utilizing GoK resources,
the NGO/CBO working group suggested that the HAPAC Model be utilized where NGOs/CBOs with or
without capacity are well supported through different schemes.
(i)    Category A: NGOs/CBOs with full capacity to implement DARE activities, the project will
directly disburse funds to national-level NGOs. A competitive selection process has been
completed, with proposals having already been evaluated. The contracts will be ready to sign at
Effectiveness.
(ii)    Category B: NGOs/CBOs with limited capacity to implement. Small grant schemes will be
developed so as to facilitate their participation and build capacity to overcome weaknesses.
Subcontract them as partners to Category A.
- 35 -



In order to achieve greater participation of these agencies, community organizations (including women
groups and their umbrella organizations) that are active and have particular interest in H1V/AIDS will be
identified, their needs assessed, and capacity building programs designed to address the gaps.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
According to the Institutional Assessment study, the implementing formal institutions for DARE have
weaknesses that must be addressed if project objectives are to be achieved (see Institutional Assessment for
details). At the community level, if the capacity-building approach suggested in Section 6.3 above is.
adopted, this will ensure outreach to communities for greater project impact.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation are provided in Annex 1. Feedback from communities will be
captured through bi-annual service delivery surveys that will be conducted in the life of the project. The
project will, however, benefit from adopting a participatory monitoring and evaluation approach that would
include stakeholders, particularly at the community level. Much of this will be possible through the
decentralized structures - Provincial Intersectoral AIDS Committees (PIACs), DHMTs, DIMBs and the
District Intersectoral Aids Committes (DIACs) which should ensure feedback from stakeholders at this
level. The approach to participatory monitoring and evaluation will involve agreement among stakeholders
on what is going to be monitored, how information will be collected and analyzed, and very importantly,
how actions will be taken.
7. Safeguard Policies:

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The MoH's commitment to and ownership of the issues addressed within the context of the project has
extended beyond the central Ministry to involve provincial and district levels. While the focus will be on
building district capacity and improving their performance as health providers, it is important that the
transition from a centrally-controlled system be carefully managed in order that current health
achievements are not lost and services are not disrupted within the communities. The change process
should be managed proactively so as to ensure ownership by both government and the communities they
represent. Many reforn programs fail duc to their inability to address the behavioral aspects of the change
process - the discomfort that managers and staff will experience will need to be balanced by mechanisms
which ensure focus on the strategic objective of improving the well-being of all Kenyans and the linkages of
this project to that objective.
The project will be a process - and action-oriented project with clear benchmarks for performance and
dynamic monitoring and review mechanisms that will form part of the institutional framework of the
reformed MoH. Clear accountability mechanisms will need to be established and the process must involve
all levels of management within the sector. The project process will aim to provide a leaming-by-doing
experience that allows a new organizational culture and management style to emerge. In order to do this,
the project will support the MoH to operationalize the proposed decentralized framework and build the
performance management framework of the project around the workplan process. The opportunities for
review and change during implementation will, therefore, be built into the policy, planning and budgeting
process of the MoH.
With the continued success of the population program the GoK has demonstrated that commitment and
ownership, together with a carefully-managed change process, achievements can be made to last. The
financial sustainability remains a challenge, both in view of the limitations in anticipated economic growth
in the immediate future, and in view of the increasing burden on the health sector as a result of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. The efficiency gains that may be achievable through the decentralization process are
unlikely to become evident until sufficient capacity has been built and new management arrangements are
fully operational. Furthermore, the efficiency gains resulting from better integration of NASCOP's
HIV/AIDS interventions into the broader program of the MoH should enhance the sustainability of both the
HIV/AIDS and RH components.
In order to address these uncertainties the MoH has put in place a number of mechanisms and processes
that will ensure the sustainability of the project's activities beyond the life of the project. These measures
include the engagement in the MTEF process, providing for a sustained budgetary focus on priority
activities such as those supported under the project. The transfer of budgetary resources from tertiary and
secondary level facilities to rural health facilities will strengthen the financial position of districts and
support the continuation of project activities. In addition, the project specifically targets the reduction of
inefficiencies incurred in the use of resources at district level by increasing financial management skills,
and providing for increased accountability and transparency. The shift from discrete project support
towards program support reduces the inefficiencies incurred at all levels of the service delivery system,
enabling the government to focus resource use towards priority programs. The combination of these
measures, all targeted towards the reduction of inefficiencies, seem appropriate in the Kenyan context and
sufficient to warrant the sustainability of the activities supported under this project.
The sustainable financing of essential inputs into the sector (equipment, drugs and commodities) will be
- 37 -



addressed in the context of developing a health sector financing strategy which aims to increase financial
resources for health as well as to support the effectiveness and equitable application of those resources in a
sustainable manner and with transparent anid fair mechanisms for ensuring access to health care by the
poor, including exemption criteria and/or improving access to prospective payment systems like
community-based funding or health insurance.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The allocation of resources to care and support for those infected and affected has been mentioned as
controversial as such use of resources does not, in a technical sense, contribute to the prevention of HIV
transmission. However, as the essential strategy for HIV/AIDS prevention is based on the promotion of
behavior change, technical interventions will be necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve the intended goal.
While it is acknowledged that the focus for public resource use should be aimed at preventive measures, it
is also realized that the public sector would not be a credible partner in bringing about the required
response if it does not care for those who are already infected and/or affected. MoH -- supported by its
partners -- has, therefore, taken the position that elaborate partnerships are needed and they require
providing whatever support it can afford to HIV-positive people and affected households.
Initially, there was some confusion about the delineation between the DARE and HIV/AIDS Disaster
Response Projects. However, once the reasoning behind the choice of two separate projects -- one focusing
on the non-medical multi-sectoral response, and the other focusing on the medical aspects of the response
integrated into the broader health program -- none of the stakeholders have expressed any opposition.

Annex 2. Detailed Project Description
KENYA: Decentralized Repr. Health and HIV/AIDS
The project will address urgent needs in the areas of HIV/AIDS and RH, while advancing the MoH's
reform program through the Decentralization component. By the end of the project, the Ministry is
expected to be prepared to implement a follow-on sector-wide Hcalth Sector Reform Credit. Coordination
among all development partners is ongoing, and the IDA Credit is expected to fill the gaps remaining from
grant financing.
Lessons from other countries indicate that, in the context of decentralization, emphasis on financial
accountability is necessary but not sufficient for bringing about desired improvements in health service
delivery. Accountability for performance is equally important, and the project therefore chooses to
combine the systems development component, focusing on decentralization, with two high-priority health
service delivery components, RH and HIV/AIDS. In addition to the focus on capacity building for
financial management, the project will therefore aim to create an environment in which performance
assessments are equally important. Both civil society, represented in DHMBs and HFCs, and the civil
service, through the Provincial Medical Offices, will be facilitated to develop the necessary capacity for
this purpose.
By Component:
Project Component I - US$7.50 million
Decentralization
This component will support the Govemment in implementing its decentralization policy by improving
mechanisms for fiscal decentralization, building capacity at provincial, district, and sub-district level for
results-oriented planning and financial management, organizational restructuring and systems development,
while promoting transparency and accountability for both resource use and performance.
Several activities related to the reform process and decentralization will be supported to involve all
distrcts. These include:
(i)    The adoption and application of a new set of resource allocation criteria. The project will support
the transition from the current practice of resource allocation based on historic pattems towards a
situation whereby resources are allocated according to objective, transparent, poverty-focused, and
rational criteria. For the geographic distribution of resources to individual districts, a district
resource allocation formula will be introduced, weighted for poverty, children under 5, women of
reproductive age, number of health facilities, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. These criteria will be
applied to the distribution of project resources throughout project implementation, and introduced
gradually for the allocation of the GoK health budget to districts, beginning in FY2001-2002.
(ii)    The MoH financial support to districts will be rationalized, whereby the traditionally over-itemized
non-wage recurrent budget will be simplified to reduce the number of line items to 9, thus allowing
for increased discretionary control by the districts to allocate and use resources. This measure can
come into effect by the beginning of the next Fiscal Year (2001/2002).
(iii)   The reform of the drug supply system will be addressed through limited support for the
restructuring of the MSCU/KEMSA, to support the transition to autonomy, and through the
support to the establishment of drug revolving funds in the periphery. Specific support activities
for KEMSA will be defined after the preparation and finalization of the KEMSA Business Plan.
- 49 -



(iv)   Capacity building activities at district and sub-district level will focus on training of DHMBs,
Hospital Management Boards and Rural Health Facility Committees and focus on financial
management, ensuring access to health care by the poor, drug management, community
involvement, transparency and results oriented health delivery management. Involvement by, and
feedback to, local communities in the management of health services will be promoted to improve
the appropriateness and transparency of public service delivery.
(v)    Provincial level involvement will be supported with a view to facilitate districts accessing policy
guidance, support for technical and managerial issues, and conducting performance reviews.
An intensified and expanded decentralization program will be established in eight IDA-financed "Phase 1"
districts, one in each province, and an additional 6 SIDA-financed districts. The key aspect of this program
in these 14 districts is the increased decentralization of planning and management of resources, as all
non-wage recurrent GoK funds will be allocated to these districts through a rationalized budget containing
a maximum of 9 line items. Additional IDA/SIDA funds will complement GoK funds in these budgets
through "district grants" (see criteria and terms below). This is a fundamental change from the current
system, in which the center allocates the district budget to a large number of over-specified line items in a
relatively inflexible system which makes reallocation across line items by districts difficult, thus impairing
the districts' ability to respond to their own unique and evolving needs. To address the need for increased
capacity at the districts in order for district-level staff to be able to fulfill their new responsibilities, the
Ministry has prepared a comprehensive 4-week health management program. Over the next 18 months, all
relevant district staff from these 14 districts, as well as additional districts as "Phase I Decentralization" is
rolled out further, will be provided this training through the KMTC. This intensified and expanded "Phase
I" program also includes provisions for: (i) the establishment of stakeholder forums at district level and
further refinement of the institutional arrangements at district and sub-district level; (ii) intensive
monitoring of health expenditures through District Health Expenditure Reviews; (iii) delegation of the
responsibility for drug procurement; (iv) improved human resource management; (v) the strengthening of
referral systems, and (vi) increased autonomy for district hospitals. The development of comprehensive,
resource based and outcome oriented workplans, as well a performance appraisal system will be supported
as instruments to monitor and evaluate performance. As the decentralization agenda develops further and
lessons are learned in the process, other related activities may be considered for support in these "Phase 1 "
districts. This phased approach to implementation will ensure that management capacity at all levels is not
overwhelmed by the transition period, when many managers will be playing dual roles as authority is being
devolved.
The project will support the central and provincial levels in the management of the change process, and to
increase the capacity for policy development, regulation, monitoring and evaluation focused on protecting
the consumer, especially the poor, and advocating for equitable and cost-efficient use of resources.
In terms of resource allocation from the project, the Nairobi area will be considered as any other district.
However, in view of the large number of health facilities in the area and the focus of the project, financial
support will be restricted to facilities in the poorest neighborhoods. Health Facility Committees for the
selected health centers/dispensaries have been put in place, and these Committees will open a bank account
with a commercial bank before financial support from the Project can be operationalized. The Project will
support, as in other districts, the decentralization of management to these Committees of HIV/AIDS and
RH-related activities, and the supervision of these activities under the responsibility of the Nairobi DHMB.
Cost sharing funds, generated by the involved facilities is currently deposited in a single bank account,
managed by the Nairobi DHMB. Beginning FY2000/2001 these funds will be increasingly retained in the
bank account of the Health Facility Committee, according to the following schedule: FY2000/2001: 50%,
- 50 -



FY2001/2002: 60%, FY2002/2003: 70% and FY2003/2004: 75%, contingent upon the satisfactory
financial management of these resources. Given the unsatisfactory performance of the Nairobi City
Council in managing its health facilities in past projects, the support to the Nairobi area facilities is
contingent on the fulfillment of several conditions related to strengthening of institutional and financial
systems as related to the management of these facilities, in order to ensure the IDA-financed interventions
enabled to achieve their stated objectives.

Project Component 2 - US$29.50 million
HIV/AIDS
This component will focus on the medical aspects of the GoK's response to the epidemic, as distinct from
the multi-sectoral Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project, which will provide support to the NACC in
addressing AIDS as a national development issue and provide no support to medical interventions. As
previously discussed, the decision was made to support the response through these two separate projects
due to the GoK and Bank's shared objcctives of (i) shielding the essential health-specific interventions, for
which the GoK and the Bank have a track record of support through previous projects, from the higher
risks associated with the bold multi-sectoral approach of the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project; and (ii)
better integrating these health-specific interventions into the broader operations of the health sector,
reducing duplication of effort with such areas as RH, Activities supported under this component include
interventions intended to expand and intensify the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and aimed at
advocacy and awareness, preventing new infections (behavior modeling interventions, condom use, blood
safety, school education programs, voluntary counseling and testing, etc.) and mitigating the impact of the
epidemic by supporting those infected and affected. The procurement of condoms, drugs for opportunistic
infection and HIV test material will be supported under this component. Gender aspects and the specific
vulnerability of women, adolescents and the poor will receive special emphasis. Support to the
implementation of district workplans, as a major area of emphasis, is designed to accommodate flexibility
in responding to changes in the operational, social and/or epidemiological situation. These workplans are
expected to accommodate district-level contracting with NGO/CBOs to provide services. The
transfornation of Kenya's response to the epidemic into a national, multi-sectoral endeavor will be
supported through a separate project that targets the institutional strengthening for the coordination of the
various initiatives through the NACC.
In addition, DflD will provide GBP 26 million (approx. US$ 40 million) in parallel financing through the
H1V/AIDS Prevention and Care (HAPAC) II Project, which will support the effective implementation of
Kenya's National AIDS Strategy. HAPAC I has supported the development of the GoK's HIV/AIDS
Strategic Plan and played a role in improving donor coordination, as well as strengthening the institutional
framework for HlV/AIDS activities in Kenya. In addition to working towards the GoK target of
stabilization of HIV prevalence at 15% by 2002 and a reduction to 10% by 2010, HAPAC II aims to (i)
support the entrenchment and prioritization of HV/AIDS in the MTEFlbudgetary process for all relevant
ministries, (ii) ensure that all distficts/constituencies have sufficient funds to implement the strategy, and
(iii) support progress toward the GoK target of 25% reduction in HIV-incidence among 15-24 year olds by
2005. It is envisioned that HAPAC II will achieve these objectives by (i) developing capacity within GoK
to budget for, coordinate and implement lHV/AIDS interventions outlined in the National AIDS Strategic
Plan; (ii) supporting the effective implementation of the advocacy and behavior change component of the
Strategic Plan; and (iii) facilitating and informing the implementation of the care and support component of
the Strategic Plan. Contingent on progress against these indicators, it is envisioned that the latter years of
the project will provide financing directly through budget support.
USAID will concurrently provide financing through its continued support of the Trust Condom Social
Marketing Program, managed by Population Services Intemational (PSI). The program's success is
indicated by the consistent increase in Trust sales and by its popularity as the condom of choice among
young people. USAID has also provided invaluable support to the MoH in the formulation of an overall
condom strategy. DflD will also provide support to the Trust program through the financing of
approximately US$ 1 million in condoms over the next four years. In addition, theGTZ plans to continue
its support towards the Community Based Distribution of condoms and the branding of GoK procured
condoms.

Project Component 3 - US$ 10.25 million
Reproductive Health
Under this component, issues will be addressed that relate to reproductive health in its broader concept,
including family planning, safe motherhood, women's status, child survival and sexually transmitted
infections. This component builds on the National Reproductive Health Strategy and its Implementation
Plan, elaborated and disseminated with support under the Fourth Population Project. District plans have
been developed and the project will provide support for training, including the conduct of maternal death
audits, procurement of essential inputs (FP commodities, drugs, and equipment), and IEC. Special
emphasis will be put on the provision of services for the youth. Elements under this component include
support for (the gradual introduction of -) IMCI, including malaria and micro-nutrient related activities as
well as the procurement of a limited amouat of drugs and equipment.
Project support for the Reproductive Health component will be applied to all districts, with the exception of
8 districts that are comprehensively supported by UNFPA. The introduction of the IMCI strategy will be
supported in the 3 districts that have been selected for the initial phase.

Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
KENYA: Decentralized Repr. Health and HIVIAIDS
A. HIV/AIDS Component
The HIV/AIDS component will absorb US$ 29.5 million, or about 60% of the total credit of US$ 50
million. Roughly 65% of the component's budget will focus on two interventions aiming to reduce the
growth rate of 1fV prevalence (i) condoms procurement and (ii) blood safety. The remaining 35% will be
used to support districts' work plans. This section evaluates costs and benefits for the condoms
procurement and blood safety interventions. The analysis of expected cost-effectiveness for the type of
interventions targeted within the district work plans is developed in a separate section, jointly for
HIV/AIDS and reproductive health.
Estimated benefits for the condom distribution intervention
The major difficulty when evaluating the costs and benefits of condoms' distribution is to estimate the
number of HIV cases averted by the intervention, as well as the associated benefits. Several studies have
analyzed this question on the basis of demographic simulation models that formalize sexual behavior within
the population (see Stover, 1998; and Stover, 1999 for a review). While high levels of uncertainty
surround the estimates of model parameters, and therefore the associated predictions, these models have
been extremely useful in guiding the policy debate. For the current analysis, we have not developed a new
demographic model. Instead, we rely on a simple relationship between the number of HIV cases averted
and the consumption of condoms, derived from Stover's demographic model for Kenya (see Stover, 1995).
The results of this exploratory analysis are summarized in Figures 1 and 2. The figures present the net
present value of the intervention and its intemal rate of return for several combinations of model
parameters.

The main finding is that the intervention has a positive net present value in all the sub-regions of the
parameter space analyzed. Hence, within the ranges of model parameters considered, there are no regions
where the intervention should not be implemented. Even in extreme cases characterized by no economic
growth, high costs of condoms distribution, low cost of curative interventions, and low effectiveness of
condoms in averting HIV, the NPV is above US$ 110 million. In scenarios with less pessimistic
expectations, the NPV can reach levels of US$ 1.29 billion. A look at the intemal rate of return of the
intervention gives a similar message. For the most pessimistic scenario, the IRR is estimated at 22%. In
less pessimistic scenarios the intemal rate of return (IRR) can reach 60% and even approximate 90%.
If we give the same weight to each scenario, then the average NPV is estimated at US$ 911 million, while
the average IRR is 42%. This estimate is below the 60% IRR estimated for a similar intervention in
Argentina (see Project Appraisal Document for the Argentina AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Disease
Control Project), but still suggests that the intervention is highly effective.
While these results are based on a very stylized treatment of the HlV/AIDS epidemics, they illustrate the
magnitude of potential costs and benefits, and for a wide range of model parameters support the hypothesis
that the intervention is economically efficient.
Estimated benefits for the blood safety intervention
The blood safety intervention will support the procurement of rapid test-kits, to be distributed principally in
rural areas. The model used for the analysis of costs and benefits of the intervention resembles the one
used in the case of the condoms procurement intervention. The major assumption driving this model is that
each year, a given number of transfusions for children and adults need to be perfonned. The blood used in
the transfusions can be tested for HIV if the appropriate test-kits are available. When they are not
available, the receiver faces a certain probability of becoming infected with HIV. If the kits are available,
this probability is reduced in proportion to the test's effectiveness. Nonetheless, because some donors are
infected, in order to generate one transfusion using non-infected blood, more than one test (i.e., more than
one test-kit) is required.
- 57 -



Not all patients that receive a transfusion survive. For the purpose of computing HIV cases averted, we are
only interested in those patients who survive after the transfusion and who were not previously infected
with HIV. These are the patients who face the risk of becoming infected if the blood is not tested.
As in the case of condoms, there is currently a shortage of rapid test-kits, particularly in rural areas.
Hence, an analysis was performed under the assumption that all test-kits will be used during the life-time of
the project. The model that simulates the NPV of this intervention shows that, as the prevalence increases
from 0, the intervention initially becomes more cost effective. Nevertheless, after some point, further
increases results in a reduction the effectiveness. In other words, the intervention will tend to be less cost
effective when prevalence is very low or very high. This is due to the fact that the higher the prevalence the
higher the number of people that could be saved by the intervention, but at the same time the higher the cost
of finding a safe donor.
Project expenditures on blood safety during the four years of the project are expected to prevent between
3,000 and 25,000 new HIV cases. Roughly, half of those cases would be observed among children. As in
the case of the condoms procurement intervention, high levels of uncertainty surround our predictions.
Nonetheless, our exploratory analysis shows that even in the case of very pessimistic scenarios (e.g., low
effectiveness of the test, high adjustment factor, and low cost of treating AIDS patients), the intervention
generates a positive net present value and an intemal rate of return above 10% (see Figures 2 and 3). If
we give the same weight to all the regions of the uncertainty space, then the average NPV for this
intervention is US$ 60 million while the average IRR is 30.7%.

B. Reproductive Health and IMCI component
This component captures about 20% of the total project budget. These resources are divided between
reproductive health US$ 3 million), integrated management of childhood illnesses US$ 1.75 million), and
district work plans US$ 5.5 million). In this section, we only review costs and benefits for the reproductive
health sub-component. In the case of the IMCI sub-component, we limit ourselves to reviewing costs and
to estimate the size of the population of potential beneficiaries. Indeed, there is still little information in
terms of benefits, although several studies conducted by WI-HO are now addressing the issue (see Tulloch,
1999). The current project could also contribute to leam about the benefits of the intervention within the
context of a semi-experimental design involving six districts: the three IMCI pilot districts, and three
control districts with similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
Estimated benefits for the safe motherhood intervention
The US $3 million allocated to this sub-component will be used to procure equipment for emergency
matemal care. The Family Planning Logistics Unit (FPLU) has estimated that 30% of matemal mortality
is due to terminated pregnancies that do not receive adequate care given lack of equipment. The new
equipment (costs and characteristics of this equipment were provided by FPLU) will be located in rural
areas, thus increasing access to low income populations and reducing maternal mortality rates.
The model that we used to compute costs and benefit for this sub-component is similar in nature to the one
used in the case of the HIV/AIDS component. As in the case of the previous components, even in the worst
case scenario, the intervention generates a positive NPV and an IRR above 10%. For less pessimistic
scenarios, the IRR can be extremely high (above 100%). These high internal rates of return are in part
explained by the relative low cost of the equipment, US$ 2.8 per tenninated pregnancy treated. If we give
the same weight to each scenario, the average NPV is estimated at US$ 12 million, while the average IRR
is close to 86%.
JMCI
The IMCI strategy involves three key components: i) improvement in the case-management skills of health
staff through the provision of locally adapted guidelines on IMCI, and activities to promote their use; ii)
improvement in health systems required for effective management of childhood illnesses; and iii)
improvements in family and community practices. The rationale for introducing IMCI in Kenya is given
first by the high prevalence of childhood i!lness (see Table 4), and second by the fact that usually mortality
is related to a combination of two or more of these illnesses. The DARE project will support the launching
of IMCI in three districts. During this start-up phase, the focus will be on the improvement of
case-management skills, and the reduction of current constraints in terms of drugs and equipment. It is
recognized, however, that better health workers skills will have little impact if family and community health
practices regarding child health are not improved, and if the health service delivery system is not
strengthened.

The start-up costs per district for this intervention have been estimated on the basis of the IMCI costing
model (see Weissman, 1999). The start-up will include the implementation of 6 IMCI training courses per
district (each including 20 health workers), and 6 follow-ups to health facilities. In addition, 10 facilitators
and 10 districts supervisors will be trained in each district. Hence, a total of 420 health workers will be
trained. The costs per district of the start-up, including the cost of equipment, are approximately US$
583,776 (see Table 5). The DARE project will support 90% of these costs.

The intervention will potentially benefit a total of 233,000 children. While expected benefits remain to be
estimated, there appears to be reason for optimism. First, the therapeutic and preventive elements that
make IMCI are accepted practices (see Tulloch, 1999). This is true for example for antibiotic management
of pneumonia, and oral and intravenous rehydration therapy. A more controversial question is whether
training changes the behavior of health workers. Nonetheless, preliminary results reported in Tullock
(1999) for Morocco, Vietnam and Bolivia suggest that they do (see Table 6).

At present, the major concern is related to the cost of implementing the strategy at the national level.
Indeed, the cost of the training is high (around US$ 1,500 per health worker), although considerable
economies of scale are to be expected. Yet, it is not clear that within a climate of fiscal austerity, 1MCI
could be implemented at the national level without extensive donor support. Hence, it is crucial that MoH
incorporates IMCJ within the core curricula of pre-service training. Other donors have provided reasonable
assurance that they will support this rcform.
Another factor that increases the risk of failure of this strategy is the HIV/AIDS epidemics. Today, in
Kenya, 10% of reported AIDS cases occur in children under five years of age. Most of these cases are due
to mother-to-child transmission. Then, it is likely that benefits resulting from IMCI could be eroded by an
increase in HIV prevalence. Finally, the success of the strategy will depend on the capacity of the involved
institutions.
District work plans
The DARE project allocates US$ 13 million to finance district initiatives. US$ 7.5 million will focus on
HIV/AIDS related interventions, while the remaining US$ 5.5 million will target reproductive health related
interventions. The allocation of these resources across districts will be based on five indicators: total
population, the share of the total population under five years of age, the share of the population of women
in reproductive age, the share of population living below the poverty line, and HIV/AIDS prevalence.
Currently, the MoH is studying the set of weights that should be given to each of these indicators.
Given that the use of resources will be fully determined by districts, it is unknown at this time which are the
specific interventions that will be targeted. Nonetheless, by looking at the distribution of the burden of
disease and the distribution of current expenditures (see Table 4), we can derive some insights about the
effectiveness of this sub-component.
We first observe that the interventions covered within the reproductive health and IMCI component cover
some of the main causes of death in Kenya. Indeed, the main killers are perinatal/matemal conditions,
which account for 22% of total deaths. Diarrhea and pneumonia are also important causes of death, with
the latter accounting for 8% of the total years of life lost due to premature mortality. While AIDS accounts
for only 3.4% of total deaths (figure for 1996), our analysis of impacts showed that this percentage could
increase considerably within the next five years.
- 63 -



The second column in Table 4 presents the ratio between the share of the observed burden of disease and
the share of total expenditures. This indicator gives a rough idea of the levels of efficiency in the allocation
of health expenditures. We observe that the share of expenditures for the conditions supported within the
DARE project (perinatal and maternal conditions, pneumonia, diarrhea, and H[V/AIDS) are low relatively
to their contribution to the burden of disease. Hence, the allocations supported by the project are likely to
increase levels of efficiency in the use of resources within the health sector.
Table 4 also presents the cost-effectiveness of community, preventive, and curative interventions related to
each of the causes of death. Cost-effectiveness is measured in dollars per years of life saved. A review of
these indicators suggests that the interventions that could be supported within the context of the
reproductive health and IMCI sub-comporent are among the most cost-effective. The indicators also
suggest that in the case of the HIV/AIDS sub-component, districts should target community-based
interventions.

C. Capacity Building and Decentralization
The last component of the DARE project provides US$ 7.5 million for improvements in institutional
capacity. Approximately 40% of these resources will be used to provide district training (including drug
management), and a restructuring of the Medical Supplies Coordination Unit (MSCU). These interventions
are expected to increase levels of efficiency within the health sector. The remainder 60% of the budget will
be used to launch the first phase of a decentralization process that should eventually reach all districts.
Decentralization, in its various forms, has become a highly popular component in policy reform.
Nonetheless, studies evaluating the impacts of decentralization in developing world (see for example
- 64 -



Visschedijk et al., 1995; Colling and Green, 1994; Bossert, 1998; Smith, 1997; Gilson et al, 1994; Kutzin,
1994; and Holland and Pimphachanh, 1995) provide mixed results. Problems associated with
decentralization include for example an increase in regional disparities in the absence of a mechanism to
transfer resources from rich districts to poor districts. Another major problem is associated with the lack
of skilled personnel, the lack of information, or the loss of economies of scale which counteract efficiency
gains from devolution. Yet another difficulty is the implementation of national policies and the creation of
coordination channels across regions. In general, there is an agreement in that the effects of
decentralization on levels of efficiency can be represented by a U-shaped function of time. Thus, in the
short run, efficiency may decrease, but it is expected to increase in the long run.
Studies suggest that there are four basic pre-conditions for successful devolution: i) the management
capacity of the receiving government; ii) the existence of regional planning practices; iii) the existence of
transfer mechanisms from rich regions to poor regions; and iv) strong leadership from MoH. Regarding the
latter, MoH must be able to influence local health policy and implementation without compromising the
autonomy of local decision-making from which many of the benefits of a devolved system would be
expected to flow. As stated by Guldner "decentralization without direction appears to undermine health
system effectiveness" (Guldner, 1995).
Unfortunately, there have not been studies, to our knowledge, relating decentralization indicators to health
outcomes indicators. This complicates the assessment of potential economic benefits. In an attempt to fill
this void, we have relied upon a panel data-set of countries which include among social and economic
indicators, an indicator of fiscal decentralization. The indicator has been computed as the ratio between
total expenditures of local governments and total expenditures of the central govemment. Using this data
set we have estimated the marginal effect that a change in the fiscal decentralization indicator could have on
infant mortality rates when controlling for other co-variates such as GDP per capita, female education, and
immunization coverage (See working paper "Does Fiscal Decentralization Reduces Infant Mortality Rates?
Evidence from a Cross-country Study"). Preliminary estimates suggest that a 10% increase in the fiscal
decentralization indicator decreases the infant mortality rate by 1.6% (see Figure 6).

The results described in this section, however, need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, our indicator of
fiscal decentralization is only a rough proxy for the fiscal decentralization process. Nonetheless, the results
suggest that one should be optimistic about the potential impacts of this sub-component of the DARE
project.

Socioeconomic Determinants of the Demand for Condoms
On the basis of the KDHS 1998, we have estimated models of the socioeconomic deterninants of the
probability of using condoms among males, as well as the willingness to pay for these condoms. The
results of the these estimations are presented in Tables B 1 and B2 respectively.

We find that the age of the individual, his level of education, knowledge about AIDS, and assets are
important determinants of the probability of using a condom. In the case of age, we find that the effect on
condom use is better described by a third degree function. Hence, the probability of using condoms
increases between 15 and 20 years of age, it decreases between 20 and 45 years of age, and then increases
afterwards. Surely, this is related to variations in the number of sexual partners in each age, as well as
marital status. It is interesting to observe that those individuals that learned about AIDS or Family
Planning through the media, are more likely to use condoms than individuals that were informed by other
means, or were not informed. Not surprisingly, more educated individuals are more likely to use condoms.
- 67 -



Finally, the level of income (here proxied by household assets per capita), increases the probability of using
condoms, although the marginal effect is very small.
In terms of the willingness to pay, the main result is that among those individuals that use condoms, the
young are more likely to pay than the old. Again, this may be a result of different levels of exposure to risk
during sexual contacts. Interestingly, willingness to pay decreases with the level of education of the
individual. One interpretation is that individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to know
about government policy towards AIDS and its willingness to subsidize condoms. Indeed, the results show
that individuals that obtain condoms from public institutions, are less willing to pay for them. In terms of
income, we verify that the willingness to pay increases when income increases. Nonetheless, the
relationship is non-linear. Hence, individuals in the top of the distribution of assets are less willing to pay
for condoms. Again, this income effect may be similar to the effect of education.
We use the models presented in Tables B1 and B2 to estimate the average probability of using condoms
and the willingness to pay, and then project total demand. We find that on average 21% of men use
condoms. From these, on average, 69% are willing to pay (the Kenya DHS 1998 report informs us that
only 50% of males are willing to pay for condoms; however, this number includes users and non-users).
Given the projection of the sexual active population of males computed by NASCOP, we compute the total
demand for condoms under the assumptions that each male has an average of two sexual intercourse per
week and that the probability of using condoms will increase by 2 percentage points per year (see Table
B3).

probability of using a
condom increases at
10 percentage points
per year.
We observe that in year 2000 close to 575 thousand males will demand free condoms. This implies that the
MoH will need to provide close to 60 million condoms at a cost of approximately US$ 1.8 million. It is
interesting to observe, however, that currently planned distribution of 95 million condoms exceeds the
estimated demand. In other words, close to 40% of these condoms could be sold at replacement cost. If
this could be done, then the currently estimated deficit of US$ 2.3 million per year, could be reduced to
close to US$ 1.4 million. Notice that under the assumption that the share of males using condoms
increases, and that the share of those willing to pay remains constant, the deficit could reach US$ 2.4
million. Under the assumption of a faster increase in the share of the male population using condoms, the
deficit could reach US$ 6.5 million in year 2005.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
KENYA: Decentralized Repr. Health and HIV/AIDS
Procurement
It has been agreed that all procurement will be handled through a qualified procurement agent. All
IDA-financed procurement in the sector has been managed by a procurement agent since 1997, and this
arrangement has proven very successful after years in which virtually no IDA-financed procurement was
completed. The agent currently contracted under the Kenya Sexually Transmitted Infections Project has
handled procurement work during preparation with the objective of having most major tenders floated with
contracts ready for signature upon DARE's Effectiveness. The major tenders which are already underway
include procurements which are central to the DARE project (Condoms, HIV Test Kits, Anti-TB drugs,
vaccines, and medical equipment). Requests for Proposals have also been floated for the major
consultancies under the project (HIV/AIDS Training, IMCI Training, District Level Training to equip
District Personnel for Decentralization and M&E). Tenders have already been completed, and contracts
are awaiting signature at Effectiveness, for Logistics Management for Drugs and Medical Supplies as well
as for NGO Implementation of HIV/AIDS Activities. At Effectiveness, the remaining procurement
workload will be assessed and, if there remains sufficient work to justify the process, a tender will be
floated for a new procurement agent contract. However, the current procurement agent will complete the
management of any tenders which have commenced prior to Effectiveness.
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement of goods and works for all IDA financed components will be carried out in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 and revised in
January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). Consulting services by firms or individuals
financed by IDA will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999).
The appropriate World Bank standard bidding documents will be used for all International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB). The World Bank's standard Request for
Proposals (RFP) will be used for the selection of consultants.
Advertising
Two General Procurement Notices (GPN), one for consulting services and one for works and goods, have
been prepared for the project and published in United Nations Development Business. The GPNs will be
updated at least once a year and submitted to IDA for review. GPNs will describe all outstanding ICB for
goods and works contracts, as well as consulting assignments.
Procurement Plan
A procurement plan has been prepared by the Borrower. The plan includes relevant information on goods,
works and consulting services under the project as well as the timing of each milestone in the procurement
process. The procurement schedule will be updated every quarter and reviewed by IDA at each supervision
mission. The detailed implementation plan is included in the PIP.
Civil Works
No large civil works are scheduled for the Project. The design does provide for flexibility for districts to
undertake small works with their district grants, though the budgets for the grants must be approved prior
to disbursements and the number of such works would be quite limited, as described below.
- 71 -



Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than US$ 20,000 equivalent per contract, up to an
aggregate amount of US$ 500,000 equivalent, may be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors invited in writing to
bid. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings where
applicable. The awards will be made to the contractors who offer the lowest price quotation for the required
work, provided they demonstrate they have the experience and resources to complete the contract
successfully.
Goods
The total cost of goods is estimated at US4* 19.94 million for the project, excluding any goods that might be
procured in small quantities through district workplans as detailed below. Procurement will be bulked
where feasible into packages valued at US$ 100,000 equivalent or more and will be procured through ICB
procedures.
Goods estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$
2.5 million equivalent, will be procured through NCB.
Goods that are estimated to cost less than US$ 30,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$
1,000.000 equivalent, may be procured through National Shopping procedures (for goods available
locally) and/or through International Shopping procedures (for those goods not available on the national
market), in accordance with the Bank Guidelines, and/or through the Inter-Agency Procurement Services
Office of the UNDP (IAPSO).
Services
The total cost of consultant services is estimated at US$ 8.60 million equivalent for the entire project,
excluding any services to be procured under district workplans as detailed below. Except as detailed
below, consulting services will be selected through competition among qualified short-listed firms based on
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS).
Consultants for financial audits and other repetitive services estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate of US$ 200,000 equivalent, will be selected through Least Cost
Selection method.
Consultants for services meeting the requirements of Section V of the Consultant Guidelines will be
selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants (IC) method. Individual
Consultants will be selected through comparison of job description requirements against the qualifications
of those expressing interest in the assignment or those approached directly.
To ensure that priority is given to the identification of suitable and qualified national consultants, short-lists
for contracts estimated under US$ 100,000 or equivalent may be comprised entirely of national consultants
(in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a
sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available. However, if foreign firms have expressed
interest, they will not be excluded from consideration. The RFP as developed by the Bank will be used for
requesting proposals, and for selection and appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used
for short-term assignments -- simple missions of standard nature (i.e., those not exceeding six months)
carried out by individuals consultants or firms.

District Workplans
Workplans will be formulated annually by the districts. It is not possible to determine the exact mix of
goods, small works, and services to be procured under the workplans due to their demand-driven nature.
Funding for these workplans will be in the form of grants. Therefore, the types of activities to be financed
under the workplans and their procurement details will depend on the needs identified by districts, much as
with Social Funds. However, guidelines are being prepared (as part of the Implementation Plan) which
state clearly that large works and vehicles are ineligible for financing. Equipment such as computers and
office equipment will be grouped into larger, more efficient tenders by the central Ministry and its
procurement agent, and there will be a cap placed on the percentage of the workplan that can be used to
finance such items. The Africa Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for
Community-Based Investments has also been used in the design of procurement under this aspect of the
project. The MoH will be responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines, and ex-post reviews
of random districts will be conducted periodically by the Bank. Details on the implementation of these
plans are available in the PIP.
For services procured at the district level under approved district workplans, contracts for services under
US$ 5,000 will not be subject to prior review by IDA of Terms of Reference and will be allowed to be
awarded through sole source selection, up to an aggregate for the project of US$ 1 million.

Overall Procurement Risk Assessment
Average
Frequency of procurement supervision mnissions proposed: One every 6 months (includes special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits)
An assessment of MoH procurement capacity has been conducted, and a report has been prepared. The
report indicates "High" risk -- without a procurement agent -- based on: (i) weaknesses in the current
institutional and legal framework of GOK procurement; (ii) consequences of insufficient external oversight
in existing arrangements for procurement of medical supplies and medical equipment under MoH; and (iii)
conditions conducive to corruption in procurement practices. However, the assessment concludes that the
employment of a procurement agent reduces the procurement risk for this project to "average". MoH has
limited capacity, despite many years of experience with IDA-financed projects. This is partially due to
continuous changes in staff, but also due to the Ministry's failure to take full advantage of the capacity
building aspect of the current procurement agent's contract. The current capacity of MoH without outside
support would be inadequate to handle the procurement activities workload under the project; therefore, it
was agreed from Identification that the arrangement that has been in place in recent years, that of using a
procurement agent, would be continued. The arrangement under DARE will also cater for procurement
capacity building by the procurement agent for the newly-established KEMSA, which will have all
procurement and distribution responsibility within the MoH. It is hoped that sufficient capacity can be
built that KEMSA would take over the functions of the procurement agent no later than the end of the
project.
- 75 -



While the assessment for this project was conducted at the central ministry level, the most recent Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), prepared in 1997, shows that the risks for procurement at the
local level are considered to be high, and that procurement capacity at the local level is generally weak.
However, the value of procurement actions that will be carried out at the local levels under the project are
relatively small individually, and the types of goods, works, and services will be very limited. These will
mostly deal with minor civil works, small service contracts, or small procurement of goods and supplies of
mainly the recurrent nature through shopping. To further mitigate this risk, the decentralization training to
be provided to districts will better equip the district staff to manage these small procurements.
Many of the system-wide weaknesses revealed by the procurement capacity assessment and listed above are
being addressed under the ongoing IDF Procurement Reform Project, including the formulation of a
comprehensive procurement law, preparation of standard govemment bidding documents, preparation of
public procurement regulations and a User Guide, the establishment of a Public Procurement Department
to conduct procurement audits. Finally, an anti-corruption law and new code of ethics are both currently
before Parliament for consideration, and these are expected to increase accountability in the area of
procurement.
Thresholds generally differ by country and project. Consult OD 11.04 "Review of Procurement
Documentation" and contact the Regional Procurement Adviser for guidance.

Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are detailed in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992
edition). All disbursements are subject to the conditions of the Credit Agreement and the procedures defined
in the Disbursement Letter. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit account will be fully
documented except for expenditures against contracts: (i) with an estimated value of US$ 250,000 each or
less for works; (ii) with an estimated value of US$ 100,000 or less for consulting firms and goods; (iii)
with an estimated value of US$ 50,000 or less for individual consultants; and (iv) for all training
workshops and study tours, which may be claimed on the basis of certified SoEs. Documentation
supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained at MoH and will be available for review as
requested by IDA supervision missions and project auditors.
The allocation of Credit proceeds are shown in Table C; the proceeds of the IDA credit would be made
against 100% of consultant services and training, 90% of all expenditures on all local expenditures for
goods and 100% of expenditures on all foreign expenditures for goods, and 100% of all expenditures for
IDA-financed components of district workplans. Workplans will also include activities financed by other
sources, including GoK, and these will exceed the 10% local requirement in the aggregate. As projected by
the Bank's standard disbursements profile, disbursement would be completed by four months after project
closure. Disbursement would be made against standard IDA documentation.

Total                                       50.00
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements would be made through existing IDA disbursement procedures (i.e. Direct Payment,
Reimbursement, and Special Commitment) during the first 18 months after credit effectiveness, and during
this time SOEs will be used for eligible expenditures financed through the Special Account under these
arrangements. The thresholds for SOE expenditures will be decided at negotiations. Subsequently, a
transition to quarterly PMR-based disbursements under LACI is anticipated. All project disbursements
would then be made on the basis of SOEs to replenish the Special Account in quarterly tranches. The
documentation required to support the replenishment under this mechanism would be agreed at negotiations
as well.
- 77 -



Special account:
It is proposed that the Government initially establish a Special Account in the amount of US$ 3,000,000 to
support the initial use of SOEs as described above. Approximately 18 months after Effectiveness, when
the project makes the transition to quarterly PMR-based disbursements under the Bank's LACI, it is
proposed that the level of the Special Account be increased to US$ 6,000,000 Under the latter
arrangement, funds from this Credit Account would be transferred to the Special Account quarterly. IDA
funds would only be used to finance eligible expenditures under the project. During negotiations,
agreement would be reached regarding the arrangements for establishing and operating the Special
Account.
