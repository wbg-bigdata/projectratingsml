                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks approval for the partial cancellation of loan funds
for the Agricultural Competitiveness Project (ACP), and to make changes to the
Performance Monitoring Framework. The main reason for the cancellation of funds, as
requested by the Borrower on June 17, 2011, is the decision to postpone the construction
of the National Reference Laboratory (NRL). The proposed cancellation would amount to
US$9,300,000 from the original amount of US$24,000,000, from the Loan Categories
Unallocated (US$1,000,000), Civil Works (US$5,300,000), and Goods (US$3,000,000).

PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was approved on April 28, 2005. The objective of the project is to
increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in Kazakhstan. Initially, the project
was affected by start-up delays but since early 2009 has shown satisfactory progress and
results almost in all components. Progress towards achievement of the project
development objective is rated moderately satisfactory. Due to a temporary slowdown in
loan disbursement, the implementation progress rating was downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory in December 2010. Total disbursements to date amount to US$36.5
million, of which US$13.2 million was financed from the World Bank loan, and US$23.3
million from counterpart funds, higher than originally planned, demonstrating a strong
commitment to the Project by the Borrower.

3.      The project is very close to fully achieving its main outcome indicator targets and
objective. Furthermore, a survey is underway to evaluate the project outcomes, quantify
the project’s contribution to the overall increase in competitiveness of the agricultural
sector, and confirm achievement of the fourth objective in terms of beneficiary
satisfaction. Despite the delay in completing the NRL, the third objective of improving
testing of agricultural products would also be achieved due to other activities supported
by the project in this area.

4.      The project underwent a level two restructuring in July 2010 to extend the loan
closing date from July 31, 2010 till June 30, 2012 in order to allow already-approved
grants under implementation and financed from the loan (Part C 2(iii) of the project)
sufficient time to fully disburse, and to complete design of a new building for the
National Reference Laboratory in Part A.2 of the Project Description (Schedule 2 of the
Loan Agreement) (National Reference Laboratory).

5.     Financial Management Status. The project has no significant financial
management issues. The project audit report for 2010 provides an unqualified (clean)
opinion. It has been reviewed by the Bank’s FMS and deemed satisfactory.

PROPOSED CHANGES

6.      Partial Cancellation of Project Funds. As part of the first restructuring in 2010,
it was agreed that due to the significant delays experienced during the procurement
process for the design of the NRL, actual construction would not be feasible by the
project’s closing date, and the Borrower was required to decide on the need and/or
allocation of the surplus funds. Through a letter from the Ministry of Finance dated June
17, 2011, the Borrower confirmed the decision to complete design of the NRL but
postpone the construction phase of the laboratory and requested the cancellation of funds.

7.      Amendments to the Loan Agreement. In order to comply with this request Part
A.2 (i) Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement would be amended to delete the sentence
“including construction of a new building for laboratory and provision of equipment and
training?, and Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement would be amended to reflect the
cancellation of the corresponding amount of US$ 9.3 million (details in Annex 2).

8.      Revisions to the Results Framework. The proposed restructuring would also
include revisions to the Project’s indicators to improve the clarity of the indicators and
their targets, as well as to correct inconsistencies in the original project documentation.
To ensure consistency with the PAD, the changes to the Results Framework would also
be reflected in the revised version of the Supplemental Letter. The draft revised
Supplemental Letter on Performance Monitoring Indicators is attached as an Annex to the
Notification to the Borrower on Partial Cancellation.

9.      Project Costs will change as follows:
