INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A PETROLEUM FUELS SUPPLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposes
credit to the Republic of Zimbabwe for SDR 1.1 million (US$1.2 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Petroleum Fuels Supply
Technical Assistance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980. A Country Economic Memorandum (Report Num-
ber 3234-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1981.
This description is based on that memorandum and on information obtained on
subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the north-
west and South Africa on the South. The population as of December 1981,
was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom were Africans. I The
remainder consisted of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000
people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is
estimated to be about 3.4 percent per year. The number of Europeans has
been declining due to emigration, which has recently been occurring at an
average rate of about 1,700 persons per month. According to estimates
based on pre-war data, 20 percent of the population is urban; but this is
almost certain to understate the present extent of urbanization.
4.        In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly
skewed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and
confirmed division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately
2.5 ha per African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity
1 The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature for population divisions is
used throughout. The first census since 1969 is scheduled for late 1982.



-2 
will begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar
disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets and in-
come. Rough estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income
suggest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.        Rhodesia made its illegal Unilateral Declaration of Independence
(UDI) in 1965, which was followed by economic sanctions and, beginning in
1973, a costly guerrilla war. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965, when they began, and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7 percent
per year and per capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded,
enhancing the country's ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimu-
lated development of local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979
consumer goods were only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with
22 percent in 1964. Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of com-
mercial agriculture and the rapid growth of investment in and exports from
the mining sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufact-
uring and mining are all important, contributing 14 percent, 8 percent, and
24 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1980, and together providing 52 percent
of total formal employment. Agriculture accounts for more than 300,000
jobs or 35 percent of the total; manufacturing for 167,000 jobs and mining
for 70,000. Most of the remaining formal employment is provided by service
sectors such as public administration, education and, in particular, domes-
tic service. Mining and agriculture earn significant amounts of foreign
exchange and supply most inputs for manufacturing, which in turn accounts
for between 20 and 25 percent of Zimbabwe's merchandize exports, mainly
processed agricultural and mineral items.
8.        Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased
by 40 percent in 1980 and by 23 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been extremely strong in agriculture,
which has benefitted from good weather. Consequently, overall real growth
of the economy was about 8 to 10 percent in 1980, while early estimates
suggest a rate of 7 to 9 percent for 1981.



- 3 -
9.       Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the country
is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-run
problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (currently
about 15 percent per year). Scme needed policies are already being imple-
mented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been raised.
The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent in
1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of GDP
has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80. However, further
reductions must be accomplished during the current (1982/83) budgetary
exercise if stabilization efforts are to fully succeed. Significant
longer-term problems concern the need to increase the level and quality of
investment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a wage policy consis-
tent with the need to increase employment. Although these issues are
inter-related, the Government recognizes that increasing employment and
labor productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth with equity.
Unfortunately, the recent increase in wage minima, the third such increase
since independence, and the announcement that further revisions are likely
is inconsistent with the employment goal. Should further wage increments
be decreed before an appropriate lapse of time, it is clear that upward
adjustments in prices and devaluation of the exchange rate will be needed.
10.      Should Government effectively deal with the above-mentioned prob-
lems, prospects for respectable growth and more equitable distribution of
income are quite good. Real increments in GDP could well average 5.5 per-
cent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter growth could slow, perhaps, to an
average of four percent per year, as investments are made in longer-
gestating programs with a more even distribution of assets. Much of the
burden of achieving these growth and equity goals must fall on the agricul-
tural sector. In the past, the commercial farms accounted for most
agricultural production. However, the development of smallholder agricul-
ture has been assigned the highest priority.
11.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In September 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$493 million (US$715 million equivalent) and the country's gross
international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated two
months of imports. The external debt figure was equivalent to US$90 per
capita or about 15 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which
was about four percent in 1980, is projected to rise to 7 and 15 percent in
1981 and 1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly
all Zimbabwe-s present debt must be repaid in the next six years. However,
so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of short-term com-
mercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to decline after
1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrowing. In light of
this and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe is
clearly creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the country-s mas-
sive external resource requirements for the next few years and the expected
high level of international interest rates and relatively hard repayment
terms of non-concessionary borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to
receive part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.

PAR? II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million
benefitting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$19.0 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of
the loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for
agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its
two loans after the lifting of sanctions on December 21, 1979. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed priority
import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components and bal-
ancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing
sector. The Bank also approved a loan (1944-ZIM) of US$42 million to
finance import requirements of spare parts, track maintenance equipment and
tools for the railways, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment
Department and technical assistance.
13.       IFC-s first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, to help finance a
project for producing coal for a thermal power station, now being con-
structed, and other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38 mil-
lion loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC-s own account, and
US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan.  IFC was
also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commercial bank
financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Eximbank).
14.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects in power, railways
development, manpower development and training, agriculture, rural develop-
ment, forestry, and industrial intermediation. A Small Farm Credit
project would provide the Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds for
seasonal loans and for medium- and long-term loans for equipment and farm
improvements, as well as technical assistance. A proposed power project
would enhance power generating capacity through a Phase II extension of
Wankie Thermal Power Station and would also include construction of a
transmission line, technical assistance and training. A forestry project
to support rural afforestation was appraised in May 1982.
15.       A proposed Highway project, which was appraised in February 1982,
includes constructing 600 km of rural roads in the Communal Areas,



- 5 -
plus a pilot feeder-road program. The Bank also has reviewed the energy
urban, education and manpower and telecommunications sectors, and sect_;
memoranda are under preparation.  Recent Bank missions have reviewed U
agriculture and population, health and nutrition sectors and identifie._
possible Bank assistance for agricultural planning.  Disbursements  nI
Zimbabwe have kept to schedule.
PART III - THE ENERGY AND LIQUID FUELS SECTOR
A. Energy Sector
Energy Base
16.      Zimbabwe's main indigenous energy resources are hydropower, coal
and wood fuel. All petroleum products are currently imported and geologi-
cal information on the country indicates that discovery of petroleum is un-
likely. However, ethanol, produced from sugar and blended with gasoline,
meets about 13 percent of the country's gasoline requirements. Some
potential exists for development of solar and wind energy.
17.      Hydro-electricity.  The Zambezi, which forms Zimbabwe-s northern
border, is the only river whose hydroelectric potential has been defined
and is estimated at a total of 36,900 GWh (9.3 million toe) annually, of
which 10,600 GWh (2.7 million toe) has already been exploited. In 1980,
the Kariba hydro complex, which is located on the river, contributed
70 percent of the electrical energy requirements of the country. The
Zambezi hydropower, which Zimbabwe shares with Zambia, is expected to be
fully exploited by about 2010.
18.      Coal.  Zimbabwe is well endowed with coal (29 billion tons) and
has made good use of it for railways, power generation, steel production,
tobacco processing, tea curing and other activities. About 2.2 billion
tons or 7.5 percent are classified as proven recoverable reserves. Current
coal production is about 3.2 million tons per annum or about 2.1 million
toe. Coal now supplies about 32 percent of the country's total energy re-
quirements and is expected to supply 46 percent by 2000. Its use is likely
to be extended to other activities including manufacture of ammonia-based
fertilizer for agriculture. Meanwhile, the Government has accepted the
Bank's recommendation that a study be undertaken to determine the optimal
use of coal resources. The study is already underway and is being financed
by the EEC.
19.      Fuelwood.  Wood Is the most important source of energy for both
rural and urban households, supplying about 28 percent of Zimbabwe-s total
energy demand. It meets nearly all the fuel requirements of the rural pop-
ulation and the urban poor and a substantial proportion of the agricultural
energy needs, particularly for tobacco curing and tea processing.
Zimbabwe's indigenous woodlands are, however, an uncertain resource,



- 6 -
especially in several eastern settlements and around the main urban areas
where they have been depleted to a critical level. The Government is
promoting an afforestation program based on communal woodlots, and the Bank
is considering supporting these efforts with a fuelwood project (para. 14).
20.      Petroleum.  Refined petroleum products have been imported from
South Africa since 1966 when the pipeline from Beira in Mozambique to the
Feruka Refinery in Mutare (formerly Umtali) was closed -- due to the block-
ade of crude oil supplies -- following UDI. Thereafter, petroleum imports
fell by an average annual rate of 2.9 percent as a proportion of total
energy so that they supplied only 11.5 percent of energy requirements in
1980 -- a small proportion when compared to other countries.
Solar and Wind Energy
21.      There is potential for using both solar and wind energy.  Govern-
ment interest in both forms of energy has resulted in the manufacture of
solar water heaters and use of wind pumps. Whereas the Government proposes
testing the possibility of promoting the use of wind pumps, solar energy is
deemed to have limited commercial use in Zimbabwe.
Energy Consumption
22.      The large industrial and commercial agriculture sectors make
Zimbabwe a relatively high energy consuming country (about 5.28 barrels of
oil equivalent -- boe -- per capita in 1980). Total energy consumption
amounted to 5,874 thousand toe or 38.9 million boe in 1980. Indigenous
sources (coal, wood, hydropower and ethanol) satisfy most of the energy
demand, so that imported energy is less than in many developing countries.
Nevertheless, 23 percent of energy was imported in 1980, of which 11.5 per-
cent was electricity and 11.5 percent petroleum products at a cost of
22.6 percent of Zimbabwe's total export earnings.
Energy Pricing
23.      A comprehensive study of all energy prices is required as these
were distorted by war considerations and past policies that may not now ap-
ply. The study would assist the Government in devising national energy
policies and plans to make a more efficient use of the country's energy re-
sources. Under the proposed Power Project, the Government has agreed to
carry out an energy pricing study covering petroleum coal, electricity and
wood fuel, to be completed by June 30, 1984, and its recommendations imple-
mented by July 1, 1985. The study would, inter alia, evaluate the marginal
cost of supplying different electricity customers, and recommend a revised
tariff structure based on marginal costs, social and revenue considera-
tions.



-7-
Energy Planning
24.      A strong and properly organized energy planning mechanism is
clearly needed. The Bank has recommended the establishment of such capa-
bility in the Ministry of Industry and Energy Development (MIED) to improve
coordination between various ministries and departments on overall energy
matters.

a Including energy imports (para. 22).
25.      Because of the distortions caused by the economic sanctions and
the recent civil war, data on past energy consumption are not a reliable
guide for projecting future demand. As part of its energy assessment, the
Bank is helping the Government develop parameters for forecasting energy
requirements consistent with the country's economic development goals.
With proper planning, indigenous resources are likely to continue to meet
most of Zimbabwe's needs.

B. Liquid Fuels
Liquid Fuels Demand and Supply
26.      The liquid fuels used in Zimbabwe are liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), motor gasoline, aviation kerosene, illuminating kerosene, diesel oil
and bitumen. Apart from about 40 million litres per annum of ethanol
produced domestically, all the products are imported, currently by rail
through the Republic of South Africa to Harare. Requirements for 1981 were
about 617,500 metric tons, as summarized in the table below.

27.      The Government is very concerned about the increasing cost of im-
porting liquid fuels, which was US$312 million in 1981, equivalent to about
22 percent of Zimbabwe's estimated export earnings. Zimbabwe is also con-
cerned about the unreliability of import channels, as difficulties and
delays in transshipment of the fuel through South Africa have caused spora-
dic shortages, severely affecting industry and transport.
Organization of Liquid Fuels Sector
28.      MIED formulates policy for petroleum imports, while the Ministry
of Trade and Commerce (MTC) is responsible for pricing of liquid fuels in-
cluding ethanol. Petroleum products are imported by the Zimbabwe Oil
Procurement Consortium. Distribution is carried out by five locally-
incorporated, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Shell, British Petroleum, Mobil,
Total and Caltex. There are 587 retail outlets, of which 388 are in urban
centers and 199 in rural areas. Storage capacity between the distributors
is about 116,000 cubic meters or about 100,000 metric tons, the equivalent
of about two months- supply.

29.      Procurement Prices.  The cost of petroleum products in Zimbabwe is
high because of the distance from the sea. During the first half of 1981,
transportation and handling costs from Durban to Harare averaged about
38 percent of the CIF (landed Harare) cost. Current procurement practices
may also contribute to high costs. FOB prices paid for some petroleum
products in 1981 were much higher than prevailing prices in the Middle East
and Rotterdam, even allowing for the extra transportation cost.
30.      Consumer Prices.  Petroleum product prices, both ex-depot and at
the pump, are administered by the Government through MTC.  While the Gov-
ernment is committed in principle to passing on costs to the consumer,
adjustment of prices by the MTC have not reflected procurement costs. Be-
cause of this, they do not appear to concur with increases in procurement
costs. Procurement Consortium depot prices in June 1981, for example,
resulted in a loss per liter of 48 percent, 21 percent and 19 percent for
gasoline, diesel oil and aviation kerosene, respectively. Increases in
cost in procurement could be passed on to the consumer most effectively at
the Procurement Consortium depot during sale to distributors, as taxes,
distribution costs and dealers- margins are determined by agreed formulae.
The Government has requested that the studies to be carried out in the
project include recommendations for improving petroleum procurement prac-
tices undler the supply option recommended by the study.
Options for Liquid Fuels Supply
31.      In the face of the increasing cost of petroleum imports and the
unreliability of supply, the Government, early in 1981, began considering
the following options:
(a)  increasing ethanol production to reduce
consumption of gasoline;
(b)  producing synthetic crude oil from coal;
(c)  rehabilitating an existing 294 km crude
oil pipeline from Beira in Mozambique
to Mutare in Zimbabwe, and converting it
to carry refined products; and
(d) rehabilitating the petroleum refinery at
Mutare, out of commission since 1965.
To establish a framework for evaluating these options, the Government asked
the Bank to carry out an energy assessment, whose conclusions on the merits
of the above options are summarized below.
32.      Expansion of Ethanol Capacity.  Zimbabwe has the capacity to pro-
duce 40 million liters of ethanol a year, which amounts to 15 percent of
automotive fuel as a blend with gasoline. Development of a 13,500 ha
sugarcane plantation for ethanol production is proposed, and a feasibility



- 10 -
study has identified three alternatlve schemes .:ith aanual pr;o)duicton rang-
ing from 17 to 129 million liters. Zimbabwe's additionnl needs for ethanol
are estimated at about 35-40 million liters a year. This assumes a gaso-
line blend that includes 20 percent ethanol, which is the iiper limit for
unmodified automotive engines. General use of pure alcohol for vehicles is
not feasible in Zimbabwe because of expensive modifications necessary to
gasoline engines and storage facilities, apart from other economic and
agricultural factors. Ethanol, therefore, is unlikely to meet more than
about one percent of total liquid fuel requirements.
33.      Oil From Coal.  Considerable work is necessary to determine the
extent and quality of mineable reserves of coal and their suitability for
conversion into liquid fuel. Furthermore, oil-from-coal technologies are
still being developed. Although South Africa has operatel an oil-from-coal
facility (SASOL) for many years, its competitiveness with petroleum crude
Is yet to be proven. Zimbabwe's most likely source of technology would be
the United States, where the first direct oil-from-coal pilot plants are
being engineered. The facilities are not expected to come on stream until
late 1990 and the technology is not likely to be established for some years
after that. Thus Zimbabwe's prospects of converting coal to oil are not
favorable in the medium term.
34.      Rehabilitation of the Beira-Mutare Pipeline.  A crude oil pipeline
was constructed in 1964 from the port of Beira in Mozambique to connect
with a refinery at Feruka, near Mutare in Zimbabwe.  The pipeline has been
out of commission since 1965, when pumping stopped after UDI. It is owned
by the Companhia de Pipeline Mozambique-Zimbabwe, a subsidiary of Lonrho
Limited of the United Kingdom. The facilities comprise 294 km of 10.7 inch
line with a pumping station at Beira, a meter station at the Mozambique-
Zimbabwe border and a receiving terminal at Feruka, with rates of flow
ranging from 1,360 to 3,000 liters per minute, to a maximum of about one
million metric tons per annum. Although the pipeline was primarily intend-
ed to carry crude oil, its owners early this year completed evacuation of
the contained crude, installed monitoring and detection equipment and modi-
fied the pumps and tank farm facilities of the refinery at Feruka to enable
the pipeline to carry refined products.
35.      Rehabilitation of the Petroleum Refinery.  The petroleum refinery
at Feruka was shut down the same time as the pipeline. The ownership of
its holding company, Central African Petroleum Refinery (CAPREF), is shared
by seven participating oil companies: British Petroleum and Shell (each
with 20.75 percent ownership); Mobil Petroleum (17.75 percent); Caltex
(15.75 percent); American Independent (15 percent); and Kuwait National
Petroleum and Total Oil Products (5 percent each). At the request of the
Government, CAPREF engaged consultants to study ways of restoring the re-
finery to its original state. The study also made provision for spare
parts for one year; process materials, catalysts and chemicals for six
months; modifications to comply with current factories and works regula-
tions, besides environmental pollution regulations; modifications to meet



- 11 -
current Shell operating and safety standards; and the upgrading and recom-
missioning of the laboratory. The study, completed in April 1981, estimat-
ed that t:he cost of such rehabilitation would be US$38 million, and imple-
mentation take 18 months.
36.      The CAPREF-appointed consultants were not asked to evaluate the
adequacy of the existing refinery configuration to process available crude
oils, whiLch have shown a trend towards heavier crudes in recent years, or
to meet the changing requirements for petroleum fuels of the Zimbabwean
market. The resulting rehabilitation proposals thus have the following
major inadequacies:
(a) The refinery has been designed as a single crude
refinery to process only Iranian light crude oil
or crude of similar characteristics. Major oil
producers have recently required oil purchasers
to uplift between 35 and 50 weight percent of the
heavier crudes such as Arabian heavy or Iranian
heavy. This proportion might increase, resulting
in further processing constraints;
(b) Assuming a two percent a year growth of gasoline
demand and three percent for middle distillates
(kerosene and diesel oil), gasoline yield from
the existing process configuration (41.6 percent
of the refinery's production) would greatly ex-
ceed the projected long-term gasoline require-
ments (27.8 percent without ethanol blend), while
the diesel oil and kerosene yield (44.8 percent)
would not meet the projected demand (65.2 per-
cent); and
(c) The refinery, as designed, would produce con-
siderable quantities of coke with high sulphur
content for which there is no market in Zimbabwe
or in neighboring countries. This would have to
be disposed of at uneconomic prices or dumped,
with environmental risks.
If the refinery were reopened without overcoming these inherent inade-
quacies, Zimbabwe would have to import substantial quantities of diesel oil
while exporting large volumes of gasoline, perhaps at uneconomic prices.
It would also be faced with the problem of disposal of high-sulphur coke.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.      The proposed project was identified in July 1981 during the Bank's
energy assessment mission. It was appraised during October-December,



- 1.
1981.  Two of the main olions for petroleum fuels supply -- using the
Beira-Mutare pipeline, poss-'Illy linked to the Feruka refinery; and obtain-
ing refined products from Zambia's refinery at Ndola -- were identified as
a result of the Bank's energy assessment in Zimbabwe and its work in the
petroleum refinery sector in Zambia. The Credit was negotiated in Washing-
ton from August 5-6, 1982. The Zimbabwe Government delegation was led by
Dr. M. Hove, Secretary, Ministry of Industry and Energy Development. Annex
III contains supplementary project data.
Project Objectives, Scope and Description
38.      The proposed project would finance detailed techno-economic stud-
ies to evaluate identifiable options for petroleum products supply avail-
able to Zimbabwe and recommend the optimum system. The project would pro-
pose improvements il. the procurement, supply, pricing and distribution of
petroleum fuels. It would also finance training in key areas in the petro-
leum fuels industry. The options to be evaluated would include, but not be
limited to:
(a) Importing gasoline and diesel oil, and probably
other compatible products, via the Beira-Mutare
pipeline and importing other products (e.g., LPG
or bitumen) by alternative means, such as rail or
road from a reliable port. Evaluation of this
option would take into account the reliability of
the Beira port and likely pipeline charges;
(b)   Refining Zimbabwe-procured crude oil at Mozam-
bique's PETROMOC refinery. Evaluation would in-
clude an assessment of the capability of
PETROMOC to process the crude and meet
Zimbabwe's petroleum requirements;
(c)   Rehabilitating the CAPREF refinery at Feruka
(para. 35) with a modified process configuration
to meet projected demand. Evaluation would in-
clude assessment of the adaptability of existing
plant and the cost of rehabilitation with appro-
priate modifications. These costs would be com-
pared with the costs of constructing a suitable
new refinery;
(d)   Importing refined products from Zambia's INDENI
Petroleum refinery in Ndola, which would require
evaluation of a pipeline from Ndola to Harare,
and an assessment of the need for expansion at
the INDENI refinery to meet Zimbabwe's require-
ments.



- 13 -
39.      Estimated charges required to cover investment, operating and/o-:
transportation costs for each of the options would be assessed, and the
legal aspects of the selected option would be considered. If the optic-.
finally selected Involved the Beira-Mutare pipeline (e.g., options a, b o -
c above), the need for a refined product pipeline from Mutare to Harare
would be assessed. In addition, the studies would recommend improvements
in current petroleum procurement practices, the pricing structure and in-
ternal d:lstribution of petroleum products. Detailed terms of reference
agreed oni with the Government are included as Annex IV.
Project Cost and Financing
40.      Total estimated cost of the proposed project is US$1.36 million
equivalent net of taxes, of which US$1.2 million would be in foreign ex-
change. The Association would finance the foreign exchange costs and the
Government the local costs. Details are shown in the Credit and Project
Summary. Cost estimates are based on 1982 prices and include physical con-
tingencies of 15 percent and price contingencies, in US dollar terms, of
8.5 percent in 1982 and 7.5 percent in 1983. The Association reserves the
right to refinance the credit under any subsequent Bank Group project for
improving fuels supply (draft Development Credit Agreement, page one).
Project Implementation
41.      The studies would be executed by a Project Unit in the Ministry of
Industry and Energy Development headed by a Deputy Secretary (Energy Devel-
opment) and assisted by an energy planner as a full-time project coordina-
tor (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.02(b)). The Government
would also create a Steering Group, representing relevant institutions, to
oversee the project and coordinate its work with other government agencies
and with the foreign oil companies. Creation of the Project Unit and the
Steering Group would be a condition of effectiveness (draft Development
Credit Agreement, Sections 3.02 and 4.01). The Project Unit would be as-
sisted by specialized consultants. The project is expected to be executed
in nine months, beginning from the effective date of awarding the contract
to the consultants. The Government and Association would discuss the find-
ings of the study and the Government's plans for implementing the selected
option (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.03(e)). The Govern-
ment will nominate for the Association's approval, up to six candidates for
training courses outside Zimbabwe, in the field of Petroleum fuels (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.06).
Selection of Consultants
42.      The qualifications, experience, selection and conditions of em-
ployment of the specialized consultants for the studies would be in accord-
ance with Bank Guidelines (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.03), and their employment would be a condition of effectiveness (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.01(b)). Proposals would be invited
from an agreed short-list of firms. The successful consulting firm is ex-
pected to be selected by October 1982, with contract negotiation and



- 14 -
signing ½ NovetTher.  T'he consulta ts would be expec'.   -            work by
the end of November.  The project would require an estLimaled 85 h-n-months
of consulting services, including 70 man-months of expertise to be con-
tracted from abroad. The average cosL of the foreign consulting services,
including per diem and reimbursable costs, is estimated at US$14,000 per
man-month and is considered reasonable by industry standards. Local ser-
vices would be provided by technical personnel in MIED drawn from the Plan-
ning and Management Unit and Research and Development Unit. Average cost
of local services is estimated at US$900 per man month, consistent with re-
muneration of senior local technical personnel.
Disbursement
43.      The IDA credit would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of: (i) the specialized consultancy services for the studies; (iI)
expenditures of the professional staff of the Project Unit related to
visits to the consultant services firm's home office during supervision of
the study; and (iii) fellowships not exceeding US$100,000Q Disbursements
are expected to be completed by December 1983.
Benefits and Risks
44.      The detailed economic and technical studies proposed under the
..oject are expected to result in the identification of the optimum petro-
im fuels supply system for Zimbabwe. This has been given the highest
iority by the Government in view of the high cost and uncertainties in
trhe supply of such fuels. The study would also recommend improvements con-
sidered necessary in petroleum products procurement practices, pricing
structure and internal distribution. There are no unusual risks associated
with the project. However, as geopolitical developments and their effect
on future petroleum supply to Zimbabwe are unpredictable, the studies can
only take into account a range of broad possibilities in evaluating secur-
ity of supply.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zimbabwe and the Association and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
would be distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.      Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III.  Condi-
tions of effectiveness would be the creation of the Project Unit and the
Steering Group and employment of the consultants.
47.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of the Association.



- 15-
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program is being
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstructi.on of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved. Therefore, a second program-type
lending operation aimed at export promotion is under preparation.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
under preparation.

IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of WCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In the renegotiation
of the Coal Pricing Agreement, Government reconfirmed its commitment to the
Wankie project and its support for the company's financial commitments un-
der the IFC Investment Agreement. Specifically, as Wankie may not be able
to have a successful rights offering in the current stock market environ-
ment, Government is now negotiating with the company the terms of an equity
investment to replace the rights issue.
The Company requested a second disbursement which was made on
March 10, 1982. As a result, the company has now drawn US$8.0 million of
the US$20.0 million "A" loan from IFC and US$7.2 million of the US$18 mil-

REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
PETROLEUM FUELS SUPPLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PETROLEUM FUELS SUPPLY
TERMS-OF-REFERENCE
Introduction
1.        The Republic of Zimbabwe currently imports almost all of its petro-
leum fuels requirements through the Republic of South Africa by rail. The
Government wishes to contract the services of an experienced, specialized
consulting firm to carry out a detailed comparative economic and engineering
study of all identifiable alternative petroleum products supply systems with
the objective of selecting the optimum supply system that minimizes petroleum
import cost and ensures reliability and security.
2.        It would be incumbent on the consultants to evaluate the reliabil-
ity, risks and security of each option considered.
Background
3.        A crude oil pipeline exists between the port of Beira in Mozambique
and Mutare in Zimbabwe. The pipeline came into operation in February, 1965
and was shut down in December 1965. The pipeline is owned by the Companhia
de Pipeline Mozambique-Zimbabwe, a subsidiary of Lonrho Limited of U.K. The
facilities comprise 294 km of 10.7-inch line with a pumping station at Beira,
together with a meter station at the Mozambique/Zimbabwe border and a receiv-
ing terminal adjacent to a mothballed refinery at Feruka, near Mutare. The
pumps are designed to permit variable rates of flow ranging from 1,360 to
3,000 litres per minute, and a maximum of about one million tons per annum.
Although the line was primarily intended to carry crude oil, it is being re-
habilitated to carry refined petroleum products.
4.        Zimbabwe also has a 20,000 barrels per stream day refinery at
Feruka, near Mutare. Its crude oil supply line is the Beira-Mutare pipeline
mentioned in paragraph 3 above. The refinery came on stream in April 1965
and was mothballed at about the same time as the pipeline ceased operating.
Its facilities consist of (a) a Crude unit; (b) a Platformer; (c) a Fluid
Catalytic Cracker; (d) a Delayed Coker; (e) a Poly-gasoline unit; and (f) an
Asphalt unit. The refinery is owned by the Central African Petroleum Re-
finery Company Limited (CAPREF), a company whose equity shares are held by



- 27 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 8
Shell, British Petroleum, American Independent Oil Company, Kuwait National
Petroleum Company, California Texas Oil Company, Total Oil Products and Mobil
Petroleum Company. Shell on behalf of CAPREF engaged Fluor Nederlands B.V.
in 1980 to conduct a detailed rehabilitation study of the refinery:
(i)   to restore the refinery to "as built" design and
mechanical conditions including spare parts for
one year, process materials, catalysts and
chemicals for six months and modifications
required to comply with current factories and
works regulations other than environmental and
pollution regulations;
(11)   to determine modifications required to meet
current Shell standards for operability and
safety; and
(iii)   upgrading the laboratory and recommissioning and
startup.
The study was completed in April 1981.
5.        Zimbabwe's petroleum fuels consumption consists of liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), motor gasoline, aviation kerosene, illuminating
kerosene, diesel oil and bitumen.  About 40 million litres of ethanol are
locally produced from sugarcane juice and blended with imported motor
gasoline. Petroleum requirements for 1981 are estimated at about 617
thousand tons. The 1981 petroleum import cost (c.i.f. Harare) is estimated
at about 22% of 1981 projected export earnings; in 1980, petroleum imports
cost US$255 million which was also about 22% of export earnings.
Objectives of the Study
6.        The main objectives of the study are the following:
'i)   to review and analyze the existing petroleum
product specifications in Zimbabwe and recommend
the extent to which these can be modified to
result in net economic benefits;
'ii) to identify and carry out a comparative economic
analysis of all the practical and reliable
econmic options available to Zimbabwe for meeting
its petroleum fuels requirements to the year 2000
taking into account availability of indigenous
hydroelectricity, coal and ethanol from biomass



Annex IV
Page 3 of 8
to replace current uses of imported petroleum
fuels, and recommend the optimum option and;
(iii)  to provide a comprehensive and documented
compilation of all detailed facts concerning the
optimum option whlch could be presented to
potential equity participants and sources or
financing.
7.        The consultants will develop the projected fuels requirements to
the year 2000 under three scenarios -  low, medium and high growths -- taking
into account projected GDP growth, proposed development strategy of the
various sectors of the economy and other relevant factors. An energy
assessment study prepared for the Government by the World Bank is available.
8.        To ensure that the objectives of the study are met, the consultants
would provide the services of highly qualified experts with knowledge of the
structure, economics, technologies and legal aspects of the petroleum
industry. If the consultant firm is deficient in any area, it would be
required to consider associating itself with a highly competent specialized
firm to overcome the deficiency.
Schedule of Study Implementation
9.        It is expected that the consultant firm-s work will take about 8
months to complete from date of contract award. Within 3 months from the
start of work, the consultants shall submit to the Government of Zimbabwe
(with copies to the World Bank) a report outlining its preliminary findings.
The preliminary report shall include firm petroleum fuels requirements to
year 2000 and a compilation of all the facts relating to objectives (i) and
(ii) above. It is proposed to have several interim reviews at key stages of
the execution of the study, as agreed with the Government of Zimbabwe, in
order to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the stuay.
Scope of Work
10.      The specific  areas to be covered by the study shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:
Demand/Suply of Petroleum Products
(i)   review all available information on energy consumption in
Zimbabwe with particular emphasis on the extent of the demand
served by petroleum fuels; examine past trends (1964-1980)
and discuss the extent to which these trends have been



- 29 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 8
modified or constrained by crude oil prices, interfuel
substitution programs and economic conditions in the country;
review in detail the proposed plans for development of
indigenous sources of energy such as hydroelectric power and
coal, and the extent to which these would affect future
demand for petroleum fuels;
(ii)  assess the impact of the proposed expansion of ethanol
production capacity under the proposed Chisumbanje project on
the future demand for gasoline;
(iii) prepare a forecast for petroleum fuels demand to year 2000
under low, medium and high scenarios, taking into account
economic indicators such as projected GDP growth rate and the
results of the review in (i), (ii) and (iii) above;
(iv)   review crude oil types and sources, examine availability of
such crudes to Zimbabwe and assess the extent to which
heavier crudes like Arabian Heavy may become dominant in
crude oil markets;
(v)   prepare a price forecast in real terms for the major types of
crude oils and refined products up to the year 2000, taking
into account only expected real price increases. All
assumptions used should be clearly stated; and
(vi)  review historical and current price relationship between
refined products and crude oil; identify any factors likely
to affect the relationship in the future.
P'rocurement and Transportation of Petroleum Products to Zimbabwe
(i)   review in detail the existing refined products procurement
practices in Zimbabwe and recommend any changes likely to
reduce overall procurement cost; changes recommended in
this regard should be supported by clear documentation of the
reliability and potential benefits to Zimbabwe;
(ii)  examine existing channels/arrangements of transportation of
petroleum products to the country; identify any bottlenecks
and recommend feasible changes for overcoming them;
(iii) prepare a detailed price breakdown of each type of petroleum
product (LPG, naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, etc.) Xnto (a)
FOB cost, (b) insurance, (c) freight, (d) port handling
charges, (e) road/railage charges, (f) other handling
charges, and (g) CIF cost landed in Zimbabwe.

,age 5 of 8
Marketin and Distribution of Petroleum Products
(i)   describe the organizational institutional framework for
marketing and distribution of petroleum products in Zimbabwe
(companies involved, ownership, size, geographical/product
coverage, etc);
(ii)  review the physical facilities used for internal
transportation, storage and distril5ution of petroleum
products; indicate the volumes transported by each transport
mode, the size and locations of storage facilities, and
recommend any changes necessary to improve the system;
(iii) prepare a breakdown, by region or major consumption centers,
of the retail price for each refinery product into: (a) CIF
cost, (b) wholesale price, (c) dealer/retailer margin, and
(d) taxes; compare retail prices with those prevailing in
neighboring countries (Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique
and South Africa);
Refined Product Pricing System
(i)   review the pricing structure and policy for retail prices and
identify any subsidies; and
(ii)  compare retail prices by region and product with CIF prices
and in the light of this comparison and conclusions in
Section C (iii), recommend a mechanism for ensuring that
retail prices of refined products reflect the full economic
cost to the country.
Identification and Evaluation of Options for Petroleum Supply
(i)   review the existing product specifications with respect to
distillation range, flash and smoke points, cetane and
research octane numbers and sulphur content and examine the
extent to which these specifications can be changed without
harmful effects on user, equipment life, cost of operations
and the environment; identify/quantify any economic benefits
to be derived from changes in specifications;
(ii)  based on the projected petroleum products requirements to
year 2000 in Section A and the recommended changes in product
specifications in (i) above, identify all practical,

ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 8
economic options available to Zimbabwe for meeting its
petroleum fuels requirements. Each option shall be designed
and costed on the basis of the high growth scenario but its
benefits evaluated on the basis of the low growth projected
requirements in Section A for the base case analysis;
relevant sensitivity tests should be carried out. The
options considered shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) importing of gasoline and diesel oil, and possibly other
compatible product(s), through the Beira-Mutare pipeline,
and other products (LPG, bitumen etc.) by alternative
means such as by rail or by road from reliable
transshipment ports. Evaluation of this option shall
take into account (i) cost of rehabilitating the
pipeline to ensure operational reliability; (ii)
reliability of the port of Beira for regular use as a
transshipment point; (iii) investment cost for
reception facilities at the port of Beira; (iv)
investment cost of tank farm, reception and storage
facilities at Feruka; (v) evaluation of overall
pipeline investment cost and estimation of pipeline
throughput charges that would ensure recovery of
investments and reasonable return; and (vi) estimates
of freight, handling and other charges for transshipment
of other products not compatible with pipeline
transportation;
(b) refining of Zimbabwe-procured crude oils at MozambiqueTs
PETROMOC oil refinery.   Evaluation of this option shall
take into account (i) relevant factors as in option (a)
above in addition to technical and economic evaluation
of the capability of PETROMOC to process Zimbabwe-s
petroleum requirements; and (ii) arrangements required
for procurement of crude by Zimbabwe;
(c) rehabilitation of the CAPREF refinery at Feruka on the
basis of a process configuration designed to meet
projected market requirements over the economic life of
a refinery with the flexibility to process heavier crude
oils such as Arabian, Iranian or Heavy. Evaluation of
this otion will include (i) detailed description of the
Central African Petroleum Refinery (ownership distri-
butlon, transferability of shares, company by-laws, date

configuration, including offsites, conslstent with
projected demand profi'le and crude oils 1l-kely to be
easily available in the future;  (vi)  estimation of
processing charges sufficient to recover overall
investment cost in rehabUlitated refinery plus a
reasonable return; (vi) reliability of the port of
Beira for regular use as a transshipment soint for the
crude feed; (vii) rehabilitation of thtae Beira-Mutare
pipeline as a crude oil pipeline; (viii) evaluation of
pipeline investment cost and estimation of throughput
charges that would ensure recovery of investments and a
reasonable return; and (ix) a comparison of the cost of
rehabilitation with appropriate modification of the
CAPREF refinery with the cost of constructing a new
grass-roots refinery designed on the basis of a process
configuration consistent with the projected demand
profile and with the flexibility to process heavier
crudes likely to be easily available in the future. The
latter costs shall include (i) offsites.; and (ii)
pipeline for bringing in the crude feed;
(d) import of refined products Erom Zambia's INDENI
Petroleum Refinery at Ndola. This option shall include
(i) evaluation of a pipeline from Ndola to Harare;
(ii) assessment of the need for expansion of process and
other units at INDENI Petroleum Refinery to meet
Zimbabwean requirements; (iii) estlimation of the
throughput charges required to ensure recovery of the
investments in the pipeline and a reasonable return;
and (iv) development of an appropriate formula for
refined products that would ensure recovery of
additional investments and use of existring facilities at
INDENI, plus a reasonable return.

ANNEX IV
Page 8 of 8
(iii) Options (a), (b) and (c) above shall include evaluation of a
refined product pipeline from Mutare to Harare for at least
the projected consumption requirements of the Harare region.
(iv)  describe in sufficient detail the scope, configuration and
technology of each option considered; identify existing
facilities, any rehabilitation work necessary and all new
facilities required to ensure the operating viability of each
option; all assumptions associated with each option shall be
clearly stated;
(v)   prepare preliminary design of adequate detail to enable
estimation of capital and operating cost and working capital
requirements of sufficient reliability (+/- 15%) for each
option;
(vi)  prepare an efficient and economic implementation plan and
provide a schedule of expenditures for each option
considered; and
(vii) by means of comparative present value analysis, using a range
of opportunity cost of capital (12% - 20%), rank the various
options beginning with the least cost; evaluate the relative
merits of each option (reliability, risks, security, etc.)
and recommend the most appropriate option for the
consideration of the Government of Zimbabwe.
Legal Aspects
(i)   identify all legal aspects associated with each option.
(ii)  propose necessary steps that need to be taken in connection
with legal aspects on the selected option, taking into
account experience elsewhere.
