MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BURKINA FASO
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCh PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
development credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 14.1 mlilion (US$17.9 million
equivalent) is submitted  for approval.   The proposed credit  would be  on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance the first 5-year
phase of a long-term national agricultural research program.
2.        Background.  With  a  per  capita  GNP of  $140  in  1985  and  a
population of 7.9 million, Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in
the world and one of the most densely populated in the Sahel of West
Africa. The population growth rate is estimated at 2.6% per annum.
Agriculture employs 80-902 of the population, and accounts for about 402 of
GDP and almost all exports. Of the country's geographic area of 27.4
million ha, agricultural land (including forest and grazing lands) covers
about  24 million  ha,  or  nearly  90%.   Improved  performance  in   the
agricultural sector will therefore be  crucial for future growth.  In  July
1982, the  Burkinabe  Government  invited  FAD, the  World  Bank,  and  the
International Service for  National Agricultural Research  (ISNAR) to  help
formulate a  long  term  agricultural  research  program.   After  separate
exploratory missions, a joint FAOIISNARIBank mission drew up an inventory
of  ongoing  research  programs,  and  presented  its  recomendations   to
Government in March 1983. The report, titled 'Agriculture and Livestock
Research', detailed appropriate instit-utional infrastructures, outlined a
plan for a long-term research program and provided a general framework for
external technical and financial assistance. The report concluded that in
the short and medium term, research and development activities should be
aimed at eliminating constraints now hampering agricultural productivity,
economic development and existing production systems. In addition to the
short-term objectives of increasing production of food and export crops,
the long term plan for the agricultural sector called for the stabilization
of farming systems and the protection of the environment, including soil,
water, forestry, and grazing resources. To help the country act upon these
recommendations, IDA in May 1982 provided a first tranche (US$275,000) of a
*        US$0.5  million  Project  Preparation  Facility  (PPE}.   This  financed  a
research adviser and seminars to elaborate and discuss a long-term research
program. During a February 1985 seminar at Ouagadougou attended by
national  and  international  research  staff  and  donor  representatives,
research priorities and ways to strengthen the national research capacity
were agreed upon  in principle.   A second  PPF tranche  of US$225,000  was
provided in 1985 to prepare a national agricultural research project for
external funding, to start training a nucleus staff, and to initiate new
priority  tesearch  activities.    During  the  final   stage  of   project
preparation in mid-1986, it was decided that because of the importance of
trees in the rural  economy, a forestry research  component should also  be
included in the proposed project.   The Institut d'Etudes et de  Recherches
Agricoles (INERA) and Institut de Recherche en Biologie et Ecologie
Tropicale (IRBET) are specialized institutes of the Centre National de la



-2-
Recherche   Scientifique   et   Technologique   (CNRST)   responsible   for
agricultural (including livestock) and forestry research, respectively.
CNRST is an "Etabliasement Public de l'Etat 'a caractare Administratif"
(EPA) in the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS).
3.        Rationale for  IDA  Involvement.  Agricultural  development,  the
heart of our strategy in Burkina, needs to be supported by a strong
national research program. IDA involvement is consistent with our broader
leadership role towards agricultural research in Sub-Saharan Africa and it
is key to ensure the coordination with international research and the donor
community and preserve the continuity of this long-term endeavour.
4.        Project Objectives.  The  proposed project  would constitute  the
first  phase  of  a  long-term   (10  to  15-year)  development plan   for
agricultural research. One of the principal design criteria has been that
it should be a financially and administratively sustainable and manageable
project. The long-term plan would aim at developing a unified national
agricultural research institution and organization dealing with crop,
livestock and forestry production, and catering to the needs of the
different categories of primary producers in the various agro-ecological
zones of the country. Such an organization would be staffed largely by
trained Burkinabi research specialists and a few short-term outside
consultants. Accordingly, objectives of this first 5-year phase would be,
to:
(i) strengthen and consolidate the capacity of national agricultural
research (including livestock and forestry) to plan, execute and
evaluate research programs that are in line with Government
agricultural policies, responsive to farmers' needs, and alert to
relevant research conducted in neighboring countries and/or by
international institutes;
(ii) improve the balance and linkages between individual research
programs, by placing greater emphasis on multidisciplinary,
systems-oriented research, as opposed to the commodity-oriented
research that has prevailed in the past;
(iii) strengthen links between research and extension services.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would seek to  achieve
the above objectives by financing: a) improvements to INER&'s basic
network of research centers, with emphasis on existing fr.cilities, and to
the physical infrastructure at INERA and IRBET headquarters; b) short- and
long-term technical assistance and staff training needed to strengthen the
local capacity to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate a national
agricultural  research  program,  including  livestock  and  forestry;   c)
equipment, vehicles and supplies, and the operating and maintenance costs
associated with the implementation of the priority research programs; d)
equipment and operating costs (travel allowances and vehicle operating
costs) incurred by research staff for the periodic training of extension
staff (subject matter specialists). In order to concentrate, rather than
disperse, scarce resources and skills, and to allow a critical mass of



- 3 -
research staff to work effectively, emphasis during the first years of the
project would be on consolidating research programs; on rehabilitating and
equipping existing infrastructure and facilities at Kamboinse, Saria and
Farako-Bi; and on financing the operating expenses of priority research
programs and  activities.   Funding  would also  be  provided  for  initial
investments in support of applied research programs, including exploratory
surveys within the farming systems and physical resources (Water, Soils,
Fertilization, Irrigation and Agricultural Machinery) research programs,
varietal testing, and improved seed production at the three locations -
Kouare, Di and Katchari - where full fledged regional research stations
would be developed at a later stage. The 5-year project is estimated to
cost US$18.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of 49Z.
A breakdown of costs,  and the financing plan  are in Schedule A.   Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Burkina Faso are in Schedules C
and D  , respectively.   A map  No. 20120  and Staff  Appraisal Report  No.
6683-BUR dated September 15, 1987, are also attached.
6.        Actions Agreed Upon.  In addition to the usual covenants, it was
agreed during negotiations that: (i) Government would hold annual meetings
with IDA and other major donors participating in the financing of
agricultural research, to review the previous year's results and to discuss
the following year's research work programs; and (ii) during the third year
of the project, Government would conduct an in-depth mid-term review of
project  progress  and  of   the  appropriateness  of  organizational   and
institutional  arrangements  for   agricultural,  livestock  and   forestry
research. Conditions of Effectiveness include the requirement that (a) the
tenancy of land assigned to INERA and IRBET has been legally attributed to
HESRS; (b) an internationally recruited Research Management Specialist has
been appointed; and (c) the members of INERA's Management Council have been
appointed.
7.        Benefits.  The  project would  contribute to  the development  of
INERA  and  IRBET's  research  management  capacity.   Joint  planning  and
coordination of the national research programs with those of  international
research institutions, and improved linkages between research and extension
are expected to lead to more efficient use of scarce human and financial
resources and thereby increase the impact of other investments in the
agriculture and rural sectors. The project is also designed to address the
increasingly serious problems of environmental degradation and decreasing
productivity.
8.        Risks.   As  with  all   such  projects,  there  is   necessarily
uncertainty concerning the  eventual impact of  the research programs  and,
hence, what the precise benefits may be. One potential risk resides in the
adequacy of the linkages between research and extension services. However,
good working relationships already exist at headquarters and in the field
between  these   two  technical   branches  of   government.   The   direct
participation of research staff in the training of extension workers, the
representation of MESRS and the Ministry of Agriculture (MAE) on INERA's



-4-
planning  would  all   help  lessen   the  risk   and  further   strengthen
research-extension  linkages.   Other  risks  are  those  inherent  in  all
research projects, namely difficulties in obtaining adequate staff and
funds. These risks are considered relatively small, however, in the case
of Burkina, where in recent years the Government has shown a strong
commitment to research. Moreover, the project's technical assistance and
training components would help minimize those risks, and project design has
minimized the incremental recurrent cost implications for the Burkinab;
Government.
9.        Recommendation.  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit  would
comply with the articles of agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
