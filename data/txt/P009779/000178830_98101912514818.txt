I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The large area of India and the widespread dispersal of population
throughout the country creates a need for widespread and efficient telecom-
munications services. Successive Governments of India have recognized that
a free and rapid flow of information throughout the country is a necessary
prerequisite to the efficient operation of agriculture, industry, commerce,
transportation, and administration. This has also been recognized by the
Bank Group which has assisted the sector over the past 18 years. At the
present time, however, even though there are 2.6 million telephones in the
country, there is still much to be done to improve access to and quality of
telecommunications service.
1.02      The telecommunications sector in India is state-owned and com-
prises the following:
(a) the Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T), within the
Ministry of Communications, which operates all the public
telecommunications facilities within India, and to
adjacent countries;
(b) the Overseas Communications Service (OCS), a separate
Government agency, also within the Ministry of Communica-
tions, which operates the international service to non-
adjacent countries; and
(c) the telecommunications manufacturing industry, of which
the three major entities are the Government-owned Indian
Telephone Industries Limited (ITI), Hindustan Cables
Limited (HCL) and Hindustan Teleprinters Limited (HTL).
In addition to these, there are many small-scale indus-
tries, some which act as subcontractors to the major man-
ufacturers 1/ and others as direct suppliers to the P&T.
1.03      The sector provides a significant source of employment with the
Telecommunications Branch of P&T employing approximately 310,000 people.
The three largest manufacturers together have about 32,000 employees. The
majority of tnese people are employed away from the major metropolitan
centers.
1/ ITI currently has about 200 small-scale industrial firms subcontracting
to it, while HTL has about 170 and HCL about 90.



-2-
Access to Service
1.04      While India has a comparatively large telecommunications network
by world standards, with more than 2.0 million direct exchange lines (DELs)
and 2.6 milliorn telephones, the ready access of the population to services
and the quality of telephone service is poor compared to many other coun-
tries. India's 1978 telephone density 1/ of 0.36 is low compared with
Malaysia - 2.86; Papua New Guinea - 1.3; Philippines - 1.26; Thailand - 0.8;
and Sri Lanka - 0.5. The average for Asia, excluding Japan, is 0.6 while
the world average is 10.2 (Annex 1).
1.05      Telephone density and access is poor not only in the rural areas
but also in the major cities when compared with principal cities in other
countries. In India density varies from about 2 telephones per 100 popula-
tion for cities such as Hyderabad, Calcutta and Lucknow to close to 4 for
Delhi and Bombay. This compares with telephone densities of 4.8 for Bang-
kok; 7.7 for Manila; 8.7 for Teheran; 11.2 for Nairobi; 19.6 for Singapore.
1.06      The geographical distribution of telephone services in India at
March 1980 shows the greatest proportion of unsatisfied demand in Bombay and
Delhi with the other cities and the rest of the country about even. This is
illustrated in the following table:

1/  Telephone density:  number of telephones per 100 population.
2/  OYT stands for "own your telephone" and represents a procedure under
which potential subscribers (mostly business people) who pay relatively
large deposits varying from Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 (Annex 16) on register-
ing as an applicant for service, receive priority status for obtaining
telephone service when facilities become available.
3/ Demand is defined as the number of DELs plus the number of registered
waiters (i.e., the waiting list).



- 3 -
1.07      The present official waiting list for telephone service in India
is misleading because:
(a)  many rural areas and towns are without service and so
have no recorded waiting list; moreover, in many places
with service, it is well known that prospective subscrib-
ers will wait for many years before being connected and
potential subscribers are consequently discouraged from
registering; and
(b)  in order to register as an applicant for telephone ser-
vice it is necessary to pay an advance deposit at the
time of registering varying from Rs 5,000 (US$600) to
Rs 800 (US$100) for connection to exchanges with more
than 100 lines, and down to Rs 100 for small manual
exchanges providing part-time service only. This
arrangement was introduced in 1976 and resulted in a drop
in the official waiting list from 637,000 to 250,000 in
1976 and 184,000 in 1977. At the end of 1975 the waiting
list was seven times larger than the annual connection
rate. Even though the waiting list is now down to two
and one-half times the current annual connection rate
there is a large level of suppressed or hidden demand in
both rural and urban areas.
1.08      Away from the larger towns, telephone service is provided over a
network of long distance public call offices (PCOs) which comprise a single
open wire line (or a radio, cable or carrier circuit) with a telephone con-
necting the town or village to the nearest city. As demand in such an area
grows, a small telephone exchange is installed at the PCO location and the
original line used as a trunk circuit to the network. The GOI and the P&T
have been allocating a significant share of the available resources into
noncity areas for many years and in March 1980 there were about 14,000 PCOs
and 5,000 small (less than 100 lines) telephone exchanges. However, of the
45,000 towns with a population exceeding 2,000, more than half still have no
telephone facilities either in the form of a PCO or telephone exchange.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.09      The existing facilities in the Indian telecommunications network
are outlined in Annex 2. Despite a substantial increase in the number of
new lines over the last five years, India has not been able to cope with the
demand and the waiting list is increasing as shown in the following table:

Due to this significant underprovision of telephone services, the calling
rates in most large cities are very high and the probability of the called
subscriber being busy is much higher than is considered desirable. This
brings about repeated call attempts to busy numbers, and, as a result,
generates even more traffic throughout the network. This, in turn, not only
creates congestion in the call handling plant which is shared by all
subscribers but also further increases the overall probability of
encountering a busy subscriber. This type of congestion, compounded by
failures of calls because of faulty equipment, results in an overall poor
quality of service in the local networks. The quality of service in the
long distance network is also poor because of the difficulties of completing
calls through the local networks and because of inadequate provision of
trunk switching equipment. The number of effective manual trunk calls, for
example, is only about 77 percent of the calls attempted and the waiting
time for the call to be connected is often over four hours.
1.10      The P&T has been studying the problems of service quality to
determine both short- and long-term solutions. A number of measures have
already been implemented and others are proposed. The project now under
consideration contains an element for upgrading the quality of the network
(paragraphs 2.07 and 2.08). The P&T has developed a management information
system which helps identify and localize particular problems and enables
performance to be monitored. There is evidence that the quality of service
has improved a little in the last three years and the increasing investment
proposed over the next three years together with the Network Upgrading
Program (paragraph 2.07) will ensure continuing improvement.
Demand for Service
1.11      A number of studies have been carried out by the P&T and the GOI
Planning Commission in an attempt to accurately forcast the demand for both
telephone and telex services in India. The studies are complicated by the
high level of registered unsatisfied demand and the unknown level of sup-
pressed demand. Also with the introduction of the advance deposit scheme in
1976 (paragraph 1.07 (b)), waiters in different areas while depositing the
same amount of money, must wait for different lengths of time before secur-
ing a telephone; hence, the effective cost to them is different.

future demand for telephone service are shown in the following table:

ly involved in another demand study, investigating growth factors in a num-
ber of separate cities and regions with a view to synthesizing a total
demand estimate. Other studies relating to subscriber motivations and sub-
scriber needs are in hand and should also help in further defining the
demand estimates.
1.14       It will be seen from the table above that existing projections of
future demand are generally based on a steady 12 percent per annum growth

rate on the existing registered demand, and that the 1990 demand is pro-
jected at more than 7 million DELs compared with about 2 million at pres-
ent. At a constant ratio of telephones to DELs this would give India about
9 to 10 million telephones by 1990. Sixteen other countries are expected to
have a similar or greater number of telephones by 1990 and these are listed
in Annex 3, together with their telephone densities and past growth rates.
The projected growth rate for India does not look out of place in this
context.
1.15      Demand for trunk calls in India is also difficult to predict
because of the very severe shortage of long distance switching facilities.
Typically in a telephone network long distance traffic grows at about double
the rate of growth of DELs but there is no way at present of making a reli-
able estimate of the base from which to project. The present FY81-85 five-
year plan allows for the expansion of the long distance switching network as
rapidly as the necessary equipment can be procured and installed in a con-
trolled manner. Nevertheless, the demand will not be met in the five-year
period. Following the installation of electronic automatic trunk exchanges
in the four main metropolitan cities in 1981/82, more extensive traffic data
will become available which will enable improved traffic forecasts to be
made.
1.16      Demand for telex services also far exceeds the supply.  Once again
better projections of demand will become possible following the installation
of electronic switching centers in the four main cities in 1981. In many
countries telex demand has grown at rates of 15 percent to 25 percent per
annum for many years, and the current P&T projection of demand growing at 13
percent per annum is likely to be low. However, raising the projected telex
demand would not lead to a major modification in the first three years of
the five-year program at this stage, because of limitations in availability
of equipment and installation capacity.
Sector Constraints
1.17      The major constraint to the development of an efficient telecommu-
nications system in India has been the lack of resources which have been
made available to the sector and the limited output of switching equipment
from the local factories. This latter problem is being partly alleviated by
increased imports of equipment and upgrading the capacity of the local manu-
facturer which was commenced under the seventh Bank Project (1592-IN) and is
continued and expanded in this project. In recent years telecommunications
investment in developing countries has been around 0.3 percent of GDP;
India's 0.17 percent has been low compared with Malaysia--0.34;
Pakistan--0.32; Burma--0.23; USA--0.83; UK--l.23 and Japan--l.05. The new
five-year P&T development plan, which is based on the ten-year horizon plan
for eliminating the waiting list by 1990, provides for higher levels of
investment in the sector.
1.18      Past financial constraints have related mainly to foreign exchange
since adequate quantities of local currency have been generated through
retained earnings of the Telecommunications Branch of the P&T. With the



- 7 -
present level of tariffs and the steadily expanding subscriber trunk dialing
(STD) network, P&T should be able during the next three years to produce
internally over 65 percent of its investment needs, even allowing for the
continuation of the policy of covering postal losses from telecommunications
earnings (paragraphs 5.03 and 5.11).
Sector Objectives
1.19      The GOI is preparing a new five-year plan, 1981-85, which partial-
ly overlaps and supersedes the previous 1979-83 five-year plan which was the
basis for the seventh telecommunications project. To provide a sound base
for its part of the new five-year plan, the P&T prepared a ten-year plan
(1981-90) designed to achieve a series of service objectives by 1990. The
P&T's 1981-85 five-year plan is therefore derived within the context of a
ten-year planning horizon and specific ten-year objectives.
1.20      The objectives of the ten-year plan are:
(a) provision of telephone and telex connections on demand by
1990;
(b) full automation of the local telephone exchange network;
(c) extension of telephone services either through a tele-
phone exchange or long distance public call office to
within five kilometers of most inhabited locations in the
country;
(d) provision of subscriber dialing facilities on an inte-
grated STD trunk network between all cities and towns
with a population of 50,000 or more (these would include
most district headquarters, industrial estates and
important project sites);
(e) provision of subscriber dialing facilities between all
telephone exchanges within a secondary switching area;
(f) replacement of worn out or obsolete equipment as it
reaches the end of its economic life;
(g) upgrading the quality of service insofar as traffic con-
gestion and transmission performance are concerned in
both the local and long distance networks;
(h) introducing significant increases in local equipment
manufacturing capability; and
(i) exploitation of new technologies to reduce the cost and
improve the quality of the telecommunications services.



-8-
1.21      The 1981-85 five-year plan consists of two general phases.  The
first phase, 1981-83 (which forms the basis of the proposed project) will
necessarily follow the general objectives and goals established in the pre-
vious 1978-83 plan because long lead time commitments have been made on the
basis of that plan. However, during this period the P&T capacity will be
increased so that in the second phase, 1984-85, the acceleration in the con-
struction program necessary to reach the long-term goals will be possible.
Some targets for the three and five-year periods are summarized below:

telephones and do not give weight to increased access in rural areas
through public call offices.
1.22      In the shorter term over the period covered by the proposed pro-
ject (FY1981-83), the P&T is directing investment and new services to Bombay
and Delhi, where the waiting lists are largest, and to the rural areas in
line with the GOI policy of encouraging rural industry and development in an
attempt to curb the urban population drift. This is shown in the following:

The Bank Group's Role in the Sector
1.23      The Bank Group has been associated with the sector since 1962 and
previous loans and credits comprise:
Amount
Loan/Credit          Year   (US$ Millions)
Credit     28-IN       1962          42

Credit    153-IN)      1969          55
Loan      615-IN)
Credit    241-IN       1971          78
Credit    403-IN       1973          80
Loan     1313-IN       1976          80
Loan     1592-IN       1978         120
Total                          488
1.24      During this period the Bank Group has provided much of the foreign
exchange required for the P&T's telecommunications development program al-
though in recent years there has been an increasing injection of foreign
exchange through bilateral loans and credits. The number of telephones has
increased since 1962 from 373,000 to more than 2.6 million; the trunk net-
work has been expanded and modernized, and an automatic telex network estab-
lished with currently about 18,000 subscribers. The Bank Group has also
assisted the P&T in modernizing its organizational and management structure,
and in establishing an Economic Research Cell which has begun to analyze
pricing, demand and investment issues in the sector.
1.25      The manufacturing entities have not always been able to grow or to
secure foreign exchange in line with the P&T's needs, and the proposed
credit to provide additional capital equipment for upgrading and modernizing
the factories, and the construction of new factories, will help them to
further increase their capacities to match the demands, further improve the
quality of their existing product lines, and launch them into electronic
telecommunications technologies.
1.26      The success of the Bank Group involvement with the Indian telecom-
munications sector may also be judged by the declining dependence of the P&T
capital works programs on Bank Group financing. During the 1970s, the
annual Bank Group disbursements to India for telecommunications development
have varied between US$30 million and US$40 million, while the annual capi-
tal works programs have increased from around US$120 million in the early
1970s, to around US$280 million in FY79. The Bank Group's financing of the
P&T construction program has dropped from about 32 percent in 1964 to about
15 percent currently.
1.27      Although the Bank Group financing is becoming smaller relative to
the total capital investment in the sector, its importance is increasing by



- 10 -
virtue of the freedom of choice of equipment suppliers that it gives to the
P&T and the generally lower prices resulting from international competitive
bidding (ICB) as against tied procurement. Over the next few years, it is
particularly important that the P&T be free to select new technology systems
without the major constraints imposed by the source of financing. System
decisions made over the period covered by this project will have an import-
ant long-term effect on the coverage, quality and cost of the Indian tele-
communications network. In the past decade bilateral loans amounting to
about US$100 million have been obtained by the P&T and it is likely that
additional financing of this nature will be obtained during the next few
years for equipment which can be procured under such arrangements.
1.28      A project performance audit has been conducted on the third and
fourth lending operations to telecommuniations in India. These projects
were considered by the audit to be successful. Some of the more significant
observations of the audit were:
(a) institutional and organizational achievements were sub-
stantial including implementation of commercial account-
ing and management information system;
(b) the projects contributed to the development of rural
telecommunications and national telecommunications
industries; and
(c) P&T did not achieve the high construction targets aimed
at and this resulted in traffic congestion and longer
than expected waiting times for connection to the system.
1.29      The project performance audit on the fifth lending operation was
conducted in December 1979. In this case the project was also considered to
be successful. The most significant observations of the audit were that
despite achieving the aims for institutional improvements there was a short-
fall in the provision of additional DELs commensurate with the growth in
demand, there remained a need to retain a system of relatively severe price
rationing and the quality of service continued to be poor. The audit also
commented on the desirability of moving into the electronic switching tech-
nology in the local factories. The sixth and seventh projects are proceed-
ing satisfactorily with the Bank loan for the sixth being fully committed
and for the seventh about 90 percent committed.
1.30      The present project contains a number of elements which relate to
these conclusions. The factory subprojects provide for the indigenous pro-
duction of electronic switching systems for trunks and rural subscribers as
well as electronic teleprinters. The P&T subproject is based on a 1981-85
five-year plan which considerably raises the levels of investment in tele-
communications. Although the projections show the unsatisfied demand rising
in the short term, the 1990 horizon plan, based on an average demand growth
rate of 12 percent per annum, forecasts that demand can be satisfied as it
occurs by 1990. The subproject also contains a network upgrading element as



- 1i -
a direct attempt to improve quality of service. For the time being, it will
be necessary for the relatively high prices, which serve to depress demand
and to allocate existing supplies to high productivity users, to be
maintained. The proposed project will therefore assist in satisfying the
major recommendations of the Project Performance Audit Report.
1.31      Looking to the future the Indian telecommunications sector should
become more self-reliant during the 1980's. During this (eighth) telecommu-
nications project the sector will adopt new technologies of great importance
to its future and will establish initial manufacturing capacity for the
modern systems. A ninth operation is envisaged in about three years time
which could well provide a valuable consolidation phase for the sector's
move into digital electronic technology, and which would further support the
increased telephone penetration throughout the country. Following that it
would be appropriate to determine whether there was a continuing useful role
for the Bank Group within the telecommunications sector and whether the
relationship should be changed in any way.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
2.01      This project is based on a comprehensive approach to the whole
telecommunications sector of India and is broken down into a number of sub-
projects to simplify description, analysis, supervision and disbursement.
The major subproject relates to the P&T construction program and it is from
this that the justification for the other subprojects is derived, These are
factory subprojects and comprise one for each of the three major suppliers
to the P&T--ITI, HCL and HTL. In each of these, there is a segment covering
modernization and upgrading of existing production facilities (an extension
of the programs included for the factories as subprojects in the seventh
telecommunications project) and a segment covering the establishment of a
new factory. The factory subprojects are designed to enable the indigenous
industry to expand and modernize in order that it may continue to meet both
in quantity and quality the material needs for implementation of the P&T
development program. In this section, the P&T program and subproject is
discussed first, followed in turn by the ITI, HCL and HTL subprojects.
A. The P&T Program and Subproject
2.02      The P&T construction program is embodied in its FY1981-85 fiveyear
plan. This plan has been developed from the previous FY1979-83 fiveyear
plan under revised guidelines issued by the Government. Because of the rap-
idly shifting technological base in telecommunications and the long lead
times involved in the introduction of new technologies, the P&T made a broad
perspective plan and defined targets and objectives for 1990. The existing
1979-83 program was extended to cover the period 1981-85 within the frame-
work of the 1990 horizon plan. The targets and objectives for the decade of
the 1980s were outlined in paragraphs 1.19 and 1.20. The year-by-year plan
for DELs is shown in Annex 4.



12 -
2.03      The new 1981-85 five-year plan is framed to set a course for the
achievement of these objectives. In addition to these physical targets, the
1981-85 plan provides for the introduction of new technologies in many parts
of the network. The new systems comprise the following:
(a) Electronic Local Exchanges: A 10,000-line electronic
local exchange has been ordered for Bombay, Delhi and
Calcutta.  These will be commissioned during 1981/82.
Further quantities of this system will be purchased and
bids will be invited for the establishment of a factory
to produce 500,000 lines per year of a digital electronic
local switching system;
(b)  Electronic Trunk Exchanges:  Electronic trunk exchanges
have been ordered for Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and
Madras.  These will be commissioned during 1981/82 and
additional orders for expansion will be placed. Bids
will also be invited for establishment of a manufacturing
facility at Palghat for digital electronic switching
equipment for primary and secondary switching centers;
(c) Electronic Telex Exchanges: Telex exchanges have been
ordered for Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras. These
will be commissioned during 1981/82 and further expanded
during the plan period;
(d) Integrated Local and Transit Digital Electronic Exchanges:
Electronic (digital) exchanges suitable for integrated
local and transit working are under development by ITI.
It is hoped to install a few of these during the plan
period for trial purposes leading to large-scale intro-
duction during the 1986-90 segment of the decade;
(e) Digital Microwave Systems: Digital microwave systems are
being used to provide junctions in the Calcutta telephone
network. Additional systems are proposed to be installed
in Calcutta and other metropolitan and major cities
during the plan period;
(f) Digital Transmission Media: Digital transmission media
for long distance circuits are proposed to be imported
and installed on selected routes during the plan period
for eventual large-scale use during the decade;
(g) Satellite Communications: A multipurpose national com-
munication satellite is to be launched during FY82. This
system will provide links from a number of remote areas
to the main administrative, business and industrial
centers in the country. In addition, circuits are pro-
posed to be provided as backup between certain important



- 13 -
stations. A total of 28 fixed earth stations and 3
mobile earth stations are expected to be commissioned in
the first stage. In the second stage during this plan
period, 20 (18 main and 2 mobile) earth stations will be
constructed for serving remote and inaccessible areas;
(h) Development of New Technological Systems for Integrated
Development of Telecommunications in Rural Areas: Exten-
sion of telecommunications facilities to rural areas and
to backward, hilly and tribal areas has been given spe-
cial importance in recent years. The targets for long
distance PCOs and small exchanges in villages have been
progressively raised. However, the facilities available
in the rural areas have been very limited as compared to
those in urban areas. The technologies used are old.
The P&T Department has set up a small task force to carry
out special studies in a few selected districts through-
out the country to determine alternative technological
solutions. During the 1980-85 plan, it is proposed to
develop the telecommunications networks in the selected
18 districts with a variety of technologies for field
trial purposes; and
(i) Introduction of Computer Centers for Telephone Service:
It is proposed to install and commission four computer
centers in the four metropolitan cities of Bombay,
Calcutta, Delhi and Madras for handling subscribers'
accounts, the directory inquiry services and some of the
other large-scale work, particularly relating to the
management of traffic and the cable networks.
While all of these technological innovations are important to the future
development of Indian telecommunications, the most import is the adoption of
a new electronic local switching system for manufacture in India. For this
reason, during negotiations we discussed and agreed with an implementation
plan and schedule for the establishment of the initial factory to produce
500,000 lines per year ((a) above).
2.04      The total cost of the five-year construction program in the plan
is Rs 36,000 million (US$4,285 million). Details of the investment sub-
divided by general purposes and by years are contained in Annex 5. The
annual achievements resulting from this program through fiscal year 1985 are
set out in Annex 6.
2.05      The three-year construction program for FY1981-83, from which the
P&T subproject is derived, is summarized in the following table of costs.
The three-year program comprises the proposed eighth P&T subproject, the
continuing investments associated with works commenced prior to FY1981
(ongoing works) and preliminary investments associated with the commencement
of works which will largely be carried out after FY1983 (future works).

2.06      During the three-year subproject period, FY81-83, the P&T construc-
tion program will provide approximately the following additions to the
network:
(a)  700,000 lines of local telephone switching capacity;
(b)  3.7 million pair kilometers of underground telephone cables;
(c)  630,000 direct exchange lines (DELs);
(d)  11,000 long distance public call offices (PCOs);
(e)  1,600 telephone exchanges, mostly small rural automatic type;
(f)  40,000 automatic trunk switching terminations
(g)  6,200 telex subscribers; and
(h)  12,000 telegraph offices.
The P&T subproject also includes computing equipment for the four metropoli-
tan districts (US$4 million); plant, equipment and raw materials for the P&T
factories (US$6 million); testing and measuring equipment for the Telecommu-
nications Research Center and the Technical and Development Circle (US$6
million); transmission equipmeat for trunks and junctions (US$12 million);
and plant and equipment for the network upgrading program (US$4.5 million).

Network Upgrading Program
2.07      In parallel with, but mainly separate from the construction pro-
gram, a new program for upgrading the telephone network ha- been conceived
and will be implemented during the project period. It is designed to
improve overall performance in terms of frequency of fault conditions, dura-
tion of faults, quality of transmission and switching performance. The
following items are included in the program which is set out in greater
detail in Annex 7:
(a) pressurization of existing junction, primary and
secondary cables;
(b) provision of ducts for important junction and sub-
scribers' cables;
(c) replacement of aluminum house wiring with copper wire;
(d) replacement of iron wire in subscribers' loops with
plastic insulated copper drop wire;
(e) replacement or repair of faulty telephone instruments;
(f) provision of digital microwave radio equipment on metro-
politan junction routes;
(g) provision of additional automatic traffic recording and
analysis equipment in the major metropolitan districts;
and
(h) provision of special testing equipment and automatic
transmission monitoring and regulating equipment for the
long distance coaxial cable and microwave radio network.
2.08      A series of performance indicators and program monitoring indices
will be used to measure the implementation of the network upgrading pro-
gram. These are listed in Annex 8. The indicators and indices have been
designed to show the improvement in quality of service which should result
from the program as well as the progress with the implementation of the pro-
gram. Assurances were given during negotiations that values of these indi-
cators and indices would be included in the P&T's annual progress reports to
the Association.

P&T Subproject Costs
2.09      The total cost of the P&T subproject is Rs 12,537 million
(US$1,493 million) with a foreign exchange content of Rs 2,041 million
(US$243 million). These costs are itemized in Annex 9 and are summarized in
the following table:

2.10      The costs are based on FY80 average costs in the P&T network inso-
far as local material supplies and labor rates are concerned and, for
imported materials on current contracts and tenders associated with ongoing
works. The cost estimates are reasonable. Customs duties are included in
the local costs and amount to US$194 million based on an average of about
80 percent over all P&T imported materials.
Contingencies
2.11      The subproject estimated cost includes price contingencies but not
physical contingencies. The reasons for the non-application of physical
contingencies are as follows:
(a)  a large proportion of the subproject comprises many
small individual works and these are costed by applying
average unit cost based on previous experience. For
example, the costs of subscribers outside plant is based
on past cable usages rates of 7 pair km in the metropol-
itan districts, 6 pair km in other districts, 5 pair km
in minor districts and 4 pair km in circles.



- 17 -
The average unit costs based on past costs are used for
duct work, telephones and lead-ins, exchange installa-
tion, junction circuits, etc.;
(b)  on major long distance transmission works, a consider-
able amount of detailed engineering design has been car-
ried out which, together with a high degree of standard-
ization in the designs, enables acceptable cost esti-
mates to be produced, without a physical contingency
allowance;
(c)  standard designs for technical and other buildings are
used and the overall cost structures are well known; and
(d)  because of the large number of small works such as tele-
phone instrument installations, cable lead-ins, etc.,
which comprise the subproject, the only practical method
of estimating is by use of average unit costs and with
this technique physical overs and unders are balanced
out.
2.12      Price contingencies are based on annual escalations of 7 percent
for 1981-83 for local costs and 9, 8 and 7 percent respectively for 1981,
1982 and 1983 for foreign costs. The imported equipment in the ongoing
works will come forward on fixed price contracts and some of the imported
equipment in the new project will be purchased at fixed prices by extensions
of existing contracts. The price escalation has been calculated on a com-
pound interest basis. The import duty, which is included in the local
costs, is escalated at the same rate as the foreign exchange cost to which
it is related.
P&T Items for IDA Financing
2.13      The items proposed for IDA financing are listed in the following
table. In the case of the direct imports by the P&T, it is proposed that
100 percent of the foreign cost be financed by the Association. In the case
of the purchases from the three domestic factories the amounts to be
financed by the Association are the foreign exchange costs of the imported
raw materials and components included in the goods and equipment purchased
by the P&T. Based on a study of current production costs and material
sources of the factories and on projected product mix of P&T purchases from
the factories, it has been estimated that the foreign exchange content of
the purchases from the factories will be as follows:
From Indian Telephone Industries (ITI): 24% of selling price
From Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL)         : 40% of selling price
From Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL):   6% of selling price

Total                                2,041          243.0
Retroactive Financing
2.14      Retroactive financing of up to US$30 million (about 10 percent of
the credit amount) is proposed to cover expenditures incurred since June 30,
1980 for the purchase of telecommunications equipment from the three
indigenous manufacturers, ITI, HCL and HTL. These purchases cover equipment
and supplies procured under regular ongoing arrangements in a manner
satisfactory to the Association. Financing for this type of procurement
which was provided in the seventh telecommunications loan was completely
utilized early in 1981 and the amount of retroactive financing now proposed
in this eighth project will eliminate most of the gap in Bank Group
financing for these supplies that would otherwise occur.



- 19 -
2.15      The retroactive financing is considered appropriate in this case
because the credit approval and agreement will come towards the end of the
Indian 1980/81 fiscal year, considerably later than initially envisaged. A
delay in appraisal and subsequent processing occurred, mainly due to the
Association's concern that the GOI reach a policy decision on the
introduction of electronic switching technology, and be in an advanced stage
of preparing equipment specifications, prior to negotiations. By the
expected time of credit signing, almost all of the project's anticipated
first year expenditure (about US$40 million) will have been made. All of
the first year expenditure would be from items 2(a) to (c) in the above
table. Although bids will be called for some of the supplies covered by
items l(a) to (h) prior to the credit signing it is unlikely that there will
be advance contracting and no provision for retroactive financing for item 1
goods is needed.
Disbursement
2.16      The disbursement of IDA funds would be made against 100 percent of
the foreign costs of the direct imports listed as items 1. (a) to (h) and
against the percentages shown in paragraph 2.13 of the purchase price paid
by P&T for supplies from the three domestic factories up to the amounts
shown as items 2. (a) to (c). In the case of the domestic factories, the
percentages would be subject to review during the project period and revised
if necessary due to changed conditions. Details of the disbursements for
the total amount of the credit are given in Annex 10.
Procurement
2.17      All the items in the P&T subproject which are to be directly
imported will be procured in accordance with the Association's guidelines
using international competitive bidding (ICB).
2.18      As has been the case with previous lending operations, ICB is not
proposed for the equipment items in the P&T subproject which can be procured
economically and efficiently from the domestic factories. The imported raw
materials and components which are used in the manufacture of equipment pur-
chased by the P&T are themselves procured by the three factory managements
using ICB in line with the Bank Group's guidelines.
Implementation
2.19      The P&T subproject will be executed by the P&T with its own staff
of engineers, technicians, linemen and tradesmen. The subproject comprises
many individual works spread throughout the country. Implementation of
earlier telecommunications project has run later than projected due to a
variety of causes. In some cases bid evaluations and technology decisions
have taken longer than desirable because of the importance of the decisions
relating to the introduction of new technologies and the complex Government
approval procedures involved. There has also been some shortfall in produc-
tion of equipment in the local factories from time to time due to power
rationing and, at times, industrial holdups.



- 20 -
2.20      Very important technological decisions are to be taken during the
implementation of this project and, in order to facilitate timely decisions,
some bids will be called prior to approval of the credit. This applies spe-
cifically to the new computing equipment for New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras, for the medium capacity digital electronic trunk switching system
and for the rural subscribers' small exchanges local switching system. In a
number of other cases equipment will be procured by extending existing con-
tracts which have been placed under the seventh telecommunications loan.
B. The ITI Subproject
2.21      The ITI subproject comprises two parts.  The first part is the
upgrading and modernization program for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for the
existing factories and the second is the establishment of new production
capacity at Palghat for 150,000 equivalent lines 1/ per annum of electronic
switching equipment, comprising 30,000 lines (60,000 equivalent lines) of
digital medium-capacity trunk switching equipment, 50,000 lines of elec-
tronic combined local and transit small-capacity exchanges and 40,000 lines
of private automatic branch exchanges (PABXs).
2.22      The upgrading and modernization of the existing ITI factories at
Bangalore, Naini and Rae Bareli is an extension of the program financed by
the Bank under the seventh telecommunications project. It comprises the
following items:
(a) improving the manufacturing processes for telephone
instruments at the Naini and Bangalore factories. The
instrument itself is to be redesigned and the assembly
lines for the key elements of the telephone instrument--
the receiver, the transmitter and the dial--will be
automated to obtain the quality and reliability neces-
sary. Improved molding technology will be introduced.
The total production of telephones from ITI is about
500,000 per year, rising to about 750,000 by FY83;
(b) improving and enhancing the manufacturing processes for
transmission exuipment at the Naini and Bangalore
factories. This will carry on the work commenced under
the seventh project and is particularly directed toward
improving quality control and facilitating production of
1/ "Equivalent line" of telecommunications switching equipment is a unit
approximately equal in production cost and effort to that of one line of
subscribers' or local switching equipment. Trunk switching equipment is
more complex and contains more components than does local switching
equipment. In this subproject one line of trunk switching equipment is
taken as two "equivalent" lines.



- 21 -
new designs of transmission equipment with increased
packaging density and higher reliability. The major
components at Bangalore will comprise automatic testing
facilities for inward goods and electronic components
and for printed circuit boards, sub-units, semi-racks,
subsystems and systems. At Naini the major investments
will be for a modern printed circuit board fabrication
facility and for new instrumentation for digital trans-
mission technologies. The value of the total annual
production of transmission equipment is about Rs 300
million (US$36 million) rising to about Rs 500 million
(US$60 million) by FY83;
(c)  improving and expanding the research and development
facilities throughout the company. Areas of R&D activ-
ity proposed for expansion include digital transmission
techniques over radio and optical fibers, processor con-
trolled testing and evaluation equipment for ITI produc-
tion lines and for service measurements and maintenance
aids in the P&T network;
(d)  replacement of machines in the tool rooms and production
lines for strowger and crossbar switching equipment at
Bangalore and Rae Barelli; and
(e)  an amount of Rs 0.5 million (US$60,000) 1/  for continu-
ation of consultancy services in the field of product
and reliability engineering.
2.23      The second part of the ITI project comprises the establishment of
production facilities at Palghat to manufacture annually 150,000 equivalent
lines of electronic switching equipment comprising 30,000 lines of medium-
sized digital electronic trunk switching equipment, 50,000 lines of inte-
grated local and transit small rural digital electronic exchanges and 40,000
lines of digital electronic private automatic exchanges (PAXs). The trunk
switching equipment to be manufactured will be decided through international
competitive bidding while the rural local and private exchanges will be to
an in-house ITI design.
2.24      The Palghat factory project represents the first indigenous move
into full scale production of electronic telephone switching equipment and
is of vital importance to the evolution of the telecommunications and elec-
tronic industries in India. The proposed IDA financing covers the foreign
costs of purchase of "know-how" and production line equipment to enable pro-
duction to commence with about 40,000 equivalent lines in FY84 and an ulti-
mate capacity of 150,000 equivalent lines per year.
1/ Estimated at US$10,000 per month for six manmonths.



- 22 -
2.25      Initially, quantities of the trunk system to be manufactured will
be fully imported by the P&T (8,000 lines costing approximately US$8 million
in 1982-83) followed by a period during 1984 when the equipment will be
imported as subassemblies and finished at Palghat. Subsequent full produc-
tion of the system will be possible in 1985.
2.26      The collaborator for the trunk switching will also provide the
production skills necessary to convert the small rural exchanges and the PAX
(and PABX), designed to the prototype stage by ITI, into production items
amenable to production line processing. It is expected that the production
techniques provided for the manufacture of the trunk exchange equipment will
largely be applicable also to the manufacture of the indigenous designed
rural and private exchanges.
ITI Subproject Costs
2.27      The total cost of the ITI subproject is Rs 364 million (US$43.3
million) with a foreign exchange content of Rs 211 million (US$25.1

2.28      The ITI subproject costs relating to the upgrading and moderniza-
tion of the existing factories are based on experience gained with prices
and procurement during the seventh project for imported items of equipment.
Local costs include import duty and other local costs associated with
installation of plant and equipment, factory modifications, etc. The costs
for the new electronic trunk, local and private exchange switching manufac-
turing plant at Palghat are based on budgetary prices obtained from poten-
tial bidders during feasibility studies and project definition.
ITI Items for IDA Financing
2.29      The amount proposed for IDA financing in the ITI subproject is 100
percent of the foreign costs. This is Rs 211 million or US$25.1 million.
The items to be financed and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the
credit are set out in the following table:
Items in ITI Subproject Proposed for IDA Financing

Implementation
2.30      That portion of the project covering the upgrading and moderniza-
tion of the existing factories poses no problems for implementation. It is
part of ITI's earlier 1979-83 five-year plan and the organization is geared
up to proceed. The experience that ITI has acquired during its first asso-
ciation with the Bank Group in the seventh telecommunications project will
further facilitate its implementation.



- 24 -
2.31      The second part of the ITI subproject covering the new electronic
switching plant at Palghat will require more effort to ensure timely imple-
mentation. The implementation program envisaged is based on the following
significant dates:
Call for bids                                    - completed
Bids received                                    - March 1981
Technical and commercial evaluation completed - July 1981
Financial evaluation completed                   - August 1981
Recommendation approved by P&T Board,
Ministry, IBRD                                 - November 1981
Letter of Intent                                 - December 1981
Detailed project report and contract
preparation completed and cleared by GOI    - January 1982
New building completed                           - June 1982
Production line completed                        - June 1983
This represents a somewhat optimistic program but is achievable if unfore-
seen problems do not arise. In view of the urgent need for electronic trunk
switching equipment in the P&T network, a stringent implementation plan for
its establishment is necessary.
2.32      The phasing in of production of the new trunk switching equipment
is based on the following strategic timetable:
*   September/
October 1981:  (a)  System decision;
(b) Orders placed for direct imports of
finished switching equipment by P&T;
e   FY1983          (c)  P&T installs 8,000 lines of fully
imported equipment;
(d) ITI assembles and finishes 2,500
lines of equipment imported in
"semi-knocked-down" condition;
*   FY1984          (e)  P&T installs 14,000 lines of fully
imported equipment and 2,500 lines
of equipment finished by ITI;



- 25 -
(f) ITI assembles 10,000 lines of equip-
ment imported in "completely knocked
down" condition;
*   FY1985          (g)  ITI reaches planned production rate
of 30,000 lines per year.
C. The HCL Subproject
2.33      The HCL subproject consists of two parts.  The first is a continu-
ation of upgrading and modernization of the two existing factories and is an
extension of the work commenced and covered by the seventh telecommunica-
tions project. The second part comprises the establishment of a new cable
factory at Hyderabad. This new factory is required by FY84 in order to con-
tinue to meet the telephone cable needs of the P&T's development program.
2.34      The first part of the HCL subproject covers the replacement of
obsolete and worn out production machinery and replacing and adding new
testing equipment for production line and R&D purposes. The replacement
program is also being used to update the technology especially in the
Rupnarainpur factory where there will be a major shift from lead sheathing
to polyethylene sheathing of cables and modern automatic test equipment will
be introduced. Details of the machine replacements are contained in
Annex 12.
2.35      The second part of the HCL subproject covers the establishment of
a new cable manufacturing plant at Hyderabad. This factory is required to
meet the growing demands for cable to satisfy the P&T's development plans.
Present output of telephone cables from the two existing factories and the
cable needs (quoted in units of million conductor kilometers) to implement
the P&T program are shown in the following table:
HCL Projected Cable Output and P&T Needs
(Unit = million conductor kilometers)
Year                        HCL Output                P&T Program
Rupnarainpur  Hyderabad        Total       Needs
1980/81              1.6          1.07          2.67        2.00
1981/82              1.6          1.38          2.98        2.36
1982/83              1.8          1.38          3.18        3.04
1983/84              2.1          1.38          3.48        4.00
1984/85              2.3          1.38          3.68        5.00
The P&T is currently importing some small sized jelly filled cable due to
the inability of HCL to meet the full demand and HCL is currently supplying
small quantitites of large size dry core cable to fulfill export orders.



- 26 -
However, it is clear that a critical supply situation will arise in FY84
and, to meet this situation a new factory at Hyderabad, with a potential
capacity of 3 million conductor kilometers per year is to be established.
Based on a projected growth of 12 percent to 15 percent per annum in DELs in
the P&T network, the annual cable requirements will grow to about 7 million
conductor kilometers by 1988 thus utilizing by that time the full capacity
of the new factory even if HCL ignored the export market.
HCL Subproject Costs
2.36      The total cost of the HCL subproject is Rs 555 million (US$66.1
million) with a foreign exchange content of Rs 309 million (US$36.8
million). Details are shown in the following table.

The full year-by-year investment program for HCL is shown in Annex 13.
These costs are based on experience with current contracts for machines and
testing equipment which have been arranged under the seventh telecommunica-
tions project and detailed designs and layouts for the new cable factory at
Hyderabad.
HCL Items for IDA Financing
2.37      The amount proposed for IDA financing in the HCL subproject is 100
percent of the foreign costs. This is Rs 309 million or US$36.8 million.
The items to be financed and the proposed allocation of the credit is shown
below.

Implementation
2.38      The implementation of the factory upgrading part of the subproject
will proceed with bids called during FY81 and equipment delivered and
installed during fiscal years 1982 and 1983. The program for the new cable
factory requires civil engineering work to be undertaken in FY81, bids to be
called also in that year, and the plant installed through fiscal years 1982
and 1983. Cable production would commenpe during FY84 with full capacity of
3 million conductor kilometers being possible in FY85. This implementation
schedule is a practical one.
D. The HTL Subproject
2.39      This subproject consists of two interrelated parts.  The first
comprises a continuation of factory modernization and upgrading, consistent
with a changeover to manufacture of electronic teleprinters, and the second
comprises the establishment of a new factory at Hosur for the final stages
of the manufacturing process of a new electronic teleprinter.
2.40      While the seventh telecommunications project has been in progress,
the P&T and HTL have been examining the performance of electronic tele-
printers in the Indian environment. A number of machines from different
manufacturers have been found to operate very satisfactorily in the field



- 28 -
and a decision has been taken to introduce electronic teleprinters into the
P&T network. As a consequence, offers will be invited by ICB for
collaboration with HTL in establishing indigenous manufacture of a modern
teleprinter.
2.41      The modernization and upgrading of the existing factories involves
replacement of machines and equipment in the machine shops, production lines
and tool rooms and the proposed purchases are detailed in Annex 14. The new
factory is to be established at Hosur, about 170 miles from the existing
factory at Madras, and will manufacture the electronic portions of the tele-
printers and carry out the final assembly, testing and packaging.
HTL Subproject Costs
2.42      The total cost of the HTL subproject is Rs 139.7 million (US$16.6
million) with a foreign exchange content of Rs 73.8 milion (US$8.7 million).
Details are shown in the following table and the total investment program of
HTL is shown in Annex 15.

HTL Items for IDA Financing
2.43      The amount proposed for IDA financing in the HTL subproject is 100
percent of the foreign costs including those associated with transfer of
know-how which will be acquired through open bidding. Consequently, the
amounts proposed for IDA financing and the proposed allocation of the credit
is as follows:

Details of the items are included in Annex 14.
Implementation
2.44      The implementation of the upgrading and modernization segments of
the subproject will flow on from and be based on experience with the seventh
telecommunications project. Bids will be called during 1981 with delivery
and intallation through 1982 and 1983. The establishment of the new factory
for electronic teleprinters is planned as follows:
(a)   call for bids                       - March 1981
(b)   bids received                       - June 1981
(c)   offers evaluated                    - September 1981
(d)   letter of intent and
collaboration agreement            - December 1981
(e)   temporary factory
building commences                 - July 1981
(f)   initial training commences          - February 1982
(g)   establishment of production line
- for initial assembly           - June 1982
- for final phase                - June 1983



- 30 -
2.45      The implementation program for the new factory production is opti-
mistic and depends on timely decisions being taken at many levels of manage-
ment including HTL, P&T, Minister of Communications, Electronics Commission,
Ministry of Industrial Development and others. The schedule would be
revised in conjunction with the collaborator when a selection has been made.
Contingencies for the Factory Subprojects
2.46      The base year for the costs is 1980 and the local cost estimates
have been escalated at 7 percent per annum to allow for possible price
rises. Foreign costs have been escalated at 9 percent for 1981, 8 percent
for 1982 and 7 percent for 1983. No physical contingencies have been
included because the factories' upgradation segment has been defined in
detail, the items of plant and equipment included in it have been specified
and there is virtually no civil engineering work involved, most of the local
costs being for import duties. In the case of the new electronic switching
manufacturing plant at Palghat (ITI subproject) and the electronic tele-
printer factory at Hosur (HTL subproject), the detailed designs have not yet
been undertaken as these must await the choice of the systems to be manu-
factured and the collaborators. The prices are based on budgetary price
information from existing foreign manufacturers, and consequently the
foreign costs and duty included in the local costs would not require a phys-
ical contingency allowance. For each of the three new factories civil
engineering costs amount to less than 15 percent of the total estimated
costs and the requirements are known accurately enough to omit a physical
contingency allowance on these segments.
Procurement for the Factory Subprojects
2.47      All items of equipment in these three subprojects (ITI, HCL and
HTL) will be procured by ICB in line with the Association's guidelines. In
particular, the procurement associated with ITI's new electronic switching
manufacturing plant at Palghat and HTL's new teleprinter factory at Hosur
will be through ICB, including the choice of collaborator and purchase of
technical expertise and know-how.
Disbursement for the Factory Subprojects
2.48      The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent
of the foreign exchange expenditure on imported items of machinery and
equipment and consultancy services. The estimated schedule for disburse-
ments is set out in Annex 10.

Overall Project Cost Summary
2.49       The overall cost of the project is summarized in the following
table. IDA financing is proposed for all the foreign exchange cost of the
project which amounts to Rs 2,637 million or US$314 million. The closing
date for the credit would be June 30, 1985.

III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The 1981-85 five-year telecommunications program from which the
present project has been derived is fundamentally a part of the GOI's
National Development Plan. The project encompasses development of the
entire sector from raw material components and the expansion of equipment
manufacturing to additional telecommunications services for final consumers.
Telecommunications and Development
3.02      In India there is a large and growing unsatisfied demand for tele-
communications services which is unlikely to be met before 1990 at the
earliest. Given this situation, the GOI is paying increasing attention to
how the limited resources allocated to the telecommunications sector are
used. On the manufacturing side emphasis is being directed to assuring that
appropriate technical decisions are taken in a timely manner. On the tele-
communications services side a high priority is being given to investment in
rural and smaller district centers, and those portions of the large metropol-
itan areas in which there is a large OYT demand (paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22).
3.03      The 11,000 additional rural PCOs, the 1,500 additional small rural
exchanges, and the 405,000 new DELs allocated to district centers and cities
other than Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras during the project period will
facilitate achievement of Government's goals of stimulating economic devel-
opment outside of the major metropolitan areas, encouraging decentraliza-
tion, and reducing transport and communication-related costs in a wide spec-
trum of economic and social sectors.
3.04      The priority provision of lines in those specific service areas of
the largest cities in which there is the greatest OYT demand should help
assure that potential large business and Government subscribers who will
derive the highest returns from telephone usage will be able to gain access
to the system.  If future postal and telecommunications usage in India is
similar to that in the past, during the project period approximately 43 per-
cent of the purchases of postal and telecommunications services will be made
by households and nonprofit institutions, 42 percent by intermediate busi-
ness consumers, and 15 percent by Government departments and agencies. Of
the intermediate business consumption, approximately 95 percent will fall in
the tertiary sector; of that amount trade will account for 68 percent, bank-
ing and insurance 14 percent, and transport 8 percent.
The Distribution of Benefits
3.05      The distribution of benefits from the proposed project should
touch all segments of the population in India. Indirectly, Government
administration and private business should incur communication-related effi-
ciency increases, or lower costs, since telecommunications is the least cost
means of communication for a wide variety of economic and social welfare
activities. A more direct impact will be felt by the high priority



- 33 -
business and commercial OYT waiters and by the general lower income popula-
tion in rural and backward areas. As a result of the emphasis on investment
outside of the larger metropolitan areas, a major improvement in quality of
service will be made in smaller cities and district centers, while in
smaller towns and villages during the 1981-83 period almost 40 million
people will receive local public access to telephone facilities for the
first time.
3.06      With regard to who makes use of telephones in rural India, a
recent survey of ten small rural exchanges undertaken by the National
Council of Applied Economic Research showed that 75 percent of the small
town subscribers were businessmen, 10 percent were employed in agriculture,
7.5 percent were professional people, 5 percent were categorized as private
(residential) subscribers, and 2.5 percent were official (Government). With
regard to those individuals who make use of public call offices, another
survey indicated that the top two occupational categories were business, 65
percent, and Government service, 12.5 percent. Agriculture and professional
or technician were the next most prominant occupations of PCO users with 7.5
percent each. In examining the purposes for which calls are made at the
surveyed PCOs, it was found that 95 percent of all calls were related to
participation in economic activity. The remaining 5 percent were calls to
kin and friends. Over 60 percent of the calls made at the PCOs were viewed
by the caller as important enough that they had to be completed on the day
on which they were actually attempted. These findings support GOI's conten-
tion that the small town local exchange and PCO telephone investment which
is being undertaken has a widespread impact on the development of the lower
income-nonmetropolitan areas.
3.07      The Telecommunications Branch of P&T has a much wider impact on
the communications and other sectors in India than is apparent from tele-
phone statistics. For example, the universal access postal service receives
a transfer of funds from the Telecommunications Branch sufficient to cover
postal losses. During the 1981-83 period the Postal Branch will receive
from the Telecommunications Branch a net of Rs 1,163 million.  Overall,
Telecommunications Branch transfers to and from Government over this period
will be as follows:

Tariff Policies
3.08      Given the scarcity of resources allocated to the telecommunica-
tions sector in India, pricing policy is another means by which the benefits
of the sector can be focused on high priority users. Currently, the pricing
mechanism is used to control access to, and priority usage of, the system.
A summary of existing tariffs is given in Annex 16. If sufficient lines are
allocated to high OYT areas, the advance deposit OYT scheme can provide a
"safety valve" for those business and commercial interests which make the
most productive use of telephone service. Also, during peak congestion day-
time hours, long distance calls can be booked as regular long distance calls
at regular daytime long distance rates, as urgent long distance calls at
twice the regular charge, as immediate priority calls at four times the reg-
ular charge, and as lightning priority calls at eight times the regular
charge.
3.09      Pricing polciy is further used to promote cheaper local service
for those residing outside of the larger urban areas. Both the required OYT
and regular advance deposits, and the monthly telephone rental charges are
generally less in the smaller telephone service areas.
3.10      Additional proposals for tariff restructuring designed to promote
the efficiency and equity benefits of telephone investment in India have
been recently adopted by P&T. The P&T, with input from the newly formed
Economic Cell, began in 1979 to charge 33 percent more for each local call
in excess of 1,750 calls per quarter per line. One of the objectives of the
surcharge is to influence network traffic congestion in areas like Bombay
and Delhi. In June 1980, an additional 25 percent increase in call charges
was introduced for local calls greater than 5,000 calls per quarter per
line. The Bank Group has encouraged and fully supports these charges.
3.11      Despite these changes and the healthy financial position of the
P&T, there is need for continuing review of the tariff structure. For years
to come the demand for telephone service will be greater than the supply and
long waiting lists will persist. The recent adjustment to the OYT scheme
did not vary the amounts of the advance deposits but did reduce the percent-
age of new lines allocated to OYT waiters from 75 percent down to 25 percent
of those becoming available. This was done in the light of the reducing
numbers on the OYT waiting lists. An alternative strategy which might
increase the effectiveness of the rationing function of the OYT scheme could
be to reduce the magnitude of the advance deposit while allocating say 50
percent of new lines becoming available to OYT waiters. This will be
studied by the Economic Research Cell.
3.12      Another aspect of the tariff structure which should be re-analyzed
is the distance/rate/time classifications in the trunk network. It may be
possible to manipulate these charges to more effectively distribute traffic
with respect to time of day, or day of week, and at the same time increase
the overall profitability of the trunk network. A related study would
embrace charging and revenue characteristics for long distance PCOs with
particular



- 35 -
reference to future revenue and cost projections. Assurance was obtained
during negotiations that the P&T would include such pricing studies in the
study program of the Economic Cell (which is periodically reviewed by Bank
supervision missions) and seek the Bank Group's comments on their terms of
reference by June 30, 1981.
Local Manufacturing
3.13      There are three major manufacturing entities in the telecommunica-
tions sector although, as indicated in paragraph 1.02, there are in addition
numerous small firms supplying material and equipment to the P&T, either
directly or through subcontracting to the major manufacturers.  The develop-
ment of the local manufacturing industry has been planned to keep pace with
the demands of the P&T for equipment for its network development programs.
However the production capacity of the three companies has not always
matched the needs of the P&T and not all the classes of items required by
the P&T can be manufactured in India.  Consequently, there is a continuing
need for imports.
3.14      During the last decade, the P&T purchases from the three indige-
nous manufacturers have amounted to about US$800 million. The foreign
exchange component of those purchases has been about US$200 million in raw
materials and components imported by the manufacturers for inclusion in the
equipment produced for the P&T and about US$50 million for the total estab-
lishment cost through 1980 for the factories which have manufactured the
goods. Hence, indigenous manufacturing has resulted in a net direct saving
in foreign exchange for India over the decade of about US$550 million.
3.15      Other benefits from local manufacturing are:
(a)   P&T Related:
(i) it reduces supply lead times, increases reliability of
supplies and provides an assured future supply of
spare parts and compatible equipment for expansion
purposes;
(ii) it provides increased opportunity for standardization
which reduces training, installation and maintenance
costs leading to better network performance and
reduced operating costs;
(iii) it provides for equipment to be designed and produced
in accordance with any special local needs and network
characteristics; and
(iv) it provides the potential for lower cost equipment
through the use of cheaper local labor.



- 36 -
(b)   Industrial Development Related:
(i)  it provides local investment and employment
opportunities;
(ii) it encourages other like industries through the intro-
duction of new technologies and skills into the
country;
(iii)  it supports the establishment of a large variety of
small scale industries supplying parts to the main
manufacturers; and
(iv) it provides the potential for earning foreign exchange
through exports.
3.16      The manufacturing segment of the telecommunications sector in
India is currently falling behind in its ability to produce the quantities
of equipment required and is becoming technologically out of date. It is
essential that these problem areas in the sector be corrected if the P&T
service objectives are to be achieved and the proposed eighth telecommunica-
tions project has been framed accordingly (paragraphs 2.21 to 2.48).
Least Cost Solution
3.17      The individual works which comprise the project are derived from
development plans which are soundly based. Telecommunications network plan-
ning is based on engineering and economic studies designed to optimize the
location and timing for new exchanges, buildings and transmission systems.
Extensions to existing exchanges, cable and transmission equipment are
dimensioned using stardard analytical techniques to ensure optimum provi-
sioning periods considering both economies of scale and the cost of money.
3.18      The majority of the equipment needed to carry out the program
would be locally manufactured. A comprehensive analysis of three major
Indian telecommunications factories carried out in 1978 by a World Bank con-
sultant demonstrated that the output cost of this equipment is in line with
if not cheaper than the cost of similar imported equipment, and that the
quality was generally acceptable. This analysis is still valid as the
international market and the local working conditions in India have not
changed substantially since the review was undertaken.
3.19      The capital expansion of the existing, and the construction of the
new, factories is designed to ensure the production of equipment for P&T at
least cost to the country. Some 70 to 80 percent of the total expenditure
in India's telecommunications development program is for equipment and
materials, and the major financial constraint on telecommunications growth
is the availability of foreign exchange (paragraph 1.18). Thus one of the



- 37 -
main benefits from indigenous manufacture of telecommunications equipment is
import substitution which results in the saving of foreign exchange
(paragraph 3.14).
3.20      The new factories proposed in the project will also be cost effec-
tive. In the case of the cable factory the production techniques will be
similar (although more modern) to those used in the existing factories which
already produce cable at a competitive price compared with the world market.
In the case of the electronic switching factory at Palghat and the new tele-
printer factory at Husor the production techniques will be those already in
use by the collaborator in each case and the factories will be set up under
the technical supervision of the collaborator. Once the setting up problems
have been surmounted the production costs should be less in India than in
the country of origin of the equipments being manufactured. In the case of
both teleprinters and electronic switching the P&T's requirements are more
than enough to economically justify a dedicated production line.
Return on Investment
3.21      The internal financial rate of return, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the present value of cost and revenue streams (at 1980
purchasing power) attributable to the FY81-85 investment program of the
Telecommunications Branch of P&T is 18 percent (Annex 17). However, this
figure is a significant understatement of total program benefits since it is
based only on the overall measurable average willingness of subscribers to
pay for final telecommunications services. As such, it does not reflect the
total of consumer surplus which callers receive; a portion of the benefits
accruing to receivers of calls; many of the benefits received by other sub-
scribers when additional subscribers join the system; and most of the indi-
rect benefits received by all through the better administration of rural
development, health, transport and agricultural programs and the increases
in rural and urban business and Government efficiency. Shadow pricing
foreign exchange at a conversion factor of 0.8 and labor at 80 percent of
the market wage rate gives an estimate of the economic rate of return as
17 percent.
3.22      In a further attempt to quantify a rough estimate of the extent of
the potential benefits that could be realized from the proposed investment,
several assumptions were made regarding the allocation of costs among var-
ious service categories in the network, the value of a local telephone call
relative to postal communication, and the proportion of long distance
callers that would pay higher than ordinary prices in order to get a quick
connection (Annex 18). Given these assumptions, estimates of the rate of
return for selected telephone service categories are as follows:



- 38 -
Illustrative Estimates of
Economic Rates of Return by Service Categories
Number of  Rate of Return
Service Category          DELs Added       (percent)
Local Telephone Service
Bombay                      117,000          52
Delhi                        77,000          47
Calcutta                     26,000          18
Madras                        5,000          36
Other large cities          109,000          32
Rural                       246,000          16
Long distance system              --           47
All Categories                                 37
These estimated rates of return, however, are highly assumption-dependent
and must be taken as being for illustrative purposes only.
Risks
3.23      There are no unusual risks associated with the project.  A pos-
sible risk may arise out of delayed physical implementation due to unfore-
seen circumstances. However, in telecommunications projects which comprise
a large number of independent works, a delay in implementation of a few
works does not generally prevent the use of other newly created assets.
Furthermore, the costs and benefits are also delayed in roughly the same
degree so the impact on the return on investment is not significant. The
construction of the new factories would have a higher probability of slip-
ping than other elements of the project but the consequences of such a slip-
page would impact on future P&T works rather than those included in this
project. A sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of return attribut-
able to the Telecommunications Branch of the P&T indicates that a combina-
tion of 10 percent higher capital and operating costs and 10 percent lower
revenues would result in an internal financial rate of return of about
13 percent (Annex 17).
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.24      No adverse environmental or health effects are expected from the
project. Telecommunications works have very little negative impact on the
environment. The plant consumes little energy. On the other hand, through
its use as an alternative to communications involving physical movements,
telecommunications has the potential to conserve energy and reduce environ-
mental pollution, particularly in urban areas where better telephone facili-
ties could slow the growth in vehicular traffic.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
4.01      There are four subprojects and four implementing agencies.  The
major entity of these four is the Telecommunications Branch of the Posts and
Telegraphs Department (P&T). The P&T is discussed first in this chapter
followed by a brief treatment of the other three implementing agencies,
Indian Telephone Industries (ITI), Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and Hindustan
Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL).
Organization
4.02      The P&T is a Government department under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Communications. The day-to-day control of its operations is the
responsibility of a seven-member Board whose chairman is the Secretary of
the Ministry of Communications. The headquarters staff of the P&T comprises
the P&T Directorate who report through members of the Board to the Director
General of the P&T Department. A single person is Secretary of the
Ministry, Chairman of the Board and Director General of the Department.
4.03      The upper level of the organization is shown in the functional
organization chart in Annex 19. The Member (Finance) is additionally
responsible to the Ministry of Finance. The Board members are Government
officials, appointed by Government, and the Minister, the Minister of State
and Deputy Minister are members of Parliament.
4.04      The regional level organization comprises districts and circles.
The districts are centered in cities and are defined as "metropolitan"
(four, located at New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras), "major" (five,
located at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kanpur and Pune) and "minor" (17
locations). The circles comprise the area surrounding the districts and are
basically rural in nature. There are 15 regional circles. These districts
and circles are responsible for the management of the telecommunications
service within their geographic area. Other organizational units outside
the directorate comprise four construction groups for major works and four
maintenance groups for the long distance service. These groups are centered
at New Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta and they operate in the north,
west, south and east of the country respectively. Other separate units are
responsible for training, research, material design and testing, workshops
and stores and procurement.
4.05      A more detailed organization chart for the Telecommunications
Branch is shown in Annex 20.
4.06      The P&T has reasonable autonomy.  It prepares its development plans
within the framework of national plans approved by the Planning Commission
but is subject to Government approvals for salary scales, major tariffs,
overall investment levels and organizational structure and staff levels.



- 40 -
Management and Control
4.07      Management systems in the P&T have steadily improved d-uring the
Bank Group's association with the sector. In consultation with the Bank
Group, there have been important additions and improvements to the management
and control processes. These have included improved economic analysis of
demand, investment and tariff structures following the establishment of the
Economic Research Cell and improved materials management and inventory con-
trol, following the establishment of the materials management group. The
management information system is now functioning as an effective tool of man-
agement in providing both technical and financial information by regions.
4.08      The Economic Research Cell (ERC) has now been fully staffed but
still its only fully qualified economist is the Director. During negotia-
tions the GOI advised that the P&T has sought approval for the additional
positions of Economist and Statistical Officer in the ERC. It is expected
that these positions would be approved and staffed by December 1981.
4.09      The P&T staff levels are high but the staff ratio 1/  has shown a
reasonably steady decline over the last decade and this is expected to
continue over the project period. The staff ratio was 178 in 1972, 152 in
1980 and is expected to be 115 in 1985. The past figures and future projec-
tions of staff and staff ratio are contained in Annex 21. In general, the
competence of the staff is adequate and an extensive training program is
operated (paragraph 4.15). Staff numbers are high because a large amount of
plant in the network requires a high maintenance effort and many of the ser-
vices are manual rather than automatic. Government policy to maximize
employment also inhibits management action to reduce the staff ratio quick-
ly. Low wage rates prevent this situation having too serious an effect on
the financial performance of the entity.
Computer Centers
4.10      The eighth telecommunications project will help finance the estab-
lishment of P&T computing centers in each of the four metropolitan dis-
tricts. The present proposals envisage these four centers undertaking sepa-
rate projects which, when developed, would be used on a national basis. The
systems would be developed under the guidance of a Computer Coordinating
Group chaired by Headquarters and including members from each of the metro-
politan districts. The presently planned initial workload is to be allo-
cated as follows:
1/ Staff ratio is the number of staff per 1,000 DELs.



- 41 -
Initial Work Program for Computer Center
Unit                 Computer Systems to be Developed
Bombay        *   Standardization of existing billing system
*   Directory compilation
*   Telephone exchange data base
Delhi         *   Network planning
*   Demand register and waiting list
Calcutta      *   Traffic recording and forecasting
*   Materials inventory
Madras        *   Fault control and analysis
*   Cable records
4.11      These projects represent a challenging initial workload.  The
concept of using regional groups to develop national systems in the manner
proposed is good.
Accounting System
4.12      The P&T has developed a commercial accounting system for the
Telecommunications Branch which is the basis for all financial reporting
within P&T as well as to Government. Although the accounting system on an
accrual basis was started as early as FY69, the double entry system of
accounts was introduced only with effect from April 1, 1972. As agreed
under credit 403-IN, P&T has now extended the accounts to the regions
including all the circles and districts. P&T management is using the infor-
mation based on these accounts as an element of the management information
system (MIS) for its day-to-day operations. The commercial accounts are
audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) and presented to
Parliament (paragraph 4.17).
4.13      There is a need to maintain both the Telecommunications Branch's
commercial accounts and the P&T's Government cash accounts under rules which
have been accepted by the C&AG so that he can give his prior approval to
their application and his staff is able to reconcile transactions between
the accrued and cash accounts during audit. This to some degree limits the
Branch's ability to expedite the closing of the final accounts, but progress
is being made to reduce the delays in the past years (paragraph 4.17).
Billing and Collection
4.14      The Telecommunications Branch has effectively utilized its MIS to
monitor the billing and collection performance in all districts and circles.
Quarterly bills are sent to subscribers in cycles; rentals are billed in



- 42 -
advance and call charges in arrears. The P&T has been following a discon-
nection policy for nonpayment of bills and is authorized also to disconnect
Government services for nonpayment. The total value of telecommunications
accounts receivable has been about two monthst of total billing, which is
reasonable, and no additional measures are considered necessary for its con-
trol. Billing in the four major cities is computerized using the computer
facilities of external service bureaus and the transfer of customer billing
to P&T's own computers (paragraph 4.10) will improve management's control of
this function.
Training
4.15      The P&T training program is extensive and comprehensive.  There
are 26 circle and district training centers and 13 regional training
centers. An advanced level telecommunications training center established
with the assistance of the UNDP and International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) provides courses for middle- and top-level engineers not only from
India but also for staff from the telecommunications organizations of other
countries in the region. The number of staff trained in the past year is

financial staff also receive training and refresher courses while all types
of senior staff are eligible for training outside the P&T Department.

Audit
4.17      Under the constitution, the C&AG is responsible for the auditing
of all Government accounts. Both Postal and Telecommunications Branchs'
cash accounts and the Telecommunications Branch's commercial accounts are
audited by the Office of Director of Audit (P&T) under C&AG. The Telecommu-
nications Branch's unaudited commercial accounts have been submitted to the
Bank Group about four months after the close of the fiscal year as stipu-
lated in the previous Bank loan agreement (1592-IN), and the submission of
the audited accounts has been improved from a delay of as much as one and a
half years to within about one year after the close of the fiscal year. The
delay is mainly due to the numerous inter-Branch adjustments at year end and
delays in finalizing the accounts. The P&T intends to further reduce the
delays in finalizing the audited accounts and submit them within ten months
of the end of each fiscal year, as prescribed in Loan Agreement 1592-IN.
The present audit arrangements will continue under the proposed credit.
Indian Telephone Industries
4.18      ITI is the largest of the three main manufacturers of telecommuni-
cations equipment in India. It has factories located at Bangalore, Naini,
Rae Bareli and Srinagar. It employs a total of about 26,000 people and man-
ufactures switching equipment, transmission equipment and telephones. About
85 percent of its output is sold to the Telecommunications Branch of the P&T.
4.19      The organization chart of ITI is shown at Annex 22. The company
is wholly Government owned and has been operating for more than 30 years
within the ambit of the Ministry of Communications.
4.20      Successive Bank Group appraisal and project review missions have
examined the organization, management and production techniques and outputs
of ITI and determined that the quality and price of the equipment it sells
to the P&T is comparable with world market prices and qualities. In January
1978, during the appraisal of the seventh telecommunications project, and
again in November 1979 during a review mission, the Bank employed an inde-
pendent consulting production engineer to accompany the Bank's missions to
determine in the first instance what actions were necessary to further
improve the quality and standard of factory output, and secondly to review
progress on the implementation of his earlier recommendations.
4.21      The major shortcoming was found to be in the lack of modern qual-
ity assurance procedures in most ITI factories and deficiencies in the
research and development area. Action has commenced to correct these defi-
ciencies and this will be continued in conjunction with the subproject now
proposed for factory modernization and upgrading. Consultancies are being
financed under the seventh loan as well as replacement machinery and addi-
tional testing, measuring and research and development equipment. The con-
sultancy and technical assistance proposed in this credit is for converting



- 44 -
laboratory and prototype models into a design suitable for mass production
and will further enhance ITI's production capabilities for modern electronic
and processor-controlled telecommunications equipment.
4.22      Following from the previous loan a quality assurance manual has
been prepared by ITI. To complement this a quality standards manual speci-
fying quality levels and methods of inspection agreeable to the P&T should
be prepared. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
standards manual and the P&T's agreement to it be completed by June 1981.
4.23      The production program for ITI is based upon the P&T's development
program--the sole reason for ITI's existence is to provide materials for the
P&T construction program.  Consequently, its expansion program is designed
to meet that need.  To date, it has not been able to fully provide the P&T
requirements and this condition will persist through the project period.
The works to be financed by the proposed IDA credit will help to increase
ITI's capacity to produce and will also give it some experience in mass pro-
duction of electronic swtiching equipment and so facilitate its next big
step when it embarks on large-scale production of electronic local telephone
switching equipment.
4.24      The output sold to the P&T is subject to prices determined in con-
junction with the P&T under a pricing agreement which provides for a profit
margin of 10 to 15 percent.
4.25      ITI has developed a number of ancilliary units in the small-scale
industrial field to supply components, parts and raw materials to its main
factories. About 91 such units have been developed, employing about 3,000
people and producing about Rs 55 million (US$6.5 million) worth of supplies
per year.
4.26      The company also sells some of its products internationally but
the scope for this is limited while there is a shortfall in production to
meet the Indian P&T requirements. However, bidding in the competitive
export market, even in a very modest manner, is valuable experience for the
company and it provides a means of checking ITI prices against international
competition.
Hindustan Cables Ltd.
4.27      HCL is a wholly Government-owned entity established in 1952.  It
has factories at Rupnarainpur and Hyderabad where it makes a variety of
telephone cables and line wire, most of which is sold to the P&T. It
employs about 4,000 people. The organization chart is shown at Annex 22.
The company is under the general control of the Department of Industrial
Development.



- 45 -
4.28      As was the case with ITI, the operations and manufacturing pro-
cesses of HCL were closely examined by Bank Group missions in January 1978
and November 1979 and the major deficiencies identified were lack of a qual-
ity assurance program, obsolete testing and measuring equipment and inade-
quate research and development facilities. Under the seventh telecommunica-
tions project, correction of these deficiencies was commenced and it will be
continued under the presently proposed credit. A quality assurance depart-
ment reporting to the General Manager, Works, is being established and we
confirmed during negotiations that this group would be established and
adequately staffed by June 1981. An assurance was obtained that the
Association would be given an opportunity to comment on the functional
statement for the new department. A quality assurance manual has been
prepared following the Bank Group's request during the previous loan
negotiations.
4.29      New and automatic testing and measuring equipment is coming for-
ward from the previous loan and more will be financed by this credit
together with replacement of antiquated worn out cable making machinery by
more modern high output equipment.
4.30      The current production capacity of HCL will not meet the require-
ment of the P&T beyond 1983 (paragraph 2.33) and part of this subproject is
the establishment of a new cable making facility at Hyderabad with a capa-
city of 3 million conductor kilometers of cable per year. The new capacity
would meet P&T's requirements until about 1986-88 depending on the extent to
which HCL would sell cable internationally.
4.31      Cable sold to P&T is subject to a pricing agreement between the
two parties and is based on a profit margin of about 10-15 percent on
production costs. HCL has had some success in obtaining export orders.
This is a useful test of its price and quality, and therefore its production
efficiency, as well as making a modest contribution as a foreign exchange
earner. In the future, the possibility of competing in the export market in
a larger way needs to be explored.
Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd.
4.32      HTL was established in 1960 and manufactures teleprinters and
ancilliary equipment. It also produces some data modems and in the past has
produced electric typewriters. The company is wholly Government owned and
under the general control of the Ministry of Communications. Its factory is
located at Madras and it employs about 2,000 people. An organization chart
is shown in Annex 22.
4.33      HTL's production capacity on a two-shift basis is 8,000 tele-
printer units per year but it has not yet reached this capacity. Over the
past few years, it has averaged an annual production rate of a little under
7,000 units, the shortfall being due to industrial action, shortages of



- 46 -
critical raw materials, power cuts and the like. Even the maximum produc-
tion rate of 8,000 units per year would not meet the demands of P&T and
other customers and capacity must be increased.
4.34      The detailed evaluation of HTL's factory operations carried out in
January 1978 brought to light similar deficiencies as existed in ITI and
HCL. These were the absence of a quality assurance program, lack of an
appropriate research and development program, poor assembly operations and
inadequate testing and measuring equipment. In conjunction with the seventh
loan, these aspects have been receiving attention and some improvement is
necessary and best obtained by employment of foreign expertise. This will
come with the present proposed project relating to the establishment of the
new electronic teleprinter factory (paragraph 4.35).
4.35      The proposed new factory for electronic teleprinters will be
established with the assistance of an existing manufacturer to be selected
on the basis of the quality of the machine produced in relation to Indian
requirements. Competitive bids will be invited for the transfer of
knowledge and collaboration required to establish efficient manufacture of
up to 10,000 units per year of the new electronic machine. The existing
electromechanical teleprinter will be phased out of production except for
the necessary spares required to maintain existing machines in the field.
The transfer of knowledge will cover the setting up of modern production
line and assembly techniques for the new teleprinter including quality
assurance, automatic testing procedures and production management.
4.36      As with the other manufacturing companies, HTL sells its output to
P&T under a pricing agreement which provides a profit margin to the company
of 10-15 percent over production costs. The cost of the present machine is
low by world standards but it is obsolete and its production cost would rise
in the future as the plant which makes it is approaching the stage at which
it must be completely replaced. The new electronic teleprinter will be pro-
duced at a cost comparable with similar modern machines because basically a
similar if not identical production line, established with the aid of the
collaborator, will produce it.
Company Audits
4.37      All three companies are audited annually by commercial firms of
chartered accountants and, under a covenant in the existing subsidiary loan
agreements relating to the seventh telecommunications loan, are required to
continue this practice and to provide the Association with copies of these
audit reports within six months of the end of each fiscal year.



- 47 -
Company Performance Monitoring
4.38      It is proposed that the performance of the three companies be
reviewed annually as part of the P&T progress reporting procedure as well as
during regular supervision and review missions. The formal reporting would
cover the price of their products to ensure their continuing competitiveness
with internationally available products (Annex 23) and their actual outputs
compared with their targets (Annex 24). Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that annual reporting in line with Annexes 23 and 24 would be
included with P&T's progress reports.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Background
5.01      As a Department of the central Government of India the P&T's
finances form part of the national budget. All of P&T's funds are remitted
to the Government's consolidated fund and all P&T's fund requirements are
made available by the Government through parliamentary appropriation. Funds
which are provided by the Government in excess of P&T's internal generation
are called capital-at-charge and the Government requires that P&T pay an
annual interest on these funds at the rate of 6 percent. For presentation
in this report, capital-at-charge has been segregated between that obtained
from long-term external financing (classified as long-term debt) and that
obtained from the Government (classified as equity contribution).
5.02      P&T keeps separate accounts for its telecommunications and postal
operations. For the Telecommunications Branch, P&T maintains commercial
accrual accounts in addition to the conventional Government cash accounts.
The commercial accounts show the Telecommunications Branch as a separate
entity and are presented to the Parliament subject to the external audit by
the Comptroller and Auditor General. All financial data in this report
relating to P&T apply only to the Telecommunications Branch and are based on
these commercial accounts.
5.03      P&T's Postal Branch has been operating at a loss, a situation
which is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. This results
from a long standing policy to provide a basic postcard communications ser-
vice to the rural and less developed areas at such a low tariff that operat-
ing costs inevitably exceed revenues. The Telecommunications Branch's com-
mercial accounts show transfers from its profits to cover the postal losses,
and the Government recognizes these transfers by accruing interest in favor
of the Telecommunications Branch on the accumulated value of transfers. The
Government has maintained the telecommunications tariffs at a level suffi-
cient to enable P&T to cover the Postal Branch's losses without damaging the
Telecommunications Branch's ability to meet its financial requirements.



- 48 -
Past Financial Performance
5.04      The operating results of the Telecommunications Branch (the
"Branch") have been satisfactory. Income statements for the period FY77
through FY80 are given in page 1 of Annex 25. During these four years, the
operating ratio ranged between 54 percent and 57 percent and the rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets in operation between 25 percent and 18
percent (paragraph 5.08).
5.05      Other financial indicators for the same period also show a very
acceptable performance with current ratios of at least 3.5 times and debt/
equity ratios remaining fairly constant at around 18/82, reflecting the
Branch's strong equity base. One significant feature of the Branch's
finances has been the extent to which it is able to meet fund requirements
from its internal generation; during the FY1977-80 period, net internal
generation accounted for about 84 percent of total fund requirements.
5.06      The Branch's collection performance has improved through the past
years. Billings in the four major metropolitan districts (Bombay, Delhi,
Calcutta and Madras) are computerized (paragraph 4.14). Billing and collec-
tion procedures are now being enforced with prompt disconnection of late-
paying subscribers. Subscriber accounts receivable based on current bill-
ings amount to about two months' billings, which is satisfactory.
Present Financial Position
5.07      Detailed statements of financial position for FY77 to FY85, actual
and forecast, are presented in Annex 26. The actual financial position as
of March 31, 1979, and the provisional financial position as of March 31,
1980, are summarized below:

1/ On historical cost basis
Revaluation of Assets
5.08      In compliance with Loan Agreement 1592-IN, the Branch completed,
in March 1980, a revaluation study on the life of its fixed assets and the
current value of the various categories of assets. The study, which covered
the period up to March 31, 1978, indicated that the net current value of
assets was about 22 percent over that based on historical valued costs. The
rate of return on the revalued assets (22 percent in FY79 and 18 percent in
FY80) was still significantly higher than the covenanted rate of return (11
percent). The method used in the revaluation study is considered
satisfactory; it takes into account the impact of price changes in the
various asset categories and reflects the technological improvements and
economies of scale in the manufacturing of telecommunications equipment.  To
calculate the rate of return in the financial forecast, the Branch's net
fixed assets in operation as of March 31, 1980, is increased by about 25
percent on the basis of the study. For future revaluation, the forecast
assumes an index of 6 percent per year, which is broadly in line with the
past experience of other available indices of manufacturing costs of
telecommunications equipment and components. For purposes of calculating
future rate of return, the P&T would continue, on a memorandum basis, to
review and determine annually its telecommunications assets in a manner
acceptable to the Association.

Total Sources of Funds                   17,258      2,055      100
5.10      In the above financing plan, the Branch's construction program is
shown to reach Rs 16,939 (US$2,017 million), representing about 98 percent
of total fund requirements; working capital increase will account for the
remaining 2 percent. During the three-year period FY1981-83, the net
internal cash generation would be equivalent to 65 percent of the construc-
tion program and working capital increase; Government contributions would be
9 percent and subscriber deposits 5 percent. The remaining 21 percent would
be financed through external borrowings, of which the undisbursed Bank loans
1313-IN and 1592-IN would amount to 3 percent, the proposed IDA credit 12
percent, and other external borrowings, including supplier credits, 6 per-
cent. The above financing plan is satisfactory and represents a reasonable
mix of foreign and domestic financing resources.
5.11      The above projections assume the Branch continuing to pay 6 per-
cent annual interest on capital-at-charge. If this interest rate were to
increase to, say, 12 percent, the net internal cash generation would still
be about 60 percent. Furthermore, in addition to the interest payments, the
Branch is also required to make cash transfers to Government to cover



- 51 -
Postal losses. Taking both these payments into account, the Branch's total
payments to Government over the period FY1981-83 would be equivalent to an
annual interest rate of about 12 percent on capital-at-charge.
Future Financial Performance of the Telecommunications Branch
5.12      Forecast financial statements for the period FY81 through FY85 are
given in Annexes 25 through 27 and notes to the statements are in Annex 31.
A summary of the forecast operating results follows:

5.13      The financial projections, based on existing tariffs, indicate
continued satisfactory financial performance. The rate of return on
revalued assets, though declining, is not expected to fall below 13 per-
cent. This decline reflects the large construction program, which increases
the net fixed assets from Rs 12,109 million (US$1,442 million) at the begin-
ning of FY81 to Rs 33,239 million (US$3,957 million) by the end of FY85, a
275 percent increase over the five-year period. During this period some of
the additional plant capacity is not fully utilized and, hence, its revenue
potential is not fully realized until after FY85. The operating ratio,
reflecting adjusted depreciation on account of asset revaluation, would be
around 60 percent during the forecast period (the operating ratio with
depreciation on historical asset cost is projected at 58 percent in FY80
falling to 54 percent in FY85). The rate of return of 11 percent on
revalued assets as in the previous Bank Loan Agreement (1592-IN) would be
continued in the proposed IDA credit.
5.14      The Branch's financial position remains satisfactory throughout
the forecast period, FY81-FY85, with a debt/equity ratio of no more than
20/80, a current ratio of at least 3.4 times and debt service and transfers
coverage ratios of not less than 4.7 times.

Domestic Manufacturers
5.15      The three indigenous telecommunications equipment manufacturers,
ITI, HTL and HCL, are Government-owned public enterprises. Their past
financial performance has been evaluated by the Bureau of Public Enterprise
(BPE) in the Ministry of Finance and found acceptable. 1/ All three com-
panies are audited annually by commercial firms of chartered accountants;
the present arrangements of submission of audited accounts within six months
of the close of the fiscal year have been complied with and will continue
under the IDA credit proposed. A summary of the historical and projected
operating results and financial positions of these three companies for the
period FY77 through FY83 are given in Annexes 28, 29, and 30.
5.16      The three companies are operating under a captive environment in
what is essentially a vertically integrated telecommunications industry;
they supply P&T with the major portion of their products and plan their
capital expansion programs and production schedules mainly according to the
requirements of P&T's telecommunications investment programs. Their produc-
tion facilities have been reviewed and found acceptable, and their products
are competitively priced by world standard. There has never been a cash
deficit problem since their inception and this position is expected to con-
tinue in the future.
5.17      Historically, all three companies have performed reasonably well,
and gross margin ratios have been good, as has rate of return on net fixed
assets. Over the past three years, the contribution to increased capital
requirements for self-generated funds has been 36 percent on average. The
considerable capital expansion over the next three years will reduce this
percentage to 23 percent (see Table below), which is reasonable given that,
at the end of the third year, about 50 percent of total net fixed assets is
work in progress and not yet revenue-producing.
L/ BPE is charged to make recommendations, instructions and guidelines for
public enterprises and to review, coordinate and advise on matters
related to their material, financial, personnel, industrial and produc-
tion managements.

5.18      Future projected financial results for the three companies are
good; gross margin ratios will be above 13 percent and returns on net fixed
assets range from 12 percent to 22 percent in 1983.
5.19      All three companies pay custom duties on their imported goods and
income tax on their chargeable profits. The Indian Government has followed
the practice of providing funds to the public entities on commercial terms
(currently 15 years with a 3-year grace period and 11 percent interest with
a rebate of one-fourth of 1 percent for prompt payments). During
negotiations, the Government confirmed that the IDA credit funds would be
onlent to ITI, HTL and HCL in accordance with this practice.
Performance Monitoring
5.20      Performance indicators to help monitor the Branch's future finan-
cial performance are given in Annex 32.
5.21      As an independent Government body, BPE conducts an annual survey
to investigate the operating results of all public enterprises, including
the three telecommunications equipment manufacturing companies, and compare
their financial and management performance with the historical trends and



- 54 -
industry norms. The survey is thorough and critical; the results are pub-
lished and reported to the Parliament. To help monitor their future per-
formance, assurances were obtained during negotiations that ITI, HTL and HCL
would submit to the Association, through the P&T, the relevant chapters
pertaining to the respective companies in the BPE annual survey report, as
soon as it is available, together with comments and planned corrective
actions, if any, regarding BPE's analysis and recommendations. Starting
FY81, the P&T would also submit to the Association a copy of any new pricing
agreements as they are concluded with the companies.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreements were obtained on the following
points:
(a)  the P&T's provisional accounts would be submitted to the
Association within four months after the close of the
fiscal year and the accounts audited by the C&AG would be
submitted to the Association within a reasonable time
after the close of the fiscal year (paragraph 4.17);
(b)  accounts of ITI, HTL and HCL would be audited annually by
commercial auditors and the audited accounts and reports
would be submitted to the Association within six months
of the close of the fiscal year (paragraph 4.37);
(c)  the P&T would continue to revalue, on a memorandum basis,
its telecommunications assets in a manner acceptable to
the Association and periodically review the adequacy of
the depreciation rates for purpose of calculating the
rate of return (paragraph 5.08):
(d)  the P&T's telecommunications tariffs would be maintained
at a level adequate to achieve a minimum of 11 percent
rate of return on revalued assets (paragraph 5.13); and
(e)  IDA credit funds would be onlent to ITI, HTL and HCL on
commercial terms in line with its routine practice
(currently 15 years with a 3-year grace period and 11
percent interest with a rebate of one-fourth of 1 percent
for prompt payment) (paragraph 5.19).



- 55 -
6.02      The following additional points were also discussed and agreed
during negotiations:
(a) an implementation plan and schedule covering the intro-
duction and local manufacture of a local electronic
switching system (paragraph 2.03):
(b) inclusion in the P&T's annual progress reports to the
Association information required to monitor the progress
of the network upgrading program and the quality
performance of the network (paragraph 2.06):
(c) inclusion in the study program of the P&T's Economic
Research Cell of pricing and tariff studies with terms of
reference defined by June 30, 1981 in consultation with
the Association (paragraph 3.12);
(d) strengthening the professional establishment of the P&T's
Economic Research Cell by December 1981 (paragraph 4.08);
(e) preparation of a quality standards manual agreeable to
the P&T and the Association by ITI by June 1981
(paragraph 4.22);
(f) establishment and staffing of a quality assurance
department by HCL, with a functional statement acceptable
to the Bank, by June 30, 1981 (paragraph 4.28);
(g) inclusion in the P&T's annual progress reports to the
Association information concerning the average price paid
for main items of supplies from the local factories and a
comparison of actual and target values of the factories'
outputs (paragraph 4.38);
(h) submission to the Association by ITI, HTL and HCL of the
annual survey reports by BPE on their financial and
management performance together with any planned
corrective actions (paragraph 5.21); and
(i) advice to the Association of any new pricing
agreements with P&T (paragraph 5.21).
6.03      With the above agreements the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$314 million equivalent under the
normal terms for such credits.

EIGHTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
P&T Network Upgrading Program
Introduction
1.        The telephone and telex network performs poorly for a variety
of reasons. One of the major causes is the serious underprovision of
facilities in relation to the demand and usage attempts and the expanded
development plans will progressively eliminate this as a factor.
2.        There are a number of other factors causing poor service and
these relate to the standards of plant in the network and the quality of
the maintenance. Numerous committees have investigated the performance
of the network and the quality of maintenance and reports and recommenda-
tions have been made.
3.        Based on these studies, a network upgrading program has been
devised and is to be implemented. The more significant elements of the
program are described and quantified in the following.
Telephone Instruments
4.        The most important part of a telephone network is the telephone
instrument and the instrument used in the past has deficiencies. An
improved design is now going into production in ITI and faulty existing
instruments now in the network have been identified. The most recent
estimate of the number of faulty telephones is 15,000 and these will be
replaced during 1981/82. A continuing check of the instruments will be
conducted in conjunction with other elements of the upgrading program.
House Wiring
5.        Many services have been installed with aluminum internal wire
between the external line wire termination and the telephone set. This
wire must be replaced with copper wire and the use of aluminum wire dis-
continuted. The program allows for the complete replacement of aluminum
house wiring by FY84. It is estimated that approximately 650,000 instal-
lations are involved and the year by year implementation plan is shown in
Annex 8.

ANNEX 7

Iron Wire in Subscribers' Loops
6.        Iron wire has been used in the subscribers' loops between the
distribution box and the house terminal. This is substandard engineering
design and the iron wire will be replaced by conventional copper drop wire.
The total number is estimated at approximately 200,000 and the task of
replacing these loops with drop wire will be completed by FY83. The imple-
mentation plan is shown in Annex 8.
Cable Pressurization
7.        Telephone cables fail when water penetrates the sheath and main-
taining gas pressure under the sheath prevents water entry and identifies
and helps locate holes in the sheath. In the four metropolitan districts,
there is approximately 12,600 sheath km of junction, primary and secondary
cable of which some 4,600 sheath km is already under pressure. It is
proposed to pressurize the remainder by FY84 in accordance with the
implementation plan shown in Annex 8.
Ducts
8.        The installation of main cables in ducts rather than buried
directly in the ground improves their maintainability and eliminates the
possibility of existing cables being damaged during the installation of
new cables. A program for duct installation in a number of major city
networks is being undertaken. The route kilometers of cable ducts
proposed for installation in the various networks for the next three
years is:

Network Monitoring and Testing
9.        There is a need for better surveillance of both the local and
long distance network to improve its efficiency, gather more and better
planning data and to undertake preventative maintenance.
10.       For local networks, it is proposed to introduce an automatic
traffic recording and analysis system into Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.
The same system as works successfully in New Delhi is proposed. The
total cost for this will be approximately Rs 30 million or US$3.6 million
and the work will be completed during FY82.
11.       For the long distance network, it is proposed to provide auto-
matic regulation equipment on the broad band systems and to upgrade the
testing, measuring and monitoring equipment at the four major repair
centers and the headquarters of the regional maintenance centers. The
equipment proposed is as follows:

Assumptions Used for Economic Analysis of
Telecommunications Project by Service Categories
1.        An economic analysis has been carried out for the major service
categories covered by the P&T's three-year investment program. The service
categories examined are (a) the local telephone service program in Bombay,
Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, (b) the local telephone service in other major
cities, (c) the local telephone service in rural areas and (d) the long
distance telephone system.
2.        For the four major cities and the other large cities the invest-
ment for local facilities (switching equipment, telephones, wires, etc.)
has been justified by the benefits from local calls. For the rural areas
investment has been justified by the benefits from local calls plus benefits
from all long distance phone calls below 50 km (the rationale being that
these relatively short long distance phone calls will not go through the
long distance network and are more allied to the local telephone service).
The investment program for the long distance telephone network has been
justified by the benefits from long distance telephone calls not already
included in the economic justification of local investment for rural area
facilities.
3. Economic Analysis for the Local Telephone Service in the Four Major
Cities and Other Large Cities
(a) to compute the average benefits from the local calls it has
been assumed that the maximum economic value to be attached
to a call is the equivalent price of printing and mailing
two letters (total cost estimated at 1.25 Rs) and that the
minimum economic value is the tariff (0.3 Rs) giving an
average value of 0.775 Rs;
(b) if the telephone allocation to a new subscriber was done
following economic priority, the actual economic value of
a local telephone call would vary from place to place
according to the level of unsatisfied demand. It has been
assumed that in India where telephone connections are allo-
cated from each waiting list (OYT and non-OYT) to the first
arrived, first served, the larger the unsatisfied demand,
the higher the value of the telephone call. Therefore, for



- 83 -
ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 4
each sub-program the average benefit from a local phone call
has been weighted by a ratio of the average level of satisfied
demand in India and the level of satisfied demand in the area
covered by each sub-program;
(c) for each sub-program the operating costs associated with each
local telephone call has been computed from statistics pub-
lished by the Management Information System (see Table 1);
(d) the number of local calls per line has been assumed to stay
constant over time. For the sake of simplicity, the free
calls have been treated as paying calls (see Table 1);

for the other cities           6,345 Rs per line

4. Economic Analysis for the Local Telephone Service in Rural Areas
(a)  for the rural areas benefits from specific local telephone
calls have been computed as above. In addition, the long
distance calls below 50 km were considered as local calls
and their benefits included in the economic analysis of
the local telephone system;
(b) for all long distance manual trunk calls including "these
local long distance phone calls below 50 km," the sub-
scriber can either place a normal call or pay twice the
rate and place an urgent call or even pay eight times
the rate and place a very urgent call. According to
existing statistics, 74% of the calls are normal, 25%
are urgent and only 1% are very urgent. According to
the demand curves that can be drawn from these three
points, the economic value of the long distance tele-
phone calls is about twice their rate;
(c) the number of long distance calls below 50 km has been
computed by assuming that the total long distance manual
trunk calls were in fact comprised of two sets of calls,
one set (the local long distance) for which average tariff
has been taken as 1.5 Rs and one set of long distance calls
for which average tariff has been taken as 15 Rs.  According
to this hypothesis, about 60% of total manual trunk calls
have to be considered as local and 40% as real long distance
calls. The average economic value from the local long
distance telephone calls has been estimated therefore at
about 3 Rs per unit call of 3 minutes;
(d) the cost of these local long distance telephone calls has
been computed by assuming that they would be equal to the
local telephone calls in rural areas plus about 20% for
the maintenance of extra wires and cables and 1.3 Rs per
call to cover the cost of the operators; and
(e) the average investment cost per line for local equipment
without tax was estimated at 4,650 Rs, 20% was added to
include additional investment for the local long distance
telephone calls.

5. Economic Analysis for the Long Distance Telephone Service
(a) the program will provide about 40,000 new trunk automatic
telephone exchange terminations, about 40 new subscriber
trunk dialing routes, 1,500 new manual trunk positions
and associated long distance cable and radio systems.
The revenue per unit of automatic exchange capacity was
estimated to be about 12,350 Rs per year and for manual
trunk positions about 155,000 Rs per year.  The economic
value of the services provided by this equipment has been
estimated as twice the revenue according to the demand
curve for long distance manual calls; and
(b) the cost of operating the long distance telephone system
has been estimated by assuming that:
(i) the yearly maintenance cost per line for cable and
radio is about 15,000 Rs per km;
(ii) the yearly maintenance cost for equipment is about
4% of its initial investment cost; and
(iii) that the other operating costs are about 90% of (i)
and (ii).

A. Notes and Assumptions to P&T Financial Statements
1. Income Statements (Annex 25)
1.01      Telephone Revenues have been forecast using the average number of
Direct Exchange Lines (DELs) estimated to be in service during the forecast
period (FY81 to FY85) at the experienced average revenue per DEL growing at
a rate of 7% during FY81 to FY83, 6% and 5% for FY84 and FY85, respectively.
1.02      Telegraph Revenues have been projected to increase at a rate of
5% per year based on past experience.
1.03      Telex Revenues have been projected to increase at 15% per year during
FY81 to FY82 and 20% per year during FY83 to FY85, reflecting past experience
and the expected traffic growth and new additional connections.
1.04      Railway Communications Revenues have been projected at a flat rate
of Rs 130 millions per year reflecting the average FY77-80 experience. The
railways has been building their own communications system and significant
revenues increases are not likely.
1.05      Miscellaneous Revenues are estimated at a flat rate of Rs 100
million per year, reflecting the average past experience.
1.06      Staff Expenses and Other Costs of Operation have been projected on
the basis of the Telecommunications Branch's estimated requirements (about
6-1/2% per year) and an inflation factor of 7% per year during FY81 to FY83
and 5% per year for FY84 and FY85.
1.07      Depreciation has been computed on a straight line basis at a com-
posite rate of 4.5%. The forecast income statements (Annex 25) reflect
this computation on the historical asset cost basis. The net operating
income has been adjusted to reflect depreciation on revalued assets for the
computation of rate of return.
1.08      Other Income has been computed on the basis of Government's compen-
sation to the Telecommunications Branch for transfer of funds to cover postal
service losses and for funds held by Government under the accounts with the
Government. The interest rate used in this computation is the experienced
6%.

ANNEX 31

1.09      Interest Expenses has been projected using the government required
6% on the capital-at-charge. The exchange loss is transferred to Government.
2. Balance Sheet (Annex 26)
2.01      Fixed Assets reflects the investment program detailed in Annex 9.
2.02      Plant Under Construction has been calculated at 60% of the total
of current year's construction program plus the value of the plant under
construction at the end of the previous year.
2.03      Subscriber Accounts Receivable have been estimated at about 16%
of total billings, which reflects the Branch's goal of two-month revenue
valuation.
2.04      Inventories have been calculated proportional to the average value
of gross fixed plant in operation; the proportion is expected to improve
from about 9% in FY81 to about 5% in FY85 as a result of better material
management system that P&T is currently implementing.
2.05      Current Liabilities have been calculated at about 6% per year of
cost expenditures for operating expenses and construction on past experience.
2.06      Other Liabilities have been projected on the basis of the expected
advance deposits by OYT subscribers and other subscribers.
B. Notes and Assumptions to the Manufacturing Companies' Financial
Statements (Annexes 28 to 30)
1. Sales Projections are based upon P&T program requirements.
2. Gross Margin Before Taxes is based upon maintenance of average rate of
margin achieved in preceding three years.
3. Tax is based upon previous three years charge as a percent of gross
margin.
4. Work in Progress is based upon construction program being cut over as
reveune earning assets at 50% in first year after expenditure and 50%
in second year after expenditure.
5. There was some shortfall in the production of equipment in all three
companies' factories during 1979 due to power rationing and industrial
action by labor unions.
