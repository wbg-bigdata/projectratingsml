MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A
THIRD ROADS PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memor-ndum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
Lanka for SDR 30.6 million (US$42.5 million equivalent). The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance priority
requirements of repair and restoration of roads and bridges to the national
network and strengthening institutional capabilities to monitor, control and
execute projects more effectively.   The project would be cofinanced by the
Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF), Republic of Korea, for US$14.5
million equivalent.
2.       Background:  Sri Lanka has a relatively extensive and well-developed
road network which evolved during the last century to service the island's
plantations.    It comprises  about 10,440 km of national  roads under  the
responsibility of the Government's Road Development Authority (RDA), 15,300 km
under the Provincial Councils and 52,200 km under local governments.   The
transport sector responded to the 1977 liberalization by di'rersifying and
expanding rapidly, mainly through private bus and truck operations; road
transport now accounts for more than 80% of both freight and passenger services.
Growth of traffic and increased unregulated axle loads have placed a severe
burden on the aging road network. Due to inadequate funding for maintenance and
rehabilitation of the network, the pace of pavement and structure deterioration
has increased. These factors combine to eause low average traffic speeds, high
operating costs and frequently dangerous conditions. Flooding and landslides in
1989 caused significant damage to roads in some regions and the overall network
has suffered considerable damage during the extended period of civil
disturbances.   At this point, the network requires extensive restoration to
arrest further deterioration and reduce maintenance costs.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement:  IDA has long supported the Government's
efforts to develop its transport infrastructure. After an early highway project
in 1968 was cancelled over policy disagreements, there was a hiatus until the
first Road Maintenance Project (Credit 900-CE of 1979; PCR No. 8000, August 1989)
which became the turning point in IDA's dialogue with the Government on highways,
as agreement was reached on the importance of rehabilitation and maintenance.
The ongoing Second Roads Project (Loan 2517-CE, appro-ed in April 1985) is
nearing completion and builds  on the earlier project.    There have been
significant cost increases on some contracts due to procurement and contract
management problems. Through dlose coordination with RDA, these problems have
been resolved, but have resulted in several components being deleted due to
unavailability of funding. Physical implementation of major roads and bridges
completed under the project has been very good, with sustainability and full
benefits realized.   The Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1833-CE, approved in March 1988) also includes reconstruction of roads
mainly in the North and Eastern Provinces. The project has disbursed slowly as
civil disturbances have been protracted; when the political situation stabilizes,
we expect disbursements relating to those areas to improve gradually. The Road
Passenger Transport Project (Credit 994-CE of March 1980; PCR No. 8011, August



-2-
1989) continued the implementation of the Government's and IDA's sectoral
development strategy by focussing on policy constraints which prevented private
sector participation in bus transport and highlighted the complexities and
inefficiencies of public sector bus operation. The Economic Restructuring Credit
(Credit 2128-CE, May 1990) moved this process a step forward by including a
component to help the Government fully privatize the bus transport sector.
Deregulation of bus fares has been agreed and discussions have been held for the
establishment of a transport regulatory authority with powers to enforce safety
standards and to control operations of new or additional services.
4.       The proposed project is a key module in the Government's medium-term
investment program for the road sub-sector and also supports key recommendations
of the Transport Sector Review (now under preparation) in terms of investment
planning and institutional improvement. It builds on the lessons derived from
earlier projects and thus emphasizes rehabilitation with appropriate standards,
close attention to operations and maintenance and effective cost control.
Earlier procurement and contract management problems were due to confusing
arrangements between the client, the engineer, and contractors, and have been
addressed under the proposed project.
5.       Apart from IDA, the Asian Development Bank and a number of bilateral
agencies, principally from Japan and the United Kingdom but including the
Republic of Korea under this project, have supported the road subsector. While
local coordinating meetings between the Government, IDA and other donors are held
regularly on transport issues, this project, would enable IDA to assist the
Government coordinate the work of other donors in the development of a long-term
sectoral strategy.
6.       Proiect Objectives:  The project's objectives are to: (a) reduce the
road transport cost and delays of passengers and goods by restoring major trunk
roads to better operational condition; (b) help to restore priority road
infrastructure damaged by flooding and landslides in May/June 1989; (c) enhance
the institutional capabilities of RDA to increase the quality and extent of road
maintenance and rehabilitation; and (d) upgrade RDA's capacity to supervise and
execute rehabilitation works and to stimulate the local road contracting
industry.
7.       Proiect Description:  The project, to be implemented over an eight-year
period by RDA (coinciding with the standard country project implementation
profile), includes: (a) rehabilitation of about 420 km of primary and secondary
trunk roads and strengthening, repair, widening, redecking or replacement of 24
bridges; (b) urgent repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected roads
and associated structures damaged as a consequence of the 1989 floods and
landslides; (c) procurement of vehicles, microcomputers, survey equipment,
computer software and office equipment to facilitate road works monitoring and
control; and (d) technical assistance and consultancy services to strengthen
RDA's capabilities to monitor, control and execute contracts more effectively,
and implement key operational and institutional reforms through special studies.
8.       The total cost of the project is US$70.5 million, with a foreign cost
component of US$40.3 million.   The prcject was prepared using US$340,000 of
funding from IDA's Project Preparation Facility.   Retroactive financing of
US$1.5 million is recommended for civil works and consultancy services, to cover



-3-
the costs of flood rehabilitation works and for final engineering designs for
preselected road sections.  The retroactive financing represents 3.5% of the
credit amount.  The Government has secured US$14.5 million from the EDCF, to
finance one major road contract and its associated structures. The proposed EDCF
loan would he at 3.5% for 20 years including five years of grace. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Sri Lanka are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached (IBRD No. 22434). The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8816-CE dated
October 3, 1990 is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions:  Agreements were reached with the Government during
negotiations that: (a) an action plan will be updated and reviewed annually by
IDA which includes budgetary allocations for RDA and other agencies to ensure
that services and resources from agencies of the Government, including RDA, will
be forthcoming during project implementation; (b) consultants for the Road User
Charges Study will be appointed by April 15, 1991; (c) consultants for the study
on the Domestic Road Contracting Industry will be appointed by May 15, 1991; (d)
consultants for the study on Road Materials, Design and Construction Standards
will be appointed by September 30, 1991; (e) recommendations resulting from these
three studies will be implemented in consultation with IDA; and (f) Government
will meet its share of project costs according to the financing plan. Conditions
for effectiveness of the credit are the establishment of a Project Management and
Monitoring Unit within RDA, the appointment of an expatriate advisor, and two RDA
counterpart staff acceptable to IDA.
10.      Environmental ImRact:  The project will have significant environmental
benefits as it will improve road safety, reduce user discomfort, allow a smooth
flow of traffic and improve drainage with a consequent lowering of current levels
of traffic noise, dust and air pollution and a reduction in the present
susceptibility to flooding of the roadside dwellings and urban areas. Project
works lie within a road reserve which has served the same purpose for many
decades. Since the proposed road and bridge works involve no major earthworks,
realignments or changes in natural drainage, there will be no adverse intrusion
into the environment and no resettlement issues are envisaged.  Provisions will
be incorporated in the contract documents for roadworks and bridgeworks to
provide environmental safeguards during and after construction is completed.
11.      Benefits: The overall economic rate of return is estimated to be 33.1%.
The cost of rehabilitating the project roads and bridges is relatively small
compared to the large and immediate benefits obtained from improving the
conditions of the road platform and the riding surface. Transport savings made
possible by the project would be passed on to the users in the form of lower
operating costs and increased product availability. The Sri Lankan population
is highly mobile and the benefits of the project are expected to be widely
distributed among all segments of the population, including poverty groups. The
project is expected to result in: (a) better network integration, reduction in
road maintenance costs, avoidance of serious deterioration and bridge and road
closures and accidents; (b) lower freight transport costs which will ease the
movement of industrial and agricultural goods; and (c) lower passenger transport
costs and travel time which would increase the general accessibility of project
areas. Further, the improvement of RDA's planning and management capabilities



-4-
would help to ensure timely implementation and early accrual of benefits of
future projects.   The project does not target poverty groups directly, but
project roads have been selected for their high return, which are expected to
include low income users.  The flood rehabilitation component is expected to
directly assist rural low income families by restoring access for agricultural
inputs/outputs. The project supports privatization through assistance to the
local contracting industry.   Although the project does not address women in
development directly, it is expected to generate labor-intensive employment
opportunities for all dwellers in the vicinity of project works.
12.      Risks: The major risk is the unstable security situation in the country
which could affect implementation and costs. Although the political situation
has shown some signs of improving, measures are proposed under the project to
closely monitor implementation and control costs. To this end, flexibility has
been incorporated into the implementation schedule to allow for the initial
contracts to be in areas unaffected by political unrest. Works will be initially
awarded at annual intervals in order to monitor the situation and enable the
timing of the later contracts to be adjusted to prevailing conditions.
Similarly, changes in fuel prices resulting from the current volatile situation
in the Middle East may materially affect project costs, although it is too early
to make a judgment at this point. A second risk is the possible weakening of
Government's commitment to maintaining rehabilitated project roads. This would
be minimized by continued monitoring of the annual maintenance budgets, the
adequacy of which will be reviewed jointly.   Another risk is the possible
overextension of RDA's engineering and management capacity by ongoing and future
commitments. This would be addressed by providing for supervision of project
implementation with consultants, and by strengthening PDA and improving its
efficiency through technical assistance and training of its staff in contract
administration, management and cost control.
13.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
