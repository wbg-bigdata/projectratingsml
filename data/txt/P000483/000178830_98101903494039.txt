APPRAISAL OF A HIGH, TAY MINTETA70TCE AMD ENGINEERING PROJECT
SY4AY
i.        The Government of Chad has asked IDA to help finance a project
consisting of (i) a five-year program to improve highway maintenance,
(ii) a feasibility study, including detailed engineering, of the Djermaya-
Djimtilo road (82 km) and complementary lakeside facilities, and (iii) the
establishment of a traffic data collection system for the main road network.
The project would be the first for the Bank or EDA in Chad.
ii.       The five-year maintenance program includes the provision of equip-
ment, spare parts, and materials, the extension and improvement of existing
shops, and the training of operators and mechanics. The program is scheduled
to start in mid-1968. IDA would finance the foreign exchange component,
estimated at 85 percent or US$3.8 million of the total capital expenditure
of US$h.4 million during the first three years of the maintenance program.
The Government would meet the local costs of the capital expenditure of
these three years, the total cost of equipment replacement in the last two
years of the program (1971 and 1972), as well as the recurrent highway
maintenance expenditures over the five-year period, these various items
amounting to a total Government contribution of US$5.7 million equivalent.
iii.      The estimated benefits of the maintenance program, primarily savings
in vehicle operating costs, yield an economic return of 11 percent on invest-
ment which is satisfactory. In addition, there are administrative and other
benefits which are not readily quantifiable.
iv.       An all-weather road linking Djermaya with Djimtilo, together with
improved lakeside facilities, would markedly assist the transportation of
fish and other products from Lake Chad to Fort Lamy. Consultants would
carry out a feasibility study of improving these transport facilities, the
detailed engineering of any necessary works,should their economic justifica-
tion be confirmed, and initiate a program for collection of traffic data.
The cost of these consulting services is estimated at US$0.4 million, of
which IDA would finance the foreign component estimated at US$0.3 million.
v.        Responsibility for the project would be with the Directorate of
Public Works (DPW), which is capable of executing the project satisfactorily.
vi.       The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit in the
amount of US$4.1 million.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE AMD ENGINEERING PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In May 1966, the Bank's Permanent Mission in Wlest Africa (PMWA)
sent a project identification mission to Chad. It recommended that a
feasibility study be made of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road (82 km), between
Fort Lamy and Lake Chad (see map), and that road maintenance be improved.
In February 1967, the Government submitted a request to the DA for assistance
in financing: (i) a five-year program to improve road maintenance, and
(ii) a feasibility study of the Djermaya-Djintilo road including complementary
lakeside facilities, to be followed by detailed engineering if, as expected,
the study proves the road to be technically and economically justified.
During credit negotiations, a one-year program for establishing a system of
traffic data collection was added to the project. The proposed credit
would be the first undertaking in Chad by the Bank or IDA.
1.02      This appraisal report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal
mission consisting of Messrs. Irion and Pusar, assisted by Mr. Brochet
from the PMWA, which visited Chad in February 1967. It includes information
supplied by the Chad Directorate of Public Works (DPW) and its consultants,
BCEOM, some of which was only recently received.



2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Chad is a large landlocked country in the southeast part of
the Sahara Desert and adjoining Savannahs in Africa. It has an area of
approximately 1.25 million km2, or about twice the size of France. It
is bounded by Libya on the north, Sudan on the east, and the Central
African Republic on its south; its western neighbors are Cameroon,
Nigeria and Niger. Its population, estimated at about 3.5 million, is
growing at the rate of about 1.4 percent per annum.
2.02      The northern two-thirds of the country is desert with an annual
rainfall of about 10 to 20 mm and is sparsely populated. The southern
part has a rainfall of about 1,200 mm per year and supports most of the
population. The country is mainly dependent on agricultural production,
principally livestock, groundnuts and cotton. Seasonal flooding in the
southern area impedes communications.
2.03      Chad's Gross National Product (GNP) was estimated in l965 at
US$240 million equivalent, representing a per capita income of only about
US$70. For the past few years there has been little growth in the GNP
mainly because of a low rate of investment and a decline in world market
prices of cotton. There is a large deficit in foreign trade.
B.   The Transport System
a.   General
2.04      Fort Lamyy, the capital of Chad, lies about 2,000 km from the
sea and external transport problems dominate the economy of the country.
Transport costs of gasoline and cement account for more than 35 percent
and 80 percent of the retail price respectively, and for cotton more
than 20 percent of its FOB export price. Recently, the fighting in Nigeria
has increased the cost of Chad imports through Nigeria, affecting
particularly fuel imports. On the other hand, improvements to several
other routes out of Chad are either underway or contemplated. On the
Cameroon route, the existing Regie des Chemins de Fer Camerounais
Railway is being extended about 600 km further north, with the help of
FED, FAC and USAID, and construction of a 150 km long all-weather road
in North Cameroon is being financed by a German loan; the Bank is also
financing engineering studies of the improvement of another 280 km long
road section (Engineering Credit No. S 3-CM) on the same route. These
improvements will be completed by early 1972 and will bring major savings
in the costs of transport between Chad and the sea.



2.05      Internal transport is inadequate due to poor, insufficiently
maintained highways and seasonal variations of water transport.   There is
no railway in the country.
b. Highways
2.06      The highway system consists largely of tracks which were created
under French colonial rule. These have been gradually inproved for vehi-
cular traffic, Out of a total network of more than 30,000 km of roads or
tracks, only 2,500 km are maintained regularly; the riding quality is
generally poor.
c. W 1aterways
2.07     W4ater transport, although seasonal, was more important in the
past when the roads were primitive. It is now concentrated on the river
Chari between Lake Chad, Fort Lamy and Fort Archambault, and accounts for
about 5 percent of the total transport activity in the country.
d. Arwa,yIs
2.08      Fort Lamy, the capital, has an international airport suitable
for commercial jets. A local airline company operates a scheduled service
between the four principal towns in the country.
C.  Trsport Coordination
2.09      The principal modes of transport for goods in Chad are highways
and waterways. Due to a scarcity of capital, the available funds for
investment in transport have to be carefully allocated between these two
modes.  The waterways, consisting primarily of the river Chari and its
tributaries, meet the limited present needs of bulk transport on a
seasonal basis but do not provide for the continuous movement of cargo
traffic. Consequently, during the past few years the Government has
concentrated investments in the transport sector on improving the Fort
Lamy-Fort Archambault road. Future investments will continue to be
concentrated on the improvement of the road network.  The feasibility study
of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road, to be financed under the proposed IDA
credit, is a continuation of this transport policy.



3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      The highway network (for schematic layout, see map) consists of
approximately 11,000 km of roads and 20,000 km of tracks. The northern part
of the country is served mainly by tracks. There are about 8,500 km of
classified roads in the southern part (Table 1) of which about 40 percent
are all-weather and the remainder are passable only during the eight months
of the dry season.
3.02      The four major towns of the country, Fort Lamy, Moundou, Fort
Archambault and Abeche, are linked by the road network; the area around
Moundou is important for cotton growing. There are also international road
links with Cameroon, CAR and Sudan, (see map). All roads are either earth
or laterite surfaced; FED is financing the first bituminous surfacing of
about 230 km of the two most important roads serving Fort Lamy, namely Fort
Lamy-Massaguet and Fort Lamy-Gelengdeng.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.03      Highway transport, although still at relatively low levels, has
expanded rapidly in the last decade and the vehicle fleet has more than
doubled; in 1966 there were approximately 9,000 vehicles registered in the
country. Table 2 gives the motor vehicle registration figures for cars,
buses and trucks. Vehicles are mainly concentrated in Fort Lamy, Moundou and
Fort Archambault. There are about 1,000 trucks owned by professional
truckers; in 1966 these trucks carried about 300,000 tons of goods for an
average haul of nearly 400 km.
3.04      The load factor for trucks is about 65 percent, which is reasonable
given the volume of traffic and goods carried. Vehicle operating costs are
relatively high because of poor road conditions, particularly in the wet
season. Average costs per ton/km vary from US 5 cents equivalent on low
standard earth roads to US 3 cents on good laterite or gravel roads.
3.05      No regular traffic counts have been carried out since 1963.  At
that time volumes were well below 100 vehicles per day. The map indicates
the traffic distribution in 1963, which is also representative of the present
traffic pattern although volumes have since increased by some 30-40 percent.
Included in the project is a country-wide traffic count to be made by
consultants in 1968/69. These counts would subsequently be updated on a
regular basis, to provide a suitable basis for planning of highway maintenance
and improvement. Traffic figures used in the preparation and evaluation of
the proposed project have been estimated by assuming a 5 percent uniform
growth rate based on the 1963 traffic figures, an assumption which appears
realistic and which is supported by trends in fuel consumption, vehicle
population, and local traffic.



C. Highway Administration
3.06      Responsibility for developing and maintaining the highway system
rests with three public agencies. The DPW (see Chart) is responsible for
most of the important roads in the southwest part of the country. The Fort
Lamy-CAR border road (684 km) falls under the jurisdiction of the Agence
Transequatoriale des Communications (ATEC), an international organization
created by Corgo-Brazzaville, Gabon, CAR and Chad in 1961 for the specific
purpose of being responsible for transport on the international route between
Chad and Congo. The maintenance of this road is financed by government
contributions as well as by tolls levied on water transport and profits
derived by ATEC from port and railway operations in the Congo. Maintenance
of the remaining roads and tracks is the responsibility of local adminis-
trative authorities.
3.07      The DPW is the principal authority for highway administration
in Chad. It is well organized, operates satisfactorily and is capable of
executing the project. Most of the senior posts are held by French engineers
under a Technical Assistance Agreement signed in 1960 between Chad and the
French Aid agency (FAC). A college of civil engineering was created in
Fort Lamy in 1964 to train Chad and Central African Republic engineers, but
the first class of 13 students will not graduate before the end of 1968.
It will take some time before experienced Chad engineers are available,
and since the senior posts in the DPW require an adequate standard of
education and experience, assurances have been obtained from the Government
that these posts will be filled, either through technical assistance or
by direct hire, with personnel possessing the appropriate qualifications.
3.08      New, time-consuming administrative procedures established late in
1966 have created delays in ordering materials and spare parts for mainte-
nance equipment. These delays are prejudicial to the sound management of
highway maintenance andthe Government has given its assurance that it
will reduce them. Moreover, payments to suppliers in 1966 were often late
because of a shortage of cash. This shortage, which has now been corrected,
originated from delayed transfers of custom duties levied for the first
time by Cameroon and Congo-Brazzaville under a new custom union formed
early in 1966. ThepDssibility that shortages might again occur cannot be
ruled out; therefore assurances have been obtained that payments will be
made on time to suppliers of materials, equipment and spare parts required
for the project.



- 6 -
3.09      Vehicle size and weight regulations are the same as in the other
French-speaking countries of Africa and are satisfactory. The maximum
permissible axle load is 10 tons which conforms with practices in West
Africa. All vehicles are subject to inspection every six months. The
movement of heavy vehicles on unsurfaced all-weather roads is forbidden
during and for a few hours after heavy rains. The present strict
enforcement of these regulations brings about savings in maintenance
costs which exceed the cost of immobilizing traffic for short periods.
D.   Highway Financing and Planning
3.10      As shown in Table 3, annual highway expenditures,which include
depreciation of equipment,have been increasing since 1960, largely as a
result of increased foreign aid for new construction. A Road Fund was
established in 1960, financed by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes earmarked
for the maintenance and improvement of the road network. Annual
proceeds since its creation are indicated in Table 4. The Government
contemplates increasing fuel taxes to meet the recurrent charges of the
proposed maintenance program included in this project (see para. 4.15).
Other taxes are levied on vehicles, spare parts and tire imports, etc.
As a whole, total revenues from road users have, over the last three years,
roughly met the expenditures for administration and maintenance of the
highway network, i.e., about 40 percent of total highway expenditure.
As a result of the tax increase contemplated by the Government, revenues
from road users will be more than doubled in 1972.
3.11      The Planning Commission has drawn up a Five-year Economic
Development Plan for the years 1966-1970 which, somewhat optimistically,
contemplates investing about US$40 million on 2,000 km of roads over the
period. Since local funds are scarce, most of this program would have
to be financed by foreign aid. The Government is now having discussions
on this subject with FED and FAC. Improvement of highway maintenance
and of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road are considered of high priority in
the Plan.
E.   Highway Construction
3.12      Highway construction works costing about US$16 million and
financed by FED and FAC are underway or are being contemplated in the
near future. Works are concentrated mainly around Fort Lamy and on the
Fort Archambault-Moundou-Cameroon border road. A subsequent step should
be to improve to all-weather standard either the Fort Lamy-Fort Archambault
or the Fort Lamy-Moundou road and to provide a link Fort Lamy-Abeche.
However, these construction works are expensive and are difficult to
justify economically because of low traffic volumes.



-7-
F. Highway Maintenance
3.13      As stated previously (see para. 3.6) road maintenance is carried
out by three different organizations. Each organization performs the
work by its own forces. Maintenance operations by the DPW and ATEC are
costed in detail; no costing is carried out by the local administrative
authorities.
3.14      Maintenance operations consist of reshaping, regravelling,
local patching and miscellaneous works such as grass cutting, maintenance
of drainage sumps etc. Labor is unevenly distributed but is used in road
maintenance in those areas where it is available; reshaping and regravel-
ling are carried out by mechanized units. Climatic conditions dictate
the work schedule; reshaping and regravelling are impossible during the
rainy season (June to October) because floods preclude the use of
machines, and reshaping is difficult during the dry season (January to
May) because of poor soil cohesion; as a result equipment utilization
is low. With the improvement of drainage resulting from the project,
the duration of floods will be reduced over some road sections, thereby
increasing somewhat equipment utilization.
3.15      Total funds available for maintenance are inadequate and as a
result the total length of roads regularly maintained is limited (see
Table 1). Furthermore, the condition of the roads for which the DPW is
responsible has deteriorated. ATEC is in a much better financial position,
and the Fort Lamy-Fort Archambault-Central African Republic border road
is in good condition. The roads or tracks being maintained by the local
administrative authorities are in very bad condition but, apart from those
which will be taken over by the DPW under the proposed project, they are
considered to be adequate for present traffic needs.
G. Highway Maintenance Equipment
3.16      The existing equipment owned by DPW is standardized on a few
French and US makes and is well suited to the type of highway maintenance
needed in the country; it was procured under FAC and USAID grants and has
been partially renewed through periodic purchases financed through an
Equipment Replacement Account. This account is credited with depreciation
charges levied on equipment used for highway maintenance, it being
intended that in normal circumstances an equivalent sum in cash should be
set aside and earmarked for replacement of road maintenance equipment.
Purchases for renewal were held up in 1966 and 1967, pending clarification
of the new equipment to be purchased under the proposed project, so that
the account shows at present a balance of about CFAF 90 million.



- 8 -
3.17      District and divisional shops carry out minor repairs to
maintenance equipment while major overhauls are done in the central shop
at Fort Lamy. Equipment is reasonably well maintained by the shops but
there is need for improvement in the daily maintenance carried out by
operators; this situation is being remedied by a training program for
operators and mechanics run by US AID in Fort Larmy (see para. 4.7).



_ 9 _
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description (see map)
4.01      The project consists of:
(i)       a five-year maintenance program to be executed by the DPW,
including the provision of equipment and spare parts,
materials, extension and improvement of shops, and the
training of operators and mechanics;
(ii)      a feasibility study for improving the 82 km long Djermaya-
Djimtilo road (see map) and lakeside facilities in Djimtilo
and Bol and, if the justification of the construction works
is confirmed, the completion of detailed engineering and
bidding documents; and
(iii)     establishment of a country-wide system to collect traffic
data on the main road network.
(1)   Five-Year Maintenance Program
(a)   ObJectives
4.02      The DPW at present maintains about 1,700 km of roads. Under the
proposed five-year maintenance plan, the DPW would maintain an increasing
length per year and be responsible by 1971 for a network of about 3,700 km
(see Table 5) linking the four major cities, Fort Lamy, Fort Archambault,
Moundou and Abeche, and adequately serving the southwestern part of the
country.
4.03      The present condition of the additional roads that would be main-
tained by DPW is generally poor. Road beds are not properly shaped, ditches
and drainage outlets are clogged, gravel or selected soil wearing courses
are worn away, pot holes and ruts are common. Most of the roads, except in
lateritic soils in the southwest area around Moundou, are impassable during
the rainy season.
4.04      With equipment and facilities provided under the project, the
roads would be improved so that regular and better maintenance could be
carried out and the roads kept at the standard of good, dry weather earth
roads. Where suitable lateritic gravel is available, they would be kept
open during most of the rainy season with the enforcement of appropriate
controls. Roads in other areas would be passable in all but very wet weather.
(b) Equipment and Personnel Needs
4.05      The quantities of equipment to be purchased per type, in 1968,
1969 and 1970 are shown in Table 6. Total equipment purchases consist of
24 graders, 49 tractors, 44 rubber tired rollers, 98 trucks and other pieces
of equipment as detailed in the table. The requirements were realistically



- 10 -
estimated on the basis of a study by the DPW which took account of the
volume of traffic, number of possible working days, and the output of the
equipment under average conditions.
4.06      An initial stock of spare parts, amounting to about 10 percent
of the value of the equipment, would be financed under the project. Addi-
tional spare parts would be supplied through local agents who would have
to be established as part of the purchase conditions; provision for
enlarging existing shops and warehouses of the DPW in Fort Lamy has been
included in the project. An initial stock of steel culverts amounting to
about US$120,000 equivalent would also be procured under the project for
use on the additional roads to be maintained.
4.07      Personnel requirements for the program are listed in Table 7.
Familiarization training for the operators and maintenance personnel would
be carried out by the equipment suppliers' local agents in Fort Lamy as a
condition of the purchase. Additional training would be provided at a
US AID-financed Regional Training Center in Lome, Togo. The Chad Govern-
ment is presently discussing with the Center the practical arrangements for
sending a relatively large number of trainees to Lome. The preliminary
outcome of these discussions is that while the Center would accept the
trainees, it might not support their travel and subsistence cost; therefore,
at the request of the Government, a provision to cover these expenditures is
included in the project. A small US AID-financed Center run by two American
experts has been training DPW operators and mechanics in Fort Lamy since
1965. Under existing arrangements between US AID and Chad, the experts are
scheduled to leave the country by the end of 1968, and US AID has informed
IDA that this assistance to Chad would not be resumed. The Center should
be operated on reduced scale after 1968 to meet the day-to-day training
needs of the DPW: the Chad Government is contemplating retaining for that
purpose the services of one of the above experts, or of an expert of similar
qualifications, until 1971; a provision to cover the corresponding cost for
1969, 1970 and 1971 has been included in the project.
(2)   Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering of the
Djermaya-Djimtilo Road and Collection of Traffic Data
4.08      The small village of Djimtilo near the mouth of the Chari river
on Lake Chad is a loading point for boats on the Lake. It is served at
present by a 82 km track, branching off the all-weather Fort Lamy-Massaguet
Road at Djermaya. This track provides excellent transportation during the
dry season but is impassable from August to December, when it is flooded
by the Chari. Its alignment is generally good, the terrain is flat with
very little vegetation and good materials for road construction are available
in the area.
4.09      The Government is considering improving this track to an all-weather
standard to provide permanent access from Fort Lamy to Lake Chad so that
fish caught on the lake, and other agricultural products from rapidly



expanding reclaimed zones along the lake, could be transported throughout the
year. Improvement requires the construction of an embankment over the major
part of the alignment, the provision of drainage and an adequate pavement.
The DPW has estimated the cost of the proposed improvement works at US$20,000
per km or US$1.6 million in total, of which US$1.2 million would be the foreign
component. The Association considers that this estimate is low and that a
cost of about US$30,000 per km is more realistic. The traffic expected is
about 40,000 tons per year after completion of the road and would increase
rapidly thereafter. A feasibility study by consultants is needed to determine
the appropriate design standards and to provide a reliable construction cost
estimate. The study would include an analysis of floods, to determine the
variation in the level of Lake Chad.
4.10      Improvement of the existing primitive lakeside terminal port and
storage facilities in Djimtilo and Bol (see map) would be required. The
traffic to be handled at these facilities would be of the same order of mag-
nitude as the expected road traffic. The Association estimates the cost of
improving both facilities at about US$0.8 million, of which US$0.6 million
would be in foreign exchange. The consultants would study these and prepare
preliminary cost estimates for their improvement and operation.
4.11      Detailed engineering and preparation of bidding documents for
constructing the prcposed road and improving the lakeside facilities would
be carried out only if, as anticipated, their economic justification is estab-
lished to the satisfaction of the Government and the Association.
4.12      The project also provides for the services of consultants to carry
out a country-wide traffic count covering the main road network and to
establish suitable facilities for the continuing collection of traffic data.
B.   Cost Estimates and Financing
(1)  Five-Year Maintenance Program
4.13      Estimates are given in Table 8 for the capital expenditures for
three years, and in Table 9 for the recurrent expenditures over the five-year
period of the maintenance program, 1968-1972. IDA would finance the foreign
exchange component (about 85 percent) of the capital expenditure of the first
three years of the maintenance program; the Government would finance the
local costs of the capital expenditure of these three years, which consist
primarily of taxes and customs duties. The Government would also finance the
total cost (both foreign and local) of equipment replacement in the last two
years of the program, and all the recurrent expenditures over the five-year
period. The cost of the new equipment, shown in Table 6, is based on recent
equipment purchases by Chad and includes about 13 percent custom and import
duties which would not be financed under the proposed credit. A contingency
allowance of about 10 percent has been added for price escalation over the
three-year equipment supply period. A further contingency allowance of about
10 percent has been added to cover miscellaneous additional needs of main-
tenance equipment, shop modernization and operator and mechanic training,
which may become apparent after the first two years.



- 12 -
4.14      The list of roads to be maintained with the 1972 target for
recurrent expenditures under the program is given in Table 5, and has been
confirmed by the Government during credit negotiations. These estimates
provide for the cost of labor and materials as well as for regular provision
for equipment depreciation. High costs for importing equipment and materials,
long haul distance for laterite and a relatively low equipment utilization
(see para. 3.14) require that this target expenditure be higher than the
usual maintenance cost per kilometer of low trafficked roads in most other
countries.
4.15      It is proposed that IDA will finance CFAF 215 million (US$870,000
equivalent) for equipment replacements in 1968, 1969 and 1970 because the
Government does not have sufficient funds available through the Equipment
Replacement Account to purchase the items required. Assurance has been
obtained that the Equipment Replacement Account will continue to be regularly
credited with adequate provisions for equipment renewal, that the cash held
for the account will be used solely to finance highway equipment replacements
and that if at any time the cash so held should prove to be insufficient
for the purpose, the deficiency will be made good by Government from its
general revenues.
4.16      To help finance the projected increase in expenditure on highway
maintenance, including the provision for equipment depreciation involved in
the five-year program, the Government confirmed during negotiations that it
will raise motor fuel taxes in three steps, on July 1, 1969, July 1, 1970
and July 1, 1972. An assurance was obtained that sufficient local funds
will be available from alternative sources should the Government have
difficulty in raising extra fuel revenue to the extent needed. The estimated
effect of the proposed increases in fuel taxes is shown in Table 9.
(2)   Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering of the Djermaya-Djimtilo
Road and Collection of Traffic Data
4.17      The estimated cost of the feasibility study and detailed engineering
of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road, as well as the cost for establishing a country-
wide traffic counting system, are based on cost figures contained in two
separate contracts negotiated with the French firm BCEOM, who will be retained
as consultants. IDA would finance the foreign exchange component as
determined in the contracts. A condition of the effectiveness of the credit
is the signature of both contracts between the Government and the consultants.
Should the detailed engineering, including preparation of bidding documents,
not be carried out because of an unfavorable conclusion of the feasibility
study (see para. 4.11), this item would be cancelled.

In addition, the Government would finance all of the recurrent highway
maintenance costs, estimated to total US$4.51 million equivalent over the
five-year period.
(4) Disbursements
4.19      Credit funds would be disbursed on the basis of the active
foreign currency costs of the project items to be financed. If any sur-
pluses in the credit account occur they would be cancelled.  On the
assumption that the credit would be signed in mid-1968, IDA disbursements
are estimated as follows:

C. Execution
(1) Five-Year Maintenance Program
4.20      Responsibility for the program would rest with the DPW.  Equipment
would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding through
separate contracts for each type or each group of similar types of equipment.
The contracts would provide for delivery of about half of the equipment in
1969 and the other half in 1970. The size of the orders would vary from about
US$800,000 for 24 graders and 52 trucks to some $20,000 for small items such
as cars and pumps. Equipment suppliers would be required to set up a short



training program to familiarize drivers, operators and mechanics with the
new equipment. They would also be required to provide an adequate servicing
organization, particularly for spare part supplies and for periodic inspection
of the equipment operating in the field. The contracts would be awarded on
the basis of the lowest evaluated bids in terms of equipment purchase price
as well as spare parts prices. Bidding documents have been prepared by the
DPW and approved by the Association. The DPW is contemplating regrouping
its present equipment, mainly of French and US origin, into two maintenance
divisions; the equipment purchased under the project would be used in the
other two divisions.
4.21      The steel culverts would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding through a single contract. Bidding documents are being
prepared by the DPW and will be reviewed by the Association.
4.22      It is inappropriate to request international competitive bidding
for carrying out the extension of the workshops and warehouses because of
the small amount (US$70,000 equivalent) that is involved. The capacity of
Chad contractors, most of whom are subsidiaries of foreign firms, is suffi-
cient to carry out these works; they would be awarded after local competitive
bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.
(2) Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering of the Djermaya-Djimtilo
Road
4.23      The study would be carried out by a French firm of consulting
engineers, BCEOM, selected in February 1968 after proposals had been reviewed
from five invited firms. The selection is acceptable to IDA. Contract
negotiations have been completed. The study would comprise two phases, the
first phase of preliminary engineering and economic analysis, the second
phase of detailed engineering and preparation of bidding documents. Because
the terrain is flat and subject to flooding, field surveys needed for the
preliminary engineering are more detailed than usual, and only a small
amount of additional field work would be required for the final design. To
reduce the consultants' mobilization expenses, all field work needed for
both preliminary and detailed engineering would be undertaken as one operation
in the firstphase of the study. Completion of detailed engineering and pre-
paration of bidding documents (second phase) would be carried out by the
consultants in their home office. The duration of the study would be about
12 months, plus 5 months for the detailed engineering and preparation of
bidding documents.
(3) Collection of Traffic Data
4.24      A contract has been negotiated with BCEOM for a country-wide traffic
count comprising the main road network. The count will extend over a period
of 18 months and will result in establishing a system for future collection
of traffic data, to be continued by DPW. The systematic traffic count will
provide a basis for planning of highway maintenance and improvement.



5. ECC`OT_OC JUSTIFICATION
A. Highway Yaintenance Program
5 °01     The econony of Chad is agricultural.  It is characterized by
a relatively modest level of demand for transport. While, in general,
the road network serves most rural and urban areas, its condition is
very poor with many roads being flooded during tlhe rainy season. The
objectives of the proposed highway maintenance program are to make up a
backlog of deferred maintenance on some roads and prevent the deteriora-
tion of others and thereby provide immediate and significant benefits to
the economy. ThequantilAhble benefits expected to accrue ff6i 'the
program are mainly savings in vehicle operating costs. While-these savings
would, in the fir§t instance, benefit users of the better maintained roads,
they ultimately would spread throughout the economy.
5.02      The bulk of Chad's economic activity takes place in the ser-
vice area of the roads to be maintained. In general, road maintenance
would encompass the Fort Lamy-Abeche-Fort Archambault triangle and the
road network in Southwest Chad (see map).
5.03      The average daily traffic projected for 1971 on the various roads
now being iraintained by DPW is relatively low, ranging up to about 100 vehic-
les (see Table 5). Although the latest traffic counts were taken in 1963,
some sample counts taken since then suggest traffic has been growing at
an average of about 7.5 percent annually. It is not anticipated that
this rate of growth is likely to be sustained.  For the purpose of this
report, therefore, it is assumed that future traffic will grow at an
average of five percent annually.
5.04      If, in the absence of the project, maintenance expenditures
were to continue at about their present level and maintenance procedures
and techniques were to remain unchanged, the condition of the roads in
the project area would deteriorate further and the costs of operating
vehicles over them would increase above their already high level. In
other words, the total transport bill (future vehicle operating costs
plus existing maintenance expenditures) would be much greater.  To cal-
culate correctly the benefits of the project, this total transport bill
without the project should be compared with the discounted total value
of future vehicle operating costs plus future maintenance expenditures
as a result of the project.
5.05     However, there are no readily available and reliable data to
indicate how vehicle operating costs would increase if the project were
not carried out. The French consultants, BCEOIi, have estimated the ex-
tent to which existing vehicle operating costs in Chad would fall as a
result of improved maintenance. They have done this by comparing vehi-
cle operating costs for existing road conditions with those likely on



- 16 -
well-maintained roads (Table 10).  The tunit savings arrived at amount to
the equivalent of CFAF 8.8 (US 3.5 cents) per km for passenger vehicles,
CFAF 11.5 (Us 4.6 cents) per km for light trucks and CFAF 2.5 (US 1.0 cent)
per ton-km for heavy trucks. The consultants have estimated these savings
fcr the whole road network in Chad at about 22 percent of total operating
^ost on prcperly maintained roads. This appears to be a little higher than
estimates of savings in vehicle operating costs due to improved road main-
tenance observed in other Bank Group member countries at a similar state of
development; to be conservative in calculating the economic return from the
project these savings have been reduced to about 20 percent.HIoreover, since
it is not possible within the limits of time and data availa'Dle to analyze
each road separately, a "global" approach has been adopted, with the full
amounts of the estimated benefits being assumed to accrue three years after
the commencement of the projected maintenance program.
5.06      Since the degree of equipment utilization is relatively low in
Chad, an average econanic life of nine years has been allowed for the
equipment.  Discounted over a period of nine years from 1969, the first
year in which the bulk of the equiprent included in the project will have
been purchased and put into operation, the estimated savings due to the
reduction in vehicle operating costs as a result of the program give an
economic return of about 11 percent on the total investment in the main-
tenance program.
5.07      This return, however, relates only to the savings betwieen exist-
ing vehicle operating costs and those expected as a result of the program.
It does not include any element representing the probable increase in
these costs should the program not be carried out.  It is, therefore, a
conservative figure which can be accepted as the basis for concluding
that the program is economically justified. In addition to these direct
benefits of the program, there are administrative and other benefits which
are not readily quantifiable. For example, some roads, because of improved
levels of maintenance, will be usable for more days in the year than at
present. This will permit some reductions in distribution and inventory
costs in the trading sector. The spoilage of perishable goods and produce
due to delays or to damage in transit will also be reduced.
B. Djermaya-Djimtilo Road
5.08      The proposed Djermaya-Djimtilo road, which runs about parallel
with the river Chari, lies north of Fort Lamy. Its construction would
provide a direct link betwieen Lake Chad and the main center of economic
activity of the country.  The road would primarily serve for the evacua-
tion of fish from Lake Chad, and agricultural produce and natron (a so-
dium carbonate) shipped to Djimtilo by water from the Bol area. At pre-
sent, the greater part of the fish caught in the Chad portion of Lake
Chad is shipped either to Nigeria or Cameroon. Agricultural produce is
transported at a high cost via poor sandy desert tracks through Mao and
Bir-Garat or via the lake and the river Chari which is not navigable
until after the agricultural harvest and the main fishing season.



_- 17 -
5.09      The Centre Technique Forestier Tropical, agricultural consultants
to the Government, estimate that, on the opening of the Djermaya-Djimtilo
road, the annual traffic would be about 7-10,000 tons of dried fish (banda),
about 30,000 tons of multi-crop agricultural produce, primarily grains, as
well as important tonnages of natron frcm the Bol area. The agricultural
traffic from the Bol area in particular, is likely to be much more signi-
ficant in the future since the present estimates are based on only 7,000
hectares of reclaimed cultivable land, whereas plans call for the reclama-
tion and cultivation of some 30,000 ha by 1970 and 80,000 ha by 1980.
5.10      At present, any significant production in excess of subsistence
needs in the area is held back by the lack of adequate transportation fa-
cilities to markets. The construction of the road and related lakeside
facilities would lower transport costs, and thereby induce the production
of cash crops and fish for marketing by bringing markets economically
closer to the production areas. It would also avoid heavy losses on ex-
isting fish output due to infestation resulting from the poor transport
conditions.
5.11      On the basis of the Association's preliminary estimates of
savings in transport cost on present fish and agricultural output shipped
out of the area, and the generated production resulting from the fall in
transport costs, an economic rate of return in excess of 15 percent ap-
pears possible for constructing the Djermaya-Djimtilo road and improving
the lakeside facilities. This is considered sufficient to justify pro-
ceeding to the feasibility study stage at this time. Detailed engineer-
ing would be carried out under the proposed project only if the apparent
economic justification is confirmed by this feasibility study.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOI1ENDATIONS
6.01      The road maintenance program under the proposed project will
greatly improve road transport in Chad. It is soundly conceived, both
technically and administratively. The program would yield a satisfactory
return on the investment principally through lower transportation costs.
6.02      The project also provide for engineering services in con-
nection with the Djermaya-Djimtilo Road and lakeside facilities in Djimtilo
and Bol, the improvement of which would greatly stimulate economic develop-
ment in the Lake Chad area.  The Government has negotiated   satisfactory
contractswith BCEOM, the selected consultant for the studies of the
Djermaya-Djimtilo Road and related facilities and for the establishment
of a traffic data collection system. Signature of the contracts would be
a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
6.03      During credit negotiations, agreement has been reached with the
Government on the following principal points:
(a) the circumstances under which the detailed engineering and
preparation of bidding documents of the Djermaya-Djimtilo Road
and related facilities will be carried out (para. 4.11);
(b) government financing of the local cost of capital expenditures
during the first three years, and the total cost of the last
two years of the program (para. 4.13);
(c) the list of roads to be maintained during the five-year period
(1968-1972) (para. 4.14);
(d) the replenishment and use of the Equipment Replacement Account
(para. 4.15);
(e) increases in motor fuel taxes to meet the recurrent expenditures
under the program (para. 4.16).
6.o0      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis of an IDA
credit of US$4.1 minlion.
