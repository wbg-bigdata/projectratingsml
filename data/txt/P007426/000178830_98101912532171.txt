I. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
1.01      During the decade following independence in 1962, Jamaica experienced
rapid economic growth, averaging about 6% p.a., in real terms. Growth was
spurred by major investments in tourism and in bauxite and alumina production.
Tourist visitors increased from 200,000 in 1962 to 500,000 in 1972, while over
the same period bauxite production expanded from 8 million tons to 13 million
tons, and the output of alumina rose from 650,000 tons to 2 million toas.
Large private capital inflows from abroad underpinned investments in these
sectors, and these same capital inflows enabled Jamaica to finance increasing
deficits of the current account of the balance of payments. However, invest-
ments during this period bypassed the agricultural sector, the traditional
source of Jamaica's employment opportunities. Agricultural production stagnated
and there was increasing migration to urban areas.  Moreover, import substitu-
ting manufacturing, mainly of consumer goods, continued to grow behind high
levels of effective protection. This, in combination with liberal tax incen-
tives and relatively high industrial wages, led to the development of a sector
which was capital intensive, provided relatively little employment, and was
heavily dependent on the import of intermediate goods. The failure to foment
agricultural and manufacturing production for export made bauxite and alumina
exports, which already accounted for one-half of total exports in 1966, rise
to about 70% by 1972. Finally, the pattern of development of the economy
failed to narrow the inequality of Jamaica's income distribution. Thus, by
the early 1970s, Jamaica was suffering from serious unemployment and growing
social tensions.
1.02      The Government which came to power in 1972 set economic diversifi-
cation, employment and redistribution of income as its priority goals. This
strategy created an atmosphere of uncertainty with the immediate result of
reduced investment activity by the private sector. The implementation of the
structural changes sought by the Government was further complicated by several
external and internal factors. The completion of a major investment cycle
in tourism and mining in the country, the increase in petroleum and other
commodity prices in late 1973 and the world recession of 1974-75, had serious
repercussions on the country's balance of payments. As a result of the ensuing
import restrictions, serious labor problems in some sectors, and the political
and economic uncertainty, private sector investment activity stagnated. The
situation was further aggravated by the migration of skilled manpower and the
massive outflow of private funds. In an effort to avoid unacceptably high
levels of unemployment, the Government undertook an expansion of public sector
activity in certain areas of investment which had hitherto been dominated by
the private sector. This expansion in public investment and employment
programs was not accompanied by an increase in public sector savings, with the
result that the overall financing deficit of the Central Government in 1976/77
amounted to 19.4% of GDP. Since this coincided with a modest reduction in
external capital inflows, there was unprecedented reliance on financing from
the banking system, equivalent to 12.1% of GDP. In 1976 real GDP declined
8.3%, and by the end of that year the economy was in the midst of a severe
fiscal and balance of payment crisis.



1.03      In early 1977 the Government began making concerted efforts to
alleviate the country's severe economic problems. The measures included a new
tax effort, a wages policy and exchange rate adjustments. A comprehensive
Government program adopted in July 1977 became the basis for agreement with
the IMF on a one year stand-by arrangement. This was replaced in May 1978 by a
three year Extendecd Fund Facility arrangement which permitted a longer period
for economic adjustment and provided a higher level of financial assistance
From the IMF.  The key elements of the first year of the program were a
flexible exchange rate policy, a strict incomes policy and a restrictive
fiscal policy. In addition, the program contained ceilings on net domestic
assets of the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ); limits on the authorization of new
foreign indebtedness by the public sector; targets for increases in the
international reserves; and provisions for orderly management of payment of
arrears. By April 1.979 the exchange rate and wage policies of the prior
year had restored Jamaica's export competitiveness and in May 1979 the monthly
mini-devaluations were suspended. Emphasis, instead, shifted towards preserv-
ing Jamaica's compe!titiveness through a more restrictive incomes policy backed
by appropriate monetary and fiscal policies.
1.04      While much progress was made between mid-1977 and mid-1979, much
remained to be accomplished when Jamaica was again adversely affected by the
increase in the int:ernational price of oil in 1979. Oil imports were reduced
from US$235 milliorn (31% of total imports) in 1977 to US$194 million (22% of
imports) in 1978, but then rose to US$335 million (33% of imports) in 1979,
and to an estimated US$440 million (38% of imports) in 1980. Furthermore,
the Government had failed in restoring confidence in its economic policies and
as a result private investment continued at a virtual stand-still and the out-
ward migration of professionals and skilled workers continued unabated. In
1979 real GDP decreased by 2.3%, making the cumulative drop since 1974 reach
about 16%, and preliminary estimates indicate that in 1980 there was a further
3.5% decrease. In the circumstances fiscal improvement was not achieved in
1979/80, when the current account deficit increased to 3.7% of GDP against
2.9% in 1978/79, a:Lthough the overall deficit was maintained at about 15% of
GDP.  The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments widened
from about US$114 million (4.2% of GDP) in 1978 to US$171 million (6.8% of
GDP) in 1979. The total value of imports increased by 16% to US$1,003 million,
with the increase resulting almost exclusively from the rise in the oil bill.
The value of total exports, however, increased by only 5% to US$770 million as
prices increased for all commodities but the volume performance of the major
export commodities was disappointing. Only non-traditional exports performed
reasonably well, wiLth their value increasing by 32% to US$95 million,
excluding petroleum products and re-exports (para. 2.09).

II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Performance, Role and Structure
2.01      For a developing country of just over two million inhabitants,
Jamaica has a relatively broad-based industrial sector which produces a wide
variety of manufactured products. The initial impetus for industrial develop-
ment derived from the demands of the sugar and bauxite/alumina sectors.
Subsequently, industrial production was stimulated by import substitution
policies that afforded the sector generous fiscal incentives and protection
against imported manufactured goods, first within the Jamaican market and
later within the Caribbean community. Through 1976 the manufacturing sector
grew more rapidly than the overall economy and by that year reached 18.5% of
GDP, compared to only 11.5% in 1950. Following the sharp deterioration of the
balance of payments in 1976, however, the manufacturing sector was hampered by
shortages of raw materials and spare parts, reduced consumer demand caused
by the general economic slowdown, and a virtual halt of investment activity of
the private sector due to the atmosphere of uncertainty. Consequently, sector
output declined at an average annual rate of 5.8% in real terms in the four
years through 1979, a much steeper decline than the 3.6% annual decrease in
GDP during that period. In 1979, manufacturing contributed only 16.3% to GDP,
and sector employment was 74,000 or 11% of the employed labor force, down from
a high of 81,000 in 1974 when it represented 13% of the employed labor force.
2.02      Development of the sector behind high protective barriers allowed
substantial diversification, with a wide variety of products being produced
locally despite the relatively small size of the Jamaican market. Sugar, rum
and molasses decreased from their prominent role of representing 28% of the
sector's value added in 1950 to a level of only 4.3% in 1979, and all food
processing, including sugar, decreased from 70% of the sector's output to only
38%. Reflecting the biases of import substitution oriented development
policies (paras. 2.03 to 2.07), the sector continues to be dominated by
consumer goods manufacturing, although during the last decade there have been
some marked shifts in the relative importance of some subsectors (Table 2.1).
There are several reasons for these shifts. Alcoholic beverages, tobacco
products, paper products, and chemicals, rubber and plastics increased their
share of the sector's output due mainly to strong export performance (para.
2.10). These subsectors, except tobacco products, are relatively high in
capital intensity and managed to retain some degree of competitiveness
despite increasing wage levels and growing overvaluation of the local cur-
rency. The export of tobacco products was strong mainly because of their
high imported raw material content and initially high profit margins. Furniture,
and machinery and metal products lost share of the sector's output despite
strong export performance. The sharp decrease in output of machinery and metal
products for the local market was a result of the marked slowdown in new
investments; and that of furniture reflected the end of the cycle in investments
in tourism infrastructure (para. 1.02), and after 1976, the contraction in
consumer demand that accompanied the Government's economic stabilization
programs. Finally, textiles and wearing apparel decreased in importance due



-4-
almost entirely to the closing down of many export oriented firms that had
been originally established to take advantage of the low wage rates that
prevailed in Jamaica until the early part of the decade (para. 2.10).

Industrial Incentives and Sector Characteristics
2.03      The current structure of Jamaica's manufacturing sector and its
characteristics are the result of incentive and trade policies which, since
the introduction inl 1956 of the Industrial Incentives Law, have been directed
at establishing and protecting domestic industry. The substantive elements of
the Incentives Law prevail to this day. They allow Jamaican manufacturers to
import capital goods, raw materials and intermediate goods without duty, and
further encourage the use of capital goods through generous tax write-offs
after a ten-year income tax holiday. The manufacturer is further protected
because when there is sufficient installed capacity to supply the domestic
market, imports have been excluded without any meaningful efficiency criteria
being applied. The current list of restricted imports includes 334 items,



of which 26 are raw materials and intermediate goods, 36 are capital goods,
and the balance consumer goods. In practice, the list is much larger because
some items are defined as broadly as "clothing--all types and materials."
2.04      The quantitative import restrictions have resulted in very high
effective levels of protection to domestic industry. Estimates developed in
1979 based on a survey of 71 firms indicate that effective protection levels
(excess of value added at domestic prices, including the effect of protection
on locally manufactured inputs, over value added at world prices) range from a
low of one percent for furniture, two percent for garments and 16% for jewelry,
to a high of 135% for electrical appliances and 219% for beverages. For the
sector as a whole the effective protection was estimated to average 68%.
Furthermore, it was found that those firms exporting to CARICOM enjoyed an
effective level of protection of, on average, 19%. In the presence of quanti-
tative restrictions tariffs have played a relatively small protectionist role.
In the past, tariffs in Jamaica have served primarily the revenue purpose.
However, with the exception of the beverages and tobacco category which has
a 115% tariff, the overall levels are rather moderate averaging only 22%, and
in recent years their role as a source of fiscal revenue has been significantly
reduced. In addition to the exemptions accorded under the industrial incen-
tives law, beginning in 1968 exemptions were also granted to imports from
CARICOM. At present, any manufacturing firm can import its inputs totally
exempt of tariff duties or any other tax, except those engaged in the manufac-
ture of tobacco products, alcoholic and soft beverages, and a few other
commodities not subject to internal taxes.
2.05      The industrialization policies and incentives have resulted in
significant distortions within the manufacturing sector. The system of
incentives encouraged the development of a mix of capital intensive industries,
and many so-called "screwdriver" industries, performing final assembly or
processing operations with very low domestic value added. Paradoxically, what
has happened is that the policy of import substitution through the encourage-
ment and protection of domestic industry, has resulted in the creation of a
highly import dependent manufacturing sector that is exacerbating, rather than
helping Jamaica's balance of payment's problem. By providing incentives in
the form of duty-free imports of intermediate goods, efforts to develop
backward linkages where comparative advantages might have existed, or developed,
were effectively discouraged. The 1979 survey of 71 manufacturing firms
indicates that direct raw material imports represent 43% of their gross sales.
Including indirect imports, the import content of domestic manufacturers
increases to about 50% of sales. Based on the data provided by the first 58
exporters to apply for Export Development Fund (para. 2.09) financing in 1981,
the direct import content of all goods manufactured by exporters, at 42%, is
about the same as for the sector as a whole (43%). For that portion of their
production which they export, however, the direct import content is 46%, and
over 50% when indirect imports are included. The higher than average import
content of nontraditional exports reflects the distortions created by the
industrialization policies. Because of the high cost structure of locally
manufactured goods, the magnitude of which is indicated by the estimates of



- 6 -
effective protection, products with a relatively lower content of local inputs
have been more able to compete outside of Jamaica, and in particular outside
of CARICOM. Also, to be competitive, most exports have had to be priced below
their local levels, which further increased their import content as a percent
of export sales. The exchange rate and wage policies of the last three years
have, however, increased the cost competitiveness of Jamaican products and
there has been a corresponding increase in private sector interest in production
for the export market of products with a higher local value added than was the
case in earlier years.
2.06      In itself the high import content of Jamaican manufacturers is
understandable given the limited natural resources of the country. However,
the duty-free import of capital goods and generous depreciation allowances
tended to promote the use of capital intensive technologies and the production
oQ capital intensive goods, while the protective barriers assured profits
without penalizing inefficiency. As a result of the marked bias favoring the
use of capital, Jamaica industry failed to absorb labor in proportion to the
country's factor endowments. During the last seven years, the political and
economic uncertainties that led to a sharp decrease of private investment
and that generally had the disastrous impact on the economy described in
Chapter I, had one unexpected positive side effect. They indirectly helped to
ameliorate the factor bias of the industrialization policies, as manufacturers
willing to invest have sought to reduce their capital exposure through labor
intensive investments, and a small scale indigenous industry appears to have
continued growing despite the general economic slowdown. Although there are
no reliable statistical data available on the subject, fragmentary data
from various sources seem to indicate that while overall sector employment
declined from 81,000 in 1974 to 74,000 in 1979, small scale firms (less than
10 workers) might ha-ve increased their contribution to employment by as much
as 8,000 new jobs.
2.07      The high levels of effective protection of the manufacturing sector
also reflect high profits, inefficiencies, cost penalties associated with
small-scale production, and unutilized capacity. Despite the limited size of
the Jamaican market, the generous industrialization incentives encouraged
investments to manufacture the vast majority of finished goods consumed
locally. The resulting industrial base is fragmented into many small and
inefficient producers, most of whom operate one shift producing a wide variety
of products in very short runs, and who rely on the high prices made possible
by the protective barriers to cover their high operating capital costs.  In
addition, the aforementioned survey of 71 firms indicates that the sector is
operating at about 60% of capacity on a one and a half shift basis. The low
utilization of capacity is due to the contraction of the local market; the
past inability of many firms to maintain or increase their export markets
because of the shortage of foreign exchange; and more recently their inability
to obtain foreign exchange to overhaul and modernize their capacity which for
many years was not properly maintained. The net effect of all of the foregoing
is a relatively high cost structure for Jamaican manufactured products, and
inordinately high profit margins per unit produced or invested, necessary to
obtain reasonable financial rates of return on investment.

Exports
2.08      In recent years exports of non-traditional manufactured goods have
represented 10% to 12% of total Jamaican merchandise exports (Table 2.2) 1/.
Bauxite and alumina exports have been and will continue to be for some time to
come the largest source of foreign exchange earnings. In an effort to
diversify its export base and generate new employment opportunities, however,
the Government has placed particular emphasis on increasing the export volume
of agricultural and manufactured goods in which the country has or can develop
a comparative advantage.

2.09      The performance of manufactured goods exports has been mixed.  They
increased from US$50 million in 1972 to US$73 million in 1976, or 10% yearly in
nominal terms, but then remained stagnant through 1978. The lack of growth
between 1976 and 1978 was due to many factors, but particularly to the over-

products, many of which represent incidental products of the refining

valuation of the Jamaican dollar, the substantial increase in wages during the
six years prior to 1978, and the shortage of foreign exchange which made it
difficult for exporters to obtain necessary imported inputs. In 1979, however,
manufactured exports increased 32% to US$95 million mainly as a result of
(i) the 96% adjustment in the exchange rate between April 1977 and May 1979;
(ii) the decrease in real wages brought about by the Government's economic
stabilization program; (iii) the granting of some incentives to exporters,
including priority consideration in the issuance of import licenses to manufac-
turers that received "Certified Exporter" status in early 1979; and (iv) the
assurance of foreign exchange availability for the import of inputs for
manufactured exports made possible by the creation of the Export Development
Fund (EDF), which was funded with the proceeds of Bank Loan 1715-JM approved
by the Board on May 30, 1979. In 1980, export growth slowed down to about
8-10% due to the further deterioration of the economic situation and political
climate, particularly after the previous Government discontinued negotiations
with the IMF in March., During the year manufacturers were plagued by
labor strikes, disrupt:ions in basic services such as power and transportation,
and an extreme shortage of foreign exchange. Although most exporters had
continued access to foreign exchange through the EDF, their performance was
seriously affected by the problems that afflicted the manufacturing sector as
a whole.
2.10      Between 1972 and 1978 there was a marked shift in the composition of
exporting firms and mtnufactured export goods. Beverages, tobacco products,
paper products, furniture, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, metal mechanics, and
mechanical and electrical equipment registered real growth, while textiles and
clothing suffered a substantial decline. The latter reflects the scope of
past exports incentives as well as the problems affecting the Jamaican economy
in the mid and late 1970s. The Export Industry Encouragement Law of 1956,
amended in 1960 and 1969, contained the same set of basic incentives as the
Industrial Incentives Law, but in addition provided exemptions from all
indirect taxes and made available benefits normally associated with free trade
zones to firms exporting 100% of their production volume to non-CARICOM
markets. This resulte!d in the establishment of some 150 so-called "export
enclave" firms performing assembly operations mostly in the garments field and
a few in electronics, sports equipment, toys, processed foods, and leather
goods. Because of the wage increases and overvaluation of the currency, by
1978 only 30 of these firms remained. The most affected subsector was textiles
and clothing, which decreased from 21% (US$10.4 million) of total manufactured
exports in 1972 to only 6% (US$4.4 million) by 1978. In 1979, there was a
notable recovery of this subsector as those 100% export firms that continued
operating in Jamaica responded to the currency devaluation and decrease in
real wages (Table 2.3).

2.11      Until 1979, practically all new Jamaican manufactured goods export
volume was to the protected CARICOM market. Between 1972-1978 exports to
CARICOM increased from US$17 million to US$39 million, while exports to the
rest of the world stagnated at US$33 million with only some changes in the mix
of products being exported. In 1979, exports to CARICOM further increased to
US$57 million, but exports to other markets increased to US$38 million,
exceeding for the first time in many years their prior year-s level in both
current and real terms (Annex 2, T-1). The increase in exports beyond
CARICOM is a positive sign. The CARICOM market is relatively small with a
population of about five million. For Jamaica to have a successful export
drive it must penetrate new markets outside of CARICOM. The growth of export
volume outside of CARICOM in 1979, was made possible by the increase in the
international competitiveness of Jamaican products that resulted from the wage
and exchange rate policy measures introduced in 1977 and 1978. Very important,
also, was the increased availability of foreign exchange provided by the EDF
to non-traditional exporters and a growing awareness of the Government and
private sector about the need for developing new markets beyond CARICOM. The
importance of this new export orientation cannot be overestimated. For at
least two decades Jamaican manufacturers had been accustomed to good profits
from sales volumes generated behind protective barriers, first in Jamaica, and
after 1969, in the CARICOM area. The success of Jamaica-s new export drive



- 10 -
will very much depend on the willingness and ability of both the Government
and the private sector to convert their newly acquired desire to export beyond
CARICOM into policy mneasures and actions -- investments in market development
and eventually new plant and equipment -- necessary to make the new exports
possible.
rofSpe ts
2.12       To achieve its economic development and growth plans the Government
has given high prior:ity to increasing exports of manufactured goods, and to
development of deepeir and wider linkages within the sector and with other
sectors to stimulate the economy and to reduce the import dependence of
manufacturing. In the short term -- two to three years -- if a continuous
and reliable source of foreign exchange is made available to exporters, which
is one of the main purposes of the proposed Bank loan, an annual export growth
near the 32% registered in 1979 can be sustained as exporters continue their
growth pattern in CARtICOM, and as they make wider and deeper inroads into the
new markets beyond CiaICOM which they began penetrating in 1979. Also, in the
very short term, those domestic manufacturers who previously enjoyed high
profit margins, or whose marginal cost of production does not exceed the world
price of the products concerned, will be able to utilize some of their idle
capacity for the export market. With renewed confidence in the Government
that was elected to office on October 30, 1980, exporters are projecting
substantial growth for 1981. Thirty eight exporters that had applied for
1981 EDF preliminary commitments as of year-end 1980, and that accounted
for 39% of 1979 exports, were projecting for 1981 an increase of about 70/.
over their 1979 export levels, and of about 55% over those for 1980. It is
probable that the unusually large increase for 1981 is in large part due to
the recovery of export sales lost during 1980, and that the same increase
could not be expected in 1982. It is nevertheless indicative of what exporters
believe they can achieve when internal circumstances are favorable to their
efforts.
2.13       Exporters have indicated that the major constraint to achieving
their 1981 export targets could be availability of foreign exchange. Beyond
that required for their imported raw materials and intermediate goods, a
survey of 47 exporters showed that as much as US$20 million would be immediately
required by the sector for equipment replacements. These would permit over-
hauling existing plant and equipment to allow production at the rated manufac-
turing capacity. Also, it would make possible some modernization to make
selected products more competitive in international markets. Finally, it would
permit some upgrading of quality to the standards of markets beyond CARICOM.
2.14       However, to achieve a sustained 25% to 35% yearly  growth beyond
1982, or above levels of about US$250 to US$300 million, important changes to the
industrial infrastructure and incentive system will be required. During the
next two years it will be necessary to improve significantly the cost compet-
itiveness of Jamaican products with a comparative advantage outside of CARICOM,
and to develop the marketing knowhow and managerial drive, particularly in
the sales area, necessary to penetrate new international markets. This task
will require, among others, the following changes: (i) adjustments in export



- 11 -
promotion and import substitution policies to redress the imbalances in
incentives which favor import substitution and production for the local and
CARICOM markets over exports to international markets; (ii) expansion of
the exportable product mix by better identification of the country's compara-
tive advantages, and strengthening and improved targeting of the programs
developed during the past two years to promote production of goods that
are competitive outside of CARICOM; (iii) investment in new plant and equipment
for products with a comparative advantage, particularly outside of CARICOM;
(iv) expansion and training of the existing managerial pool, particularly in
the fields of export marketing, cost accounting and industrial engineering;
and (v) further reorientation of the private sector, which to date has been
accustomed to relatively well protected low volume and high margin sales, to
larger volume cost efficient production for the export market.  The Government
shares these views and is in the process of developing export promotion programs
to address these issues.
Policies and Incentives
2.15      The new Government is keenly aware, as was the previous Government,
of the sectoral requirements for rapid short-term export gains and sustained
long-term export development. During the last three years the previous Govern-
ment took a number of substantive steps designed to support its export promotion
policy, and entered into a continuing dialogue with the private sector to
assure that new policies were compatible with the needs of exporters.  The
most significant short-term steps taken were the adoption of realistic exchange
rate and wage policies. Also, the Jamaica National Export Corporation
(JNEC), which provides export marketing services to local firms in the private
sector, was restructured and substantially strengthened. Under JNEC, the
Jamaica Export Trading Company was formed to locate export markets and provide
sales services to new exporters and to small-scale enterprises; the Trade
Commissioner Service was strengthened and now has marketing officers based in
Brussels, London, Toronto, New York and Port of Spain; and product design,
production, quality control, and shipping technical assistance is now being
provided to local manufacturers by a growing group of specialists hired for
the purpose by JNEC. A component of Bank Loan 1715-JM, which helped create
the EDF, contained funds that were utilized to provide JNEC with technical
assistance to review its rapidly expanding operations and further strengthen
its internal and delivery capabilities (para. 4.08).
2.16      The Government is particularly committed to the development
of small-scale enterprise as a means of increasing production and employment,
and developing more labor-intensive exports and further backward linkages.
The Bank has been working closely with Jamaican officials in this area and
is providing direct assistance under the Small Scale Enterprise Loan
(No. 1609-JM) approved by the Board in July 1978. The development of the
Kingston Free Zone has also been expedited to attract foreign investors and
subcontracting operations. A proposed Bank loan to help finance the expansion
of the Free Zone is scheduled for presentation to the Executive Directors in
mid-1981. Jamaica has unique comparative advantages for these types of
industries, which have the potential of creating a substantial number of new
employment opportunities, as illustrated by the large number of export enclave



- 12 -
firms that operated in the country prior to 1973. With the restoration of
internationally competitive wage levels and its announced intention to maintain
its export competit`iveness, Jamaica hopes to recover many of the industries it
lost. In this respect, it is noted that considerable interest has been
expressed by international investors ready to utilize the new Kingston Free
Zone's facilities as they become available.
2.17      A major constraint for exporting over the last four years has been
the uncertain availability of foreign exchange. Accordingly, the Government,
working closely with the private sector, adopted early in 1979, a Certified
Exporter Status scheme which helped provide foreign exchange on a priority
basis through the ED)F to certified exporters for necessary imports, expedite
the import-licensing process and confer certain other benefits. More important,
the creation in May 1979 of the EDF with the proceeds of Bank loan 1715-JM
helped assure a conl:inuing availability of foreign exchange for the imported
inputs of exporters of manufactured goods. A number of criteria for determin-
ing eligibility were set forth. In general, the criteria were designed to
assure that the exporter is a bona fide exporter, with either a record of
performance, or a credible plan for future performance; that the firm is
capable of expanding exports in coming years sufficiently to help meet an
overall non-traditional exports growth target of at least 25% yearly; and
that there is a net foreign exchange gain to the country resulting from the
export sales. The new Government and private sector are very satisfied with
the results of the Certified Export Status scheme and of the EDF, and consider
the proposed additional funding of the EDF of paramount importance to meet the
short-term export targets of the sector and to establish a base from which to
continue working on development of a long-term export base.
2.18      In 1978 the Special Export Incentive Scheme was enacted under the
CARICOM Harmonization of Fiscal Incentives Program. This is a partial income
tax credit provision, with 10 years duration, to provide incentives for export
sales outside CARICOM to firms not benefiting from tax holidays provided by
previous incentives laws. The amount of the tax credit increases up to a
maximum of 50% of the export profits of firms who export 60% or more of their
total sales. Because the tax credit is applied specifically to the earnings
of export sales it will prove difficult to administer. Furthermore, many
existing and potential new exporters are or will be exporting at the margin at
least until their products become well established in foreign markets and
local manufacturing becomes more efficient. The Special Export Incentive
Scheme will thus be of limited, if any, value in providing new incentives to
exports. The new Government has agreed that a more effective incentive has
to be provided, particularly in the short-term, and is evaluating various
alternatives in consultation with Bank staff.
2.19      In conjunction with Loan 1715-JM the Government undertook to review
and to develop a program and schedule for making any necessary modifications
to the existing industrial development policies and administrative procedures.
The objective was to redress the imbalance in incentives offered producers
for the domestic market and those offered producers for export, and to eli-
minate those incentives that favored capital intensity and kept adequate
backward linkages with the rest of the economy from developing. In November
1979, preliminary proposals were completed and presented to the Bank for
review. These focussed on short-term export incentives, and it was agreed



- 13 -
that more substantive proposals would be developed in early 1980. Soon
thereafter the Government discontinued negotiations with the DIF and called
for early elections in which an alternative economic program would be a major
issue. In the process the task force which had been reviewing industrial
incentives shifted its work towards the development of the alternative to
the IMF, and no further work was done on the program to modify existing
industrial policies.
2.20      The new Government is aware that achievement of its objectives
for increasing manufactured goods exports will depend on modifying indus-
trial policies and redressing the imbalance in incentives offered producers
for the domestic market and those offered producers for export. The action
taken in this area cannot be precipitious. Manufacturers for the domestic
market are important employers of labor, and the current high unemployment
rate would make it difficult to take actions which would result in further
layoffs. Also, to the extent that incentives are changed through tax measures,
or the payment of cash subsidies, the revenue implications would have to be
consistent with the Government's overall economic program. The Government
has, however, stated its intention to develop in consultation with the Bank
a reform package and a timetable for the implementation of the new policy
measures. Bank staff is working closely with the Government on this matter
in the context of the ongoing dialogue about the new medium- and long-term
economic development program that the Government is in the process of pre-
paring. Also, at the request of the Government a portion of the technical
assistance funds available under Loan 1715-JM have been reallocated to cover
the expenses of internationally recruited experts to assist in the develop-
ment of the industrial reform package. During negotiations it was agreed
that the Government would submit to the Bank the results of the study that
will be prepared by the consultants now being engaged, and to consult with
the Bank by no later than July 31, 1981, on a specific program of action
for the implementation of industrial reforms.
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Background
3.01      Jamaica has a well developed financial system based on the British
model and whose assets are dominated by the commercial banking system (Table
3.1). The system includes a central bank, commercial banks, merchant banks,
building societies, a development bank, trust companies, insurance companies,
and two specialized institutions for small business financing. Jamaica also
has a small securities exchange which, although growing, does not yet play a
significant role in the mobilization of financial resources.

The Bank of Jamaica
3.02      Established in 1960, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) regulates money
supply, credit, and the operations of all financial intermediaries, and
manages international reserves. Beyond its normal central banking role, the
BOJ has been successful in promoting the establishment of locally owned
financial institutions to serve specialized functions such as export credit
insurance, mortgage banking, unit trusts, and development banking. After the
major economic crisis of 1976 (para. 1.02), the BOJ took an increasingly
active role in assuring the availability of foreign exchange credit to the
industrial sector, particularly through specialized financial services that
could help generate new exports. These services it provides through three
subsidiaries. The Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC) sells
export insurance, administers three BOJ funds which provide pre- and post-
shipment local currency financing and operates ten supplier lines of credit
from seven countries (para. 4.05). The Export Development Fund makes
available foreign exchange financing for the necessary imported inputs of
non-traditional manufactured goods. Finally, the Premier Investment Company
(PIC) provides term loans to small scale enterprises and administers a credit
guarantee scheme. Foreign exchange financing of PIC is supported by Bank loan
1609-JM approved by the Board on July 6, 1978.
Commercial Banks
3.03      As of December 31, 1979, eight commercial banks with about 150 branch
offices throughout the country had combined total assets of J$1,644 billion,
or 66.4% of the total assets of the major financial institutions (excluding
insurance companies). Most banks were foreign owned until late 1977 when the
Government acquired Barclays Bank of Jamaica and renamed it the National
Commercial Bank (NCE). Subsequently, NCB acquired the Bank of Montreal of
Jamaica and branches of First National Bank of Chicago, which decided to
discontinue its banking business in Jamaica. With its recent acquisitions,
NCB has become the second largest commercial bank with about one third of the
commercial banking system's assets and deposits (Table 3.2). In 1980, the
Life of Jamaica, a locally owned insurance company, acquired the Jamaica
Citizens Bank from Citizens Bank of Atlanta. Between year-end 1975 and



- 15 -
September 30, 1980 deposits in commercial banks increased about 12% yearly,
while lending operations increased only about 10% yearly. Both declined in
real terms during the period, and the lag between lending operations and
deposits has led to excess liquidity. During the five years the proportion of
the various type of deposits in the commercial banking system remained fairly
constant, with about one-fourth in demand deposits, another fourth in time
deposits, and one-half in savings deposits.

3.04      Because of the inability of the Government to mobilize sufficient
foreign resources with which to finance its large budgetary deficits (paras.
1.02 to 1.04), since 1975 an increasing share of commercial bank credit has
been to the public sector. At year-end 1975, 13% of the J$775 million total
credits outstanding of commercial banks were to the Government, and by June 30,
1980, the Government's share had increased to 40% of the J$1,301 million then
outstanding. Of the loans outstanding to the private sector as of June 30,
1980, manufacturing had received the largest share (20%), followed by personal
loans (18%), construction (14%), and agriculture (10%). Between December 1975
and June 1980 manufacturing increased its share of private sector credit by
about 3 percentage points, while construction lost 6 points and personal
loans 2 points. The reduced demand for construction and personal credit was
a direct result of the decline in investment activity and of the Government's
programs to control consumer demand and inflation. A substantial part of the
increase in credit to the manufacturing sector took place during late 1979 and
the first half of 1980, and there is some evidence to suggest that this was
due to the increased activity of exporting firms that had access to the EDF's
foreign exchange.
3.05      The nominal lending rates of the commercial banks have been negative
in recent years (Table 3.3). In January 1980, the commercial prime lending
rate increased from 11% to 13% when the BOJ raised its discount rate from 7%
to 9%. Generally, commercial banks add some 2.5% to 3% to the prime and
recent commercial lending rates have been about 16%. The actual or effective



- 16 -
rate paid by borrowers is much higher as most banks add service charges,
collect interest in advance, and require compensatory balances. However, with
inflation of 47% in 1978, 22% in 1979, and about 30% last year, it is doubtful
that during that period any borrowers actually paid positive rates in real
terms. Most commercial banks provide only short-term loans but generally
allow a rollover after yearly reviews. Some commercial banks also provide
term loans (up to five years), but usually only to their more select and
creditworthy clients.

The Jamaica Development Bank
3.06      The Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) was established by the Government
in 1969 to foster the development of the industrial, agricultural and tourism
sectors. During the early 1970s, it expanded its operations quite rapidly,
but since 1976 it has been facing severe financial and managerial problems due
to the economic recession and mismanagement. At year-end 1979 it had total
assets of J$159.3 mi-Llion, including a loan portfolio of J$115.7 million,
foreign liabilities of J$60.5 million, and share capital of J$34.3 million.
By sector its loan portfolio was 52% in industry, 24% in agriculture, and 16%
in tourism, with the balance in various other sectors. JDB's lending oper-
ations declined from J$28.1 million in 1976 to J$8.2 million in 1978. Since
most JDB resources were traditionally obtained from foreign currency loans,
its lending was also in foreign exchange, and after the first devaluation of
the Jamaican dollar in 1977 its borrowers were no longer willing to accept
exchange risks.  In July, 1979, the Government agreed to bear the foreign
exchange risk for a fee that ranged from 1.5% to 2% depending on the activity
of the borrower. Consequently, JDB's operations increased to J$19.0 million
in 1979 and to J$27.7 million during the first eleven months of 1980. The new
management that took over in 1978 was faced with a financially troubled
institution with over 90% of its clients in arrears.  For two years the
institution managed ito stay afloat only through capital increases and loans
from the BOJ. One result is that JDB has drastically cut back on its small
loans to agriculture where it was facing its biggest problems. During the
last two years practically all loans have been to industry where JDB has been



- 17 -
concentrating its lending to export oriented or efficient import substituting
enterprises. The average loan size has increased from about J$95,000 in 1976
when JDB made 295 loans, to about J$900,000 in 1980 when only 31 loans were
made through November.
Small Scale Enterprise Financing
3.07      Term lending to SSE is done by the Premier Investment Corporation
(PIC) and the Small Industries Finance Corporation (SIFCO). PIC, which was
established in 1978 with funds provided by Bank loan 1609-JM, lends through
commercial banks to enterprises with net fixed assets (excluding land and
buildings) of up to US$100,000 equivalent prior to applying for a subloan.
PIC has already fully committed the US$5.5 million allocated to it under Loan
1609-JM, and a new Bank supported SSE project is currently under consideration.
SIFCO was established in August 1980, through the merger of the Development
Venture Capital Finance Limited, which had been implementing the employment
generation component of Loan 1003-JM, a Sites and Services Project approved
in 1974, and the Small Enterprise Development Corporation, which had been
implementing a component for lending to very small enterprises under
Loan 1609-JM. After the merger, the combined assets of SIFCO were about
US$4.8 million, including liabilities of US$2.6 million. Together, PIC and
SIFCO have been covering the term financing needs of small and very small
enterprises quite successfully.
IV. PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS
4.01      Under the proposed project the existing institutional arrangements
would be continued. Exporters would be financed by commercial banks who upon
lending and arranging for payment of overseas obligations would apply for
foreign exchange cover with the Export Development Fund. The Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC) would administer the EDF as well as
provide other financial services to exporters. The Jamaica National Export
Corporation (JNEC) would continue providing technical assistance in export
marketing to EDF clients and to manufacturers in general that are considering
entry into export markets.
The Export Development Fund
4.02      The EDF was established on May 9, 1979, as a subsidiary of the Bank
of Jamaica and began operations during September. Its main purpose is to make
available foreign exchange for the import content of non-traditional exports.
In the case of exporters who are net earners of foreign exchange the EDF will
also make available the foreign exchange required for manufactures for the
local market. The foreign exchange is made available to exporters through
commercial banks which provide import financing through US$ denominated loans
which are then, at time of payment overseas by the commercial banks' corre-
spondents, discounted with the EDF. The cycle is closed and the obligations
to the EDF repaid, through the commercial banks, at the time that exporters
receive payment from their overseas clients. The resources of the EDF include



- 18 -
US$30 million out of Bank Loan 1715-JM, which have been fully disbursed,
and US$7.5 million from an IDB loan approved by that institution in November,
1979. The EDF was also able to negotiate with Royal Bank of Canada a US$5
million overdraft facility at that bank's New York office, which has been used
mainly for bridge financing between EDF disbursement and Bank reimbursement.
4.03       In 1980 the EDF received US$69.6 million in applications for
preliminary commitments of which eventually US$49.6 million were approved,
equivalent to the theoretical financing capacity of the EDF on the assumption
that its resources would turn around every nine months 1/. Through December 31,
1980, US$45.2 million (including a US$5.5 million carryover from 1979) of
preliminary commitments had been converted into final commitments, which in
theory are firm purchase orders placed by exporters with their suppliers. As
of that date cumulative disbursements by the EDF stood at US$25.1 million and
repayments at US$10.6 million. Thus, at the end of December, US$20.1 million
of final commitments remained undisbursed. All of these final commitments
should be disbursed sometime in early 1981. Through December, 1980, a
total of 80 exporters, representing about 75% of the 1979 export volume of
non-traditional goods, had made use of EDF resources.
4.04      The EDF has a nine-member Board of Directors, including representa-
tives of the BOJ, the ministries of Finance, of Industry, and of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, and of the private manufacturing and commercial banking
sectors. The Board of Directors is the EDF's highest authority, and played
a key role during the last eighteen months, first in guiding the EDF's
implementation and first months' operations and then in assuring that it was
not distracted or diverted from its purpose and functions by the political
and economic events of the past year. The EDF's operating policies, which
were developed in conjunction with Loan 1715-JM and form part of that loan
agreement, remain unchanged, except as noted where appropriate in Chapter V of
this report, and would continue to govern the operations of the EDF under the
proposed Bank loan. The external auditors of the EDF were selected after Bank
review. Because the only audit so far made of the EDF was for a short fiscal
year with practically no operations, a full evaluation of the external auditor's
performance has not yet been possible. Having no staff of its own, the EDF is
administered by the Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation.
The Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation
4.05      JECIC has considerable experience in import and export financing
operations. In addition to its normal export insurance operations, which were
initiated in 1971, JECIC administers three relatively small local currency
pre- and post-shipment financing funds, and ten supplier lines of credit from
seven countries. As of July 31, 1980, JECIC had total assets of US$41 million,
including US$31 million disbursed from the US$71 million available to it in
supplier lines of credit. Including all disbursed and undisbursed funds from
the supplier lines of credit and the loans to the EDF, in August, 1980, JECIC
was managing resources totalling about US$121 million in various currencies.
JECIC's organization includes a Managing Director, a Deputy Managing Director
1/   In practice the EDF is being repaid in about 8 months so that in
restrospect it would have been possible to support during 1980 a demand
of US$56.3 million.



- 19 -
responsible solely for EDF operations, and five section chiefs, two of which
deal only with the EDF. Total staff numbers 55 and includes 39 professionals
of which 16 are assigned full-time to EDF operations.
4.06      In the two years since the EDF was established, JECIC has matured
substantially. During that time it has, with the assistance of consulting
services and an internationally recruited expert, both financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan 1715-JM, restructured its organization, responsibilities
and workloads, updated most of its policies, procedures and operating manuals,
and undertaken considerable training activities.  JECIC's institution building
activities are still in progress, and the proposed Bank loan includes US$300,000
for technical assistance that would cover: further training activities;
acquisition of an electronic data processing system for its accounting
function and that of the EDF's operations; and development and implementation
of a management control, information and performance evaluation system.
Acquisition, development and implementation of the latter two by September 30,
1981, was agreed upon during negotiations. In addition, and to improve commu-
nications with and be more responsive to the needs of the private export
sector, a Technical Committee to JECIC and the EDF would be created by
no later than July 31, 1981. Its composition would include key managers of
JECIC and representatives of the private manufacturing and commercial banking
sectors.
The Jamaica National Export Corporation
4.07      JNEC was created in 1969 under the M4inistry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade. Its basic objective is to promote exports, which, during its early
years, it did mostly through trade fairs and missions, and by collecting and
supplying to exporters basic trade information. In 1977 JNEC's activities
were expanded to help implement Government policies designed to result in
export led economic growth. As a consequence, JNEC became involved in assist-
ing exporters with overseas market research, product development, quality
control, production and shipping, and placed greater emphasis on exporter
training activities. Also in 1977, JNTEC formed the Jamaica Export Trading
Company (JETCO) to locate export markets and provide sales services to new
exporters, particularly small farmers and small scale enterprises whose size
does not permit efficient independent access to international markets.
During the ten months ended October 31, 1980, JETCO exported to 28 countries
goods with an f.o.b. value of US$8.3 million, including spices (45%), fresh
citrus fruits (16%), crafts (15%), and garments (10%).
4.08      To handle more effectively its wider scope of activities in 1979
JNEC commissioned an extensive study to determine more clearly the needs of
exporters and the best methods of delivering the assistance they require; and,
in this context, to review JNEC's own operations, establish priorities for
its activities, and strengthen its organizational structure, personnel and
procedures.  The study and the subsequent implementation of its recommendations
were and continue to be financed from the proceeds of Bank loan 1715-JM. JNEC,
excluding JETCO which operates as a separate subsidiary, is now organized
along five functional lines including development services, which are mostly
product development, package design and quality control oriented; promotional



- 20 -
services to assist exporters in the design and supervision of their overseas
promotional activities; overseas market services, dealing mostly with the
acquisition and dissenlination of informatiorn; market research services; and
administrative and support services. Furthermore, to improve the use of the
resources available to it, JNEC adopted a system of program budgeting wherein
all expenditures and activities are approved only if they will assist in the
furtherance of specific program objectives, and performance is measured
against the attainment: of those objectives. JNEC has a total staff of 71 of
which 32 are professionals. In addition, JNEC has the full time services
of 8 internationally recruited experts which provide specialized technical
assistance to exporters in areas such as furniture manufacturing to export
standards, quality control of processed foods, and the like.
4.09      Funds from Bank Loan 1715-JM are also being utilized by JNEC to
help strengthen the quality control capabilities of exporters, particularly
exporters of fresh and processed foods and furniture; and to finance compre-
hensive research of fresh and processed foods markets in selected cities
overseas. It is expected that the market research will help exporters identify
more clearly the characteristics of fresh and processed foods most in demand,
their required qualities and packaging, and the prevailing systems of distri-
bution, and that it will open direct lines of communication between Jamaican
exporters and potential foreign buyers. The proposed Bank loan includes
US$700,000 for technical assistance to JNEC, which would allow it to continue
the programs initiated with Bank Loan 1715-JM funds.  The additional technical
assistance funds would be used to help implement the recommendations, as they
evolve, of the market research currently underway, and tentatively and subject
to ongoing detailed review by Bank staff, to expand that research to other
markets and subsectors such as furniture, garments, or crafts, and to help
implement the recommer.dations that would evolve from the additional research.
V. T'HE PROJECT AND PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Loan Amount and Objectives
5.01      A loan of US$37 million equivalent is proposed.  Twenty-six million
would be used to increase the resources of the EDF for its current short-term
financing of imports required by exporters; twenty-two million of this component
would be used for imports of raw materials, intermediate goods, packaging mate-
rials and spare parts for producers of non-traditional manufactured exports and
their domestic suppliers, and four million would be used to finance imports of
recurrent inputs required for the cultivation, harvesting, handling and
packaging of bananas for export. Ten million would be used to open a new EDF
window for medium term financing of permanent working capital and equipment
required by exporters of non-traditional goods to attain their presently
installed rated production capacity. The remaining one million of loan funds
would be used for technical assistance to further strengthen the institutional
and delivery capabilities of JECIC (para. 4.06) and JNEC (para. 4.09).



- 21 -
5.02      The project would be expected to support the current export drive
and long-term development of the country's non-traditional exports by:
assuring a continued availability of foreign exchange to meet the import
requirements of non-traditional exporters; allowing a better utilization
of the presently installed manufacturing capacity; complementing the export
development policies that the new Government intends to put in place
(para. 2.20); helping rehabilitate the banana industry; and strengthening
the institutional infrastructure that provides support to exporters,
including assistance to small scale enterprises to find access to export
markets. The foreign exchange shortages of the last several years resulted in
periods when not even assurances could be given by the Government as to when
foreign exchange might be made available to exporters. Under these circum-
stances exporters could not prepare and execute long term production, invest-
ment and export plans.  The growth of non-traditional exports and the needed
recovery of banana production was thus limited by a scarcity of foreign
exchange. The assurance of foreign exchange availability that the EDF provides
has ameliorated some of these problems and should help overcome them entirely
with the additional funding. The project would thus also encourage new
investments for export market development, for modernization of existing
capacity, and for new plant and equipment.
Utilization of Loan Resources
5.03      To support projected export levels of manufactured goods of US$160
million in 1981 and US$208 million in 1982 (para 2.12), it is estimated that
demand for EDF resources for current imports of raw materials, intermediate
goods, packaging materials and spare parts could reach as much as US$80 mil-
lion in 1981 and US$104 million in 1982, including imports for local market
sales of exporters that are net earners of foreign exchange. To meet this
demand the EDF would have average resources of US$61.6 million in 1981 and
US$64.4 million in 1982, including the original Bank and IDB loans (US$37.5
million), the additional US$22 million under the short-term import operations
component for nontraditional exporters of the proposed loan, and retained
earnings. Because there is normally a lag of about four months between the
time an import order is placed and payment for it is made, and the EDF's
resources turn around about 1.5 times a year (eight month export cycle), these
resources should prove sufficient to cover the requirements of exporters of
manufactured goods through 1982. Annex 2, T-2 shows actual operations in 1980
and operating projections through December 1982, based on the resources
currently available to the EDF. The US$22 million included in the proposed
loan to support exports of manufactured goods would cover the shortfall
indicated in those projections, and would in addition provide through 1982 the
minimum two week cash reserve required to meet random month-to-month fluctua-
tions in demand. Continued successful operations of the EDF would also be
expected to encourage foreign suppliers, overseas confirming houses and
foreign commercial banks to reinstate short-term credit lines to help finance
the import requirements of Jamaican exporters.
5.04      Because of Jamaica's very tight foreign exchange situation, during
the last four years suppliers' open account, and sight drafts and other
acceptances, which at one time provided as much as 85% of all import financing
and were normally for terms ranging from 90 to 180 days, were replaced by



-- 22 -
commercial banks' letters of credit wherein the commercial bank assumed the
foreign exchange obligation to the overseas supplier. However, because
Jamaica's foreign exchange situation deteriorated and commercial banks had
difficulties in obtaining cover from the Bank of Jamaica, they limited the
amount of letter of credit operations and reduced their terms to 30 to 90
days.  At the time of its creation, the strong financial position of the EDF
coupled with the provisions for its replenishment through hard currency
repayments and its conservative but effective management, made it possible for
the EDF to de facto guarantee the cover of letters of credit and other supplier
import financing extended to EDF users.  Thus, when the EDF initiated operations
many exporters were able to negotiate better terms from suppliers or other
sources of overseas credit, and foreign commercial banks operating in Jamaica
were observed to increase their letter of credit exposure and terms with the
only proviso that the additional financing thus made available be used by
qualified EDF users and be supported by EDF commitments to provide the required
foreign exchange. Unfortunately, the progress made in late 1979 and early
1980 in developing new sources of commercial import financing came to a halt
as the economic situation and political climate continued to deteriorate
during 1980. Recently, however, there has been a renewed interest by foreign
commercial creditors and suppliers to discuss new financing and improved terms
for Jamaican manufacturers that have access to the resources of the EDF and
thereby to its de facto guarantee of cover of foreign exchange obligations.
5.05      The new resources of the proposed loan should further strengthen
the EDF's guaranteed cover feature. To the extent that this feature would
allow exporters to niegotiate better terms abroad, the availability of foreign
exchange to the sector would be expanded and the EDF's resources could be
utilized to support a larger volume of imports. If the EDF is very successful
in assisting exporters to generate additional overseas financing with improved
terms, the disbursement of the short-term import operations component of
the proposed loan might take some more time than presently envisaged. 1/
1/   Two other factors which may affect the demand for short-term EDF resources
are "retained accounts" and "no-funds" import licenses. Since last year
the BOJ has been allowing certain exporters that are net earners of foreign
exchange to retain the foreign exchange they require for their operations.
Exporters with retained accounts are freed from many bureaucratic require-
ments and procedures, but the retained foreign exchange is normally held
overseas.  Because exporters are continuously using these funds to pay
for imports, their overseas balances of foreign exchange are presumably
very small. Nevertheless, these balances are not available to others in
Jamaica and the BOJ is therefore currently reviewing the advantages and
disadvantages of retained accounts. "No-funds" import licenses have been
normally granted for imports whose payment does not create a foreign ex-
change obligation for the country. Continuation of this facility, or any
substitute for it, and the use of it by nontraditional exporters could also
have an effect on the demand for EDF resources. At this time it is not
foreseen that retained accounts and no-funds imports will affect importantly
the demand for EDF resources. They nevertheless warrant careful monitoring
to determine the extent to which they affect demand for EDF resources, and
to determine any modifications to the EDF's procedures that may be
required to make its operations compatible with the new environment in
which it would then operate.



- 23 -
Accordingly, during project execution the evolution of the factors that could
affect the resources required by the EDF for short-term import operations,
including the optimum level of cash reserves necessary to meet random month-to-
month fluctuations in demand, would be carefully monitored, and reallocation
of loan funds made, as required, to the permanent working capital and equipment
replacements component of the proposed loan.
5.06      During appraisal of the proposed loan it was determined that to be
able to fully utilize their currently installed manufacturing capacity, many
exporters would have to overhaul their existing capacity to break bottlenecks,
improve efficiency or meet changing product quality standards in international
markets. In addition, many exporters would require longer term financing than
that available under the short-term window of the EDF to allow them to carry
larger inventories of raw materials, intermediate goods, packaging materials
and spare parts with which to support the new levels of export sales they
expect to reach with their currently unutilized capacity. Based on the
projected increase in export volumes for 1981 and 1982, it is estimated that
up to US$10 million in additional permanent working capital could be required
in each year to carry inventories of raw materials, intermediate goods,
packaging materials and spare parts. In addition, a survey of 47 major
exporters indicated that the sector may require as much as US$20 million for
capital equipment replacements during the coming 12 to 18 months (para. 2.13).
Thus, the proposed US$10 million component for medium-term financing would
only cover about 25% of the potential needs. Some firms, however, were
negotiating supplier credits for their equipment needs and indicated to the
appraisal mission that they were confident of obtaining some resources in that
manner. For permanent working capital it is likely that some firms will
prefer rolling over short term obligations with their local commercial banks
while using the short-term financing window of the EDF to finance their
imports. Any further resources required beyond the US$10 million could be met
from the short-term import operations component should additional commercial
overseas credit allow the EDF to operate with a lower level of resources for
that component (para. 5.05), or as part of a possible project to provide
long-term financing for export oriented industrial development currently
being evaluated by Bank staff.
5.07      The US$4.0 million for imported inputs for banana production would
help realize the considerable potential for a quick recovery of banana exports.
After having reached a peak of 200,000 tons in 1966, the volume of banana
exports steadily declined to about 70,000 tons by 1974. During 1974-79 exports
fluctuated between 65,000 and 75,000 tons yearly, but in 1980 further declined
by more than 50% as a result of hurricane Allen, which hit the country with
devastating effects in August 1980. Present export levels are far below
Jamaica's quota of 150,000 tons p.a. in the protected U.K. market, and failure
to expand banana exports quickly may lead to a reduction of this quota.
The lack of foreign exchange for crucial imported inputs is the main factor
now limiting the recovery of banana production and exports. Emergency relief
provided by bilateral donors after hurricane Allen is being used to finance
fertilizer imports. With the proposed loan funds for banana production the
EDF would initially finance other imports required for cultivation, harvesting,
packaging and handling. It is expected that with adequate foreign exchange
availability the volume of banana exports could be tripled in about three to
four years from their 1980 level of only 31,000 tons, and foreign exchange
earnings increased from about US$11 million in 1980 to about US$40 million by



- 24
1983-84. Since nearly two-thirds of total acreage is cultivated by 25,000
small farmers on lots of five acres or less, the recovery of the industry
would have significant positive social effects in addition to its impact on
the balance of payments.
Loan and Onlending Terms, Conditions and Procedures
5.08      The proposed US$37 million equivalent loan would be made to the
Glovernment of Jamaica for 17 years, including four years of grace, at a 9.6%
p.a. interest rate. The Government would onlend $36 million in US dollars to
the EDF on the same terms and conditions as those of the proposed Bank loan
plus a 1% p.a. fee to cover the cross-currency exchange risk against the US
dollar. The signing of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank
would be a condition of loan effectiveness. Section 3.03 of Loan Agreement No.
1715-JM of June 8, 1979, which requires that the Government assure that the
EDF is maintained fcr at least five years (through May 9, 1984), would be
extended for another three years.  Tn connection with the proposed loan the
Government has further agreed that if at any time during the next six years
or thereafter it shall become apparent that the financial and foreign exchange
needs of non-traditional exporters of manufactured goods, or the foreign
exchange situation of the country, have changed sufficiently to require
modifications to the purpose for which funds were originally made available
to the EDF, such modifications would be made consistent with the objective of
promoting Jamaican exports in ways acceptable to the Bank.
5.09      Short-Term Import Operations.  The EDF would continue its current
and very successful program of short-term import operations with borrowed
resources increased to US$63.5 million (para. 5.03). Exporters and their
local suppliers would receive financing for the direct import content of
exports or of local sales to exporters, but those exporters who are net
earners of foreign exchange would receive financing for all of their imports.
All imports for banana production would be handled by The Banana Company
of Jamaica Limited, a public company, which would be subject to the same
terms, conditions and procedures that apply to any other eligible EDF user
under the short-term import operations component of the proposed loan.
Loans denominated in Jamaican dollars indexed to the US dollar would be made
by commercial banks to eligible exporters and discounted by the EDF with full
recourse to the commercial bank. Repayment would be in the currency earned
from export sales. Thus, commercial banks would assume the credit risk and
borrowers the US dollar exchange risk, while the EDF would discount the loans
and guarantee their convertibility into US dollars. The only substantive
change to the existing policies and procedures would be to allow exporters the
option of buying US dollars from the EDF instead of being limited, as they now
are, to obtaining their foreign exchange needs through the above financing
scheme. Under said option exporters would undertake to sell back to the EDF
from their export earnings sufficient currencies to cover both the amount of
US dollars they originally purchased and the interest earned by the EDF while
holding the equivalent Jamaican currency. Following standard practice for
the handling of foreign exchange under Jamaica's exchange control laws, all
cash transactions of the EDF would be handled through exporters' commercial
banks. The new cash sales option has been included to avoid displacing normal
credit operations of commercial banks with excess liquidity (para. 3.03), and
to avoid penalizing exporters who need the foreign exchange provided by the



EDF but who have a strong cash position in domestic currency and do not need
any further credit. During negotiations it was agreed that no later than July
31, 1981, amendments to the existing policies and procedures satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 4.04) would be approved by the EDF's Board to enable the
EDF to commence operations under the cash option.
5.10      Use of EDF foreign exchange would be limited to the import of raw
materials, intermediate goods, packaging materials and spare parts entering
into the manufacture of non-traditional exports, including the processing and
packaging of agricultural products. For banana production use of EDF resources
would be limited to the import of fertilizers, insecticides and other current
inputs required for cultivation, and of materials used for harvesting, handling
and packaging. The Banana Company would sell imported agricultural inputs to
private growers of bananas for export, and would itself use imports required
for the marketing of such bananas. In the case of manufacturing firms that
are net earners of foreign exchange, EDF resources would be made available for
all of the direct import requirements of the firm, including those necessary
to satisfy their domestic sales. For manufacturing firms that are not net
earners of foreign exchange, use of EDF resources would be limited to the
value of the direct imports required exclusively for the production of goods
that would be exported. Local firms manufacturing intermediate goods utilized
by EDF client exporters would also be eligible to use EDF resources up to an
amount not to exceed the direct import content of goods on order from exporters
for use in the manufacture of export goods. Only exporters with an established
record of performance, or a credible plan for future performance, would be
eligible to use EDF resources. It is expected that exporters would use the
EDF's resources at least once a year, but the EDF would in general not provide
resources for new imports of an exporter who has failed to perform as agreed
upon in earlier operations. Export performance would be monitored by JECIC
who would prepare quarterly reports of substance and in form acceptable to the
Bank. During negotiations it was agreed that the Banana Company would, as a
condition for Bank disbursements under the component for banana production,
provide the Bank and EDF with satisfactory assurances regarding its under-
standing of, and readiness to comply with the terms and conditions for its
participation in the project. The Banana Company's eligibility to use EDF
resources beyond June 30, 1982, would, moreover, be subject to a review by
JECIC and the Bank of the export performance and foreign exchange needs of the
banana industry at that time.
5.11      Terms of the financing or US dollar sales would be for the export
cycle (time of cover by EDF of overseas payments to suppliers, to time of
payment for the export sales, normally about eight months), or 365 days,
whichever is shorter.  In the case of local suppliers, terms of the financing
or US dollar sales would extend to the time of delivery of the financed goods
to the exporter. Since it would be difficult to trace specific imports
through re-export, exporters would be free to select the items and amounts of
each that would be imported with EDF resources, subject only to the limits set
for each exporter and proof that the items being imported are necessary in the
manufacture of exports; and an export cycle applicable to all imports of each
exporter would be negotiated, and reviewed periodically, based on the particu-
lar characteristics of his export goods. Limits on use of EDF resources and
the export cycle would be determined by JECIC. Interest rates to exporters
that choose the financing option would be based on the EDF's discount rate,



- 26 -
currently 11%, plus a 1% administration fee for JECIC, and a 3% spread for the
com ercial banks.  The discount rate would be reviewed every three months
and would be adjusted in consultation with the Bank if warranted by conditions
in international money' markets. Exporters who purchase their US dollar
requirements might be expected to pay a fee sufficient to cover the difference
between the cost of ft.nds to the EDF net of earnings from its investments of
Jamaica currency holdings.
5 12      To maintain the foreign exchange integrity of the EDF, the BOJ would
continue to replenish the EDF with US$ whenever: (i) the export cycle exceeds
365 days at which time the BOJ would take over the debt instrument or Jamaican
currency held by the EDF; (ii) a firm fails to export or defaults on its
subloan in which case the BOJ would exchange the local currency then held
by the EDF, or deposited with the EDF by the commercial bank; and (iii) soft
currencies are earned from export sales. In the case of local suppliers to
exporters, whose obligations are repaid in Jamaican currency, the BOJ would
continue converting all such currency to US dollars 90 days after it is
received by the EDF. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the EDF and its
users would not be negatively affected by any changes in the foreign exchange
laws and regulations, the Government and the BOJ have agreed that the EDF and
its users would not be denied benefits that may be granted to other exporters
as a result of any change in foreign exchange laws or regulations, unless
such denial would not affect their international competitiveness.
5.13      Under Loan 1715-JM the Government undertook to assure that persons
and entities granted access to the FDF would be promptly granted import
licenses for goods financed by the EDF. Although substantive improvements
have been observed in the licensing procedure during the past eighteen months,
exporters inform and Government officials confirm that some elements of the
procedures still remain which create unnecessary paperwork and delays, and
which result in some umcertainty and lack of continuity to exporters' import,
manufacturing and export programming activities. Of particular note is the
fact that all import 'Licenses are granted for an irregular period which in all
cases expires on December 31 of the year in which the license was issued. The
remaining deficiencies - as they affect the exporter - are particularly
troublesome for the smaller exporters who do not have and cannot afford an
administrative staff with which to handle effectively many of the remaining
bureaucratic requirements for an import license. During negotiations the
Government agreed to simplify the import license application requirements for
EDF users by no later than July 31, 1981, and to ensure that licenses are
granted promptly upon the approval of applications for use of resources from
the EDF. The Government also intends to simplify licensing requirements and
procedures of its Trade Administrator's Department for all importers and,
in consultation with the Bank, intends to develop and implement during 1982 a
time-phased program to attain the desired simplification.
5.14      Permanent WDrking Capital and Equipment.  The US$10 million
permanent working capital and equipment component of the proposed loan would
flow through a special account of the EDF that would be established for the
purpose. The funds would be used strictly for permanent working capital and
equipment necessary to attain the originally installed rated manufacturing
capacity of exporters. Imports under this component would be made only
through the financing option of the EDF. The financed equipment would be used
to break existing production bottlenecks, increase the efficiency of the



- 27 -
existing process, or to allow the exporter to improve quality and meet new
product standards in overseas markets. It would be difficult to calculate
meaningful financial and economic rates of return; and since established
creditworthy clients would be using subloan funds to expand existing export
volumes the inefficient use of funds in ill-conceived projects is extremely
unlikely. A simple analysis would therefore be made of each financing request
which would assure that, as a minimum, the borrower is a qualified user of the
EDF; the equipment is installed in an existing production process at its
existing location and does not form part of a project to increase capacity; a
reasonable proportion of the output from the production process using the
equipment has been or will be exported or sold to exporters; and the amounts
of permanent working capital financing do not exceed three months of the
manufacturers' incremental projected export sales, or sales to exporters, for
the following year.
5.15      Financing would be provided through the same mechanism as under the
short-term financing operations option of the EDF, except that instead of the
terms being linked to the export cycle, loans made by commercial banks would
be for up to four years including up to one year of grace. Repayment to the
EDF of principal and interest of the US dollar indexed notes would be in
Jamaican currency which the BOJ agreed during negotiations to exchange for
US dollars on demand. Rollover funds would be used for the same purposes
as those of the proposed project. Interest rates would initially be the same
as those for short-term financing operations, but would be reviewed every
three months and be adjusted in consultation with the Bank if warranted by
conditions in international capital markets. Replenishment obligations
of the BOJ would be the same as those for short-term financing operations
(para. 5.12) except that for this component the 365 days export cycle limit
would no longer apply. A policy statement for medium-term financing acceptable
to the Bank, and which would incorporate the eligibility and analysis criteria
(para. 5.14) and the above policies and procedures, would be approved by the
EDF's Board no later than July 31, 1981, and would be a condition of Bank
disbursements for financing under this component.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.16      Procurement would be made by firms using normal commercial practice
from Bank member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan. Since procurement for
imports to be made with EDF resources would depend on the decision of many
enterprises for a large number of items, international competitive bidding
would not be practicable. Procurement of individual contracts costing the
equivalent of US$100,000 or more would, however, have to be supported by an
explanation of the procurement process and decision, including evidence that
the purchasers had sought price quotations from competitive sources. Since
equipment will be mostly for overhauling capacity and breaking bottlenecks
at various points in the production process of relatively small production
units, it is not expected that any discrete equipment packages that would be
required from a single source would exceed one million dollars, and very
likely not even half a million.
5.17      Disbursements for short-term supported imports of raw materials,
intermediate goods, packaging materials and spare parts would be made against
statements of expenditures certified by JECIC. The detailed documentation



- 28 
evidencing the final expenditure would be retained by JECTC and be available
for inspection by the Bank in the course of project supervision.  During
negotiations agreement would be obtained that a special audit be made of the
statements of expenditures and supporting docurnentation as part of the annual
independent external audit of the EDF.  Th-e Banana Company would, moreover,
provide the Bank with quarterly reports on its sales (para. 5D10) and own use
of imported inputs. D)isbursement procedures for permanent working capital and
equipment financing would be the same as under standard DFC operations, with a
free limit of US$250,000 for subloans from this component. Approval of
subloans would include a review of the list of goods to be financed out of the
loan resources, and disbursement would be against docunents evidencing payment
for the specific goods previously approved. JECIC would certify that it has
not claimed financing from any other source for imports for which it claims
disbursement under the proposed loan.  All technical assistance expenditures
would require prior Bank approval, for which purpose the participating insti-
tutions would periodically present discrete programs or projects for approval
by the Bank. Disbursement for technical assistance would also be against
documentation evidencing the expenditure. In the light of the present import
requirements for export and the EDF's current resources, it is expected that
the proposed loan would be disbursed within two years after loan signing.
Annex 1, shows the schedule of estimated disbursements.
Benefits and Risks
5.18      By enabling exporters to obtain their import requirements the
proposed loan would help increase non-traditional manufactured exports from
TJS$105 million in 1980 to an estimated US$350 million in 1984, and banana
exports from US$11.0 million in 1980 to about US$40.0 million by 1983-84;
would allow improved utilization of existing manufacturing capacity; would
generate new employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector and the
banana industry; and would improve incomes of banana farmers. The proposed
loan would, in addition, further strengthen the EDF which has been and will
continue to be for some time a focal point of the Government program to
increase non-traditional exports; and would provide important technical
assistance for institutions serving manufacturers of exports, including small
scale enterprises which without such assistance would find access to export
markets prohibitively expensive.
5.19      The ability of the sector to increase its export volumes, particu-
larly to non-CARICOM markets, will depend on producing acceptable products at
competitive prices and then being able to market them. This ability, and
particularly the willingness to develop it, will in turn depend on the
decisiveness with which the Government moves to redress the imbalance in
incentives and protection which favor productior. for the local market over
production for export. Otherwise, as the Jamaican economy recovers and local
demand improves many exporters could again find it more profitable to divert
export production to the local market.  hle Government is aware of the need to
develop and implement policy measures to make export production at least as
profitable as production for the local market and has requested the Bank to
assist in the formulation of a reform package. Finally, success beyond
current expectations by the EDF in inducing larger amounts of supplier and
other overseas credit for its clients, might allow the EDF to operate with a
lower level of resources for its short-term operations than those projected
for the proposed loan. This would result in a slowdown in the speed of



- 29 -
disbursement of the proposed loan. In that event, funds of the proposed loan
would be reallocated from short-term import operations to the permanent
working capital and equipment component, which is expected to cover only part
of the requirements for those purposes.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements
6.01      During loan negotiations agreements were reached on the following:
(a)  With the Government on
(i) consulting with the Bank by no later than July 31, 1981,
on a specific program of action for the implementation of
industrial reforms (para. 2.20);
(ii) loan amount, and the onlending terms and conditions for
the proposed loan components for the EDF (para. 5.08);
(iii) the minimum period of time during which the EDF would
continue its current and proposed operations, and the guide-
lines for future use of EDF resources when and if any of these
are no longer required by the EDF for its normal operations
(para. 5.08);
(iv)  a timetable for simplification of the import licensing
requirements and procedures for imports made with resources
of the EDF (para. 5.13);

(i) a timetable for development and approval of a policy state-
ment for onlending of permanent working capital and equipment
(para. 5.15);
(ii)  the composition and a timetable for the establishment of
a Technical Committee for JECIC and the EDF (para. 4.06);
(iii) a timetable for acquisition, development and implementation of
electronic data processing, and management control, information
and performance evaluation systems (para. 4.06);
(iv) a timetable for approval by the EDF's Board of the amendments
to the existing policies and procedures required to regulate
the new US dollar sales operations of the EDF (para. 5.09);
(v) reporting requirements on the export performance of EDF clients
(para. 5.10);



- 30 -
(vi) a reviLew of export performance and foreign exchange needs
of the banana industry to determine its eligibility to use
EDF resources beyond June 30, 1982 (para. 5.10);
(vii) onlending terms and conditions for short-term financing,
inclucling quarterly review of onlending rates (para. 5.11),
and for financing of permanent working capital and equip-
ment (para. 5.15);
(viii) the use of the rollover funds from subloans for permanent
working capital and equipment (para. 5.15);
(ix)  a US$250,000 free limit for subloans for permanent
working capital and equipment (para. 5.17);
(x)  procurement and disbursement procedures, including audit
of the statements of expenditures (paras. 5.16 and 5.17);
(c) With the BO)J on
the replenishment procedures of the EDF whenever hard currencies are
not earned by EDF clients, the export cycle on short-term financing
operations exceed 365 days, EDF clients default on their obliga-
tions, or Jamaican currency is received from amortization and
interest payments of medium-term financed notes (paras. 5.12 and
5.15); and
(d) With JECIC and JNEC on
approval procedures for disbursements under the technical assistance
component of the proposed loan (para. 5.17).
6.02      The following would be condition of loan effectiveness:
signing of a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank
for onlending by the Covernment of the proposed loan components
for the EDF (para. 5.08);
6.03      The following would be conditions of disbursements:
(i)  for the banana production component: assurances from the
Banana Company with respect to its participation in the
Project (para. 5.10); and
(ii) for the permanent working capital and equipment component:
approval by the EDF's Board of the policy statement to regulate
lending for permanent working capital and equipment (para. 5.15).
Recommendation
6.04      The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to the Government of Jamaica of US$37 million equivalent with a term of 17 years,
including four years of grace, at an interest rate of 9.6% per annum.
