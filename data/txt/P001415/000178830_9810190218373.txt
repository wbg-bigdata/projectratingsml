INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND REODMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to The Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of
US$1.2 million on standard IDA terms to finance a project to help prepare
agricultural projects, strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture and implement
a pilot rubber scheme.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank has made five loans for projects in Liberia, totalling
$20 million and IFC has made one investment of $250,OOO. An IDA credit
of $7.2 million for a First Education Project was approved by the Executive
Directors on March 28, 1972. The Bank's loans have been for roads, port
expansion and power. Details are shown in Annex I. Project execution and
loan disbursements have generally met expectations. The Government's
decision to add several new functions (radio, television and telecommuni-
cations) to the existing power, water and sewerage functions of the Public
Utilities Authority appears to conflict with assurances obtained in
connection with Loans 684-LBR and 778-LBR, and the Government has been
requested to reconsider its decision. The off-shore costs of both power
projects have increased in terms of U.S. dollars, partly because of the
devaluation of the dollar and partly because of the need for gas turbine
units larger than those originally planned.
3.        This agriculture project, together with the recent Credit for
education represents a shift in Bank Group lending strategy in Liberia.
Previous lending had gone almost exclusively into infrastructure and
continuous support for investment in infrastructure will be required.
At the same time more emphasis will be given to agriculture and educa-
tion. This conforms with the reordering of priorities by the Liberian
administration that came into office last July. Because of the serious
scarcity of local expertise to prepare and implement development projects
in these sectors, technical studies and training are important features
of the agriculture pnQject now proposed and the previous education project.
These projects, which complement each other, should provide the foundation
for further Bank Group lending in both sectors.

PART II - THE ECONOMY
4.       An economic mission was in Liberia in July and August 1970
and its report (AW-25b), dated June 1, 1971, has been distributed to
the Executive Directors. Country data are in Annex II. The next
comprehensive economic mission is scheduled for January, 1973. An
updating mission visited Liberia last December. Its main conclusions
were discussed' in my Report to the Executive Directors on the First
Education Cred-it (P-1044), dated March 14., 1972, and there have been
no developments since then to change the analysis. The main conclusions
were that while Liberia's GNP has grown at an average annual rate of
about 4 percent in real terms during the last decade, most of this
growth originated in the so-called enclave sectors -- primarily iron
ore, but also rubber and logging -- which contribute about 35 percent
to GDP and 85 percent to merchandise exports. There has been little
growth, however,, in the large underdeveloped rural economy.. The economic
situation improved markedly in 1969 and' 1970, because of improved' export
prices for iron ore and rubber. However, in 1971, economic activity lost
some of its buoyancy, mainly because of adverse external developments.
The iron ore~ sector, which accounts for some-70 percent of the v'alue
of exports and- 25 percent of GDP, failed. to expand,. largely due to the
general economic slowdown in industrial countries, and especially the
reduced European demand for iron ore. The rubber industry was even more
adversely affected in 1971. Prices received by Liberia rubber producers
fell sharply throughout the year.
5.       While; the economic situation weakened in 1971, the political
outlook chang'ed significantly with a new government administration
under President William R. Tolbert, which took office last July. The
new administration already has taken encouraging steps to strengthen
the econamy and to provide more effective economic leadership. In
view of the weak budgetary situation, the Government last December
negotiated an. IF standby arrangement for 4 million SDR's. The Government's
letter of intent included a commitment to introduce tax reforms, to
exercise greater expenditure control, to limit domestic bank credit
and not to contract or guarantee any external loans of less than 12
years' maturity. The Government has announced it will prepare a- develop-
ment plan for 1974-1978, an important step in view of the fact that so
far there has been no systematic development planning and only inadequate
sectoral knowledge. Mie Government also is implementing measures adopted
late in the previous regime to obtain more revenue from foreign concession-
aires. An audit of the iron ore concession agreements led to an increase
of $500,000 in government revenues. An audit of one rubber firm produced
another $600,000. In addition, the Government is continuing its efforts
to renegotiate the iron ore agreements. To help improve enforcement of
the terms of the concession agreements, the Government has decided to
establish a central administration for coordinating, supervising and
formulating policy in relation to them. UNDP has given its initial
approval to a request for experts (including a concession lawyer,
accountant, auditor, mining and forestry economists) to help the new
central administration in its formative stages.



-3-
6.        Public capital expenditure in 1971 continued at the level of
about $10-12 million for the fourth year in a row, reflecting the shortage
of identified and prepared projects and.reduced external assistance.
However, given new capacities for greater project identification and
preparation, public inVestment is expected to rise to an average of
about $17 million annually over the next several years. Disbursement
of external capital assistance in the last two years averaged about
$7.5 million annually, almost all for infrastructure. There was also
an average of about $8 million a year from grants for technical assist-
ance, mostly from the United States. These amounts represent a sharp
drop from the annual average of $13 million in capital assistance and
$12 million in technical assistance from 1965 to 1969. There were no
new aid commitments for capital projects in 1971, in contrast to average
annual commitments of about $10 million in the previous two years.
IBRD loans accounted for about 55 percent of these commitments, with
29 percent from the United States and the remainder from the African
Development Bank. External public debt outstanding at the end of 1971
is estimated at $162 million. About 67 percent is owed to the United
States (mostly loans from AID), 10 percent to Germany, 9 percent to
IBRD and 14 percent to suppliers (mostly Italian). In the past two
years debt service payments absorbed about 13 percent of net export
earnings (merchandise exports minus net factor payments abroad), and
about 24 percent of current government revenues. They are expected
to absorb similar proportions in the next several years.
7.        The new administration's efforts indicate a substantial improve-
ment in Liberia's economic policies. Even so, it will take time before
the budgetary constraints on debt servicing capacity, as discussed in the
1971 economic report, will be overcome. In these circumstances, and
given the widespread poverty in Liberia (60 to 70 percent of the popu-
lation engaged in subsistence agriculture have an average per capita
income of less than $50, compared to the GNP per capita of $235), a
substantial portion of external assistance should be provided on concession-
ary terms and some local expenditure financing is justified. Future US
aid is likely to be concentrated in public administration and agriculture.
Germany is financing water supply systems and is helping to establish road
maintenance stations. Future Bank Group lending planned includes a Bank
loan for the Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment, to
be presented later this year. A road maintenance and engineering project
is under study, and a supplementary power loan is being considered.
PART III - AGRICULTURE
8.        Much of Liberia's terrain  is low and sloping. Tree crops,
including rubber, oil palm, coffee, coconut and cocoa, are well suited
to the climatic conditions. However, because high rainfall and temperatures
cause rapid soil degradation, most of the land is unsuitable for the



continuous cultivation of annual crops. Consequently, rice and other
food crops are produced under a system-of shifting cultivation. Valley
bottoms and swamps are fertile, however, and with water control and
fertilizers, they can be used for continuous cultivation.
9.       Agriculture accounts for about 21 percent of GDP and about
70 percent of employment and is exceeded in inportance only by mining,
which accounts for about 30 percent of GDP. Rubber is by far the most
important export crop. In 1969 (the last complete year for which re-
liable data are available) growers produced 64,o0o tons valued at about
$30.5 million, which accounted for about 36 percent of Liberia's agri-
cultural production and 2.3 percent of world natural rubber output.
About 70 percent of rubber exports is produced by seven foreign con-
cessionaires who hold land under long leases ranging from 40 to 99 years.
In 1969 these concession plantations, which are the source of about 60
percent of value added in agriculture, produced 47,000 tons of rubber
from about 94,000 acres of mature trees. Generally, concession holdings
are planted with high yieldirg clones and are capital intensive.
10.      Data on the five thousand Liberian-owned rubber farms are limited
and only a very general picture can be drawn. Production increased from
about 12,300 tons in 1965 to about 18,300 tons in 1969 (valued at about
US$8.5 million).  However, on all but a few of the larger Larms, field
management is poor and yields are low, ranging from about 800 pounds an
acre to about 180 pounds an acre. About 45 percent of Liberian-owned
rubber is estimated to be untapped. Low yielding planting material,
poor farm maintenance, inadequate tapper wages and incentives, high
transportation and processing costs, absentee landlords, and lack of
capital, have all contributed to this situation. These problems become
acute when world prices for natural rubber decline, as they have in
recent years due mainly to economic recession in industrial countries
and the gradual reduction in the production costs of synthetic rubber.
11.      In spite of continued increases that can be expected in world
demand for rubber, the c.i.f. New York price is expected to decline in
real terms by 13-14 percent by the mid-1970s from its average 1971 level.
While concessionaires and well-managed plantations will be able to offset
the effect of price reductions by increasing production, inefficient and
poorly managed farms will be forced out of production. This presents
a serious problem for Liberian-owned farms, many of which are badly
managed. A decline in rubber production by Liberian farmers would
have serious economic and social consequences, including an increase in
unemployment in the labor force, which is estimated at 18,00 to 24,000.
12.      The majority of Liberians live near subsistence levels, producing
rice and food crops for their own consumption and coffee, cocoa and palm
kernels for export; production has shown little or no increase for a number
of years. Subsistence farming areas suffer from an almost complete lack
of infrastructure. Roads are few and frequently unusable in the wet
season (April through November). Crop marketing and processing facilities



-5-
are insufficient. Farm implements are rudimentary, little fertilizer is
used and disease and pest controls are virtually unknown. The average
income of subsistence fanmers is estimated to be the equivalent of About,
$175 per family, or some $40 per capita. This compares with per capita
GNP of $235.
13.      The Government is anxious to find ways to assist subsistence
farmers. Although Liberia has received assistance for agriculture in
the past, mainly from the United States and UNDP, it has often failed
to develop viable projects which would make this aid effective. This
failure is now recognized by the Government, which plans to expand- the
proportion of the national budget devoted to agriculture. Government
agencies concerned with agriculture and rural development are to concen-
trate on the collection of basic data, with the object of preparing
investment proposals for development projects in subsistence farming
areas. A special unit has been established in the Office of the President
to ensure that rural development priorities and plans are executed properly
and speedily.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
.14-     In May 1970, the Liberian Government asked IDA for financial
help to replant 24,000 acres of Liberian-owned rubber. The project
had been prepared for the Government by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation under contract to the Bank Group. A Bank mission appraised
it in June/July 1970 but did not recommend Bank Group financing because
of the low economic return on replanting rubber. The appraisal was made
difficult, however, by the lack of adequate information about the Liberian-
owned rubber industry. Subsequently, in discussions with Government
representatives, it was concluded that surveys and studies would be re-
quired to prepare sound projects in the rubber and subsistence agricultural
areas, and that Bank Group assistance should be sought. To this end,
negotiations for an IDA credit were held in Washingeon on February 28 and
29, 1972.  Mr. Edwin Williams, the Deputy Minister of Finance, headed
the Liberian delegation.
15       This is an unusual project for the Bank Group in that it is maiilly
for pre-investment studies and planning. It is of a kind which UNDP
finances. However, UNDP has informed the Association that it will have
no funds available for additional projects in Liberia for some time to
come. In these circumstances it seemed proper to propose it for IDA
fina.ncing.
16-      The proposed project, as summarized in Annex III, would be
carried out over three years and would include:
(a) making feasibility studies and preparing detailed
investment proposals for two integrated rural development
projects;
(b) carrying out a physical survey and detailed study of the
Liberian-owned rubber industry;
(c) carrying out a pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian



-6-
rubber farmers with credits to rehabilitate 2,000 acres
of untapped or poorly tapped rubber, and government grants
to replant 500 acres of old, uneconomic rubber;
(d)  preparing, on the basis of (b) and (c), detailed proposals
for any investments justified for improvement of the
Liberian-owned rubber industry;
(e) improving rice research at the Suakoko central research
station;
(f) providing a specialist experienced in administration to
plan the future structure and organization of the De-
partment of Agriculture and to prepare a staff training
program; and
(g) providing training for Liberians in preparing investment
projects, rice research, and in rubber farm management
and tapping.
17.      The Government has selected Lofa County in the north for its
first rural development project, and is now collecting basic physical and
human resource data. It was chosen because of its agricultural potential
and because a proposed iron ore mine in the same area is expected to
create a new urban center of some 35,000, requiring large quantities of
food that could be produced locally. Basic data will also be collected
for a similar rural development project in central Liberia. The pro-
posed project would finance consultants to analyze the data gathered in
both areas and formulate investment proposals for two integrated rural
development projects. These would cover agricultural inputs, marketing
and processing facilities, crop extraction and feeder roads, potable
water supplies and social services, such as health and education.   These
studies would provide the basis for long-range agricultural development
throughout the country.
18.      If rural development projects are to succeed, however, additional
adaptive research .is urgently required to proviae information concerning
crop varieties, fertilizer use and pest control for rice and other food
crops. Adaptive research on rice and'other food crops was renewed in
1970 at Suakoko as part of a four-year UNDP project. Facilities, how-
ever, are insufficient to support the project, and improved infrastructure--
mainly road surfacing, housing, fencing, electricity, buildings and equip-
ment -- is required.  In addition, research needs to be better directed.
The proposed project would finance these physical improvements, consul-
tants to plan and'monitor rice research and an experienced rice agronomist
to carry it out.
19.      The rubber industry studies and the pilot rubber scheme would
determine whether Liberian growers would adopt improved management and
production techniques necessary to make rubber growing financially sound
and economic. Under the proposed project, consultants-would carry out
the rubber industry studies. A special management unit of the Ministry
of Agriculture would supervise the pilot scheme. This would include a
wide range of Liberian rubber farms, especially smaller ones.   The unit



-7-
would select the farms for rehabilitation and replanting according to
the following guidelines:  they would have to be within a 20-mile radius
of Suakoko, the unit headquarters; owners would either have to reside on
their farms or have a satisfactory manager; farms to be rehabilitated
would have trees with at least 10 years of productive life with an esti-
mated potential yield of not less than 700 pounds per acre; those to be
replanted, an estimated production potential for two years under intensive
tapping of at least 900 pounds per acre per annum. Financial returns to
farmers participating in the pilot scheme would be satisfactory. Annual
net returns for rehabilitation are estimated at $21 an acre, and would
average $30 an acre for replanted rubber. These net returns would be
similar to the present returns obtained by the best Liberian rubber
farmers.
20.       The project would be carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture,
but in view of the Ministry's staff limitations, the administration
specialist to be employed to review its functions, organization and
training requirements would also coordinate all project activities. He
would be responsible to the Minister of Agriculture or his deputy. The
Deputy ministers or their equivalents in Government Ministries and
agencies associated with the project would be responsible for ensuring
the cooperation of their Ministers and agencies in project implementation,
and for reviewing and evaluating the consultants' studies financed under
the project.
21.       In addition to some 15 consultants to prepare rural development
projects, to study the rubber industry, and to plan and monitor rice
research, three full-time professionals would be needed -- one to manage
the pilot rubber scheme, one rice agronomist, and an administration
specialist in the Department of Agriculture. The project would also
provide training for graduate economists, agronomists, rice research
workers, and rubber farm managers.
22.       Total project cost is estimated at $1.6 million.   An IDA credit
of $1.2 million would meet 75 percent of this amount and would cover the
foreign exchange costs of US$0.9 million and US$0.3 million of local
expenditures. The remaining 25 percent of project costs (Us$0.4 million)
would be met by the Government. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government that funds required for the project would be
made available two months before actually being needed, and in block
form, on the basis of monthly estimates approved by the project coordi-
nator.  Procurement for goods and civil works, valued at $250,000, would
be by local competitive bidding under procedures satisfactory to the
Association, since individual contracts would be too small to attract
international bids and a sufficient number of construction companies and
manufacturers' agents exists in Liberia. All contract awards would be
reviewed by the Association and all contracts for civil works and equip-
ment estimated to cost US$5,000 or more would be subject to the Associa-
tion's prior approval. Consultant's services totalling $628,000, would
be obtained according to the Association's normal procedures.



- 8 -
23.      The proposed project is primarily limited to pre-investment
activities because this is the-best way to develop a sound agricultural
development strategy which can have a significant impact on Liberia's
economy. In the absence of developing and carrying out such a strategy
the subsistence farming sector will remain stagnant, and the contribution
of rubber farmers to the economy will fall. The project does not pre-
suppose that the Liberian-owned rubber industry can be placed on a firmer
economic footing, since without the actions proposed under the project this
cannot be determined. The importance of the industry is such, however, that
this determination is of the highest priority.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORIT(
24.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Liberia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern
of agreements for agriculture projects.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
25.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the propose
Development Credit.
