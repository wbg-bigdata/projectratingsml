DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate:   Number of live births per year per 1,000 population.
Crude Death Rate:   Number of deaths per year per 1,000 population.
Rate of Natural      Difference between crude birth and crude death rates;
Increase:         usually expressed as a percentage.
Rate of Population  Rate of natural increase adjusted for (net) migration,
Growth:            expressed as a percentage of the total population in
a given year.
Age-Specific         Number of live births per 1,000 women in a given age
Fertility Rate:   group, in a given year.  It is usually calculated for
5-year age groups.
Total Fertility     The average number of children that would be born to
Rate:              a woman if she were to live to the end of her child-
bearing years, and bear children according to prevail-
ing age-specific fertility rates. The Total Fertility
Rate often serves as an estimate of the average number
of children per family.
Gross Reproduction  This is the same as the Total Fertility Rate, but
Rate:              refers to the average number of daughters a woman
would have under the prevailing fertility pattern.
Net Reproduction    The number of daughters a woman would have under
Rate:              prevailing fertility and mortality patterns who would
survive to the mean age of childbearing.
Infant Mortality    Annual number of deaths of infants under 1 year per
Rate:              1,000 live births during the same year.
Maternal Mortality  Number of maternal deaths per 1,000 births attributable
Rate:              to pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperal complications
(i.e., within six weeks following childbirth).
Life Expectancy:    Average number of years, children born in a given year
can expect to live if mortality rates for each age/
sex group remain the same.
Age Dependency       Number of people 14 years and under plus people 65 years
Ratio:             and over, divided by the population aged 15 to 64 years.

I. POPULATION GROWTH AND HEALTH SITUATION
A. Introduction
1.01      The population of the Republic of Korea increased from about 17
million in 1945 to about 37.3 million in mid-1979 or at an average annual rate
of growth of 2.3% (Annex 14, T-1). Between 1945 and 1978, the crude birth
rate fell from about 41 births per thousand population to 23.7 per thousand,
while the crude death rate fell from about 20 deaths per thousand population
to about 6.2 per thousand. Migration fluctuated widely during this period,
but at present has little effect on the rate of growth. Although Korea has
reduced the rate of growth of population from about 3.0% in 1960 to about 1.7%
at present, the population problem is still serious.  Korea has one of 2the
highest densities of population in the world (about 377 persons per km ) and
limited natural resources. Even to reach the Government of the Republic of
Korea's (GROK) goals of a rate of growth of population of 1.6% by 1281 and
1.3% by 1986, which would mean a density of over 500 persons per km in the
year 2000, will require a considerable increase in efforts to control fertil-
ity.
B. Population Growth
Recent Trends
1.02      The increase in population in the recent past has been the result
of changes in fertility, mortality and migration patterns, and has affected
the geographical distribution and age composition of the population. Between
1955 and 1978, fertility fell by about one half as the result of a reduction
in the proportion of married women, and an increase in contraception and
abortion. In 1955, the mean age of marriage for women was 20.5 years; by
1975, it had increased to 23.7 years. Married women are increasingly con-
trolling their fertility by means of contraception and abortion. In 1964,
only 9% of the married women of reproductive age were practicing contracep-
tion; by 1976 that number had increased to 44% (Annex 14, T-2). During the
same period, the proportion of currently married women aged 20-44 years who
ever had an abortion increased from 7% to 39%. The increased practice of
contraception and abortion explains the 29% decline in marital fertility rates
between 1960-65 and 1976.
1.03      Except during World War II and the Korean War, mortality has steadily
declined in Korea since the 1920s: life expectancy at birth has increased
from about 34 years in 1925 to about 66 years at present; the crude death
rate has fallen from about 28 per thousand in 1930 to about 6 per thousand;
and infant mortality has fallen from over 100 deaths per thousand live births
in 1950 to about 38 per thousand live births. The fall in mortality is due
to a rising standard of living, better nutrition, rapidly improving sanitary



- 2 -
conditions, and the increased availability and accessibility of health ser-
vices. In 1975 about 62% of the population had access to clean water and
about 61% lived in households connected to a sewer or other waste disposal
system.
1.04      In the past, international migration had some effect on the rate
of growth of the population. Before 1945, about 3 million Koreans emigrated
to Manchuria and Japan. About half of them returned between 1945 and 1949.
During the Korean War, about 350,000 people immigrated into the country,
primarily from North Korea. After the war, international migration almost
ceased. A law enacted in 1962 encouraged systematic emigration to help to
reduce the rate of population growth. This policy, however, has had little
impact; only about 46,000 Koreans leave the country each year. Since immigra-
tion is limited, net emigration thus reduces the rate of population growth
by about one per 1,000 per year. Recent concern about a shortage of skilled
labor may reduce the net emigration rate even further.
1.05      During the past 20 years, there has been rapid urbanization.  In
1960, only 28% of the population lived in urban areas; by 1975, 48% of the
population was urban. Concentration in large urban centers has also increased.
In 1960 about 51% of the urban population lived in Seoul and Pusan; by 1975
the proportion had risen to 55%. Migration accounts for most of these changes.
In the period 1971 to 1977, inter-provincial migration grew from 1.3 million
to 2.2 million persons per year. Of the 2.2 million persons who changed
province of residency in 1977, about 1.0 million moved to Seoul and Pusan,
while about 0.6 million left those cities. This migration has mainly been
due to the search for a better way of living: of the 2.2 million inter-
provincial migrants in 1977, about 0.8 million migrated for reasons of occupa-
tion and about 0.3 million people moved because of marriage, education or
other reasons. Expansion in the area of influence of each city, as well as
natural increase, also contributed to the increase in the proportion of the
population living in urban areas.
1.06      The last four population censuses show important changes in the
age distribution of the population (Annex 14, T-3). In 1960, 42.9% of the
population was aged 0-14 years; the proportion declined to 38.6% in 1975 as a
consequence of the decline in fertility that began in 1962. During the same
period, the proportion of the total population aged 65 and over increased
from 3.3% to 3.5%. The population of working age increased from 53.6% to
58.4% thus reducing the age dependency ratio from 0.86 to 0.71.
Demographic Prospects and Implications
1.07      The Bureau of the Census has prepared three population growth pro-
jections based on three different assumptions about the success of the inten-
sified population program that GROK is now planning. All three projections
assume that life expectancy at birth will increase from about 66 years in 1975
to about 73 years in 2000 and that the net emigration will increase from
46,000 in 1975 to 74,000 in 1980, remaining constant thereafter. The first
projection assumes that a net reproduction rate of one will be reached in



- 3 -
1985; the second that it will be reached in 1990; and the third that it will
be reached in the year 2000. 1/ Details of these assumptions and the projec-
tions appear in Annex 14, T-4 and are summarized below.
PROJECTIONS OF TOTAL POPULATION UNDER THREE FERTILITY ASSUMPTIONS
(In thousands)
Projection        1975 /a              1980             1990            2000
I             35,281             38,023           43,888          49,848
II            35,281              38,197          44,642          50,619
III           35,281              38,243          45,134          51,142
/a   Based on 1975 Census data corrected for underenumeration and
estimated for mid-year.
1.08      The difference between the highest and the lowest projection of the
population in the year 2000 is only 2.6%. Although this difference is small,
the changes in the age composition of the population under the three pro-
jections have important implications for the country's development. In 1975
there were 6.3 million persons between the ages 6 and 12, or of primary school
age. If there is rapid decline of fertility (projection I) there will be 6.1
million primary school-age children by 2000; if the decline is slower (projec-
tion III) there will be 6.5 million. The population between ages 13 and 18,
i.e., the population of secondary school age, would fall from 5.4 million in
1975 to about 4.9 million in 2000 under projection I or increase to 5.6 million
under projection III. The different rates of fertility under the three
projections would not be reflected in the size of the labor force until the
year 2000, when the rapid decline (projection I) would result in a population
aged 15-64 years of about one million less than there would be with a more
gradual decline.  Regar less of  the rate of decline, density will increase
from 357 persons pSr km in 1975 to the very high figure of between 505 and
518 persons per km by the year 2000. This is particularly serious in a
country where density is already high and natural resources are limited.
1/   These projections are different from those prepared by IBRD and presented
in the World Development Report, 1979 because of differences in base data
and assumptions. The IBRD projections use as base population the
enumerated population of the 1975 Census without correction, and begin
with a low expectation of life at birth and total fertility rate. The
Bureau of the Census projections utilize as base population the enumerated
population of the 1975 Census corrected for underenumeration and the life
expectancy and total fertility rate estimated from that Census. These
projections also include an emigration assumption not considered in the
Bank projection.

1.09      If there were no increase in family planning activities, fertility
would remain close to its present level, and the population would be consider-
ably larger in the year 2000 than any of the above projections predict. The
family planning program has therefore to be stepped up sufficiently not only
to reduce the total fertility rate but also to compensate for the effects
of changes in age structure and a possible reduction in the average age of
marriage. GROK's plan to strengthen its programs makes it likely that projec-
tion II may be realized.
C. Health
1.10      Despite the reduction in mortality (para. 1.03), morbidity remains
a serious problem. Although Korean health statistics are unreliable, surveys
indicate that at least 15% of the population lose an average of 3.4 days of
work per month because of illness, primarily among the rural population.
Gastroenteritis and respiratory diseases are the most common, and are due to
poor food hygiene, lack of potable water and deficient disposal of wastes.
About 40% of the population surveyed suffered from parasite infestation.
Cholera and malaria have practically disappeared, typhoid fever, diphtheria
and poliomyelitis have been greatly reduced, while the incidence of tuber-
culosis and leprosy remained constant between 1968 and 1977.
1.11      There are differences between rural and urban areas.  1"ost urban
households have access to potable water and are connected to a waste disposal
system, but only about 27% of rural households have access to potable water
and only 30% have some form of sanitary waste disposal. The country has
about 257 hospital units with about 27,000 beds, 202 health centers, 1,336
health subcenters and a large number of private clinics. It also has about
22,000 physicians and about 70,000 nurses. Although the rural population is
about half of the total population, it is served only by about 13% of the
country's health facilities and workers.
1.12      The deficiency of maternal and child health services is more striking.
Korea lacks both traditional birth attendants and trained health workers. Of
the 850,000 births in 1977, only about 40% were attended by medical personnel.
Further, in 1977 only about 27,000 deliveries were actually attended by public
health personnel; in 125,000 other cases, mothers were supplied with delivery
kits for home use. Only 307,000 pregnant women registered for pre- or post-
natal services. In 1975 only 41% of the population received BCG vaccine; less
than 20% of children under five received measles vaccine and less than 80%
received polio vaccine. A strengthening of the health services would reduce
morbidity and mortality, especially in rural areas.

II. POPULATION AND HEALTH POLICY, STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS
A. Policy
Population
2.01      The need for a population policy in Korea was first realized after
the Korean War. The 1955 Census indicated that fertility was high, and both
public and private groups began to debate the consequences of rapid population
growth for economic development. Further fuel was added to the debate by the
1960 Census and data on the rate of growth of gross national product for 1960,
which indicated that population growth was offsetting the effects of economic
growth. In 1961 the Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea (PPFK), a private
organization, was established. In the same year GROK directed the Ministry of
Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) to provide family planning services and to
support the efforts of private groups also providing family planning services.
This led in 1962 to the adoption of a family planning program with the target
of reducing the annual rate of population growth from 2.9% to 2.0% by 1966.
2.02      The services of the national family planning program were at first
available only in urban clinics and the choice of contraceptive methods
(condoms, foam and vasectomy) was limited. In 1964, family planning workers
were assigned to all health subcenters in rural areas, mobile teams were set
up to cover remote areas, and the intrauterine device (IUD) was offered as an
alternative method. In 1966, GROK began to offer financial incentives to
users. In 1968, mothers' clubs were organized by PPFK to promote family
planning and to supply contraceptives, and the oral pill was made available.
The Maternal and Child Health Law of 1973 broadened the medical justification
for abortions. Female sterilization was made available in 1974.
2.03      Complementary international and internal migration policies were
also adopted. In 1962, an Emigration Law was passed and in 1965 the Korean
Overseas Development Corporation was set up to promote emigration. In 1964,
GROK adopted a program designed to reduce the concentration of population in
big cities, but it has not yet had much effect.
2.04      In 1976, GROK established a Population Policy Coordinating Committee
under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister. Among the measures
promoted by this Committee are population education programs for adults and
out-of-school youth, tax exemptions for small families, priority in public
housing and financial assistance for sterilized persons, lower delivery fees
for the second child when it is the last, and legal changes which allow women
to be heads of household and to inherit property.
2.05      Korea's population policy has thus become increasingly comprehensive
and covers family planning, emigration, geographical distribution and incen-
tives to lower fertility. It has been formulated so as to meet the country's
needs wnile not arousing serious political opposition. The policy supports
both public and private efforts and encourages utilization of all available
medical resources.



-6-
Health
2.06      Attempts to introduce preventive health services and modern medical
institutions began at the end of the 19th century. After 1910 an active plan
to improve medical services was formulated. A Bureau of Public Health, now
the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) was set up after liberation.
The Korean War caused severe damage to the medical infrastructure. After the
War, priority was given to the rebuilding of hospitals in large cities and to
the introduction of sanitary regulations for foods, drugs and public facili-
ties. It was not until the Health Center Law of 1962 was passed that efforts
were made to provide health services for the rural population. Home visiting
services were established to provide family planning, tuberculosis surveillance
and, later, maternal and child health care, and led to the setting up of health
subcenters to cover remote areas and serve as the headquarters for the field-
workers.
2.07      An important aspect of health policy has been the training of medical
personnel and the encouragement of private practice. The country now has about
one physician per 1,680 people and one nurse per 520 people, but they are over-
whelmingly concentrated in urban areas. Partly to correct maldistribution,
GROK now offers incentives in the form of tax exemptions and low interest
loans to physicians who practice in underserved areas. GROK also pays private
physicians on a fee-for-service basis to provide family planning services for
people referred to them by fieldworkers. In addition, the Social Security
Law, enacted in 1963, and the Medical Insurance Law, enacted in 1976, provide
assistance to employees, self-employed persons and those unable to pay or
unemployed.
2.08      The Maternal and Child Health Law of 1973 is intended to fill a
serious gap in the system by establishing better maternal and child health
services but its implementation has been delayed by lack of funds. The Law
also extended the medical grounds for legal abortion.
2.09      Although these laws have significantly improved health care, there
is a need for further improvement. Services are still concentrated in urban
areas and continue to be on curative rather than preventive and environmental
approaches; existing facilities are underutilized; and there is no ongoing
health education program to induce people to utilize the services available.
The Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (1977-1981) recognizes these problems
and sets the following objectives:
(a) establishment of a health care delivery system through the
development and expansion of low-cost health services for the
urban poor and rural residents, and a more even geographical
distribution of medical resources;
(b) intensified public health measures, particularly in
preventive medicine including disease control and MCH; and
(c) better sanitation and water supply in rural areas and
minimized industrial pollution.



-7-
2.10      In 1975 GROK established the Korean Health Development Institute
(KHDI) to carry out research on the development of health delivery systems,
the implementation and evaluation of demonstration projects and the demand for
and supply of health services. Better knowledge of the health situation in
Korea as well as the development of appropriate delivery systems will help the
country to achieve the objectives of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan and
to formulate a more comprehensive national health policy (see Annex 15 for
documentation). The work of KHDI has already led to an improvement of maternal
and child health services and is expected soon to lead to the setting up of a
low cost delivery system in rural areas. The knowledge acquired through the
work of KHDI is constantly monitored for application on any new program or
project of the GROK.
B. Organization
2.11      The activities comprising the National Population Program are
conducted by a number of public and private institutions, each of which may
have a hand in the formulation of policy as well as its execution.
Policy-Making Agencies
2.12      Population policy can in theory originate in any government agency;
in practice, family planning and emigration policies originate in the Ministry
of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA); population distribution policies originate
in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry
of National Defense, the Ministry of Construction and the First Minister without
portfolio; policies about integrating family planning with the New Village
Movement originate in MORA; promotion of low fertility through tax exemptions
originate with the Ministry of Finance; population education policies originate
with the Ministry of Education; policies to promote family planning through
information, education and communication originate in the Ministry of Culture
and Information; and any change in laws related to population have to go through
the Ministry of Justice.
2.13      Policy proposals are discussed, evaluated and approved by the Office
of Planning and Coordination within the Office of the Prime Minister. Once
policies are approved, they are translated into plans and related to programs
and agencies by the Population Policy Section of the Economic Planning Board.
Since 1976, to ensure coordination among implementing agencies, there has been
a cabinet-level Population Policy Coordinating Committee, (para. 2.04 and
Annex 14, C-1). Also since 1976 a Population Policy Secretariat within the
Korean Development Institute has provided a link between population policies
and socio economic plans.
Executing Agencies
2.14      The agencies that originate population policy are in charge of
executing those policies once they have been approved and converted into



-8-
programs and plans. Many of the policies do not imply provision of services
to the public. Family planning does, and for this reason it is the agencies
implementing the family planning services provision that have become most
important in the field of population.
2.15      Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA).  Since the beginning
of the population program, MOHSA has been the major agency in charge of
implementing the family planning program (see Annex 14, C-2). Through its
Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, MOHSA is responsible for planning and
coordination and for the maintenance of the national service network. MOHSA
licenses all health practitioners, supervises the manufacture and distribution
of drugs and its approval is necessary before hospitals and clinics can serve
the public. In addition, MOHSA provides technical support and guidance for
the provincial health offices and rural health units which are administered by
the provincial governors, who in turn are under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). MOHSA is also responsible for implementation
of the emigration policy.
2.16      Provincial Governments/Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA).  MOHA is
responsible for financing and operating, through the provincial and local
governments, a network of provincial and municipal hospitals as well as the
health centers and subcenters which provide family planning services for the
population. The different Bureaus in each provincial government, including
that of Health and Social Affairs, are under the Governor and report to their
respective Ministries through the Governor (Annex 14, C-3). Technical support
and guidance for each Bureau comes from its respective Ministry. Health and
family planning services therefore come under the administrative control of
MOHA, but receive technical guidance from MOHSA. Although it appears that
such an arrangement could create problems of coordination, in practice it
works fairly well.
2.17      Korean Institute of Family Planning (KIFP).  KIFP is a semi-
autonomous organization working under the supervision of MOHSA, responsible
for: (a) all training in family planning; (b) technical guidance in family
planning for health centers and subcenters; and (c) research and evaluation
in the fields of family planning and demography. KIFP was recently assigned
the task of retraining all fieldworkers (TB, MCH and family planning) as
multipurpose workers. KIFP is at present concentrating on the improvement
of service statistics since problems of misreporting are widely recognized.
An organizational chart of KIFP appears in Annex 14, C-4.
2.18      Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea (PPFK).  PPFK was established
in 1961 as a voluntary non-profit organization and became an affiliate of the
International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) in the same year. PPFK,
acting for the GROK, is responsible for all information, education and commu-
nication (IEC) activities in support of the family planning program and
provides direct family planning services through 15 clinics in urban areas.
Until 1969, PPFK was in charge of the mobile unit program; this program was
then transferred to MOHSA, but will revert to PPFK in the near future. PPFK
has been responsible for the development of the mothers' clubs, and trains



supervisors and managers for them. PPFK has been engaged in innovative
activities such as introducing family planning to the Homeland Reserve Train-
ing Program, the Military Family Planning Program and the Industrial Site
Program. An organizational chart of PPFK appears in Annex 14, C-5. In total,
PPFK has about 351 workers, of whom 273 are in branch offices working with the
provincial governments. Although a private organization, about 40% of its
budget of $2.5 million in 1978 came from the Government, another 40% came from
IPPF and the rest from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA) and other sources.
2.19      New Village Movement (Saemaul Undong).  The Saemaul Movement was
initiated in 1970 by the Office of the President to promote greater industrious-
ness, self-reliance, cooperation and a positive attitude towards self-improve-
ment among the rural population. At first it emphasized environmental improve-
ments such as village clean-up, sanitation, house renovationsand road openings.
The movement has become nationwide and now emphasizes income-generating projects.
It attaches great importance to improving the status of women and promotes
health and family planning. In 1977, the PPFK mothers' clubs were absorbed
into the women's clubs of the Saemaul Movement.
C. Financing of Population Activities
2.20      The family planning budget for 1978 was W9.5 billion (US$19.5
million), double the budget for 1976, demonstrating GROK's renewed concern
over the rate of population growth. Since its inception, the program has
received funds totalling W41 billion (about US$102 million). The annual
budget increased slowly from 1961 to 1965, then more rapidly from 1965 to
1969, less rapidly from 1969 to 1975 and then more than trebled between 1975
and 1978 (Annex 1).
2.21      On average, the Central Government has contributed about 50% of the
family planning budget: about 19% coming from the local Governments, 21% from
foreign sources and about 10% from miscellaneous revenues. The contribution
of the National Government to the program in recent years has been more or
less stable at around 0.18% of the total national budget and about 16% of the
amount allocated for health in the national budget. This is considerably less
than in 1966, when the corresponding figures were 0.3% and 30% respectively.
2.22      Foreign aid in the form of funds, technical assistance and supplies
has been provided since the beginning of the program. IPPF began providing
technical and financial support to PPFK in 1961. Since 1962 the Population
Council has provided assistance for research, information, education and
communication, and training. The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) has provided oral contraceptives, research funds and
overseas training since 1967; the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) has provided a building for KIFP, audiovisual vehicles and equipment
and oral contraceptives; UNFPA has supported special projects in industrial
plants, low income areas and population education. The total volume of this
overseas aid has been about US$22 million.



- 10 -
2.23      It has been estimated that Korea spent about W331.3 billion on
health in 1976. Of this amount, W34.4 billion was financed by the Central
Government and W22.9 billion by the Provincial Governments. The remainder
represented private consumer expenditures. The proportion of the national
budget allocated to health, has fluctuated in the last sixteen years between
1.1% (1963) and 0.7% (1975). In 1978, the proportion rose to 1.1% (Annex 2).
In the past, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO), USAID and SIDA have supported health programs. The level of
external assistance for health activities at present, however, is small.
D. Strategy
Overall Strategy and Evolution
2.24      The population program of Korea is one of the most comprehensive in
the world. It includes the encouragement of emigration and the redistribution
of population as well as the reduction of fertility by means of delayed marriage
and an increase in the practice of contraception. Contraceptive practice is
encouraged by measures which increase the supply as well as the demand for
services. On the supply side, the program includes prescription and supply
of contraceptive devices, making use of all the basic approaches to service
delivery - clinical, outreach and inundation (widespread availability of
supplies). It offers most known methods of contraception as well as abortion.
The demand side is stimulated, not only by IEC, but also by incentives and
regulations favoring small families, socioeconomic improvement, and by the
use of community pressure. The program has had good results but: the final
goal is far from being achieved.
2.25      When the family planning program began in 1962, its approach
was purely clinical. The outreach system was introduced in 1964, when family
planning fieldworkers were assigned to health subcenters where they were
responsible for information, motivation, the prescription and supply of
contraceptive devices and referral for both IUD and male sterilization, as
well as for follow up of IUD users. In the same year the first mobile units
were set up to serve remote areas using the clinical and outreach approaches
combined. Private physicians were trained to prescribe and supply contra-
ceptive services (IUD insertion and vasectomy), and were paid by GROK on a
fee-for-service basis. The inundation approach was first used in 1968 when
mothers' clubs were formed with the object of motivating couples, referring
them for services to authorized doctors, providing condoms, jellies and foam
tablets and following up IUD acceptors. During the same year, the oral con-
traceptive was introduced as an alternative to the IUD, which was experiencing
a high discontinuation rate. The oral contraceptive and the condom were later
used for the "inundation" approach. In 1973, the grounds for legal abortion
were extended and abortion became an accepted program method. In the following
year female sterilization was introduced.



- 11 -
2.26      The next phase of the program, which began in 1974, was marked by
the introduction of a series of regulations and incentives and disincentives,
designed to induce people to have smaller families. This phase was facilitated
by the creation of the Population Policy Coordinating Committee. GROK has
thrown its full weight behind the program by making various socioeconomic
benefits depend on family size.
2.27      The Government wherever feasible uses existing service networks
as channels for the provision of family planning services. Integration of
population activities into the activities of other sectors has been an objec-
tive of the Government for some time. Emigration, population distribution and
measures to affect the demand for children and therefore for family planning
have been assigned to relevant ministries. The mothers' clubs have been
integrated into the womens' clubs of the Saemaul Movement, producing an
integration of family planning with community development activities. From
the start (1962), MOHSA was made responsible for the family planning program,
and has provided both health and family planning services, but full integration
in the sense of the use of multipurpose workers only now is beginning. This
integration is expected to bring good results.
Family Planning Services and the Health Delivery System
2.28      As of 1978, health services were provided through 284 hospitals,(of
which 72 were government),through 249 dispensaries, 202 health centers, 1,336
health subcenters and a large number of private clinics providing both western
and oriental types of medical services. There are about 81,000 hospital beds
in the country of which about 29,000 are in government hospitals and health
centers and the remainder in private hospitals and clinics. The country also
has eight maternal and child health (MCH) centers, each attached to a health
center. Family planning services are provided in most government hospitals,
health centers and subcenters, 15 family planning clinics run by PPFK, 11
mobile units and in a number of designated private hospitals and clinics.
2.29      The most comprehensive medical care is provided in the hospitals
which are mainly in urban areas. The health centers, under the administrative
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, are responsible for public
health (inspection of restaurants, food processors and other public facilities;
surveillance of water quality; communicable disease control; and pollution
control); for providing personal health care and family planning services;
and for supervising the health subcenters. Of the 202 health centers, about
60 serve urban and semi-urban areas and the rest are in rural areas (see map
in Annex 14). The staffing pattern of the health centers varies according to
population served, but all have physicians, public health technicians, dentists
and a full array of paramedical personnel as well as administrators (Annex 3).
As necessary the health center refers patients to provincial, regional,
national, or university-affiliated hospitals for further treatment.
2.30      The health subcenters (1336 at present) serve the rural areas
essentially as headquarters for the community health workers (fieldworkers),
of whom there are three at each subcenter--one for tuberculosis (TB), one for



- 12 -
family planning and one for maternal and child health (MCH) care. The sub-
centers are also responsible for health education, immunization, the preven-
tion and treatment of leprosy, venereal or other communicable diseases, the
collection of health statistics, and guidance on environmental and food
sanitation. For some of these activities the function of this subcenter is
reduced to information, screening and referral rather than to direct action.
In addition to the three fieldworkers, most subcenters are expected to have a
private doctor on call and cover a population of 10,000 to 13,000 people. The
community health workers are government employees, although generally without
permanent appointments. Most of them are nurse aides (junior high school plus
about one year of qualifying training), although some are nurses and midwives.
The fieldworkers are unipurpose workers. The family planning worker provides
contraceptive information, supplies non-clinical contraceptives and refers
patients for clinical services. The MCH workers provides ante- and postnatal
services for mothers, health care for infants, and either attends deliveries
at home or provides delivery sets for mothers to use at home. The TB worker
identifies suspected cases of tuberculosis, refers the patients to other
facilities and provides treatment for patients at home. The family planning
worker may refer patients for IUD insertion or for sterilization to government
facilities or authorized private physicians and clinics; the TB worker may
refer patients to the health center for further care. The MCH worker does not
have a practical referral system because of the lack of public MCH facilities.
2.31      Health and family planning services are also provided privately
by physicians and by midwifery clinics. These private services are usually
available only in urban or semiurban areas, and at a high price, so they are
beyond the reach of the rural population. Family planning services are also
provided through 15 family planning clinics operated by PPFK and through 11
mobile units which reach remote rural areas lacking access to regular services.
An effort has been made to utilize commercial distribution to dispense contra-
ceptives, and there have been experiments in community-based distribution.
The mothers' clubs are at present an important channel for the community dis-
tribution of contraceptives.
Information, Education and Communication
2.32      Although some health education is provided, there is, at present,
no centralized health IEC program in Korea. There is, however, a very active
population IEC program which has been organized by PPFK as an integral part
of the national family planning program, and which uses both mass media and
interpersonal approaches. A large number of films, slides, leaflets, posters,
books and magazines have been produced by the PPFK, including the successful
"Happy Home Magazine", which is distributed to all mothers' clubs (about
30,000 copies monthly). The interpersonal approach, however, has been the
more important means for motivation. In 1968, when it was clear that family
planning field workers were reaching only a small part of the population, PPFK
began to organize mothers' clubs to disseminate family planning information.
These clubs at first included only the better educated community leaders, but
membership was later opened to all mothers. By the end of 1977, there were
27,000 clubs with a membership of 750,000 mothers. The clubs have helped to
eliminate the social stigma formerly attached to family planning. One of



- 13 -
their most important activities has been the distribution of oral contracep-
tives. The IEC work of PPFK also reaches other special groups, such as the
Homeland Reserve Forces, the regular army and civil service employees and the
Enterprise Program, which focuses on motivating factory workers.
2.33      Although the IEC program has done much to legitimize family planning,
it has yet to overcome the strong preference for boys among Korean families.
This is particularly difficult in the rural areas, where about 72% of parents
still say that they must have a son. This preference is deeply rooted in
traditions which emphasize a patrilineal society and a male head of household
system. One of PPFK's efforts has been the initiation of the Two Child Family
Club, started in 1971, whose members are couples who have decided to have no
more than two children regardless of sex.
Training
2.34      The training of health personnel is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Education as is the administration of the university hospitals
attached to medical colleges. The role of MOHSA is limited to pre-service
orientation and in-service training. In the 1960s, training for family
planning was conducted mainly by PPFK and was directed basically to service
providers, who were taught how to insert IUDs and perform sterilizations and
how to provide information on contraception. Since 1970, KIFP has been in
charge of the training of service providers as well as of supervisors, and of
IEC workers as well as other government personnel only indirectly involved in
family planning. Recently, KIFP was also given the task of transforming the
unipurpose community health workers into multipurpose workers. This effort
implies giving three different types of orientation courses for the three
different types of workers so that all will be capable of performing the
comprehensive services expected of them. KIPF also conducts research into the
training needs and techniques, prepares training materials and evaluates the
training.
Research and Evaluation
2.35      The importance given to the population program made it essential to
have a research organization exclusively devoted to population research, and
in 1970, KIFP was given that responsibility. KIFP's current program includes
evaluation by means of both service statistics and survey techniques; demo-
graphic analysis; and analysis of the social and economic correlates of
fertility behavior. Health-related research is now in the hands of the Korean
Health Development Institute (KHDI) which, since its establishment in 1975,
has conducted research into the supply of and demand for health services, and
into health delivery systems. It also conducts and evaluates demonstration
projects. The Korean Development Institute (KDI) also carries out some research
at the macro level in connection with its responsibilities as Population Policy
Secretariat of the Population Policy Coordinating Committee.

E. Program Performance
2.36      The population program has been successful in promoting contraceptive
practice, reducing fertility and increasing emigration. In 1964, only 9% of
the married women of reproductive age were practicing contraception and 12%
had ever practiced; by 1976 these proportions had increased to 44% and 63%,
respectively. In 1964, only 7% of currently married women aged 20-44 years
had ever had an abortion; by 1976 the proportion had increased to 39%. Most
of these changes were due to the program, which supplied the services and
stimulated the demand for them, as well as to socioeconomic development,
which also increased the demand.
2.37      Between 1960 and 1976, the total fertility rate in Korea declined
from about 6.0 to about 3.2 children per woman. Changes in the age and sex
strleture of the population during the period account for about 1% of the
decline, and changes in the age of marriage foi. about 38%. The rest of the
decline, 61%, has been due to changes in marital fertility, primarily attribut-
able to the increased practice of contraception and abortion. It is estimated
that between 1960 and 1975, about 3.5 million births were averted, half by
contraception and half by abortion.
2.38      The primary program methods have been the IUD (accounting for about
45% of the total births averted by contraception) and the condom (accounting
for about 28%). Oral contraceptives and female sterilization were not available
in the earlier years. In the last few years, there has been a decline in the
acceptance of IUDs, condoms and oral contraceptives, to some extent compensated
for by the increased acceptance of sterilization and abortion. This may
indicate that a plateau in acceptance has been reached and that there is a
need for an intensified effort to attract more acceptors. The contribution of
sterilization to the number of births averted is sure to increase, given the
above trends.
2.39      Emigration is still too small to have an appreciable effect on the
rate of growth of population, but some progress has been made. In 1965, there
were only 1,000 emigrants; by 1973, there were 28,000; and in 1976, there
were 48,000; the number went down to 44,000 in 1977, i.e., little more than
one per thousand population.
F. Problem Areas and Program Constraints
2.40      Despite the impressive results of the population program in the
past eighteen years, Korea still faces the prospect of an increase in popula-
tion of 43% between 1975 and 2000, even if GROK's targets are at2tained.  This
will increase the density of population from 377 persons per km  in 1975 to
over 500 in the year 2000. The present density, one of the highest in the
world, is especially significant in a country with limited natural resources.



- 15 -
2.41      Even to achieve the Government objectives, the population program
will have to be considerably strengthened because of demographic trends
which will tend to increase the birth rate even if fertility were to remain
constant. Chief among these trends is the rapid increase in the proportion
of women of reproductive age which will take place in the next few years as
a result of the post-Korean War baby boom. During the period 1975-1991 the
population is expected to grow at an annual average rate of about 1.6%, while
the number of women aged 15-44 is expected to increase at an average rate of
2.1%.
2.42      A second demographic factor that may affect the birth rate is the
change in the mean age of marriage and in the proportions married. According
to the 1975 census, Korea's mean age of marriage for females was about 23.7
years. The 1976 National Fertility and Family Planning Evaluation Survey
found a mean age of marriage of 23.5 years. The difference may not be
significant, but it suggests that the peak may have been passed. If this is
so, the birth rate would increase even if fertility were to remain constant.
2.43      A third factor is emigration.  Emigration increased steadily up to
1976 but went down in 1977. GROK's objectives are based on the assumption
that emigration would increase from 44,000 in 1975 to 74,000 in 1980, and
remain constant at that level until the end of the century.   At present,
however, Korea is experiencing a shortage of skilled labor which, together
with the tendency of other countries to restrict immigration, may reduce
the number of emigrants, and thus make it more difficult to achieve the
planned growth rate.
2.44      There is also the possiblity that, as suggested in para. 2.38
above, a new plateau in acceptance of family planning is being reached, and
that a more intensive effort and new strategies will be needed to attract
new acceptors. This trend is particularly noteworthy at a time when the
number of women of reproductive age is rapidly increasing.
2.45      Contributing to the trend may be the still strong preference
for sons among Korean families (see para. 2.33). The practice of contra-
ception is still very limited among women with no sons, independent of their
age or the number of children they have. Despite strong IEC efforts in the
last few years to encourage couples to stop at two children regardless of
their sex, 61% of the "ever" married women interviewed in the last fertility
survey (1976), said that they "must" have at least one son.
2.46      If the planned population growth path is to be followed, family
planning services must be made more effective and accessible and more
emphasis must be laid on integrating services more closely with other social
programs and on incentives toward smaller families. Improved access to
services means a greater number of facilities, a better distribution of time
among fieldworkers so they can reach more people, fewer constraints to clinic
visits, different emphasis on different target groups in the population to
be visited by workers, and better IEC activities to increase knowledge about
facilities and motivate clients to visit them.



- 16 -
2.47      That there is room to make services more effective is suggested by
the still high attrition rates of IUD and pill users (47% and 68% respectively
in the first year), by the increasing proportion of people using less effec-
tive methods (4.2% in 1971 and 11.3% in 1976); by the increase in abortion;
and finally by the high proportion of currently married women not practicing
contraception and not having contact with program personnel. About 42.6% of
the currently married women of childbearing age in the country wanting "no
more children" are not current users of contraception, and about 24% have
never practiced. Moreover, practice bears some relation to contacts with
family planning personnel. About 53% of those practicing, but only 27% of
"never" users, have had some contact with family planning fieldworkers.
2.48      The services of family planning workers can be made more effective
by better training, better allocation of workers' time, the redirection of
workers' efforts toward the groups in the population with the greatest need,
changes in the target system, reduced turnover of workers, and better IEC.
Most fieldworkers are nurse aides who have at least junior high school
education, a nurse-aide training period of nine to twelve months and an
introduction to the work of family planning. This training prepares them
to do some motivational work, to supply clients with oral contraceptives,
condoms and other methods and to refer clients to health facilities for IUD
insertion or sterilization, but does not qualify them to provide elementary
health services which are often demanded by clients or to deal with the side
effects of contraception. Better medical back-up is therefore necessary.
2.49      A better allocation of workers' time is also needed.  Each field-
worker has to serve a population of about 10,000 to 13,000 people dispersed
in rural areas so that a high proportion of the working time is spent in
traveling. A reduction of the area to be covered would increase the propor-
tion of working time actually devoted to services. This reduction could be
achieved by increasing the number of workers or, better still, by combining
the functions of the present fieldworkers and reducing their area of work
(see para. 2.55 below).
2.50      The concentration of workers' efforts on people with most need
can also improve effectiveness. Under the present target system, workers
confine their visits to the people who are most likely to accept -- those
with many children and past users -- and pay too little attention to the
young married couples with few or no children who offer the greatest poten-
tial for averting births.
2.51      The present contraceptive target system, under which a target
figure for each contraceptive has to be achieved, leads workers to recom-
mend a method in which they are short of the target which is not necessarily
that preferred by the client. It would be better to assign points to each
method according to its long range effectiveness, and set each worker a
target of total points rather than a target for each method.
2.52      The turnover of community health workers is now estimated to be
about 30% per year. This high turnover implies a waste of training and
prevents the workers from gaining experience and getting to know the



- 17 -
people in their area. It is due in part to marriage and emigration, but
also, and perhaps to a greater extent, to the fact that their jobs are only
temporary, with no opportunities for advancement, and carry low salaries
and little prestige. GROK has been considering making the jobs permanent,
but has been deterred so far by the budgetary implications.
2.53      Improved IEC is also needed to improve effectiveness and to change
the attitudes of people away from son preference. Unfounded rumors about the
side effects of contraceptives and low continuation rates among well motivated
couples can both be reduced by better interpersonal and mass communication.
2.54      As mentioned in para. 2.27 above, the Government is alert to the
possibility that ministries and agencies not primarily concerned with family
planning can be used as channels for the provision of family planning
information, and possibly also services.
2.55      The most obvious application of this principle is in the health
sector, since the skills required for family planning and health are closely
related and people develop a trust in health workers which helps to make
their family planning advice acceptable. As far as management and facilities
are concerned, family planning and health have been combined under MOHSA
since the beginning of the program in 1962. At the service level, however,
they are still separate. As mentioned in para. 2.30 above, there are three
fieldworkers for each subcenter serving the rural areas. All three workers
are at least nurse-aides, but many are licensed nurses or midwives. All
three workers cover the same area and the same population and spend much
of their time traveling. MOHSA wants to make each one a multipurpose
worker providing all three services in an area about one third of the size
they now actually cover. Some of the workers have already been retrained.
Full implementation of this approach, however, awaits final approval.
2.56      Integration of family planning services with health including
nutrition services would be most beneficial. Many hospitals already have a
postpartum program, but they are mainly in the urban areas. Moreover, in the
rural areas, about 85% of pregnant women deliver their children at home, and
only 20% of the births in rural areas are attended by qualified health per-
sonnel. Furthermore, there are no traditional birth attendants in Korea as
in many other countries. An opportunity is therefore being lost to provide
postpartum family planning services to most of the rural population. The
use of multipurpose workers, and added emphasis on help by those workers in
deliveries, either in hospitals or at home, would increase the opportunities
to offer family planning services at the time when they are most likely to be
acceptable.
2.57      Family planning education is already included in the activities of
day care centers. MOHSA introduced a program of day care centers in 1970
with the help of CARE and the World Food Program, with the objective of
providing food for pre-school children, and instruction in nutrition and
family planning for their mothers. At present there are about 650 day care
centers. Most of them provide these services and at the same time offer



- 18 -
mothers the opportunity to engage in economically productive activities. A
preliminary study suggests that mothers who receive family planning educa-
tion at the day care centers attended by their children report a higher rate
of contraceptive practice than those attending centers that do not provide it.
2.58      As noted in para. 2.19, the mothers' clubs have been merged with
the women's clubs of the Saemaul Movement. Family planning services are
also being combined with the health services provided for the military,
industrial workers and government employees.
2.59      Finally, there is a need for stronger incentives and disincentives
to promote the small family norm and for still greater efforts to raise the
social and economic status of women and to encourage further delays in marriage.
GROK has gone a long way in these directions through taxation, housing prefer-
ences and inheritance laws, but more could be done to finance costs of educa-
tion for families with few children, to offer community incentives within the
Saemaul Movement for villages achieving a target reduction of birth rate and
to provide retirement benefits for families with few children.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
Project Concept
3.01      This project is designed to assist Korea in its efforts to reduce
the rate of growth of population and, at the same time, to improve family
health, reduce maternal mortality, and reduce infant and child mortality and
morbidity. Essential to the project design is the outreach of service delivery
into the community, utilizing the "at risk" approach, which allows special
attention to those in need within a framework of improved health care for all.
The project is based on the premises that: a reduction of infant mortality
will reduce fertility; there are advantages in delivering family planning
services in conjunction with health services, especially maternal and child
health services; and there is a higher rate of contraceptive practice among
women who receive instruction in nutrition and family planning in day care
centers which their children attend. The project design also takes into
account the need to make these centers more effective and accessible, and the
need for integration of family planning services with other social services.
The project has been designed not only to increase the supply of services, but
also to improve the demand for those services.
Project Objectives
3.02      The project will assist GROK to reach its objective of reducing
the birth rate from 24.3 in 1976 to 23.9 by 1981, and 22.9 by 1986. To do
this, it is necessary to increase the number of current users of contra-
ceptives from 2.0 million in 1976 to 3.1 million in 1981 and 3.9 million



- 19 -
in 1986. The number of births to be averted annually has to increase from
0.4 million in 1975 to 0.7 million in 1981 and 0.8 million in 1986. The
project will also help to increase the rate of safe deliveries from the
present 40% to 86% in 1982 and 100% in 1986; to reduce maternal mortality
from 6.3 deaths per 10,000 births in 1975 to 3.0 in 1986; and to reduce infant
mortality from 38 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1976 to 14 in 1986. These
objectives will be difficult, but not impossible to achieve, given the strong
commitment of GROK.

C. Project Description
Health and Family Planning Delivery System
3.04      To help make health and family planning services more effective and
accessible (paras. 2.48-2.55), the project will help GROK to reorganize the
community health workers and to increase the number of MCH/FP centers from
8 to 99. All TB, MCH and FP community health workers will be retrained as
multipurpose workers, each of whom will cover only about one third (3,500)
of the people now covered by the present unipurpose workers. In a second
stage, those workers not yet trained in midwifery will be trained
to assist in normal deliveries at home and to utilize the risk approach in
MCH care (Annex 4) to identify and refer risk cases to the newly established
MCH/FP centers. Each worker will therefore: (a) be in charge of surveillance,
control and treatment of TB cases among a population of about 3,500 people;
(b) provide pre- and postnatal care for about 95 pregnant women per year,
of whom about 30 will be referred to the MCH/FP center for delivery as risk
cases, and the rest will require delivery assistance at home; (c) provide
infant and child health services for about 470 children; and (d) provide
family planning services, including motivational work, contraceptive supply
and referral for IUD insertions and sterilizations to about 500 married women
of child-bearing age. As a result of these changes, the fieldworkers will
spend less time traveling and more time providing services. The wider range
of services each worker will provide will give her a higher standing in
the community. During negotiations the GROK gave assurances to the effect
that it shall ensure that all community health workers will be offered terms
of remuneration and conditions of service mutually satisfactory to the GROK
and the Bank (see para. 2.52 above). The project will also help to strengthen
the management and supervisory capability of the health and family planning
delivery system. At the provincial level the Government will appoint an
additional supervisor in the Bureau of Health Services. The provincial
supervisors will be responsible to oversee the activities of the health
centers. At the health centers, the Government will appoint an additional
supervisor to oversee the activities of the multipurpose workers and also the
activities of the MCH center. Initially these additional supervisors will
concentrate on the development of MCH services using the "at risk" approach.
Later on they will be converted into multipurpose supervisors.
3.05      Of the 91 new MCH/FP centers to be provided, 68 will be of type A
and 23 of typl B (see map in Annex 14). Type A centers will have an area of
about 1,000 m and serve between 100,000 and 200,000 people (Annex 5). They
will have 16 maternity beds. The staff will consist of 2 midwives, 4 nurses,
8 nurse-aides, a clerical officer, a cook, a janitor, a guard and a driver.
There will also be a private physician on call. It is expected that each type
A center will handle about 1600 deliveries per year, or about 40% of the
deliveries taking place in its coverage area.   Because of the extended area
of coverage, the unavailability of public transportation and the fact that
most patients will be "at risk" patients, each type A center will have a



- 23 -
four-wheel drive vehicle to transport patients.  Type 2B centers (Annex 5) will
have only 6 maternity beds and an area of about 800 m , and are expected to
attend about 600 deliveries per year, or 40% of the deliveries expected among
a population of 50,000 to 100,000. The staffing for a type B center will be a
midwife, 2 nurses, 4 nurse aides, a clerical officer, a cook, a janitor and a
guard. There will also be a private physician on call. During negociatio,,"
the GROK gave assurances that it will finance the operational expenditures of
the MCH/FP centers.
3.06      Each MCH/FP center will be attached to an existing health center
which will be upgraded, and will be under the direction of the health center
Director. The centers will provide pre- and postnatal care, delivery ser-
vices, infant and child care and family planning services. About three-
fourths of the cases to be attended in the MCH/FP centers are expected to be
risk cases and the rest normal. The centers will be located in the adminis-
trative centers of the Guns (counties) to facilitate communication with the
villages (see Annex 6). Land will be acquired by MOHSA. All MCH/FP centers
will have examination rooms for mothers and children, labor and delivery
rooms, ward rooms, space for IEC activities, living quarters for midwives, and
administrative offices. In 68 locations (not all in type A centers) where no
other day care facilities exist, the MCH/FP center will also include a small
day care center where the integrated day care center approach (Annex 7) will
be utilized. The day care centers will be equipped, staffed and operated by
the local community and will essentially be independent of the MCH/FP centers.
During negotiations, the GROK gave assurances that 2the sites for the MCH/FP
centers will be of adequate size (at least 1,000 m ).
3.07      To improve the health and family planning delivery system, the
project will also provide for the construction, furnishing and equipping
of 11 buildings for family planning clinics now operated by PPFK in rented
premises (Annex 8). These clinics will provide delivery services, thus
facilitating the postpartum approach to family planning. They will be
located in provincial capitals and serve the poorer quarters of these
cities.  Each will have a gross area of about 1,100 m2 and have a 12-bed
delivery ward. The four clinics already owned by PPFK and the 11 clinics
to be replaced will enable about 65,000 vasectomies and 71,000 tubal liga-
tions to be performed and about 30,000 IUDs to be inserted during the project
period. They will also be able to attend about 1200 deliveries per year.
The clinics will be staffed by one doctor, one head nurse, two nurse-aides,
two midwives and five other staff. Direct operational financing will not
be necessary because GROK will reimburse the clinics for family planning
services on a fee-per-case basis, and deliveries will either be paid for
by clients or by the medical insurance programs. PPFK expects the provincial
governments to donate land for the clinics. During negotiations the GROK
gave assurances that sites of suitable size (at least 1,000 m2) and location
for the PPFK clinics will be acquired before July 31, 1980.
3.08      Until recently GROK was operating 11 mobile units to provide family
planning services in isolated areas. These units have now been disbanded for



- 24 -
lack of funds to replace the vehicles. The project will increase the number
of mobile units to 13 and provide them with new vehicles and equipment.
These units will provide family planning services in remote areas and will
be simultaneously utilized for IEC activities. As the operational cost
of 11 of these units has until recently been borne by the Government, their
future operation will imply additional expenditures only for two of the
units. During negotiations the GROK gave assurances that it will continue to
finance the operation of the units. To ensure proper maintenance of the
mobile units as well as of other vehicles provided in the project, the GROK
gave assurances that the vehicles will be properly maintained and used only
for project purposes and that a system for monitoring their use and mainte-
nance will be set up.
Training Activities for Health and Family Planning
3.09      The project supports the retraining of community health workers
to become multipurpose workers, as the first step in strengthening the health
and family planning program. The training will be conducted by KIFP and will
give the workers the professional knowledge, skills and attitude on MCH, FP
and tuberculosis necessary for the concept of integrated health services and
for provision of quality care. The basic course will last two weeks and expose
workers, depending on their needs and past field experience, to concepts of
general administration, the "new village" movement, health education, maternal
and child health, family planning, tuberculosis control, control of parasites,
venereal disease and leprosy, and environmental health. The basic course will
be given to all present workers (about 4,000) and to new recruits (also about
4,000). Following the basic course, the workers will be given continuous
on-the-job training by provincial and health center supervisors. In addition,
one-week refresher courses will be offered every year and will be attended by
about 3,600 persons during the project period.
3.10      The object of the midwifery course (para. 3.04) is to provide
the multipurpose workers with the skills necessary to assist in normal home
deliveries and to identify and refer to the MCH/FP centers, cases considered
to be at risk. The course will last four months and consist of both theoretical
and practical training. The theoretical part of the course will be given at
universities selected by MOHSA. It will cover topics such as the physiology
of human reproduction, normal deliveries, home delivery procedures, neonatal
care and the identification of cases at risk. Practical training will be
provided in the field and at 18 medical institutions selected by MOHSA. The
institutions will be selected based on the following criteria: (a) either a
general hospital or a maternity hospital; (b) providing high quality obstetric
services as well as general medical and health care; and (c) handling an
adequate number of deliveries. The course emphasizes practical training and
will be given under close professional supervision. At the end of the course
the workers will be expected to assist in normal deliveries and care for the
newborn. During negotiations the GROK gave assurances that MOHSA will enter
into contracts with universities and hospitals to carry out this training.



- 25 -
3.11      The project also supports the training in family planning of
other workers, from inside and outside the health services. These courses
are for industrial site social workers (16 one-week courses); provincial
family planniag supervisors (8 one-week courses); and health center senior
administrative management and clinical workers (25 one- to twelve-week
courses); instructors (24 one-week courses); and general orientation (232
one-day courses). Theoretical training will be provided at the Korean
Institute for Family Planning (KIFP). Practical training will be provided
at hospitals designated by KIFP. The content of the courses ranges from IUD
insertion for clinical workers to general knowledge about population and
family planning for the personnel of civic organizations. The project will
support the construction, furnishing and equipping of additional training
facilities (Annex 9), the production of materials, and the incremental costs
of the training.
3.12      Each health and MCH/FP center and obstetrical department of a
general hospital will assign one of its workers to be in charge of all IEC
equipment and activities. These workers (about 400 in eight batches) will
participate in a five-day course in the principles of IEC, and the use and
routine maintenance of IEC equipment. This course will be carried out jointly
by the KIFP and PPFK. The project provides instructor fees, travel expenses
and per diem for the trainees.
3.13      The project provides funds for a two-month course abroad, in video
tape recording program production and the use and maintenance of equipment,
for thirteen audiovisual aid workers in the mobile units and five new members
of the PPFK production staff.
Information, Education and Communication Activities in Health and Family
Planning
3.14      PPFK has hitherto been solely responsible for the IEC aspects of the
family planning program. The IEC aspects of the health services have been
neglected. To ensure that people take advantage of the health and family
planning services, MOHSA will have to carry out some IEC activities of its
own. The project will provide for a media officer in MOHSA in charge of the
whole IEC component of the project. He will coordinate all IEC activities for
health and family planning; plan and supervise production; and write scripts
in collaboration with the media producers and health directors. He will also
supervise the distribution and use of materials, and monitor the use of
equipment at health centers, MCH/FP centers and hospitals. The project will
include the production of 20 radio spots; 5 television spots to be used
once monthly during the project period; 5 plays for television; and 3 color
films with 11 copies for use in Seoul, Pusan and the 9 provinces. MOHSA will
also produce cassette tape programs (five) and newspaper ads to be run five
times a year in five different dailies. MOHSA will establish a library of IEC
materials, circulate a catalogue among health centers, subcenters and hospi-
tals, and make the materials available to these and other institutions.



- 26 -
3.15      The project will also provide, through MOHSA:  (a) video tape
players as well as cassette recorders for all MCH/FP centers and OB/GYN
departments of general hospitals; (b) film and slide projectors in the 202
health centers; and (c) booklets and pamphlets to be distributed to field-
workers and clients in the rural areas. These materials will be utilized for
educational programs directed to clients in waiting rooms and to visitors and
groups such as mothers' clubs, agricultural clubs, village leaders and field-
workers. Materials for these programs will be produced by MOHSA in collabora-
tion with the private sector and PPFK, as well as by health educators in the
health centers. These programs will focus on health including family planning
messages.
3.16      The IEC program of PPFK is of good quality, but has been restricted
by shortages of funds and staff. The project will support PPFK's work in four
respects: (a) expanding production capacity by constructing, furnishing and
equipping an IEC production studio with video production capacity attached to
PPFK headquarters, which will produce materials for MOHSA as well as for PPFK,
(Annex 9), and by staffing this studio with a production manager, two pro-
ducers responsible for planning and script writing, one cameraman, one editor
and one audiovisual technician; (b) providing full audiovisual equipment for
each of the new mobile family planning units; (c) providing each of PPFK's 11
family planning clinics with video tape players. With these inputs, PPFK will
be able to produce health education, nutrition education and other materials
in support of the health and family planning programs, and to bring these
materials to the community through MOHSA's health centers and PPFK's family
planning clinics and mobile units; and (d) covering the cost of materials,
staff and other items needed to pre-test, test and evaluate its own materials
as well as those produced by MOHSA. PPFK will thus be able to improve its
materials, which have hitherto not been systematically evaluated.
3.17      As it is important that all health and family planning workers
should be familiar with modern IEC techniques and the use and maintenance of
equipment, the project will provide funds for equipment for the production of
training IEC materials at KIFP, for which part of the extension of the KIFP
buildings will be made available. Duplicating equipment will be provided
and a photo laboratory will be renovated to permit the processing of still
pictures and color slides. KIFP will collaborate with PPFK in the training
of health staff in the use and maintenance of IEC equipment.
Research and Evaluation
3.18      Research and evaluation are conducted by KIFP for family planning
and by KHDI for health.  There are, however, activities directly related
to the project that need further support. The project will therefore include
funds to support: (a) the setting up of a reporting system for the new MCH/FP
centers, including data collection, tabulation and reporting; (b) evaluation
of the midwifery training of multipurpose workers; and (c) full evaluation of
the results of the health and family planning activities undertaken under the
project. MOHSA has agreed to request proposals from at least three research
institutions (public and private) to carry out each of these research projects



- 27 -
and to award contracts on the basis of quality and cost of the proposals.
These proposals will be awarded on the recommendation, satisfactory to the
Bank, of a Project Advisory Committee (para. 3.19). During negotiations,
the GROK gave assurances that this procedure will be followed.
Project Implementation Capacity
3.19      The MCH Bureau of MOHSA will coordinate the project.  The Director-
General of the MCH Bureau will be Project Director, and the Division Chief
of the MCH unit will be the Executive Project Director.  The MCH unit will
be strengthened to enable it to undertake its project responsibilities,
and the project includes funds for salaries, vehicles, equipment and per
diem for this purpose. The IEC, training and construction components will
be coordinated by suitably trained and experienced persons. In addition,
there will be an accountant. The Project Director will be assisted by a
Project Advisory Committee, consisting of representatives of MOHSA, PPFK and
KIFP as well as of universities, the Korean Development Institute and KHDI.
The Project Advisory Committee will: (a) advise the Project Director in
matters of policy, ongoing research, coordination and implementation of MCH
and population programs; and (b) review research proposals (see para. 3.18
above). During negotiations, the GROK gave assurances that the Project
Advisory Committee (PAC) will be activated by March 1, 1980. The buildings
to be constructed under the project will be designed by executive architects
appointed by the provincial governments, KIFP and PPFK. The executive
architects will prepare working drawings and bidding and contract documents,
help to invite and evaluate bids, and supervise construction.
IV. PROJECT COST, FINANCING, IMPLEMENTATION AND RISK
A. Cost
4.01      The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated
at US$93.4 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$37.2
million, or about 40% of total project cost. Capital investment accounts
for about 91% of the base cost; the incremental operating costs of the pro-
ject for training, IEC, research and evaluation and project management account
for the rest. The cost estimates by expenditure category are summarized in
Table 1 and details are given in Annex 10.

4.02      The largest share (87%) of the base cost is allocated to the expan-
sion and improvement of MCH and family planning services.  About 7% of base
cost is allocated to training, 4% to IEC, less than 1% to research and
evaluation, and less than 1% to project administration.  The breakdown by
functional categories is given in Table 2.

4.03      The cost estimates are based on April 1979 prices.  The foreign
exchange component of the project is estimated at 40% for construction, 45%
for furniture, 50% for vehicles, 90% for equipment and 100% for special
equipment and training abroad. Local training, IEC production, research
and evaluation and project implementation are not likely to require foreign
exchange.
4.04      The contingency allowance of US$23.1 million includes:  (a) physical
contingencies, estimated at 10% of base civil works costs, furniture, equip-
ment, vehicles and professional fees; and (b) price contingencies estimated at
about 22% of the base cost plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies
were calculated on the basis of the project expenditure schedule and of an
assumed rate of foreign price increases of 7% per year for civil works and 6%
per year on other costs, and local price increases of 14% in the first half of
1979, 10% in the second half of 1979, 9% in 1980 and 8% thereafter.
4.05      In addition to the small incremental recurrent costs included
in the cost of the project, there are incremental recurrent costs associated
with the operation of the facilities to be built under the project. These
costs amount to about US$33 million for the period 1980-1983. In the last
year of the project (1983) they will be equivalent to 13.3% of the 1979
central government health budget, or about 7% of the total central and
provincial health budgets. The breakdown of these incremental recurrent
costs, including contingencies, is as follows:

GROK has agreed to finance the incremental recurrent costs of the operation of
the project facilities and has confirmed this commitment during negotiations.
B. Proposed Financing
4.06      The total project cost (US$93.4 million) is to be financed by an
IBRD loan of US$30.0 million equivalent and a GROK contribution of US$63.4
million equivalent. The loan will be at an annual rate of interest of 7.95%



- 30 -
for a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years. The loan will
finance part of the foreign exchange component of the project, while the
GROK contribution will finance the rest of the foreign exchange component and
the local costs.
C. Disbursements
4.07      The proposed loan would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  32% of the cost of civil works;
(b)  43% of the cost of furniture;
(c)  100% of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported equipment,
vehicles and materials;
(d)  100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured
equipment and vehicles;
(e)  65% of the cost of imported and locally procured equip-
ment, vehicles and materials; and
(f)  100% of the cost of training abroad.
The estimated disbursment schedule is shown in Annex 11.
D. Project Implementation
4.08      A number of public and private agencies will take part in the
implementation of the project (Annex 12). The Bureau of MCH at MOHSA,
KIFP and PPFK will have primary responsibility, but other MOHSA Bureaus,
the Provincial Governments, the Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea
(OSROK), universities and other agencies will have roles to play.
Project Management
4.09      The MCH Division of the Bureau of MCH in MOHSA, as managing agency
for the project, will: (a) define the policies and procedures to be followed
in the execution of the project; (b) prepare a program for the execution of
the activities by the different agencies; (c) issue guidelines for project
implementation; (d) coordinate the activities of the different agencies;
(e) monitor the progress of the project and submit quarterly progress reports
to the Bank; (f) enter into contracts as necessary for the execution of the
project; (g) establish an accounting system and maintain the accounts of
the project; and (h) authorize payments to contractors. To carry out these
activities, the MCH section of the Bureau of MCH at MOHSA will be strengthened
by the appointment of a construction coordinator, a training coordinator, an
IEC coordinator, an accountant, and architectural consultants as necessary.



- 31 -
4.10      The Director of KIFP, the Secretary General of PPFK, and the pro-
vincial Bureaus of Health and Social Affairs will be responsible for project
activities within their own jurisdictions and will coordinate their activities
with the Project Director and report to him on the progress of their own
activities. The Director of KIFP and the Secretary General of PPFK will be
members of the Project Advisory Committee to be set up to advise the Projec-
Director (see para. 3.19).
Construction of Physical Facilities
4.11      The construction of physical facilities will be the responsibility
of the Provincial Governments, PPFK and KIFP under the direction of MOHSA.
MOHSA will: (a) prepare a program for the planning, tendering, contracting,
constructing and commissioning of the facilities; (b) issue guidelines to
the provinces, PPFK and KIFP on these matters; (c) approve sites for the
construction of MCH/FP centers; (d) prepare prototype designs and prelimi-
nary specifications for the MCH/FP centers and the upgrading of health
centers; (e) approve final designs and specifications; (f) approve tender
documents and bid evaluations; (g) approve requests for payments to contrac-
tors; and (h) monitor the progress of construction.
4.12      PPFK, KIFP and the provinces will:  (a) enter into contracts with
the Executive Architects who will prepare preliminary designs and tender docu-
ments, assist in inviting and evaluating tenders and supervise construction;
(b) except KIFP, select and acquire the sites for the construction of MCH/FP
centers and family planning clinics; (c) prepare preliminary designs and
tender documents for the construction of MCH/FP centers and the upgrading of
health centers, family planning clinics, additional facilities for training
in the KIFP building and additional facilities for IEC production in the
PPFK building; (d) prepare final designs and documents; (e) invite tenders for
construction from prequalified domestic and foreign firms; (f) evaluate bids
and recommend the award of contracts; (g) enter into construction contracts;
(h) continuously supervise the progress of construction; and (i) submit
quarterly progress reports to the Project Director.
Acquisition of Furniture, Equipment and Vehicles
4.13      MOHSA, KIFP, PPFK and the provincial governments will prepare
preliminary lists and specifications of furniture, equipment and vehicles
for the approval of the Project Director.  The final lists and specifications
will then be sent to OSROK, which will invite tenders, evaluate bids, award
contracts and receive and distribute the furniture, equipment and vehicles.
IEC
4.14      MOHSA will coordinate project IEC activities and will also:  (a)
determine the distribution of the IEC equipment provided under the project;.
(b) prepare a program for the design, production, distribution and utiliza-
tion of IEC materials; (c) design some of the materials; (d) contract for



- 32 -
the production and distribution of IEC materials; (e) request PPFK to design,
produce and distribute IEC materials; (f) collaborate with PPFK in the
pretesting, testing and evaluation of IEC materials; (g) monitor the use and
effects of IEC materials as well as the use and maintenance of IEC equipment;
and (h) set up a library of IEC materials to be made available to other
institutions.
4.15      PPFK, as the agency responsible for IEC in family planning, will:
(a) design, produce and distribute family planning IEC materials; (b) produce
health IEC materials for MOHSA; (c) pretest, test and evaluate health IEC
materials in collaboration with MOHSA; and (d) in collaboration with KIFP,
train health personnel in the use of IEC equipment and materials and in basic
program techniques, as well as equipment maintenance.
Training
4.16      KIFP will be responsible for the family planning training component
of the project, and will prepare detailed training plans giving priority to
the conversion of community health workers into multipurpose workers. In
collaboration with the Provincial Governments, and in coordination with
MOHSA, KIFP will prepare and carry out the training programs. KIFP, in
collaboration with PPFK, will provide IEC training for about 400 persons
from the various health facilities. KIFP will also report to MOHSA on the
progress of the project training activities.
4.17      MOHSA will be responsible for the midwifery training of multi-
purpose workers and, in conjunction with universities and hospitals, will
prepare detailed programs for this training. It will enter into contracts
with universities and other institutions to carry out the theoretical and
practical portions of the program and supervise the training.
Research and Evaluation
4.18      As specified earlier (para. 3.18), MOHSA will invite proposals
from public and private research groups to carry out the research included
in the project, award contracts and monitor their execution.
Operation of Health and Family Planning Facilities
4.19      Each MCH/FP center will operate under the direction of the Director
of the health center to which it is attached, and it will be administered by
the Provincial Government and receive technical supervision from the Bureau
of MCH at MOHSA. Within the MCH/FP center itself, the senior midwife will be
in charge.
4.20      In order to ensure some community participation in the operation
of MCH/FP centers, GROK is proposing to set up for each center a Joint
Operational Committee (JOC) consisting of the Director of the Health Center,
the senior midwife, a local physician, the leader of the Saemaul Movement in
tha community and a representative of the community. This may contribute to



- 33 -
a fuller utilization of the centers. During negotiations, the GROK gave
assurances that guidelines and procedures for the establishment and function-
ing of these JOCs will be prepared by June 30, 1981.
4.21      Hitherto, the supervision of the health centers by the provincial
Bureau of Health and Social Affairs and that of the community health workers
(subcenter) by the health centers has been inadequate because of a shortage
of supervisory staff. The GROK is planning to appoint a supervisor in the
Bureau of Health and Social Affairs of each province and one extra supervisor
in each health center (para. 3.04). The latter will provide services in the
MCH/FP center when necessary.
4.22      The family planning clinics and mobile units to be donated by
GROK to PPFK will be operated by the provincial branches of PPFK in collabo-
ration with the Bureau of Health and Social Affairs as in the past. Issuance
by the GROK of an Executive Order to PPFK on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank, relating to PPFK's functions and obligations under the project,
is a condition of effectiveness.
4.23      The project will provide space for day care centers in 68 of the
MCH/FP centers, to be operated by the Saemaul women's clubs under the direction
of the provincial Bureaus of Health and Social Affairs. If these day care
centers are to be effective, they should use the integrated day care approach,
including feeding and nutrition and family planning education programs, now
being followed in the existing day care centers. Assurances to this effect
were given during negotiations.
E. Accounting
4.24      The project provides for the appointment of an accountant who will
be attached to the accounting unit of the Bureau of MCH at MOHSA. This
accountant will set up an accounting system, maintain the accounts, prepare
disbursement requests to the Bank, and have them approved by the authorized
officials in MOHSA and sent to the Ministry of Finance for approval and
transmittal to the Bank. The accounts will be subject to regular Government
auditing procedures and be open for inspection by the Bank as well as summar-
ized in the quarterly report to be submitted to the Bank by the Project
Director.
F. Procurement
4.25      The project unit in MOHSA will work closely with the Office of
Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK) for the procurement of civil works, furni-
ture, equipment, special equipment and vehicles. Contracts for civil works
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following domestic adver-
tising and local procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign contractors



- 34 -
would be allowed to participate (prequalificationof contractors would be
required). However, as Korea's construction industry is large and efficient,
and the civil works under the project would cover a large number of small
buildings widely scattered around the country, it is unlikely that they
would be of interE<, to foreign contractors. Prior Bank approval would be
required for all civil works contracts exceeding US$750,000 equivalent.
Furniture, equipment and vehicle contracts of US$100,000 equivalent and
over, except those for certain special equipment, would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines; domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of
15% or the existing customs duty, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing imports. Special video-tape equipment, costing not more
than US$500,000 equivalent, will be obtained directly from the producers of
the equipment already in use in order not to lose the advantages of standard-
ization. Equipment and vehicle purchases that cannot reasonably be grouped
to form contracts for at least US$100,000 equivalent would be awarded with-
out prior Bank approval on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
following Government procedures that are satisfactory to the Bank, provided
that the aggregate of all such contracts shall not exceed US$1,000,000 equiv-
alent. In addition, off-the-shelf items, not exceeding US$10,000 equivalent
in each contract and aggregating not more than US$500,000 equivalent will be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three quotations.
G. Project Evaluation
i    4.26       The physical progress of the project will be measured against
an implementation schedule (Annex 13). Progress in achieving targets
will be measured against quantitative indicators of services provided.
These indicators will be devised by MOHSA and approved by the Bank. During
negotiations, the GROK gave assurances that a list of such indicators will
be prepared by MOHSA by June 1, 1980. To facilitate Bank monitoring of
project implementation, the provincial governments as well as KIFP and PPFK
will submit to the Project Director quarterly reports giving, for each
component, the physical status, expenditure and performance.  The Project
Director will prepare its own report in regards to project activities to
be implemented by MOHSA.  On the basis of these Reports, the Project Director
will prepare a summary report to be sent to the Bank.  This summary report
should include sketches of the "standard" civil works designs; copies of
evaluation of bids and recommendations of award of contracts; and copies of
research proposals received by MOHSA for the three evaluation studies to
be financed under the project. The detail reports from executing agencies
would be available in Korea for review by supervision missions.
H.  Project Risk
4.27      Up to the present the Bureau of MCH at MOHSA has wanted to make
birth delivery at health facilities its principal goal and therefore wishes



- 35 -
to have 100% of those deliveries take place in institutions rather than at
home. Because of the impossibility of achieving this goal in the short to
medium term, given the lack of facilities and the traditions of the Korean
population, this project emphasizes delivery of normal cases at home attended
by trained multipurpose workers and referral of "at risk" cases to MCH/FP
centers. Failure to emphasize this approach constitutes the principal risk
for the project. Lack of emphasis on this approach would imply that the
advantages of integrating family planning with health at the field level and
the possibility of using the postpartum family planning approach at home would
be reduced. The final effects of the project would then be significantly
diminished. Understanding on the part of the management of MOHSA, that
attendance by health personnel in home deliveries is the most that can be done
at present, will certainly reduce the risk.
4.28      Another risk apparent in the project is the fact that provincial
health services are under the administrative jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Home Affairs (MOHA) and under technical supervision of MOHSA. There is there-
fore the risk that the priorities of the Provincial Governments will direct
the resources provided in the project toward other health needs, thereby
reducing the importance of family planning work in benefit of other health
work. The supervision of MOHSA, the importance that the Central Government
has given to the population problem and the effects of the reinforced IEC
campaign in increasing demand for family planning and MCH services, make this
risk rather remote.
4.29      A third risk is that the facilities to be provided under the project
will not be fully utilized. In the short run this is a real possibility
because Korean women, especially in rural areas where the project is concen-
trating its efforts, are not accustomed to delivering their children in health
facilities. This risk is diminished because of the concentration of those
facilities in "at risk" cases, because of the IEC campaign emphasizing the
availability of the facilities, and because of the work of the fieldworkers
in referring "at risk" cases to those facilities. It is not expected, how-
ever, that full utilization will be achieved immediately. Realistically it
will be some time before those facilities will operate at full capacity.
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
5.01      It is impossible to calculate precisely the direct contribution the
project is likely to make to the reduction in fertility or to the reduction
of maternal mortality, and infant and child mortality and morbidity. The proj-
ect will, however, help the Government to make family planning services more
accessible through the creation of new MCH/FP centers and family planning
clinics; to increase their effectiveness through the conversion of TB, MCH
and FP workers into multipurpose workers each covering a smaller area than at
present; and to increase the demand by increasing the scale and quality of



- 36 -
IEC activities. By providing population and health education for mothers in
day care centers, it will be easier to influence rural women to adopt new
attitudes towards family health. The project will also help to increase the
proportion of deliveries attended by qualified personnel either at home or in
MCH/FP centers. The conversion of community health workers into multipurpose
workers will make possible better pre- and postnatal care and better care for
infants and children. By the end of the project period, the MCH centers
should be able to handle about 150,000 births a year or about 30% of the
number of births in rural areas. In addition, the multipurpose workers would
have the capacity to help in about 200,000 deliveries at home. This compares
with direct attendance for only about 27,000 births at present. The services
provided by these workers include delivery, pre- and postnatal services,
screening of at-risk mothers for reference to MCH facilities, infant care,
family planning services and TB control, and will reach at least 50% of the
rural population. It is estimated that about ten million people would be
provided primary health care services under the project. By helping the
Government achieve its objectives of reducing the rate of growth of popula-
tion, the project will also help slow down the pressures on land resources,
reduce the possibilities of high unemployment and increase per capita in-
come at a higher rate. It may also facilitate the improvement in income
distribution.
Project Justification
5.02      This project is justified on four basic reasons:  the high density
of the country; the difficulties in reducing fertility further; the trends
toward higher birth rates in the near future; and the consequences of addi-
tional growth in population for the economy.
5.03      The Republic of Korea is, after Bangladesh and a few city-states,
the most densely populated country in the world. Even though it has been
able to reduce its rate of growth of population significantly, any new addi-
tions will worsen the already overcrowded environment which, besides putting
heavy demands on the scarce natural resources of the country, tends to worsen
the problems of pollution and damage to the environment. While other coun-
tries with a much higher rate of growth can afford more people, at least in
the short run, because of the relative abundance of land, Korea cannot afford
this and has consequently pursued a strong population program that encourages
even permanent emigration of its citizens.
5.04      Fertility in Korea has reached a level where any new reductions
require significant costs. During the 1960s fertility was so high that
reductions could be obtained with moderate program effort and socioeconomic
development. The present situation is showing a plateau in the acceptance of
effective methods of contraception, the drop-out rates among users of pills
and IUD's are relatively high compared with those in other countries, and
abortion is on the increase. These barriers may in part be due to the still
strong son preference which makes women desire at least one son and perhaps
more. Efforts to make families desire two or three sons instead of four
have to be strong. Efforts to make families go from desiring two sons to
stop at two children regardless of the sex of the children have to be stron-



- 37 -
ger still. The latter is required in Korea at present. The job is more
difficult among the rural population of low socioeconomic status and that is
the population to which this project is directed not only with services but
also with a strong IEC campaign.
5.05      If fertility is not reduced, the birth rate will increase again in
the near future and thus bring about an increase in the rate of growth of
population. These circumstances would occur because of the increase in the
proportion of women of reproductive age among the population (a consequence of
the baby boom after the Korean War) and because of a likely reduction in the
mean age at first marriage. To reduce the birth rate or even to maintain it
at present levels, it is necessary to reduce fertility to counteract the
effect of the trends observed in age distribution and age of marriage.
5.06      Reducing fertility and the rate of growth of population is needed to
moderate economic problems. Even if the Government's objectives in population
can be achieved, by the mid-eighties between 5-7.5% of GNP will be required
just to give the added population present standards of living. Employment in
rural areas has been declining and this will force future population increases
to be concentrated in the cities, increasing congestion, pollution and the
demand for public services. The additional population will require the
standard of living of the cities, not that of the rural areas. Moreover,
employment creation is not likely to occur as fast as the increase in the
labor force, bringing about a higher rate of unemployment. Agricultural
production has increased at a commendable pace in the last fifteen years and
made the country almost self-sufficient in rice, but limitations of arable
land and the cost of energy may place this self-sufficiency in jeopardy with
more growth in population. Although the project will not eliminate the
problem of population growth and its effects on the environment and on the
economy, it will certainly help the Government come closer to the solution of
this important problem in the country.
5.07      The project is also justified on health grounds:  the poorer popu-
lation in rural areas do not have access to reliable health services, most
deliveries take place at home without the assistance of medically trained
personnel and immunization is still short of needs. The reductions in mortal-
ity and morbidity that this project can help to bring about, especially among
women and children, are likely to be sufficient to justify the Government's
investment in health services through the present project.
VI. AGREEMENTS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained to the effect that
the GROK shall:
(a) ensure that all community health workers engaged at health
facilities under the project will be offered terms of
remuneration and conditions of service mutually satisfactory

acquire2not later than July 31, 1980 adequate sites (at least
1,000 m and suitably located) for the construction of MCH/FP
centers and PPFK family planning clinics (paras. 3.06 and
3.07);
(d) ensure that vehicles acquired under the project shall be
properly maintained, used exclusively for the project and
that a system for monitoring the maintenance and use of the
vehicles shall be established (para. 3.08);
(e) cause MOHSA to solicit proposals from at least three research
institutions for each of the following items: establishment
of a reporting system, evaluation of the midwifery training
and evaluation of the results of the project; and that such
proposals shall be evaluated by the Project Advisory Committee,
whose choices shall be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.18);
(f) establish, not later than March 1, 1980, a Project Advisory
Committee with representatives of MOHSA, KIFP, the Korean
Health Development Institute, the Korean Development Institute,
PPFK and universities having health care expertise to advise
the Project Director on matters of policy, program development
and research (para. 3.19);
(g) ensure that establishment at each MCH/FP center of a Joint
Operational Committee (JOC), consisting of the Director of
the health center, the senior midwife of the MCH/FP center a
local physician, the leader of the local Saemaul Movement and
one or more community representatives; and submit to the Bank
for comments, not later than June 30, 1981, guidelines for
the establishment and functioning of such Joint Operational
Committees (para. 4.20);
(h) ensure that the financing and operation of the day care centers
to be established within the MCH/FP centers to be built under
the project, will follow the same pattern as that of the day
care centers now following the integrated day care approach
(para. 4.23); and



- 39 -
(i) devise, not later than June 1, 1980, detailed quantitative
indicators satisfactory to the Bank, to measure program
progress (para. 4.26).
6.02      As condition of loan effectiveness, the GROK shall issue an Execu-
tive Order to PPFK, the contents of which shall be satisfactory to the Bank,
relating to PPFK's obligations and functions under the project.
6.03      With the above assurances, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$30 million equivalent on standard terms to the Government of the Repub-
lic of Korea.

RISK APPROACH FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH CARE
1.         The "risk" approach is a managerial strategy for health services,
in particular for serving mothers and children. Individuals and groups with
an increased expectation of complications or disease are defined as being "at
risk"; they are identified as early as possible and interventions made to
reduce the risk. This strategy allows special attention to those in need
within a framework of improved health care for all.
2.         Risk factors may be defined as the characteristics or circumstances
of a person or group that are associated with an increased risk of having,
developing, or being especially adversely affected by a morbid process.
First pregnancy, high parity, too frequent pregnancies, pregnancy at the
extremes of reproductive age, previous child loss, and malnutrition are
examples of universal risk factors, which increase the chances of a poor
outcome of pregnancy. For the infant, large families, crowding, illiteracy,
and poor sanitation are well known examples of risk factors, e.g. for gastroen-
teritis as for a number of other diseases. Certain risk factors are specific
for particular outcomes, but more often one risk factor - grand multiparity,
for example - increases the frequency of various undesirable outcomes.
In some situations, culture and customs may act as risk factors by
limiting the education or status of women, by prescribing or withholding certain
foods during pregnancy, or by perpetuating unhygienic practices. In others,
the climate, the nonavailability of certain foods, or poor environmental sanitation
increase the risks for both mothers and children.
3.         Detection of risk factors requires a knowledge of the characteristics
associatedwith poor outcomes, the ability to recognize and measure them, and
contact with every woman and child in the community. Some factors are easily
detected even by the minimally trained health worker, e.g., age, parity, maternal
height, and previous fetal or child loss. With increased training, the proportion
of detectable factors increases, leading to improved precision in predicting
outcomes. Measurement of blood pressure, detection of twin pregnancy, and estimation
of haemoglobin level are examples of methods of detecting further risk factors
during pregnancy that require additional resources. For the infant, the measurement
of birth-weight, monitoring of growth, and knowledge of feeding practices all give
desirable bits of information that permit the detection of risk factors and facili-
tate early intervention.
4.         Intervention strategies need to be developed in response to the health
problems of women and children in each locality, taking into consideration
individual characteristics as well as the effects of the physiochemical, bio-
logical, and social environments.  The needed intervention may well involve not
only treatment of the individual to reduce risk but also community advice on
family spacing, health education to change feeding patterns, and development
programs to improve food production and environmental sanitation.

and Child Health Care", Offset Publication No. 39, 1978.

Decisions must be taken, based on local patterns of epidemiology and
availability of resources, as to the action to be taken at each level and
the tasks of each member of the health team, including policies for referral.
These, in turn, have clear implications for training and supervision and for
the organization of the health services generally.
5.         A health information system is an essential part of the strategy,
providing, at levels consistent with local resources, information on the
population at risk, the services provided and their utilization and the
results achieved. This knowledge can then be used to extend coverage, to
change practices, to reallocate resources, and to monitor the consequences
of such improvements.
6.         Information needed for decisionson strategy includes both community
factors based on population data (or best estimates) and individual factors for
the pregnant women and children. Community factors include:
- Marriage and family formation patterns
- Cultural patterns, special taboos, and religious practices
- Education of women, their status and employment outside the home
- Economic patterns - socioeconomic indices (i) generally, and (ii) of
defined sub-groups
- Nutrition, dietary habits, and availability of foods
- Age-distribution of pregnant women
- Parity distribution - spacing, birth order
- Fetal and child loss
- Environmental sanitation
- Prevalent infections and other endemic diseases
- Acceptability and utilization of available MCH/FP services
7.         Examples of characteristics that define individuals at higher risk,
and possible interventions follow.

KOREA
DAY CARE CENTERS
1.       Day care centers in Korea provide care to the children of working
parents. They are administered by the Saemaul Womens' Clubs, with support
from the Bureau of Social Affairs of MOHSA. As of December 1975, there were
574 licensed   day care centers, 505 of them providing the integrated
approach.
2.       A typical day care  center employs a director and, depending on
the size of the center, between 3 and 9 attendants and aides. The directors,
most of whom are professional administrators, educators and welfare workers,
administer the centers. Attendants feed, teach and supervise the children,
and counsel the mothers regarding child development, supervision and child
care; over 90% of the senior attendants and about 55% of the junior attendants
have received professional training. About 75% of the centers care for 70-90
or more children. On average, there is about one staff per 15-18 children.
3.       The clients of day care centers are primarily low-income families
with working mothers and small children. About 88% of the mothers are aged
26-40 years.  About 35% of the mothers in the urban areas attended high school,
while only about 19% of those in the rural areas did. All the children are
of preschool age; about 92% are between 4 and 6 years old.
4.       The integrated day care center approach was begun in  the early 1970s
with support from CARE, the World Food Program and MORSA. It provides food
for pre-school children and instruction for their mothers in nutrition
education and family planning. The objective is to promote an integrated
system for the delivery of these services.
A. Feeding Program
5.       The objectives of the feeding program are:
(a) To provide an acceptable feeding service for pre-school
children.
(b)  To improve the child's physical condition-measured by
morbidity and anthropometric indicators.
(c) To promote the participation of children in the program.
6.       The feeding service provides nutrition supplements--lunch and two
snacks--to children everyday except Sunday. The daily ration of 150 grams
of flour, 70 grams of corn-soy blend, and 25 grams of vegetable oil, is
supplied to 35,000 children, 300 days a year,l/ through the auspices of the
World Food Program.  Compared with children in day care centers without the
integrated approach, the children participating in the feeding program
experienced fewer colds, stomach problems and serious illness, and were taller
and weighed more (controlling for age, sex and rural/urban variables).
B. Nutrition education
7.       The objectives of the nutrition education program are:
(a) To increase the mother's knowledge of the nutrients essential



51                              ANNEX 7
Page 2
in maintaining good health for her children and other
members of her famr--.
(b)  To help the mothers to apply their knowledge, acquired in
the nutrition class, in day-to-day living.
(c) To promote the participation of mothers in the nutrition
education class.
8.       Ten nutrition education classes are conducted by CARE nutritionists
at each center each year. About 40 mothers attend the class at any one time.
Mothers learn such things about nutrients and food habits in relation to the
health of children as milk-feeding, weaning, the proper food for patients,
pregnant women and balanced diets. Mothers are also encouraged to put what
they learn into practice, although some cannot afford to do so. Mothers who
participate in the integrated program show a far better knowledge and practice
of nutrition principles than mothers who do not.
C. Family Planning education program
9.       The objectives of the family planning education program are:
(a) To increase mothers' knowledge of family planning and to
promote a favorable attitude toward family planning.
(b) To help mothers to practice family planning.
(c) To induce mothers to participate in the family planning
education class.
10.      Ten family planning education classes are also conducted by CARE
nutritionists at each center each year. Family planning and maternal and
child health are discussed. Mothers who have participated in the program
have been found better informed as to the purposes of family planning, more
supportive of the program, understand better why they support the program,
and prefer male children to a lesser extent. About 80% of the mothers
participating in the program use a method of contraception whereas only 59%
of those not participating do so. In the rural areas, this difference is even
more marked: 87% and 55%, respectively. These mothers also evidenced greater
satisfaction with the method theywere using (65% and 40%, respectively).
Nearly two-thirds of the mothers participating in the program reported that
they started to practice family planning after they had attended the education
class, while only 7% of mothers not participating did so.
11.      There is a high degree of participation in and support for these
programs. They serve not only those participating directly, but to friends
and relatives of participants. The number of fathers participating in the
family planning class has also been increasing. The integrated day care center
approach provides an excellent opportunity for expanding the integrated service
delivery network.
