KEMUBU IRRIGATION PROJECT
S UIMMAR Y
i.        The Government of Malaysia has requested a Bank loan to help
finance the Kemubu Project to provide irrigation for 47,000 acres in the
State of Kelantan in Northeast Malaya.
ii.       Irrigation farming, particularly rice growing, is important to
the Malaysian economy.   Bringing additional water supplies to rainfed
areas, together with providing a dependable water supply for the existing
irrigated land in this area, will permit double cropping of paddy.   This
will offset some of the rising imports of rice and provide more food for
an expanding population.
iii.      The project would require construction of a pumping station on
the Kelantan River, an irrigation distribution system, a drainage system
and improvement of river channels to accommodate the drainage water. The
cost of the project, which would be carried out over five years, is
estimated at M$ 55.55 million (US$ 18.52 million), including interest
charges.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would be M$ 30.00 million (US$ 10.00
million), and would amount to approximately 54 percent of the cost of the
project.   The proposed Bank loan would meet the foreign exchange cost
of the project, amounting to M$ 26.13 million (US$ 8.71 million), and
interest during construction on the loan of M$ 3.87 million (US$ 1.29
million).   The balance of M$ 25.55 million (US$ 8.52 million) would be
met by the Government from regular sources of funds for development.
Ancillary works and services would be financed through regular Government
budget.
v.        The project would be executed by the Drainage and Irrigation
Division (DID) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.    The major
project works would be constructed by contract after international com-
petitive bidding.   There is a competent staff organization for the
operation of the project.   The proposed project works have been soundly
planned and the cost estimates are realistic.
vi.       The Government has agreed to increase water charges and land
taxes to cover costs of operation and maintenance, and as much as practic-
able of the capital invested in the project.
vii.      Water charges and taxes wcald be assessed by the Government and
shared between landowners and tenants on such a basis that tenant-cultivators
would have an incentive to maximize production.    These charges would be
collected by the State Government.

- ii -
viii.     Tne economic benefits from the project include an increase in
annual net farm benefits from paddy-growing estimated at M$ 12.2 million
as full double ^ropping and increased yields are reached in approximately
12 years. The rate of return to the economy would be about     percent.
The investment v.ould result in import savings of approximately M$ 23
million per year.
ix.       The project is souad and suitable for a Bank loan of US$ L0.00
million for a term of 25 years, includi.g a grace .period of five years.
The borrower would be Malaysia.

KEMUBU IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governnent of Malaysia has requested a Bank loan to assist
in financing the construction of the Kemubu Irrigation Project, comprising
82,000 acres (47,000 acres net) of the coastal plains of Kelantan State in
northeast Malaya.   The area is bounded on the west by the Kelantan River
on the north by the outskirts of Kota Bharu and on the south by the
Tongkat hills (see Maps, annexes 1 and 2).
1.02      This report contains an appraisal of the project based on the
findings of a Bank mission composed of Messrs. T. Threlkeld, Jo Willems,
J. Douglass (Consultant) and J. Guillard (FAO Consultant) which visited
Malaysia in February 1966.   Documents prepared by the Malaysian
Authorities and the two Consultants who worked on the scheme during the
period 1960-196b (Sir Wgilliam Halerow and Partners and SOGREAH), were
available to the mission.   At the time of the mission's visit, it was
anticipated that electric power would be used for pumping.  The power
rate quoted by the National Electricity Board did not make use of electric
energy attractive and, as a result, it was decided to install diesel
engines to drive the pumps.   This decision was only recently reached and
is reflected in this report.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.01      Agricultural production represents about 34 percent of Malaya's
G.D.P. and agricultural products about 6O-65 percent of total exports.
The most important export crops are rubber, oil palm and coconut products.
The annual growth rate of agricultural production for the States of Malaya
is currently assessed at 3.6 percent and that of population at 3.0 percent.
There is a pressing need to produce more basic foods domestically,
especially rice, to meet the growing demand of the rapidly increasing
population, and to curtail the imports of basic foods.   Despite the in-
creased production, Malaysia continues to be a large importer of rice and
rice production has not increased in proportion to the demand.
2.02      Farming in the States of Malaya is practiced with varying degrees
of intensity over 6 million acres of the country's gross area of 32.4
million acres.   This represents less than one acre of cultivated land per
inhabitant.   The flatter arable lands are mainly confined to the coastal
plains and the southerm half of the country.   Mountainous areas and
jungle preclude agricultural practices in other areas.
2.03      Government financed irrigation programs, which are important to
Malaysia, account for more than half of all capital expenditures for water
control purposes.   Drainage schemes, concentrated along the coastal areas,
improve and protect land under rubber, coconut, rice and other crops.



III. *rTE PROJECT AREA
A,   General
3.01      The Kemubu Irrigation Project area is in the northeast of Malaya
in the State of Kelantan, approximately 400 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur,
the capital of Malaysia.   It is about 60 north latitude and lies on a
flat, slightly sloping, alluvial plain 17 miles wide paralleling the cast
coast along the China Sea.   Inland to the west, the area is bounded by the
Kelantan River.
3.02      The coastal plain is a highly productive agricultural area,
mostly devoted to rice and rubber and, to a lesser extent, tobacco.
Bananas, other fruits, vegetables and livestock are grown in farm plots for
local consumption.
B. Climate
3.03      The climate within the project area is tropical.  The heaviest
rainfall occurs during the northeast monsoon period, November through
January.   High intensity showers of short duration over limited areas are
frequent during this period.   Rainfall records show wide differences in
precipitation between stations in daily rainfall, as well as in monthly and
in annual totals.   Rainfall in excess of 30"1 a month is not infrequent.
Temperatures range from a high of about 98°F to a low of 60°F in December.
Daily temperature ranges usually between 95°F and 73°F.  Relative humidity
ranges between 40 and 95 percent.
3.04     Light winds up to 10 m.p.h. are usual in the dry period and 30
m.p.h. in monsoon, but tlhe area does not have the tropical hurricanes as
they follow a more northerly track.  Tides vary from about -4 feet to +7
feet m.s.l.
C.   Present Irrigation Development
3.O5     A substantial portion of the project area is dependent solely on
rainfall for successful cultivation of paddy.  There are three existing
gravity irrigation systems and one pump system within the project area.
Each of these gravity systems involves a diversion dam on a stream, a main
canal and distribution system to deliver irrigation water to supplement
rainfall for growing a main season crop.   None of the streams have
sufficient flow to furnish a water supply for an off season crcp.
3.06      The Salor Irrigation Project is located in the bend of the
Kelantan River and now irrigates h4,100 acres from a pumping plant located
on the right bank of the Kelantan.   The Kemubu Project can serve the lower
eastern half of the Salor area and it is proposed that 2,000 acres of the
Salor area be in the future served by Kemubu.



-3-
3.07      On the opposite side of the River from the project area are
two irrigation schemes designed to provide a dependable wuter supply for gr.A4ng
double crop paddy.   Pasir Mas Pump Irrigation scheme was completed in
1958 and serves the area between the Kelantan River and the railroad line.
The Lemal Irrigation scheme was commenced in 1960 as an extension of the
Pasir Mas project and covers the area west of the railroad.    The main
season water supply is obtained by a diversion from the Lemal River.
To provide a dependable off season water supply, a pumping plant is under
construction on the left bank of the Kelantan River. The existing, or
under construction, pumping irrigation schemes all drawing water from the
Kelantan River downstream from the Kemubu Project are:

Lemal           23,000                 4                  800
3.08      The project area of 47,000 acres may presently be classified as
followed:
a)   6,000 acres supplied with irrigation water sufficient
for single crop of paddy.   The area is presently
served by 3 diversion schemes.
b)   2,000 acres which receive water from the Salor pump-
ing scheme sufficient for single crop paddy.
c)   The remainder of the project area of 39,000 acres,
which is presEntly solely dependent on rainfall for
single cropping.
D. Population and Industry
3.09      The population of the project area is estimated to be 80,000,
the majority of which are engaged in, or dependent upon, rice cultivation.
Fishing, rubber, coconut, lumbering, weaving and service industries are
also important to the area.
1/  Total existing area.   With Kemubu Project, Salor would continue
to serve 2,100 acres with balance served by Kemubu.



-14-
3.10      The population is predominantly Plalayasian.       Malaysians
of Chinese descent are negligible in number.
3.11      There appear to be adequate facilities for rice milling of the
present output and for services and marketing of paddy and other crops
grown in the area.
E.   Transportation
3.12      The general area is served by a number of roads down the East
coast and to Kuala lumpur.   Coastal shipping is to Tumpat, port for
Kota Bharu.   Kota Bharu is on the railroad connecting Singapore and
Kuala Lumpur with points in Thailand.
3.13      Water buffalo and oxen are the predominant farm animals, but very
feni carts are used on the main roads.  Trucks, cars and bicycles carry
most of the transportation load.   Motor-scooters and three-wheded trishaws
are numerous in Kota Bharu.
3l14      Malaysian Airlines maintain daily service between Kuala Lumpur
and Kota Bharu;  tri-weekly Kota Bharu to Alor Star and Penang.
IV.   THE PROJECT
A.   Definition
4.01      The Kemubu Project would provide irrigation water for growing
two crops of paddy per year on 47,000 acres of the coastal plains in the
State of Kelantan.
4.02      The project works include the installation of a pumping station,
construction of canals, irrigation distribution system and a drainage
system. River channels would be improved to accommodate the drainage
water.   Water will be pumped from the Kelantan River into the main canals.
The project would include facilities for operation ard maintenance and
provision for Consultant services.
B.   Project Wdorks
4.03      The Division of Irrigation and Drainage retained a consulting
firm (SOGREAH) to plan major works of the project and perform the necessary
investigations to choose the locations and prepare designs and cost estimates
for the following:
Kemnubu Pumping Plant
4.04      The plant will be located on the right bank of the Kelantnn River
just downstream from the confluence with the Kemubu Rivwr.    The plant is
to be of conventional design with 5 pump units, each having a hydraulic



-5-
capacity of 250 cusees.   The pump lift will vary according to the stags
of the river.   The static pump head will normally be about 24 feet and
be a maximum of 31.5 feet when the river stage is low.   Normally, the
full irrigation demand can be supplied with four pumps operating.   The
fifth unit will be used for standby.
4.05      The National Electricity Board has constructed a diesel powered
electric generating plant at Lemal to furnish power to the Lemal Irrigation
Scheme.   This station is about 12 miles from Kemubu.   Efforts by the
Drainage and Irrigation Division to negotiate electric rates with the
Board for Kemubu have been unsuccessful in achieving rates competitive with
the costs anticipated for use of diesel driven pumps.   Therefore, diesel
engines have been chosen as the power source to drive the pumps.
14.06     The south Canal will act partially as a reservoir and,as the
water level drops, successive pumps will be brought into service until the
water level is restored.   This will be accomplished automatically by
control devices on the engines actuated by the water level in the canal.
Canals
4A.07     The main canals would be in open cut and unlined, except in those
sections where geologic conditions dictate the need for some type of lining.
4.08      The irrigation area has been divided into three zones.   The con-
struction program is designed to develop irrigation progressively in each
zone.
Kelantan Canal, Zone I
4.09      The canal system will serve the 13,930 acres of project land
lying between the Kelantan River and the Ketereh River.      The Limbat
Main Canal branches off the Kelantan Canal.
South Canal, Zone II
4.10      This canal will serve 20,830 acres in the southeastern portion of
the project.  WIater for Zone III is also carried in this canal.
Peringat - Banggu Canal, Zone III
This zone comprises the interior and northeast portion of the
project and serves 12,240 acres.   Water for this zone is carried in the
South Canal to a hranch of the Keterch River, where it is released to
be rediverted at Ketereh Dam into the Peringat Canal.
Irrigation Distribution System
.-12     The main canals serve to feed a series of secondary canals which
in turn supply the tertiary system.   The area to be irrigated has been
split into irrigation units of approximately 48 acre size.    The water for



- 6 -
each irrigation unit will be delivered frcm the tertiary system to an
earth ditch, called a quarternary, which will take water to the highest
point of the irrigation unit.  Water will successively overflow from the
highest plots in the unit to the lowest, until it reaches a waste ditch
at the low end of the unit which will then lead to the drainage system.
Under this system, all plots within an irrigation unit must be at the same
stage of paddy cultivation so as to have similar requirements for water.
The project will include all main, secondary and tertiary canals and turn-
outs to the quarternary system. The quarternary system from the turnout
to the irrigation unit is to be constructed by the water users and no
allowance for their construction is included in the estimates of cost.
The system is laid out with sufficient capacity to deliver 1 cusec per 60
acres of land.   To provide flexibility, the turnout capacity is 2 cusecs
to each irrigation unit.
Project Lands above South Canal
4.13      Two thousand acres of project land lie above the South Canal and
will require that water be pumped from the South Canal to serve them.
Three small pumping stations are proposed with appropriate pipe discharges
to serve these lands.
Diversion Dams
4.14      To make the most use of locally available water and to reduce
the need to pump at Kemubu, three diversion dams are included in the plan.
The dams at Seligi and Danan would divert water from streams of the same name Ito
the South Canal.   The South Canal is laid out for downstream control and
is broken into level reaches by automatic gates.  Water diverted at Seligi
and Danan can be used to meet requirements on the lower end of the South
Canal to the extent water is available.   The Ketereh Diversion Dam serves
to divert locally available water into the Peringat - Banggu Canal and also
to divert water released from the South Canal into Ketereh River during
those times when the retereh River flow is not sufficient to meet water
requirements in Zone III.
Drainage System
4.15      Project drainage will be into three main streams, the Peng Datu
River., the Kermsin and Semerak Rivers.        The channels of these streams
will be improved by remDving vegetation along their banks and by enlarging
the channels where they are now inadequate.  A secondary and tertiary
drainage system is to be constructed to convey drain water from project
lands to the main drains.   The capacity of the secondary system will be 1
cusec per 11 acres and of the tertiary system 1 cusec per 12.5 acres.
This will remove excess rainfall having a frequency of occurrence of once
in five years in a sufficiently short period that paddy will not be sub-
merged for more than three days.
4.716    The drainage system cannot prevent local flooding in the low
lying areas near the coast and some 5S,000 acres along the Kemasin River



- 7 -
and 6,000 acres along the Semarak River could still be affected by flooding
during the main crop season.
4.17      The capacity of the main river channels used for drainage is
impeded by the presence of fish traps near their mouths.   The traps are
semi-permanent structures made largely of bamboo stakes and would be removed
by the Government if they impede drainage discharge too much.
Kelantan and South Dikes
.18       The high flood stage of the Kelantan River at Kemubu is +53 feet.
To protect project lands from flooding by the Kelantan, dikes are to be con-
structed on the rIght bank of the river and along the South Canal.   Weirs
are to be provided in the dikes to allow exceptionally large floods to over-
flow the Kemubu lands.   The weirs are located at depressions which the
Kelantan Canal will cross in siphons.
Operation and Maintenance Facilities
L.19      The project would provide office space for the administrative
staff and housing for all employees.   Besides the office, 30 houses ranging
in cost from M$ 8,000 for a gate keeper to M$ 45,000 for senior staff, will
be constructed,   Laborers will be housed in 10 Labor Lines.    Equipment to
be purchased is shown in Annex 3.
C. Water Supply
General
4.20      The water supply for the production of 47,000 acres of two crops
of paddy per year will be derived from three sources: (1) rainfall; (2)
diversion of locally available water at Ketereh, Danan and Seligi Dams; and
(3) water pumped from the KeLantan River.   The main irrigation supply will
be the pumped water which will be used to fu\m ish the water requirements
when they are not met by rainfall or by locally divertable water.
Rainfall
4.21      The rainfall pattern is largely governed by the monsoon.   Unlike
most of southeast Asia, the main rains occur during the nortlheast monsoon,
November through January, from winds off the South China Sea.    As these
winds reach the land, cooling occurs with resultant precipitation.    The
period of least rain is usually February - April in the lull before the
southwest monsoon is fully established.    During the southwest monsoon, the
area is in the rain shadow from the mountains.    The annual rainfal, as
meRsured at Kota Bharu, varies from 85"' to 160?' and averages 11)L". Rainfall
records are &vailable, *rith some gaps in record, fram 1932 to the present
time. Shorter records are availablh from other stations in the project area.
h-22      Planting of paddy is often delayed because of lack of rain to
allow transplanting.   In many years, the northeast monsoon tapers off pre-



- 8 -
maturely and there is not sufficient rain to mature the crop properly.
Rains are not dependable enough to justify planting an off-season paddy
crop,   Irrigation will assure adequate water to dependably plant and
mature the-main season crop and provide a water supply for an off-season
crop.
River Discharge.
4.23      There are no records of discharge at the sites of the three
diversion dams.   The Consultants estimated flows available for diversion
as a function of rainfall.   Any errors in appraising divertable water at
these points would only affect to a minor degree the estimate of water to
be pumped at Kemubu.
4.24      Flows available at Kemubu Pumping Plant are appraised on the
basis of a gauging station maintained at Guillemard Bridge about 12 miles
upst ream.  There are no withdrawals of water or major tributary inflow
in the intervening reach.   As it is believed there is little loss in this
reach, the flows recorded at the bridge are taken as available at the pump-
int plant without adjustment.   With some gaps in reocrd, values for daily
discharges are available from August 1949 to the present.   Such records
were examined for periods of low flow and it was found that periods of flow
less than 4,000 cusecs were very infrequent and of short duration.    From
this it was concluded that the Kelantan would provide sufficient water for
a dependable supply to Kemubu of 1,000 cusecs without adverse effect on
downstream pumping plants,
D.   Water Requirements
4.25      Project water requirements are based on two paddy crops per year.
It is believed that initiaIly there will be a tendency to grow a long term
variety for the main season crop followed by a short to medium term variety
for the off season.   Ultimately, it is believed the practice will evolve
to growing two medium term varieties, each having a term of 130-150 days
between nursery planting and harvest.
4.26      The maximum requirement for water will occur in the presaturation
period prior to transplanting the off season crop.    This will normally
take place in the period from late March into April.   This period is
normally quite dry and the system is designed to deliver the full require-
ments of 12" of water to the land in a 30 day period.    This is equivalent
to 1 cusec per 60 acres.
4.27      Theestims.ted water requirements appear reasonable and represent-
ative of good practice in the Project area.    (Annex 4).  The nursery beds
would be planted at appropriate times to meet the schedule for field pre-
paration and transplant.   Annex 5 shows how irrigation water would be
pumped to supply the irrigation requirements in a typical year.



-9-
Losses
4.28      The 8"' of water supplied per month at the field during the grow-
ing season is considered adequate to meet the evapo-transpiration require-
ment of the crop and losses to deep percolation.   An allowance of 12 per-
cent has been made for conveyance losses and iastage in the irrigation
system.
Downstream Requirements
b.29      There are two existing pumping plants and one under construction
downstream from the site of the Kemubu Pumping Plant.   These have a com-
bined capacity of 1,030 cusece.   A future pumping plant is contemplated
to serve the town of Kota Bharu.   The unregulated flows of the Kelantan
iivor    are adequate to meet the requirements of Kemubu and the downstream
users under all except the lowest flow conditions.
Water Quality
430       No chemical analyses of waters from the Kelantan River were
made.   However, the runoff of the river is derived from a heavily vegetated
drainage aroa and the water has been successfully used for paddy irrigation
without deleterious effects at Salor and Pasir iMas so the flows are con-
sidered to be of good quality for irrigation.
h.31      The Kelantan is tidal below Kota Bharu.   In no event could
Kemubu be affected by salt water intrusion.
E.   Soils, Topography and Drainage
h.3?      The coastal plain, approximately 18 miles in length and 17 miles
in width, consists mainly of alluvium deposited by the river systems which
rise in the mountains to the southwest and traverse the plain in a
meandering course eastward to the China Sea.
4.33      A reconnaissance soil study has been made of the project area by
a soils chemist of the Malays~ian Department of Agriculture (see Annex 6).
The study indicates that the soils are suitable for irrigated paddy
cultivation.
4.34      The irrigation area is a  gently sloping plain crisscrossed by
numerous drainage channels meanderingin a complicated interlace, but flow-
ing generally in a northeast direction.   The general slope is from
elevation 50 feet on the western edge of the project to about 10 feet on the
eastern side in a distance of some 12 miles.   Some isolated hilly outcrops
rise 300 - 800 feet above the average level of the plain.
4.35      Surface drainage to remove excess rainfall and to drain the paddy
fields prior to harvest is provided by natural slopes, open cut channels
and by improvement of natural streams.   These empty into a series of rivers
which discharge into the sea during low tide periods.



- 10 -
4.36      Subsurface drainage is impracticable in the tight, relatively
impervious soils.   The dry season water table is 10 - 14 feet below
ground level.   The top soil dries 6 to 12 inches deep with closely spaced
open cracking.   When saturated, there is almost no percolation through
these tight soils.   Salinity and alkalinity are not expected to be problems.
F.   Present and Anticipated Crop Production
4.37      The project will provide irrigation water for 47,000 acres.Present
paddy yields, as estimated for the irrigated and rainfed areas in the pro-
ject over the last few years, average about 1,950 lbs. per acre for single
cropping. The pump irrigated portion which grows double cropped paddy
yields 4,500 lbs. per acre per annum.
4.38      Projected yields are based on various assumptions regarding the
rate of development of double cropping.   Experience with double cropping
in Province Wellesley and in Kelantan at Pasir Mas and Salor has been taken
into account.   It is anticipated that double cropping will be generally
applied over the whole scheme by the sixth year after water for double
cropping becomes available.   Recognizing that there will initially be
problems in extension, credit, use of fertilizer, etc., it is anticipated
that double crop       elds will be about 5,000 lbs. per acre at the
beginnin         le cropping in 1971 and that by the time the whole project
is double cropped, yields would increase to 5,600 lbs. per acre.   A further
gradual increase should take place up to approximately 6,160 lbs. per acre
per year in the tenth year.   Improvements in varieties, together with
improvement in extension, education, use of credit and other inputs, should
accelerate this process.
4.39      Present cultivation is mainly by buffalo- or oxen-drawn implements.
Government tractor units will be available on a hire basis.    The Govcrn-
ment subsidizes fertilizer purchases, thus making it more readily avdil-
able to the farmer.
G. Land Tenure
4.140     The average landowner in Kelantan possesses about a half acre of
village land where he lives, and about two and one half acres of paddy land.
Large land properties are scarce and no holdings exceed about 20 acres.
About half the paddy land is owner-operated, the other half is tenant-
operated in a crop-sharing system.   A high proportion of the tenants own
their village home site and rent paddy area.   Nearly half of the tenants
change every year.   The common rent practice in Kelantan is 50 percent of
the crop to the owner, who normally pays the land tax, the water charges
and half the cost of fertilizers.
4.41      The Government asked the Ford Fbundation to carry out a survey of
the land tenure problem.   The results of the survey indicate that rents in
general have increased, particularly in areas where double cropping developed,
and concludes that strong legislation and Government support are required to
prevent the major benefits of double cropping accruing entirely to the land-
lords.



H.   Marketing and Prices
4.42      Rice marketing in the Kemubu area is determined by the general
rice policy of the Malaysian Government and  by local circumstances.    The
general rice policy is to promote domestic production of rice and ensure
an adequate national stockpile.   The domestic production is supported by
guaranteed paddy prices, which at the moment stand at M$ 16 per 133-1/3
lbs. for preferred varieties, the long grain Thai type, and M$ 14 for other
kinds, mostly the glutinous Taiwan rice.   This price is at the moment more
or less in line with C.I.F. prices for comparable varieties.    The farmer
does not always receive the full guaranteed price because of deductions
made by rice millers for transportation, bagging, moisture content, quality
etc.; which often reduces the price paid the farmer to about M$ 12.
4.43      Government and cooperative rice mills have been established in
the area, but because of delayed payments from the new mills and complicated
Government procedures, the farmer appears to prefer the private mills.
The newly created Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority intends to
ensure that the farmer is promptly paid a fair price and that processing
charges are reasonable.
4.44      The marketingsituation is complicated in the Kemubu area by the
profits possible from smuggling rice across the Thai border into Malaysia
and the presence of several hundred small inefficient and illegal rice
mills.
I.   Construction Cost Estimates
4.45      The cost estimates for the project are based on preliminary
designs for the pumping plant and the 2,000 acres above the South Canal
and on detailed designs, scaled quantities and unit prices for all
irrigation and drainage features in the three irrigation zones.
4.46      The cost estimates include all works to be built for the project
and for purchase of 0 & M equipment needed to supplement that now avail-
able.   The equipment needed is detailed in Annex 3.
4.47      Unit costs were chosen by the Consultants from data furnished by
DID, which reflect actual costs of similar type work being done in Malaya.
A contingency allowance of five percent is included for those items for
which detailed estimates are available and 15 percent for those items for
which there are only preliminary estimates.     Costs are included for
supervision of construction.   The cost estimates are considered reason-
able.
4.48      Details of the construction cost estimates are given in Annexes
8 and 9 and are summarized, including interest during construction on the
loan system, below:

J.   Operation and Maintenance Cost Estimates
4.49      The operation and maintenance costs are estimated to be M$ 1.0
million per year at full development and are detailed in Annex 7.    The
annual operation and maintenance costs of the project are estimated in M$
million as follows:
Year      1st   2nd   3rd   4th   5th   6th   7th   8th    9th   10th

The payment of these charges is discussed in the section entitled "Water
Cnarges and Taxes".
K.   Financing
4.50      The proposed Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange component
of the investment consAing of imported equipment and spare parts, materials,
shipping costs, consulting services and interest during construction.
4.51      The amount of the proposed loan would be M$ 30.00 million (US$
10.00 million), including M$ 3.87 million (US$ 1.29 million), interest
during construction.   The balance of the project costs of M$ 25.55 million
(US$ 8.52 million) would be met by Government development budget allocation.
14.52     The expenditure schedule for construction of the project (in-
cluding disbursement of foreign exchange, but excluding interest) (Annex 9)
would be approximately as follows:

V.   ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      The DID of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives would be
the executing agency for construction of the project.   The DID was
established in 1932 to develop and administer the water resources of
I4.laysia.  It has successfully established an organization and has carried
out irrigation developments totalling 330,000 acres and is currently
carrying out a further 280,000 acre development of the Muda River Irrig-
ation Scheme.   It is capable of expanding its operations to include super-
vision of the Kemubu Project in addition to its other commitments.
A.   Construction
5.02      The planning, design and construction of the Kemubu Project is
the responsibility of the Director of the Division of Irrigation and Drain-
age (DID).
5.03      A consulting firm (SOGREAH) has done the planning and exploratory
work for the pumping plant, the main canals, the irrigation distribution
system and drainage system.
5.0h      The construction of works would be done by unit price contracts
after international bidding. Specifications and tender documents for the
irrigation and drainage facilities have been prepared by the consultants.
It was agreed during negotiations that a consultant firm, acceptable to
the Bank, would be engaged to supervise construction of all works, including
canals and drains. Distribution works would be done by international and/
or Malaysian contractors, who are capable of handling this work.   Procure-
ment of pumps and equipment would also be through international bidding.
5.05      The schedule for construction is shown in Annex 9,    Under this
schedule, water would be available in Zone I for irrigation of an off
season crop two years after construction is started, and for double
cropping of the area thereafter.
B.   Operation and Maintenance
5.06      The operation and maintenance of the Kemubu Irrigation Project is
to be under the supervision of the State Drainage and Irrigation Division.
The State Drainage and Irrigation Engineer, with headquarters in Kota Bharu,
will supervise the project, but will receive technical supervision and
approval of annual budgets by the Drainage and Irrigation Division of the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The State Drainage and
Irrigation Engineer now administers present irrigation schemes totalling
26,750 acres in Kelantan.   This aren will increase by 20,000 acres over
the next two years, exclusive of Kemubu.
5.07      The 0 & M organization would be expanded to handle the 47,000
acre Kemubu irrigation area. It would include a Drainage and Irrigation



Engineer, an Assistant Engineer, a Technical Assistant, a Chief Irrigati3n
Inspector, five Irrigation Inspectors, ten Irrigation Overseers and such
other staff as may be required.   The State Drainage and Irrigation
Mechanical Engineer would supervise the workshops and the operation and
maintenance of all mechanized equipment and vehicles.   With recruitment
and training during construction and development periods, a competent and
adequate organization will be available.
C.   Research and Extension
5.08      There is an experimental station in the project area at lundang.
The work carried out there, together with the work carried out at other
stations in Kedah, Perlis and Province Wellesley, appears adequate for the
project.   Extensive work has been done and is continuing on new varieties
of rice and double cropping of paddy.   This work should be extended to
altemrative crops under irrigation.
5.09      In addition, Government should expand the agricultural extension
services required to reach double cropping production goals.   The Gcvern-
ment should also increase the present cadre of agricultural officers in
the State, provide shorter-growing rice varieties, improve the fertilizer
program and make available additional mechanical equipment.
5.10      Senior extension staff should consist of one State agricultural
officer and two assistant agricultural officers, each of whom would in
turn supervise junior agricultural assistants.   The total requirement of
junior agricultural assistants is estimated at 20 on the basis of one
assistant for no more than 1,000 farm holdings and an assumed total of
20,000 farm families.   Recruitment of additional staff will commence at an
early date and build up gradually to provide the increased staff required
as the double cropping acreage expands.   The Government and the State of
Kelantan, has undertaken to carry out an adequate program for research and
agricultural extension services as outlined above.
D.   Agricultural Credit
5.11      Credit facilities for paddy farmers in Malaya are largely
dominated by the traditional moneylender, middleman, shopkeepers, pawn-
shops and village leaders.   Kelantan is no exception.
5.12      As elsewhere in Malaysia, the activities of the Cooperative Credit
Bank (the Apex Bank), have been very limited and not too successful.    In
the Kemubu area, there are 66 cooperative credit societies with about
2,500 members, that is, about five percent of the number of potential
members.   Loan volume has been declining since 1960/61 when a crop failure
led to arrears in repayments.   Much of the fertilizer now bought by farmers
is acquired from dealers against repayment in kind (paddy) at the end of the
crop season, which means that the actual price to the fanmer is about double
the official price.
5.13      There are various plans to improve the credit situation:   cooper-
ative credit unions, farmer credit associations, credit through the newly



- 15 -
established Bank Bumiputra and regulations for trading rice. All are aimed
to break the hold of the trader on the farmer.
5.14      The credit situation was discussed with the Malaysian Government
and it was strongly emphasized that, under the commitment made in a supple-
mcntal letter regarding credit in the Muda agreement, the Government should
create an adequate credit system for the rice irrigation schemes. At the
request of the Government, a Bank mission visited Malaysia (December 1966)
to advise on the appropriate steps that need to be taken. As the first step
in establishing a credit system the Government will submit to the Bank, not
later than 15 months after signing the Loan Agreement, plans for a proposed
credit system.
E.   Water Charges and Taxes
5.15      The water charge for Class I irrigated land in Kelantan is now
M$ 6.00 per acre single crop and M$ lOo0O  double crop.   This land grows
one ton or more of paddy per acre in one crop. The State proposes to in-
crease gradually the per acre charges until they reach M$ 15 per acre after
double cropping in the new area is achieved and when farmers have the
financial ability to pay.
5.16      An assessment of M$ 15.00 per acre on 47,000 acres would amount to
M$ 700,000, or about 70 percent of the annual operation and maintenance cost
of M$ 1.0 million.
5.17      The water charge should be paid by the farmer on irrigable land.
If the tenant farmer's rent is limited to 50 percent of the first crop and
25 percent of the second crop, the landowner should pay half of the fertil-
izer costs for the first crop and one quarter of these costs for the second
crop. If this system is followed, the farmer or tenant can pay the full
water charges of 10 15 per acre and still have sufficient incentive for
double cropping (see Annex l0)o
5.18      A supplemental land tax assessed only on the landowner would provide
additional funds for paying 0 & M costs and partial amortization of capital
costs. Assuming rent payments as proposed in the preceding paragraph, the
landlord's rent income (excluding charges and taxes) would increase from
about M$ 98 at present, to M$ 162 per acre in the future (see Annex 10). In
the meantime, the value of his land will be more than tripled from about
N$ 900-1,000 per acre to over M$ 3,000 per acre. Under these circumstances,
it would appear reasonable to increase the land tax to M$ 25 per acre from
the present nominal amount. For 47,000 acres, this would amount to about
M$ 1.1 million per year, which, together with about M$ 700,000 received from
water charges, would pay the 0 & M costs and leave about 1$ 800,000 per year
available as a contribution toward amortization. A commitment to increase
water charges and land taxes to recover 0 & M coats and as much as practic-
able of monies invested in the project was obtained from the Government and
State of Kelantan during negotiations for the loan.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project contemplates irrigation to intensify the cropping
pattern from partially irrigated single cropping of paddy to total double
cropping of paddy, the basic food for the Malaysian population.
6.02      The direct investments of this project are estimated at Mi$ 51.69
million, amounting to about M$ 1,100 (TUs$ 367) per acre. On-farm in-
vestments will be very limited, as no settlement is involved and paddy
growing is the present agricultural pattern.   Besides irrigation irater,
there will be complementary inputs such as extension, credit, fertilizer
and possibly mechanization, the cost of which is reflected in the cost-
price figures used to compute the net value of production. It is con-
servatively expected that full realization of the potential of the project
will take about 12 years because of the various institutional elements
involved.
6.03      The production of paddy on the Kemubu Project is estimated to
increase from 40,500 tons of paddy presently produced to 117,500 tons in
the future. This increase represents about 51,000 tons of rice. This
quantity can replace imports of an estimated value of about M$ 23 million
per year. This is about equal to the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the project. The project will also expedite the development of a cash
economy in one of the low income States of the Federation. The Kemubu
farmer, in general, is intelligent and hard working and it can be assumed
that he will try to develop the full.benefit of irrigation in this area.
As an additional benefit of irrigation development, other cash crops' such
as tobacco, vegetables and fruits, are likely to further raise the
productivity and income of the area.
6.04      Discounting the annual benefits over the life-time (30 years) of
the project, the rate of return to the economy would be     percent;V.  The
beneTit for the individual will be determined by various factors: credit
and marketing development, satisfactory tenure and water rate regulation
and adequate education and extension. So far, the response to double
cropping possibilities in other small adjacent areas indicate that the
Kemubu farmer will certainly use this chance to increase his production
and income. Average farm cash budgets, as shown in Annex 10, indicate an
expected increase of 2 to 3 times in the net cash income of the farmers
after development of the scheme. The tenant operator should experience
a net increase in income of M$ 220 per year from 2.5 acres irrigated. For
the same size of farm, the owner operator should have a pet increase of
M$ 520 per year and the landowner a net increase of M$ 60 after payment of
water charges and land tax as outlined previously.
I/ For assumptions used in these calculations see Annex 11.

VII* CONCLUSIONS AND RECONMENDATIONS
7.01      Irrigation is important in Malaysia and, in particular, to the
rice growing economy of Kelantan.
7.02      The Federal DID with Consultants will be responsible for the
construction phase of the project and the State DID will be responsible
for the administration of the scheme.   These are capable of executing
and operating the project.
7.03      Incentive tofarmers isessential.   Therefore, water charges
and taxes on land in the project area should be assessed and shared
between landlords and tenants on such a basis that tenant-cultivators
will have an incentive to maximize production.
7.04      The cost estimates are realistic.   The project is sound and
economically justified and is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 10.00
million, including interest during construction of US$ 1.29 million.
The Borrower would be Malaysia and an appropriate term would be 25 years,
including five years of grace.

KEMUBU SOILS
Whilst a scientific soil survey of the area was never fully
completed, the area has been growing rainfed paddy rice for a great
number of years with considerable success.
The following is a short description gathered from Depart-
mental files and verbal discussions with the Goverr4ment Soils Chemist.
The alluvial plain consists mainly of soils belonging to the
Main Plain Association derived from river terraces and alluvia.
Series have been mainly classified from the parential material of the
upper, middle or lower terraces.   They are generally yellowish-brown,
varying from sandy-clay to clay-loam textures.   Continuous main
season paddy cultivation has developed on upper clayey-grey impervious
horizon, while the lower horizons are more loamy and yellow and allow
free draining.
This type of soil, very suitable for paddy cultivation, covers
the main part of the project area (approximately two-thirds of the area),
particularly in the westem and norther parts.     However, in the north-
east corner, marine clays overlying muck and peat give more impervious
and acidic top soil over highly drainage-impeded horizons.    Over-
saturation of these soils must be avoided by carefuXl water applications
and by good drainage to permit oxygenation.   In the south, heavy
colluvial materials descending from the neighboring hills have resulted
in granite-wash soils, varying from sandy clays to coarse sands. These
heterogenous soils have low moisture holding capacity, and are often
cultivated with "broadcast" paddy, as they do not afford sufficient
moisture conditions for transplanting.   Availability of water will
strongly improve the output of these soils.   Application of fertilizers
is desirable because of their lower average fertility.
Adjacenu to the project area on its eastern side lies the soil
area known as the Bris Association, or Rudua-Rusila Association.    This
includes two strongly contrasting soil types, both very poor and with
low development potentialities.   Between long ridges of highly leached
white sandy soils, parallel to the coast, water-logged dark colored
peaty swamp soils occur.   Any extension of the project onto these soils
should be avoided.

KEMUBU PROJECT
Operation and Maintenance Costs
Under present arrangements on the existing irrigation projects
in Kelantan, the State pays the costs of maintaining the supervisory and
clerical staff and the irrigation overseers and inspectors. Relatedly,
the State also pays for supporting services such as housing for the State
paid people and office supplies. The State traditionally also pays the
annual depreciation on equipment needed for project operation and also
the petroleum products required and repairs on the equipment. Such costs
as are paid by the State are normally financed as a regularly budgeted
item.
The project water users are normally assessed a water charge
which is intended to finance all costs not paid by the State as budget
items. Such costs include maintenance, all labor not directly related
to operation, equipment drivers, pumping plant operators, diesel fuel,
etc.
Following is a tabulation of 0 & M costs with full development
segregated by:
(i) Administration
(ii) Operation
(iii) Equipment
(iv) Maintenance
(v) Pump Plant
Items (i), (ii) and (iii) are normally State budget items.
Items (iv) and (v) are project costs and not State budget items.
For Bank projections, all items are classified as 0 & M costs.

Farm Cash Budgets
The scheme would increase the farmer's cash-income considerably.
Based on the average farm size of 3 acres (2.5 acres irrigated and 0.5
acres village land) the budgets would be as follows:
For the Share-cropper:
Present      After development of double cropPinR
M$                          M$
Oross cash income           200                         520
Production expenses          26                         125 /
Net Cash Income             174                         395
For the Farmer-Owner
Present      After development of double cropping
M'                           M$
Gross cash income           322                       1,060
Production expenses           0                         263 1/
Net Cash Income             272                          797
The increase in net cash profit is impressive (2 to 3 times the previous
level) because under the present system only a rather small surplus is
left after the subsistence consumption of paddy by the farmer. Under
double cropping the whole of the second crop becomes available for
marketing.

Increment in net return includes value of family labor, which is not cal-
culated as cost. (The ratheer small plots in the project area make it
possible to rely only on family labor).
Costs are used as follows:
Investment Cost           M$ 51.7 million
0 & M Costs               M$  1.0 million per year
Extension Costs           M$  0.5 million per year

Lifetime of project 30 years. Maximum increment in net return reached in
twelfth year after beginning of construction.
1/ This is the present, rather low, farmgate price received by the
farmer.   If, in the future, rice marketing and milling practices
would improve as hoped for, this amount could increase maybe 15 -
20% and thus raise the return.
