countries in the world with an annual per capita income of US$260 in 2002, nearly 70 percent of
the population in poverty and nearly half of the children malnourished (Project Appraisal
Document, World Bank, 2003e, henceforth cited as PAD). Between 1997 and 2001, following
decades of economic stagnation and downturn the country had sustained four years of positive
real growth and low inflation, and the public deficit was under control. However, following the
contested first-round of elections in December 2001, Madagascar plunged into a deep political
crisis at the beginning of 2002, which had a significant negative impact on national income for
2002, in the form of foregone direct investments, physical destruction, and losses resulting from
the cessation of tourism, transport, export processing industries, and mining activities (PAD). At
the time of appraisal, Madagascar showed signs of a promising new beginning under the newly
elected Government of President Ravalomanana, which embarked on unprecedented public sector
and governance reforms in order to gain the confidence of private investors.

2. Sector background. Madagascar is richly endowed with minerals and precious stones, such
as sapphire and rubies. At the time of appraisal, 2,300 mining operators were active in the sector,
generating employment for about 100,000 miners and seasonal employment for an additional
500,000 workers (PAD, p. 3). Between 1996 and 2000, the value of official mining exports,
mostly of precious stones, had more than doubled from US$16 million to US$37 million.
However, poor governance and corruption discouraged formal investments and led to the
smuggling of precious stones out of Madagascar with very little value added created in the
country (PAD, p. 3). The value of illegally trafficked precious stones was estimated to be in the
US$200-500 million range, at the time equivalent to 10 percent of GDP per year. In addition to
most of the artisanal and small-scale mining being conducted outside the formal channels, a series
of mining rushes in gemstone mining exacerbated social conflicts, environmental damage, and the
substantial loss of fiscal revenues. At the time of appraisal, the Government thus considered
formalizing mining operations a key step towards improving internal revenue generation in
Madagascar, which, in turn, was considered a key prerequisite to financing anti-poverty and
service provision programs (PAD, p. 4).

3. Rationale for Bank assistance. At the time of Project approval, the World Bank had been: (i)
the leading provider of technical assistance in mining countries in Africa and Latin America and a
contributor to the significant expansion of mineral activities on both continents; and (ii) the prime
supporter of mineral sector reforms in Madagascar through the Bank-funded Mining Sector
Reform Project (MSRP). This Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL), implemented between
January 1999 and December 2002, succeeded in establishing an investor-friendly legal and
regulatory framework, including mining-related environmental regulations; and a Mining
Cadastre, which was a major milestone as it awarded and managed mining rights in a transparent
and non-discretionary way. As a result of these successful sector reforms, along with its
involvement in other related operations, the World Bank was uniquely positioned to support the
Government in addressing persisting institutional constraints, such as: (i) the lack of capacity to
enforce the new mining code, considered a prerequisite to integrating artisanal and small-scale
mining into the formal economy; (ii) serious governance issues in the management of mineral
resources, notably the mining of gold and gemstones, at the sub-national level; and (iii) limited
availability of geological information which hindered private investments in the sector. The
Bank’s involvement was further expected to play a catalytic role in attracting additional support
from bilateral Development Partners. The Mineral Resources Governance Project (henceforth

                                                 1
referred to as “the Project?), which built on the achievements and lessons learned from the LIL
(see Section 2.1), represented one of the priority instruments in the Government’s post-crisis
recovery strategy.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4. The Project Development Objective (PDO) as stated in the main body of the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)1 was: “to assist the
Government of Madagascar in implementing its strategy to accelerate sustainable development
and reduce poverty in Madagascar through the strengthening of governance and transparency in
the management of mineral resources, with special emphasis on small-scale and artisanal mining?
(PAD, p. 2). The wording of the development objectives in the Project Design Summary in
Annex 1 of the PAD differs substantially from that in the main text of the PAD: 1) Strengthening
transparency and governance in mining; 2) Key institutional reforms for the decentralized
management of mineral resources; and 3) Promote private investments and value-added in the
sector. The development objectives in the Additional Financing (AF) Project Paper (PP) (World
Bank, 2007b, henceforth cited as AF PP) were the same three PDOs as the ones stated in Annex 1
of the PAD. The assessment of the Project’s performance in this ICR will be based on the three
PDOs and Key Performance Indicators listed in Annex 1 of the PAD, given that: (i) the Project
Design Summary in Annex 1 was an integral part of the Board-approved PAD; (ii) the Board-
approved Additional Financing Project Paper cited them as the original Project objectives that
“would remain unchanged? under the Additional Financing (AF PP, p. 2); (iii) and they are more
focused on outcomes for which the Project could reasonably be held accountable, compared to
the higher level objectives of accelerating sustainable development and reducing poverty stated in
the main text of the PAD, DCA and Financing Agreement for the Additional Financing. Table 1
below shows the PDOs and related Outcome/Impact indicators as defined in Annex 1 of the PAD.

  The exact wording in the DCA was: “to assist the Borrower in the implementation of a strategy designed to accelerate
sustainable development and reduce poverty in Madagascar through the strengthening of governance and transparency
in the management of mineral resources, with special emphasis on small-scale and artisanal mining (DCA, Schedule 2,
p. 15). The wording of the first part of the PDO in the Financing Agreement (FA) for Additional Financing (AF) was:
“to assist the Recipient in the further definition and implementation of a strategy? (FA for AF, Schedule 1, p. 6).


                                                          2
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

5. The PDOs were not revised. At the time of approval of the Additional Financing Credit (IDA
Credit 3754-1) in 2007, 13 new indicators, comprised of nine mining-related, and four petroleum-
related indicators, were proposed in the Additional Financing Project Paper to measure the
Project’s performance in relation to its expanded scope of expected outcomes (AF PP, p. 13). The
Financing Agreement (FA) for the Additional Financing contained five of these as “performance
indicators? (FA, p. 10), which were primarily output indicators. Given that the Financing
Agreement was the legally binding of the two documents, the assessment of the Project’s
performance will include the five (intermediate results) indicators listed in the Financing
Agreement. The purpose of the Additional Financing was to finance additional activities, within
the existing Project components, in order to respond to the surge of large-scale mining projects
and oil exploration in Madagascar at the time (PP for AF, p. 4).

6. The additional performance indicators, comprised of four mining-related and one petroleum-
related indicator were (FA, Schedule 2, p. 10):
(i)   No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, updated hydrocarbons law and
      regulations, also addressing environmental concerns have been prepared in line with of
      international practice, and a draft law has been submitted to the Parliament.
(ii) No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, the fiscal framework for mining,
     including large scale investments, has been reviewed to include adjustments to optimize
     fiscal revenues, while maintaining a competitive edge to investments, and a draft law has
     been submitted to the Parliament.
(iii) No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, methodologies to control ASM
      rushes and to manage conflicts between ASM activities and protected areas have been
      developed and are ready for implementation at central and decentralized level;
(iv) Within 24 months from the date of effectiveness, the National Geological Survey and the
     integrated sector data bank and information systems have been established and are operative;
(v) No later than by December 2009, financial mechanisms for long term sustainability of
    mining institutions have been established and are operative.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. The Project’s main beneficiaries included:
         Government agencies, who were to benefit from activities aimed at strengthening their
          capacity to implement the new mining-related legal and regulatory framework;
         Public mining agencies at provincial, municipal and communal levels, who were to
          benefit from training aimed at making the administration of mining rights more efficient
          and the enforcement of mining-related regulations more effective;
         Private foreign and domestic mining investors, who were to benefit from the non-
          discretionary award of mining rights, security of tenure, and the accurate geological
          location of concessions;
         Gemstones cutters and polishers, who were to benefit from an enhanced capacity to add
          value to Gemstones locally and from improved access to markets’;
         Gemstone buyers and exporters, whose businesses were to benefit from improved export,
          certification and control procedures;

                                                 3
      Artisanal miners, who were to benefit from improved awareness of mining regulations,
       environmentally more benign technologies, and occupational health and safety
       precautions, as well as from enhanced access to mining titles and markets;
      Local Mining Communities, who were to benefit from improved access to health and
       education services as well as basic infrastructure as a result of a better regional
       distribution and local generation and use of mining-related revenues.
      Madagascar’s population in general, which was to benefit from improved protection
       from mining-related environmental damage and the enhanced provision of basic
       infrastructure and social services as a result of increased mineral sector tax/royalty
       revenues.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8. The Project comprised the following four components (PAD, pp. 8ff.):

    Component 1: Strengthening transparency and governance in mining (US$ 6.22
       million, about 16 percent of total Project cost at appraisal) was to support measures to
       improve governance in the management of mineral resources, with particular focus on
       curbing gemstone smuggling in the artisanal and small-scale mining sub-sector.
       Activities under Component 1 included reforming the mining sector's legal and
       regulatory framework; supporting the establishment of decentralized mining
       administration offices close to exploitation sites; and creating a program for the
       certification and quality control program of gemstones, including a one-stop shop for
       gemstone exports and gemstones exchanges with specific focus on strengthening private
       sector associations.
      Component 2: Key institutional reforms for the decentralized management of mineral
       resources (US$ 8.63 million, about 22 percent of total Project cost at appraisal) were to
       advance the decentralized management of mineral resources through re-organizing and
       strengthening public mining agencies at the provincial and communal levels, and by
       empowering communities to play an active role in the management of mineral resources.
       The Project was to create six provincial-level offices aimed to oversee the environmental
       management of mining titles at the provincial level, extend access to cadastre information
       to the municipal level, and pilot decentralized tax collection in ten communes.
      Component 3: Promoting private investments and value-added in the sector (US$ 20.18
       million, about 52 percent of total Project cost at appraisal) was to entail the creation of a
       Mining Sector Promotion Agency (Agence de Promotion du Secteur Minier) and the
       strengthening of geo-scientific information though airborne geophysical surveys,
       geological and geochemical mapping and associated Data Bank to attract private sector
       investment. Furthermore, this Component was to improve the Government’s capacity to
       coordinate interventions related to artisanal and small-scale mining, including
       certification procedures, administration of a small grants program, dissemination of
       information, environmental management, and extension services.
      Component 4: Project coordination and management (US$ 2.67 million, about 7
       percent of total Project cost at appraisal) was to support the existing Project
       Implementation Unit (PIU) responsible for the day-to-day management of Project
       implementation, including procurement, financial management, reporting, monitoring
       and evaluation, coordination of Project activities with the Steering Committee and other
       public entities.

1.6 Revised Components

9. The Components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

10. Changes in Implementation Schedule. The Project was approved by the World Bank’s
Board of Directors on May 13, 2003 and became effective on September 22, 2003. Its closing
date was extended twice, by a total of 42 months (3.5 years): (i) from its original December 31,
2008 closing date to December 31, 2010 in conjunction with the approval of an Additional
Financing credit on April 23, 2007 (without restructuring) by the World Bank’s Board of
Directors to “assist the Government of Madagascar in [the] continued sustainable management
and good governance of the mineral resources? (PP for AF, p. 3), and to coincide with the
Additional Financing credit’s closing date; and (ii) through June 30, 2012 (without restructuring)
per approval by the Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa Region in October 2010.

11. Changes in funding allocation. The project was financed by an IDA credit in the amount of
US$32 million equivalent, and an Additional Financing IDA credit in the amount of US$8.0
million equivalent was approved in April 2007. The Government was to provide a counterpart
contribution in the amount of US$4.45 million to the original IDA credit, and in the amount of
US$0.8 million to the additional IDA credit. The purpose of the latter was to finance: (i)
additional/scaled up activities to be carried out within the realm of the original components (see
paragraphs 12 and 13 and activities highlighted in italics in Table 2 below) in order to increase
Project impact and to meet the Government’s expanded focus to include large scale mining and
broader objectives for the extractive industries (PP for AF, p. 3); and (ii) cost overruns.

12. Under Component 3, the actual contract value for the airborne survey exceeded the budget
estimate by US$1.63 million (see Section 3.3), mostly due to increases in fuel prices as well as
commodity prices as a result of risen demand for services associated with the exploration boom in
the industry globally (Reallocation Memo, December 7, 2007). Furthermore, additional
geological and geochemical analyses had to be conducted to harmonize the work and
interpretations provided by the three main geological survey contractors covering the country.
Under Component 4, operational expenses exceeded original forecasts mainly because of the
three and a half year extension of the Project duration (see Section 3.3) as well as the
internalization of the set up and operational costs of key institutions, such as the Gemology
Institute of Madagascar, the Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank and the Large-Scale
Mining Investment Commission whose attainment of autonomy and financial independence took
longer than expected.

13. Changes in the scope and scale of planned activities. The originally identified Project
activities addressed overall mineral sector issues, with a clear focus on support to the artisanal
and small-scale mining (ASM) sub-sector, in accordance with Government priorities at the time
of Project approval. However, in order to respond to the new development of large-scale mining
projects in Madagascar, the sector strategy was adjusted in 2005, which necessitated an
adjustment of Project activities. The additional activities added a different yet complementary
layer to the original Project scope in pursuit of the same PDOs as under the original credit. In
addition, in response to increasing oil prices, oil exploration in Madagascar had increased sharply.
The extractive industry’s institutional structure thus faced more pressure overall and, in spite of
earlier successful reforms, required more comprehensive integration, in line with the Madagascar
Action Plan (MAP), which represented the Government’s development strategy for 2007-2012.

14. As shown in Table 2 below, the following activities were added to the original scope of
activities under the existing components under the Additional Financing:
       Component 1 was expanded to include further reforms of the policy, legal and regulatory
        framework, including adjustments to the mining code, fiscal reforms, and the introduction
        of the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI).
       Component 2 was expanded to support additional institutional reforms needed to improve
        the public mining agencies’ governance and management capacity, including
        environmental management skills related to large and small-scale mining.
       Component 3 was to be reinforced through activities aimed at strengthening mining
        entities and agencies that fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Mines. A
        National Geological Survey entity and a Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank were
        to be set up, and the Geological and Mining Information System was to be enhanced.

* Estimated Project cost comprised IDA financing, Government counterpart funding and parallel financing from
USAID and the French Agency for Development (PAD, p. 1).


15. Parallel financing and partnership arrangements. According to the PAD (p. 1), parallel
financing was anticipated from the French Agency for Development (US$1.2 million) to support
the geological mapping of one of the initially defined blocks, and from the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) (US$1 million) to support the provision of equipment and
capacity building for the Gemology Institute of Madagascar. In addition, the Government of
South Africa provided US$0.5 million in parallel financing to support the expansion of the scope
of the geological mapping to additional blocks. The latter was not foreseen at the time of
appraisal and thus not included in the PAD.

                                                           7
16. In light of the Government’s broadened focus on the extractive industries agenda, as
documented in the 2007 Additional Financing Project Paper, the Bank coordinated with the
Government of Norway, which was to provide US$5 million (NOK36.1 million) in parallel
financing to improve the legal and regulatory framework and strengthen institutional capacity
pertaining to Madagascar’s petroleum resources (Aide Memoire (AM), July 2008 mission). The
Norwegian parallel financing became effective in 2007. However, following the unconstitutional
regime change in March 2009, the Government of Norway suspended its operations in
Madagascar, which it did not resume.

17. Changes in implementation arrangements. Given that the implementation arrangements
under the original credit proved to be effective, as evidenced by the fact that implementation had
been progressing well and that the Project was in compliance with all fiduciary requirements,
they remained the same under the Additional Financing credit. The Project Implementation
Manual was updated to reflect the additional activities to be funded from the Additional
Financing credit; a separate procurement plan was prepared and approved by the Bank; and the
Project’s chart of accounts was reviewed to reflect the new activities outlined in the Project Paper
to satisfy reporting requirements under the Additional Financing (PP for AF, p.11).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18. Project Preparation. For the most part, the PAD correctly identified the prevailing conditions
in Madagascar’s mining sector. As consistently stated in the PAD, the key sector issues were
persistent governance problems and the lack of capacity to effectively manage “the dynamism
and complexity of informal small scale mining? at the provincial and commune level, notably the
rushes in the gemstone area and the smuggling of gemstones out of the country (PAD, pp. 3ff.).
Given the second PDO’s focus on the decentralized management of mineral resources,
particularly the tax collection at the provincial level (PAD, p. 9) the PAD could have contained a
more detailed analysis of the state of decentralization at the time of appraisal. An Environmental
Management Plan, which was prepared and disclosed in 2002, contained an appropriate analysis
of the judicial, institutional, operational and financial constraints to the effective environmental
management of the mining sector (GLW, 2002).

19. Incorporation of lessons learned. Project design incorporated lessons learned from the Bank-
supported Mining Sector Reform Project, which closed in 2002, such as: (i) new sector
regulations can only be enforced if governance issues and institutional shortcomings are
addressed concurrently; (ii) pilot operations are crucial to identifying viable ways of improving
governance when baseline data and institutional capacity are lacking; and (iii) beneficiary
participation in all phases of the Project cycle is critical for timely and effective implementation
(PAD, p. 16). Furthermore, lessons learned from the Bank’s experience with capacity building in
the mining sector in other parts of Africa (including Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Mali,
Mozambique and Tanzania) and in Latin America were incorporated into Project design.
Experiences in these countries have shown that enacting the necessary legal, fiscal and
environmental policies and establishing strong mining institutions to enforce them are key
prerequisites for a country to attract and retain significant private investment (PAD, p. 16).

20. Assessment of Project objectives, design and components. The Project’s PDOs, components
and proposed activities were highly relevant at the time of appraisal. The Project represented one
of the priority instruments in the Government’s post- (2002) crisis recovery strategy. With its
focus on the promotion of private sector growth as well as on curbing illegal mining activities the

                                                 8
Project was to avert a crisis-induced withdrawal of private investment and preempt delays in the
establishment of good governance in the mining sector (World Bank, 2002, p. 7). The Project’s
development objectives directly targeted two of the three axes of the Government’s 2003 Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP): (i) the creation of an institutional framework of good
governance to foster fast, sustainable and inclusive development; and (ii) the revitalization of the
private sector and promotion of the development of high potential growth sectors (World Bank,
2003d).

21. The Project also featured prominently in the Bank’s 2002-2003 Interim Country Assistance
Strategy (I-CAS) as a new lending instrument (World Bank, 2002, p. 12) aiming to support the
Government’s efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption in the high growth potential
mining industry. Furthermore, the Project’s development objectives were fully aligned with the
objective of the Bank’s subsequent 2004-2006 CAS, which was to support the Government’s
PRSP efforts of improving governance - considered the best way to support poverty reduction in
Madagascar (PAD, p. 3). The PDOs’ continued relevance was confirmed during the Project’s
Midterm Review. While the PDOs could have been defined more concisely, it was laudable that,
unlike many Projects of its generation, the PDOs stated in the Results framework were clearly
distinguished from higher-level objectives beyond the purview of the Project, such as poverty
reduction.

22. The Project’s design was relevant to its objectives, as the components and activities were
consistent with what was internationally considered a good practice approach at the time of
appraisal. While the PAD did not specify a particular theory of change upon which Project design
was based, it was noted that it implicitly anticipated the World Bank’s value chain approach for
supporting extractive industries, which since then has marked the evolution from the emphasis on
“merely? increasing investment to promoting environmentally and socially sustainable
development (McMahon, 2010). A minor shortcoming of the otherwise sound Project design was
the fact that the “Support to Decentralized Management of Mineral Resources? sub-component of
Component 1 could have been more clearly delineated from and linked with related activities
under Component 2, which also aimed to strengthen the decentralized management of mineral
resources. Project design would have benefited from a more prominent gender-sensitive approach
to small-scale mining, given that the PAD only vaguely mentioned that the Project “will also
address gender and infant labor issues in artisanal mining? without specifying how (PAD, p. 14).

23. Innovative Project design. Project design was innovative and inspirational for similar
operations in other sub-Saharan countries. Whereas traditionally most technical assistance
projects tended to approach the mining sector from a national and central point of view, the
Project put a lot of emphasis on the decentralized management of mineral resources, which turned
out to be a successful strategy in Madagascar and other countries with similar projects. The
piloting of a range of approaches to address challenges associated with artisanal mining,
including formalization and value addition in the supply chain, which may now be regarded as
almost common was very creative at the time of project preparation.

24. Implementation arrangements. Implementation arrangements were appropriately designed.
The Project was housed in the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and the existing Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), which had successfully managed the implementation of the Project’s
predecessor operation, was to be responsible for the procurement of all goods, services, and
works under the Project (PAD, p. 14). In addition, a Mining Sector Promotion Agency was to be
established within the Ministry of Mines to promote private investment and mainstream pilot
activities in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector (including operating the small
grants program). The Promotion Agency was ultimately intended to provide business

                                                 9
development services to entrepreneurs, as well as social intermediation services to build social
capital and basic skills in Project-supported communities (PAD, p. 13).

25. Adequacy of Government commitment. Borrower commitment was evidenced by the fact
that the mining sector was considered a priority instrument in the Government’s Interim-PRSP
(PAD, p. 18) – and by the successful implementation of the Project’s predecessor operation, the
Mining Sector Reform Project. The Government demonstrated commitment to sector reforms
throughout this Project’s implementation period and also reacted promptly to mitigate the
negative impact of the rushes on gemstones (MSRP ICR, p. 12). Furthermore, the Government’s
ability to meet all of the mining related conditions of the Second Structural Adjustment Credit,
and the seriousness of its participation in the preparation of the Project are indications of
Government commitment (PAD, p. 18).

26. Stakeholder involvement and participatory process. Recognizing the importance of
beneficiary participation for timely and effective Project implementation was one of the key
lessons learned from the Project’s predecessor operation. Multiple stakeholder groups, which had
been involved in the implementation of the previous Project, also participated in the preparation
of this Project. These included the National Council of Mines, small-scale and artisanal miners
and mining associations which were to be directly associated with Project preparation through the
creation of a Consultative Committee. NGOs and private firms who had participated in the
predecessor project were to be involved in the discussion of environmental and social issues. It
was noted that consultation on environmental and social issues, which was mandatory under the
2002 mining law, was to be a permanent feature of the Project (PAD, p. 23). Formal consultations
began with the disclosure of the Environmental Management Plan in October 2002. Associations
of small-scale miners, civil society, private mining companies and representatives of the central,
provincial and municipal administration, and consultations with local NGOs took place during
Project appraisal (PAD, p. 23).

27. Assessment of Risks. Overall, the list of identified risks was comprehensive and the risk
ratings, including the Significant overall risk rating, were appropriate. However, the country risk,
especially in a post-crisis time, was probably underestimated.

2.2 Implementation

28. Mid-term review. During the time period between Project effectiveness in September 2003
and the Midterm Review, which was conducted in February 2006, implementation progress and
progress towards achievement of the development objectives had consistently been rated
Satisfactory in supervision reports. The Project had achieved particularly good results with regard
to the establishment of the Gemology Institute of Madagascar and in strengthening geological
information (MEM, p. 7). At the time, 44 percent of IDA funds had been disbursed and 90
percent had already been committed. Therefore, no changes were made to the Project’s
development objectives. The Midterm Review did, however, prepare the way for the Additional
Financing in that it emphasized the promotion of large-scale mining as a priority in addition to
improving governance in artisanal and small-scale mining. This was motivated by the decision
made by Rio Tinto/QMM in August 2005 to invest US$800 million 2 (AM, September 2005
mission), and the global increase in commodity prices. The Midterm Review also identified the
need for financing to support the Government’s efforts in reforming and promoting the petroleum
sector, in addition to the ongoing mining sector reforms.

    As it turned out, one billon US$ was eventually needed.


                                                              10
29. Impact of the 2009-2012 political crisis. Madagascar’s political crisis, triggered by an
unconstitutional regime change in March 2009, had a profound effect on the Bank’s assistance
strategy. Disbursements under all projects were suspended from March 2009 until the gradual
resumption of existing projects in mid-2011, followed by a broad portfolio restructuring exercise
to ensure the operations’ consistency with the new 2011 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) as well as
the constraints associated with the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 7.30 (dealing with de facto
governments). The latter recommended throughout the portfolio to: (i) work at arms’ length from
the Government; (ii) target social impacts as much as possible; (iii) favor partnerships in
particular with the private sector; and (iv) strengthen coordination among Bank operations. As of
the time of writing of this ICR, Madagascar continued to operate under the Bank’s Operational
Policy 7.30.

30. Even though the political crisis had major implications for Madagascar, it did not drastically
change the course of the project. The main reason is that the crisis occurred in 2009 when 95
percent of the credit proceeds had been disbursed during a six-year period of successful
implementation - implementation progress and progress towards achievement of development
objectives had consistently been rated Satisfactory. When disbursements of this Project resumed
in July 2011, with only five percent of the credit proceeds remaining, restructuring or adopting a
radically different approach were not considered feasible. The 2011 review mission concluded
that, for the most part, it was possible to complete the remaining Project activities within the
limitations of the new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (ISR September 2011). Project activities
pertaining to legal and institutional reforms were most affected by the crisis since these could not
reach a decision point at a time when no major legal act could be legitimately passed, approved
and signed by the transitional Government. However, all the background work preceding legal
decision was undertaken.

31. In addition, the Project deliberately decided to stay focused on its longer-term objectives
rather than changing direction on the basis of unstable and volatile policy declarations. Indeed,
with the commodity boom and new developments in artisanal and industrial mining in 2006-2008,
notably the development of large-scale mining, the political economy of mining was changing.
According to a 2010 analysis of the World Bank’s development effectiveness, the transition was
associated with a new distribution of powers and rent-seeking strategies. The new authorities’
attention focused to a large extent on the immediate returns that the mining sector could generate.
The Project was thus faced with the need to safeguard the long-term interest of the sector. This is
best illustrated by the Project-supported acquisition of geo-scientific information, which
represents a major public investment that will, over time, gradually generate benefits in mining as
well as other sectors.

32. In this context, the Project’s last annual work plan, which targeted the achievement of key
results, focused on the following four areas of intervention: (i) professionalization of artisanal
mining; (ii) integration of industrial mining into local and regional development; 3 (iii)
environmental and social management in the mining sector under PDO 2/Component 2; and (iv)
the completion of the geological mapping, the Project’s largest investment, under
PDO3/Component 3.

33. Implementation arrangements. The Project Implementation Unit remained effective
throughout the Project’s lifetime, including the two-year "freeze" imposed by the Bank. This was


3
 The Project cooperated closely with the Second Governance and Institutional Development Project in the area of
participatory budgeting in mining communities as well as with the Growth Pole Project.


                                                     11
key to the successful resumption of Project activities, and in particular the completion of the
geological mapping in June 2012.

34. Project Risk status. Throughout its lifetime, the Project carried a country record flag.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35. M&E framework design. The design of the Project’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
framework presents the typical challenges of this generation of pre-results framework projects.
Some indicators are not easily attributable or measurable. Also, outcome indicators could have
been defined - and distinguished from output indicators - more clearly. On the positive side, five
out of the seven outcome indicators contained numeric end of Project target values, and three
outcome indicators included a baseline value. It is worth noting that the Project was prepared in
the aftermath of the 2002 crisis when reliable national data and statistics at sector administration
level were scarce and difficult to access. Overall, despite its shortcomings, the M&E framework
was sufficiently robust to allow for a meaningful assessment of the Project’s achievement of its
development objectives.

36. M&E framework implementation and Utilization. While Project supervision was rather
strong on technical aspects, as evidenced by the significant achievements the Project was able to
accomplish despite its two-year hiatus, according to the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs)
only three out of seven outcome indicators and five out of thirteen output indicators were tracked
during the Project’s lifetime. (One additional indicator – creation of a Mining Sector Promotion
activity - was monitored in the supervision reports but was not part of the PAD Results
Framework.) However, the monitoring data collected during implementation and an external
evaluation undertaken at Project closing allowed for a meaningful assessment of Project results.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37. Environmental and Social Safeguard Compliance. The Project was categorized as an
Environmental Category B Project; it triggered Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment). Throughout Project implementation, environmental safeguard policies were
complied with and rated Satisfactory in supervision reports. A Sector Environmental and Social
Assessment (SESA) was prepared and disclosed in 2003; the SESA was updated and re-disclosed
in 2007. No significant safeguard issues were identified during implementation. An update of the
SESA was conducted during the Project’s last year of operation and was available by Project
closure. The Project contributed to enhancing the environmental management capacity in the
country, notably by supporting the creation of Environmental Units at decentralized levels,
strengthening the coordination with the National Environment Office (Office National de
l’Environnment), and by supporting a framework for dialogue with civil society, which played an
important role in resolving conflicts between mining activities and the environment.

38. Covenants. All covenants associated with the original and Additional Financing were
complied with, except for one, which lost its relevance as a result of the 2009 crisis. The
Additional Financing Project Paper included the following covenant: “No later than December
31, 2008 the Borrower shall have adopted a plan with specific time based measures for the
restructuring of OMNIS [National Office for Mines and the Strategic Industries].? However, this
covenant did not directly pertain to the Project as it related to an activity, which was to be led by
the Government of Norway on a parallel financing basis, as documented in the Additional
Financing Project Paper and Financing Agreement.


                                                 12
39. Financial Management. The financial management system in place was adequate and
performed well. The quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports were submitted in time by the PIU,
and the external audit reports were unqualified.

40. Procurement. There were no problems associated with the procurement activities under the
Project. No misprocurement occurred - all contracts were procured in accordance with the
provisions of the Development Credit and Financing Agreements. The post-crisis resumption
after the two-year suspension of disbursement was smooth; issues such as settling arrears and
resolving contractual situations were handled effectively by the PIU; and an updated procurement
plan was prepared for the last year of operation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41. Need for additional technical assistance. At the time of Project closure, it was clear that
additional technical assistance was needed to sustain reforms and institutional capacity built
under the Project in the mining sector. The recent rapid growth of industrial mining, which was
partly a result of the improvements that the Project helped put in place, has generated new
institutional capacity needs. The Additional Financing attempted to address these by supporting
efforts to integrate mining operations into their local and regional socio-economic contexts.
However, at the end of the Project’s life, with two world-class mining projects and the biggest
investments in green-field mining in Sub-Saharan Africa, those needs clearly exceeded the
Project’s reach. Concerned about the Ministry of Mines’ ability to monitor Ambatovy’s large
mining and processing operation and to effectively carry out its mining inspectorate functions, in
mid-2012 the transition authorities commissioned an audit of the Ambatovy project, which in turn
could add risk to the biggest operation in the country. Strengthening mining inspectorate
functions is therefore a priority area for future technical assistance. Similarly, in line with the
Project having devoted great efforts to attracting investments through its ambitious geology
program, future assistance should build on the renewed understanding of the island’s subsoil and
finalize the institutional structure to ensure that geo-data is consistently updated and made
available to the public.

42. Continued Bank engagement. Despite the country’s political crisis remaining unresolved,
the Bank decided to stay engaged in the mining sector as much as possible, within the limits
delineated by the ISN. At time of Project closure, mining was of greater strategic importance than
ever, posing tradeoffs between immediate returns and long-term impacts. Both at the central and
local levels, questions have been raised as to what extent mining development is generating
benefits for the country. High expectations for benefits in some regions have led to
disappointment and protests. Stakeholders from the private sector, the civil society and also the
Administration requested that the World Bank, the main historic partner in mining, stay engaged
and provide a platform for more quantitative information and constructive dialogue on issues like
fiscal revenues, employment, infrastructure and local content. An analytical and advisory activity
(AAA) on mining benefits, to be supported by the South African Trust Fund for Sub-Saharan
African Energy, Transport, and Extractive Industries (SAFETE), was therefore proposed as an
opportunity for donors and the Bank to stay engaged in the mining sector and to contribute to its
sustainable development at a critical time for Madagascar. This type of engagement is in line with
the ISN (see Section 2.2), according to which the Bank would: (i) remain focused on the most
pressing short term issues affecting the country, while keeping a medium term view on key
strategic pillars of governance, employment and vulnerability to prepare for re-engagement; and
(ii) pursue analytical work that would raise public awareness and update the knowledge base in
priority areas.


                                                13
43. Social accountability and transparency in mining. In light of the increasing mining sector
investments, future Malagasy Governments will likely be held accountable by civil society
organizations for the benefits generated by the sector and their distribution among the State,
investors, and local communities. Future World Bank interventions should support such demand-
side governance initiatives and provide technical assistance so that policy changes are made in a
consultative manner and on the basis of good international practices and realistic expectations.
Typically, fiscal provisions of the legal framework may have to be reassessed in order to preserve
both the competitiveness of the country and a fair sharing of the benefits in the context of rapidly
changing international markets. Transparency should remain a priority so that increasing revenues
and rents are administered in an open and efficient manner and to ensure that they translate into
more sustainable returns.

44. Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). In close consultation with the main
stakeholders, the Bank consistently supported the EITI as a unique platform for promoting
transparency in the mining sector. One of the Project’s key contributions in terms of transparency
was its decisive support to the launch and the management of the EITI. The initiative, then funded
under the Bank-managed EITI Multi-Donor Trust Fund, was very successful despite the political
uncertainty in Madagascar, which led the EITI International Board to suspend the country’s
candidacy status in 2011. The EITI Madagascar published in September 2012 a detailed and fully
disaggregated report that reconciled all payments declared by mining companies in the fiscal year
2010 with all revenues declared by Governmental institutions. A new proposed Grant as well as
potential additional funds from the African Development Bank were discussed in November 2012
to ensure continuous support to the initiative which, to all observers represented a unique way to
promote transparency in the mining sector at a time of relatively high uncertainty and opacity.

45. In the medium run, depending on the country’s development priorities, future technical
assistance support could be needed. A general outline for a 5-step EITI++ program was
discussed during an EITI++ scoping mission in July 2008 (eight months prior to the crisis), and
the 2010 policy note also identified areas of priority for the future. This diagnosis will have to be
updated, especially in view of the improved understanding of the political economy based on
recent Bank research. Much emphasis should be placed on building capacity to realize the
potential benefits that mining can bring to the economy at the national and local levels. With a
view to maximizing the mining sector’s contribution to the economy capacity building should
target in particular local supply in mining areas, efforts to stimulate local employment,
community development and synergies between mining projects and infrastructure developments.
Other areas for future support should typically include: (i) mining policy (in view of new
industrial mining developments); (ii) mining fiscal regime (building on the Project’s analytical
work); (iii) institutional capacity building (typically to consolidate the creation of the National
Geology Survey and the Inspectorate functions); (iv) further mineral resources assessments
(especially of the Sedimentary basin); (v) environmental impact management related to mining;
and (vi) tertiary education. As many challenges, such as transparent management systems for
licenses and strengthening of institutions are similar for all extractive industries, a key question
will be whether a new project should or should not include interventions pertaining to petroleum.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

46. The High overall Relevance rating is based on the following observations:


                                                 14
   Relevance of Objectives and Components. The continued High relevance of objectives and
    components is evidenced by the fact that the 2011 Interim Strategy Note explicitly mentions
    the Project as one of the operations designated to support: (i) its governance and public sector
    capacity pillar with PDO2 and Component 2 of the project, notably social accountability
    mechanisms in mining; (ii) activities related to artisanal and small scale mining; as well as
    (iii) integration of industrial mining into regional development. The growing importance of
    mining in Madagascar, the related challenges and opportunities in terms of governance, and
    the relevance of the Project as an instrument to address governance and capacity needs are
    further elaborated in the Bank’s most recent analytical work like the mining policy note
    (2010) and the political economy analysis of mining (2011).

    Mining also features prominently in the Government’s 2007-2012 Madagascar Action Plan
    (MAP), which “one could argue [is] by inertia or by default [still considered] the basic policy
    framework [and poverty reduction strategy] under which the administration works,? given
    that “the transition government is essentially running current affairs and in principle is
    refraining from committing the country to long term policies changes (World Bank, 2011).
    The mining sector was referenced as one of the country’s high economic growth engines
    besides tourism and agriculture, and the sector goals and strategies, such as “unleashing? the
    country’s extractive potential by helping current mining projects enter the production phase
    and attracting more explorers; improving the existing legal and regulatory environment; and
    integrating the small scale miners into the formal economy are consistent with the Project’s
    three development objectives (Republic of Madagascar, 2006).

   Relevance of Design and Implementation. The continued High relevance of the Project’s
    design to its objectives is evidenced by the fact that the implementation of the Project’s
    complex sub-components and components was progressing well, and that the activities were
    contributing towards the achievement of the Project’s intended objectives until its suspension
    due to country factors in 2009. From the beginning, the Project was designed to advance the
    development of the entire mining sector, notably by promoting artisanal and small scale
    gemstone mining as well as the collection of geoscientific data, which primarily targeted
    industrial mining. In order to remain highly relevant and adapt to the changing structure of
    Madagascar’s mining industry prompted by two large-scale mining investments, the Project
    sought Additional Financing to support efforts to integrate those operations into regional
    development, and to continuously advance sector development notably by expanding the
    scope of the geology component to realize a comprehensive synthesis of the national geology
    at the scale of 1:1,000,000.

    It is a tribute to the sound Project design that, despite the difficult circumstances, the Project
    was able to complete some of its key activities and achieve the corresponding PDOs, such as
    the geoscience data information infrastructure under PDO 3/Component 3. While the ban on
    rough stone exports, which was in effect from February 2008 to July 2009, adversely affected
    some performance indicators, it did not diminish the relevance of design.4 On the contrary,
    this temporary ban illustrated the critical need to strengthen value addition and transparency
    in the supply chain. The gemstone sector has partly recovered as evidenced by the high
    demand for the lapidary training and the reopening of the monthly Madagascar Gem Market
    in Antananarivo, which indicates that Project design and envisaged promotion of value
    addition remain highly relevant.
    In addition, the Project continued to support the right activities, given that the mining sector

 The ban was decreed by Madagascar’s President in the context of a controversy about a giant emerald, which later
proved to be a green beryl.

     was identified in the 2011 ISN as one of the four key sources of growth in the country. In
     light of its large growth potential, renewed focus was to be placed on transparent processes
     and institutions that can ensure good governance in the sector, benefit sharing, and private
     sector development in artisanal and small-scale as well as large scale mining. In addition,
     Project activities were well-aligned with the priority actions cited in the MAP in relation to
     the mining sector, which included: (i) improving laws and regulations in mining sector; (ii)
     building capacity to manage oil and mining resources; (iii) eliminating existing impediments
     for mining production; (iii) promoting the exploration and development of mining; and (iv)
     educating, informing and training small-scale gemstone miners (World Bank, 2011, p. 11).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

47. The Project comprised three Development Objectives (PDOs): (i) strengthening transparency
and governance in mining; (ii) key institutional reforms for the decentralized management of
mineral resources; and (iii) promote private investments and value-added in the sector. Together,
the three PDOs were to support the environmentally and socially sustainable management and
inclusive development of the solid mineral sector. In accordance with the Bank’s ICR guidelines,
the three objectives will be assessed separately below. The achievements by indicator are
summarized in Tables 3, 4, and 5 below.

3.2.1 PDO 1- Strengthening Transparency and Governance in mining
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48. Activities carried out in support of the first development objective addressed key elements of
the Extractive Industries value chain, i.e. the theory of change implicitly underlying Project
design (see Section 2.1) to improve the legal and institutional frameworks at the central level.

(i) Enhanced legal and regulatory frameworks for industrial and artisanal mining. The Project-
supported legal and regulatory reforms represent one of the Project’s key accomplishments. The
revision of the Mining Code in 2005 and the subsequent production of mining regulations
(Mining Code Decree of 2006), as well as the revision of the Large-scale Mining Investment Act
(Loi sur les Grands Investissements Miniers) enhanced the legal and regulatory framework’s
effectiveness. As depicted in Figure 3 below, it further instilled confidence in mining operators to
invest in Madagascar as evidenced by the fact that direct foreign investments in mining amounted
to more than US$6 billion in 2012, compared to about US$23 million in 2005 (Rakotoarison,
Razafindrahaga, 2012).

While these investments may not be fully attributable to the Project, major investments in the
sector, such as the $5.5 billion Ambatovy nickel-cobalt mine in 2006, the largest mining sector
investment ever in Madagascar, were at least partially attributable to the investor-friendly legal
and regulatory environment supported by the Project. It is worth noting that the crisis did not
question the two existing large-scale investments, i.e. Ambatovy and QMM. If anything it
generated delays and increased the investment value, given the increased cost of doing business
in a politically risky environment. Exploration activities, however, have decreased.

In addition to benefiting large-scale mining investors, the revision of the regulatory frameworks
generated various benefits for artisanal and small-scale miners. New legal provisions and
awareness raising campaigns made it possible for artisanal and small-scale miners to form
associations, formalize their operations and access mining titles, and the size of mining squares
was reduced from 2.5 kilometers to 625 meters, which drastically enhanced the capacity to access
mining resources, and artisanal mining corridors were created on a pilot basis.

Further reforms and adjustments of the policy, legal and regulatory framework, which were to be
carried out under the Additional Financing, were adversely affected by the 2009 political crisis.
However, while the latter prevented the passage of the act and adoption of reforms the
comprehensive analysis of the fiscal framework for mining conducted under the Project provides
valuable guidance to the transition authorities as well as a legitimate future Government.

(ii) Formalized exports of gemstones. Addressing informality and adding value to the gemstone
industry was one of the main policy and institutional reforms supported by the Project. The
Project-facilitated trade and exchanges, simplified export procedures, improved quality control,
the development of local cutting and polishing capacity, and the creation of a certification scheme
effectively contributed to a major increase in formal exports from about US$21 million in 2003 to
US$40 million in 2006. These gains were partially reversed in 2008 when the Government
unexpectedly declared a ban on rough stone exports, which was lifted about 1.5 years later. The
declared gemstone exports are expected to recover to about US$30 million in 2012. While the
temporary disruption in the gemstone industry constituted a setback, it did not compromise the
underlying value addition “infrastructure? put in place by the Project for facilitating training,
trade and exchanges.

A one-stop shop for the export of rough gemstones as well as jewelry was set up with Project
support and is jointly run by Mining and Customs administration staff. The one-stop-shop
delivers export certificates in coordination with the National Mines Laboratory. It was
successfully associated with a total of 260 market days held in Antananarivo between 2007 and
2012, initiated by the Gemology Institute of Madagascar and now sustained through the creation
of an independent and self-financed association. Progress still remains to be made on aspects of
the “Laissez-passer? system as identified during the policy dialogue facilitated by the Project in
2006 as well as in the Bank’s 2010 political economy analysis.

(iii) Improved institutional capacity. The Project supported the creation of the following
institutions, which resulted in significant transparency gains in the mining sector:

       Gemology Institute of Madagascar. Although the sale of rough gem material is a strong
        income generator, adding value by transforming rough gems to polished jewels or better
        yet, jewelry can earn even more revenues and generate even more employment. At
        present, Madagascar is recognized worldwide as a quality gem producer - an
        accomplishment, which is attributable to the Project-supported creation of the Gemology
        Institute. Delegations from around the world have visited the top quality gem cutting

                                                17
         equipment, the world-class gemology lab and learned from the Institute’s highly skilled
         staff how to increase professionalization in the sector. The Institute improved the national
         gemstones value chain, as evidenced, for example, by flourishing local jewelry
         businesses in Antananarivo, and contributing significantly to the professionalization and
         formalization of the gemstone industry in Madagascar. Considered one of the best
         gemstone training facilities in Africa, the Institute was accredited by the Gemological
         Association of Great Britain, the world's foremost authority in gemology.

         Education and training were seen as the best way to add value to the sector and gradually
         provide incentives for gemstones miners to formalize, and for international buyers to buy
         refined stones directly in Madagascar. During the Project’s lifetime, the Institute
         delivered 1,750 trainings and courses in cutting, polishing, jewelry and/or gemology, as
         well as numerous workshops in the field. As a result of the training, about 100 new
         independent businesses were created between 2004 and 2012. In close collaboration with
         the mining and customs administrations, the Institute also plays an important role in
         curbing the exports of controlled stones by providing independent expert identification
         and evaluation of gemstones. Private buyers and exporters also appreciate the Institute’s
         control and identification services, which help to enhance export quality and
         Madagascar’s recognition internationally.5

        ASM Management Centers. In an effort to further support the formalization of artisanal
         and small-scale gemstone and gold mining and develop new intervention schemes to deal
         with particularly intense situations, the two first artisanal mining management centers
         (Bureau de l’Administration Minière) were created in Ilakaka, an area that had
         experienced frequent sapphire rushes, and Vatomandry, a ruby mining area. These offices
         provided administrative services to miners with regard to their registration, formalization
         and training. Around 3,000 artisans were trained, and the formation of 100 cooperatives
         was supported in 30 different communes. These results were promising, but due to the
         2008 ban on rough stones exports (Ilakaka) and the exhaustion of the resources
         (Vatomandry), the efforts could not be sustained and two other planned management
         centers could not be set up. While none of the centers were operational at Project closing,
         a sector study conducted in 2012 by the Project and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
         recommended that the approach be revived.

        Large-Scale Mining Investment Commission. With regard to large-scale mining, the
         Project facilitated the creation of a special inter-ministerial commission in charge of
         monitoring large-scale mining contracts, and financed the operating expenses of its
         permanent technical secretariat. The Commission has been the main coordination
         mechanism and arm of the Government to negotiate with interested large-scale mining
         companies and oversee their investments, in particular the Ambatovy investment. The
         Commission is still operational and the Secretariat was successfully integrated into the
         Ministry of Mines after Project closure.

(iv) Improved transparency in tax and royalties payments. As a result of Project-facilitated
fiduciary, technical and financial support to the EITI, Madagascar received candidate status in
2008, and validation status in 2011. Even though Madagascar’s validation was suspended in
October 2011, based on the Government’s lack of legitimacy, its involvement in the EITI
5
 A post-training survey of participants of trainings conducted by the Gemology Institute showed that at least 6 percent
of the respondents had started their own gemstone businesses, and 42 percent of the respondents were employed by
gemstone businesses. The Institute further conducted 645 exports controls were over a period of six years, with up to
145 tons of stones controlled in 2010 alone.

                                                         18
persisted and led to a significant improvement in the transparency of sector investments and
revenues, as they were published in EITI reconciliation reports in 2010, 2011 and 2012.6 Those
reports are regarded as a key success in transparency during the challenging times of the
transition.

                           Status: 50% achieved. Two out of the four targeted mining administration centers
                           were created in the Ilakaka and Vatomandry areas, which had experienced frequent
                           rushes of thousands of sapphire and ruby miners, respectively, prior to the Project.
                           The centers’ initial results, which helped to train around 3,000 artisans and facilitated
                           the formation of 100 cooperatives, were promising. However, due to the 2008-2009
    PDO 1:                 ban on rough stones exports (Ilakaka) and exhaustion of resources (Vatomandry), the
    Strengthening          efforts could not be sustained. The centers were not operational at Project closing, but
    transparency           their revival was recommended by a recent sector study conducted by the World

                           Customs administration staff. After a period of anarchical rushes on sapphire and
                           ruby, such measures helped to simplify export procedures, reduced the incentive to
                           smuggle, and effectively contributed to an increase in formal exports.


3.2.2 PDO 2- Key institutional reforms for the decentralized management of mineral resources
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49. Objective 2 of the Project aimed to build the capacity of institutions to enable them to
perform their assigned roles especially at the decentralized level. The Project achieved the
following key accomplishments under its second development objective:

(i) Improved collection and use of mining revenues for local/regional development.

      Improved access to mining cadastre services at sub-national level. The Project provided
       financial and technical support to strengthen the capacity of the central cadastre office
       (established under the Project’s predecessor operation) and created seven cadastre “antennas?
       (regional delegations) in the main mining provinces/regions. The successful integration of
       these antennas into a unique integrated licensing system was ensured through close
       monitoring until 2008. It led to an increased number of permits granted throughout the
       country and an improved application of the “first-come first-served? license processing
       principle. The Project also established mobile cadastre offices (cadastre ambulant) in order to
       reach miners in remote areas. The latter was an innovative tool, which, by making cadastre
       services more accessible, effectively promoted the formalization of artisanal and small-scale
       mining operations. The increased formalization of the hitherto informal mining sector, in turn,

6
    The 2012 report (FY 2010) also includes the oil sector (see http://eiti.org/Madagascar for details and reports).

                                                              19
    led to an increase in the local tax base for mining-related taxes.
    Until the political crisis in 2009, Madagascar’s cadastre system was considered one of the
    best in Africa. Since 2009, this key institution has been affected by the de facto moratorium
    on permit allocation ordered by the Transition authorities, as well as a lack of oversight. On
    the positive side, the cadastre “infrastructure? is still in place, and with minimal support the
    mining permit allocation could resume, provided the Government is able to sign the mining
    licenses. The private sector is currently urging the Government to clean up the backlog and
    resume the permit allocation. While it is not uncommon for cadastre systems to experience
    this kind of “stop and go? situation, the impact of the de facto moratorium on the
    achievement of PDO 2 will depend on the moratorium’s duration.

   Improved collection and use of revenue from artisanal and small-scale mining. The
    decentralization of mining revenue collection was introduced in the legal framework
    accompanying Madagascar’s new decentralization policy to ensure that local governments
    (provinces and communes) and mining communities would benefit from mining revenues by
    collecting them directly. The Project supported extensive capacity building activities in 16
    pilot mining municipalities (4 gemstone and 12 gold mining municipalities). A total of 54
    miners’ associations were formed as a result of the Project-funded capacity building activities
    for local administration officials and miners.7 The formalization of gold mining operations,
    which had previously operated outside of the formal economy led to a significant increase in
    the declared gold production, as illustrated by the example of the Antimbary commune. In
    Antimbary alone, the declared gold production rose from zero before the Project to 83
    kilograms after three and a half years of Project support (from mid-2005-2008), generating
    about US$30,000 in fiscal revenues for the municipality. Based on the commune’s
    development plan, the incremental fiscal revenues contributed to the provision of basic local
    health, education, and transportation infrastructure. In addition to these pilots, the Project
    provided support through legal and sector studies for the design and implementation of
    improved collection schemes at the decentralized level.

   Improved management of mining revenues in industrial mining areas. In light of the large
    mining investments materializing and socio-economically impacting the three municipalities
    of Fort-Dauphin (QMM), Moramanga (Ambatovy) and Tamatave (Ambatovy) the Project
    implemented a comprehensive capacity building package to ensure the transparent and
    effective use of tax revenues generated by those mines. This included activities to strengthen:
    (i) supply-side governance by enhancing local and regional authorities’ development
    planning competencies and setting up Local Coordination Committees as the interface
    between mining companies and local/regional authorities; and (ii) demand-side governance
    by facilitating participatory budgeting to ensure that local citizens’ priorities were taken into
    account in the allocation and use of mining revenues.

    As a result of empowering mining communities to participate in mining revenue management,
    in the two municipalities affected by the Ambatovy operation, for example, US$475,000 or
    the equivalent of 90 percent of local taxes paid by Ambatovy for construction permits in 2011
    were invested in priority infrastructure, such as health, education, transport. The participatory
    budgeting approach has since then been scaled up in non-mining communities throughout the
    country, funded under the Bank-supported Second Governance and Institutional

7
 These included: (i) training of local administration officers in public sector management, including the
new fiscal reform regulations, and mining regulations; and (ii) educating miners in mining legislation and
how to obtain licenses, more productive mining and mineral processing methods, business skills,
occupational safety and health practices, and environmental management.

                                                   20
    Development Project. The Project further supported studies on benefit sharing mechanisms at
    the regional level and a dialogue between QMM, the regional authorities, the Ministry of
    Mines and local communities in view of improving the management of royalties through a
    regional community foundation.

   Dynamic Mineral Resources Management System. In the case of the expected QMM ilmenite
    mining investment, in 2005-2006, the Project funded the development of a Dynamic Mineral
    Resources Management System to enhance planning and development activities in the Fort-
    Dauphin region. This innovative, GIS-based tool integrated multi-disciplinary information on
    mining, agriculture, tourism, fisheries as well as conservation, restoration, and social and
    physical infrastructure improvements. This planning tool, which is accessible to local
    authorities and development partners, can be adjusted as new information becomes available
    to refine the existing growth poles for regional development and focus investments
    accordingly. By the end of the Project the System was used to support an Inter-Communal
    Development Plan (Schéma d’Aménagement Inter-Communal) among the four communes in
    the Fort-Dauphin area, in coordination with development administrations and partners.

(ii) Improved environmental impact management of mining activities

   Central and regional Environmental Units. In order to ensure a more environmentally
    sustainable use of mineral resources, the Project established and supported the creation of one
    central and six regional environmental units in the country’s main mining regions. These
    Units have now been successfully integrated into the Ministry of Mines’ institutional
    structure and are staffed with civil servants, thus making them more sustainable. Between
    2005 and 2011, the units handled around 3,400 environmental permits (mostly for exploration
    or small-scale mining). However, the lack of resources of the National Environmental
    Agency under the Ministry of Environment has reduced the units’ effectiveness especially
    since the crisis. The Environmental Units, as well as other units of the Ministry of Mines and
    related agencies, are benefiting from improved information flow, given that an
    Internet/Extranet network was established with Project support.

   Environmental Management Information System. The Project supported the development of
    an Environmental Management and Information System (Systeme d’Information pour la
    Gestion Environmentale) - an innovative and cutting-edge management tool developed on the
    basis of existing environmental regulations and procedures - which consolidates
    environmental data related to both large and small-scale mining operations. This GIS-based
    system, which uses a Google Earth platform that supplies up-to-date satellite imagery,
    provides mining permit and cadastral information, environmental management plans, results
    of past environmental monitoring activities and infractions by large-scale mining companies.
    The system is operated by the Ministry of Mines’ environmental units, and by sharing its data
    with the National Environment Office (Office National de l’Environnement) it facilitates
    close cooperation between these two entities in the enforcement of environmental regulations
    in the mining sector.

   Interministerial Committee on Mines and Forests. The Project supported the creation and
    operation of an Interministerial Committee on Mines and Forests as a mechanism for
    addressing overlaps between mining permits and newly protected areas, in accordance with
    the fifth IUCN World Parks Congress in 2003 (Durban process). Overall, the Committee
    managed to resolve at least 85 percent of the overlap problems and reclaim more than six
    million hectares of newly protected areas. Notably, the Committee successfully facilitated the
    negotiation between Madagascar National Parks, responsible for managing protected areas,

                                                21
       and the mining title holder, which resulted in the redefinition of the boundaries of the Mikea
       protected area in south-west Madagascar. In addition, in partnership with the World Wildlife
                                                                           8
       Fund (WWF), the Project supported the preparation of a toolkit to prevent mining rushes,
       which tend to occur in or close to protected areas.

                    projected production (industrial mining). They show an increase in the collection rate
                    throughout the Project period as a result of measures like the one-stop shop, but also the
                    effect of the startup of industrial mining operations. The figures do not include informal
                    production, for which there are no statistics.

3.2.3 PDO 3- Promote private investments and value-added in the sector
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50. Objective 3 of the Project was to promote private investments and value addition in the sector
mainly through an ambitious geology program. The following results were achieved under the
third development objective:

(i) High quality geo-scientific data available to potential investors and other users. A wealth of
geological, geophysical and geo-chemical maps and data, mineral resources interpretations and
assessments and other scientific information have been collected and are available to the public
through the online Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank. State of the art geophysical data

was acquired through the successful completion of about 600,000 linear kilometers of airborne
surveys (magnetometric and spectrometric), and 150 geological maps were produced at a scale of
1/100,000 and 1/500,000, covering over 65% of Madagascar territory plus a national synthesis
map at a scale of 1/1,000,000. In addition, “hands on? training in modern fieldwork and data
processing techniques, as well as in up-to-date geological concepts was provided to relevant
Ministry of Mines staff. The geological and geochemical mapping activities resulted in a renewed
understanding of Madagascar’s geology and mineral resources, including new insights on the
origins of the island, which inspired the production of international publications by reputable
scientific teams, both foreign and national, as well as the organization of conferences during the
course of the work.

(ii) Mineral Resources Governance Promotion Data Bank created. The Mineral Resources
Governance Promotion Data Bank is one of the Project’s major achievements and represents the
already operational core of the National Geological Survey. Collected, digitized and stored geo-
scientific data is available to the public either on site at the Documentation center established
under the Project or online. The Data Bank provides potential investors and the general public
with a unique platform to access and acquire geological data, and its highly skilled staff, trained
under the Project is responsible for managing the geological information and running a cutting-
edge platform and data center.9.The Ministry of Mines has pledged to issue a formal access to
information policy to guarantee that this wealth of information will remain available to the public
during the Transition.

(iii) Improved geological information management and private investment promotion. The
Project supported the creation of two previously missing yet critical elements of a modern
institutional mineral resources management framework, namely the Mining Inspectorate (Bureau
d’Inspection Miniere et Environnemental) and the National Geological Survey (Bureau de
Géologie National).10 While its Environmental Units, as discussed in Section 3.2.2, as well as the
Large Mining Investment Commission are operational, the Mining Inspectorate is not yet
completely structured as a fully operational body within the Ministry of Mines. A feasibility
study and concrete action plan are in place, which would allow the Government to proceed with
implementation as soon as the political context is favorable for completing institutional sector
reforms. Similarly, the National Geological Survey (Bureau de Géologie National) functions
were partially performed through by the Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank (Base de
Promotion de la Gouvernance des Ressources Minerales), but the formal creation of the National
Geological Survey has been on hold since the onset of the 2009 political crisis curtailed the
creation of new institutions.

   Initially, a Mining Sector Promotion Agency (Agence de Promotion du Secteur Minier) was to be created to provide
business development services as a limited liability company with private shareholders. Based on a series of
institutional assessment studies, including a feasibility study for the Agency, the decision was made not to create the
Agency in favor of establishing an institutional framework more in line with the functions of modern government. The
Agency’s intended functions were subsumed primarily by the Mineral Resources Governance Database (Base de
Promotion et Gouvernance des Ressources Minérales), which implemented programs initially assigned to the Agency,
such as programs to promote the formalization of ASM operations, environmental and legal awareness campaigns, and
community development,

                      6.   Annual declared exports of gold and gemstones from small scale mining increase
                           from about US$ 21 million today to US$ 50 million at the end of the project.

                      2003 to US$40 million in 2006. It decreased thereafter and reached a historical low in
                      2009 (US$2 million), clearly showing the impact of the 2008 ban on rough stones
                      exports (see Section 2.2). Since the ban was lifted in 2009, the value of gemstone exports

 sector                    to US$ 85 million at the end of the project.
                           Baseline: US$ 10 million, End Target: US$ 85 million, Actual: US$2.9 billion
                      Status: 100% achieved. According to the most recent official figures the annual
                      investment in 2009 amounted to US$2.9 billion (Central Bank of Madagascar), but
                      cumulative investments by QMM and Ambatovy between 2006 and 2012 have reached
                      more than US$6.5 billion. This does not reflect a trend but clearly demonstrates the
                      scope of mining development in the country. Annual investment has also grown, due to
                      increased exploration expenditures particularly before the 2009 crisis.



3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

51. The Project largely exceeded the proxy economic indicators used in the original efficiency
assessment in the PAD. The economic and financial assessment in Annex 4 of the PAD (p. 41)
utilized “possible contributions of mining to the economy? (PAD, p. 41) as a proxy approach for
measuring efficiency. This includes possible large-scale investment in ilmenite production, as
well as an increase in the reported production of gold and gemstones as a result of Project
interventions.

52. Projections of the mining production at the (original) end of the Project in 2008 were made
for two scenarios: (i) a base case scenario of one large-scale US$500 million investment which
was to result in an annual production value of US$143 million; and (ii) a best case scenario of
two large scale investments totaling US$1 billion which were to result in a US$378 million
mineral production value. The data suggest that the Project by far exceeded its expected results,
with at least US$6.5 billion in mining investments realized by the end of the Project, and over
US$140 million paid in taxes11 by mining companies in 2010 only, which suggests a much higher
production value. While it is unclear to what extent the returns on investments are attributable to
the Project, the Project had a role in making the large-scale mining law applicable with the
corresponding comprehensive Decree and the Ambatovy investment feasible by creating a
favorable business environment.

53. Another proxy measure of efficiency is the “value for money? approach. As shown in Table 6
below, while the actual costs of Components 1 and 2 were below the appraisal estimate,

Component 3 (“Promote private investments and value-added in the sector?) and Component 4
(“Operating Cost?) incurred cost overruns. The main increase in Project cost compared to
appraisal estimates pertains to Component 3, which is explained by a more ambitious and costly
geological program motivated by the intensified focus on industrial mining. Two additional
blocks of airborne surveys were added and financed both by the Project and the Government of
South Africa, which had expressed interest in parallel financing after appraisal.

54. About 40 percent of the cost overrun can be explained by the expanded coverage from
600,000 to 647,921 linear kilometers, and 60 percent or about US$ 900,000 is attributable to the
underestimation of costs at appraisal. It is worth noting that these cost overruns did not adversely
affect the overall efficiency of the Project, considering: (i) the significant increase in the airborne
survey resulted from a sharp increase in commodity and fuel prices associated with the global
mining boom; (ii) the unit cost per linear kilometer was lower in Madagascar than in the case of
similar projects implemented in other sub-Saharan African countries (see paragraph 55 below),
which also incurred significantly higher than anticipated airborne survey cost as a result of the
global mineral boom; (iii) the expansion of the coverage by about 50,000 line kilometers; and
(iv) the tremendous success of the geological program, which brought about new scientific
perspectives. The synthesis of all the geological work revealed a fundamentally new
understanding of Madagascar’s geological history and sub-soil, which was of great benefit to the
mining sector and of general interest to the public at large.

55. Comparing the cost of selected activities to similar ones in other projects is another way of
assessing efficiency. The single most costly activity carried out under the Project was the airborne
geophysical survey. While the actual contract value was substantially higher than expected (see
paragraph 54 above) at US$6.49 million compared to the US$4.86 million appraisal estimate
(PAD, p. 37), a comparison of unit costs of airborne surveys (expressed in nominal values), as
measured in US$ per linear kilometer flown, carried out in Madagascar, Uganda, Nigeria and
Tanzania shows that the unit cost in Madagascar was much lower than those in the other three
African countries (see Table 7 below).

56. Overall, overruns on operating costs, i.e. Component 4 of the Project, were modest and
mostly attributable to the extension of the Project’s lifetime from initially five years to a total of
8.5 years. The delay and cost overrun related to the extension of the closing date were directly
linked to the two-year “implementation freeze? associated with the 2009 crisis. Operating costs
exceeded the appraisal estimate of US$2.67 million by 177%; the actual Component 4 cost
amounted to US$4.73 million (final disbursements under the category). According to appraisal
figures, the annual operating costs were estimated at US$534,000 per year over a period of five
years, totaling US$2.67 million. Actual disbursements on operational expenses amounted to
US$588,000 per year over 8.5 years, totaling US$4.73 million). The cumulated overruns not
attributable to the Project’s extended implementation period were therefore rather modest at
US$189,000 over the project life – or US$22,000 per year on average.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57. The Overall Outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory, in light of:
          the High Relevance rating, given that the Project’s objectives and components were
           considered of high importance by the 2011 ISN in addressing governance and capacity
           needs in the mining sector, and that Project design remained highly relevant during
           implementation by adapting to the significant changes in the mining industry, notably the
           development of large-scale mining;
          the Moderately Satisfactory Efficacy rating, i.e. Moderately Satisfactory ratings for all
           three development objectives, given that despite a two-year hiatus following the 2009
           political crisis the Project succeeded in completing most of its intended objectives, such
           as: (i) improved transparency and governance as a result of enhanced legal and regulatory
           frameworks; formalization of gemstone production and trading; and improved
           transparency in tax and royalty payments (PDO 1); (ii) improved decentralized collection
           and use of mining revenues for local and regional development; and improved
           environmental management of mining activities; and (iii) the creation of a Mineral
           Resources Governance Promotion Data Bank and improved availability and management
           of geological information (PDO 3);

12
  Surfaces to be mapped are covered by parallel lines, with space in-between the lines to be defined in the contract.
Typically, a space of 250 m in-between lines implies that the plane flies twice the distance compared to covering the
same surface with 500 m line spacing. The costs are therefore compared by line kilometer (and not by surface).


                                                          26
         and the Substantial Efficiency rating, given: (i) that the Project contributed to the creation
          of a favorable environment that attracted at least US$6.5 billion in mining investments
          during the Project’s life time, and over US$140 million paid in taxes by mining
          companies in 2010 only; (ii) the lower unit cost per linear kilometer of airborne survey
          compared to those in other sub-Saharan mining countries; (iii) that delays and cost
          overruns were mainly associated with the extension of the closing date to accommodate
          the crisis-induced two-year “implementation freeze; ? and (iv) that no misprocurement
          occurred.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58. The Project contributed to improving the livelihoods of artisanal miners in the gold and
gemstones mining communes where it facilitated formalization, awareness raising and value
addition. The Project also had a direct social development impact in industrial mining communes
in the form of enhanced social accountability and technical assistance in community development
planning. Social accountability, based on civic engagement to demand transparency and
responsiveness in public policy making and implementation, is increasingly regarded as vital for
good governance. With regard to industrial mining, in partnership with the Bank-supported
Governance and Institutional Development Project and Integrated Growth Poles Project,
participatory budgeting of local tax and royalty revenues was piloted under the Project in six
mining communes. Although civil society capacity in social accountability is still weak, the
approach yielded positive results in terms of increased budget transparency, sound management
and improved service delivery. Following the piloting phase and many collaborative exchanges
between the different parties involved, the Second Governance and Institutional Development
Project is now rolling-out participatory budgeting to 69 communes throughout the country.

59. As a result of the Project-supported participatory budgeting of local tax revenues (carrier tax,
construction permits and mining taxes) collected from QMM between 2006-2009 in the Anosy
region about Ariary 700 million or about US$430,000 were utilized to fund local development
sub-projects in three rural beneficiary communes (Soanierana, Ampasy Nahampoana and
Mandromondromotra).13 In addition, in 2008, the QMM investment created 3,600 new formal
mining and ancillary services jobs (World Bank, 2008b, p. 15). The Ambatovy investment also
contributed directly to local economic development, mainly through buying and hiring locally.
Ambatovy is presently entering into its production phase, and has so far created around 15,000
mining and ancillary services jobs, which supported about 65,000 to 75,000 family members.14
The mining company also started a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, which funds
educational, health and vocational training programs. Local populations are also benefitting from
improved access to markets as a result of the transport infrastructure constructed by Ambatovy.15
Lastly, communes have benefited from increased tax revenues collected from the Ambatovy
investment.

13
  The local development sub-projects included investments in schools, water supply and sanitation, communal market,
rural roads, bridges, maternity care facility, rural hospital, canal drainage, dam for rice culture, electrification extension,
and a vaccination facility.
14
   According to the Ambatovy Sustainability Report (2010), the company paid about $19.8 million in local employee
wages and benefits in 2010.
15
  Transport infrastructure investments include 100 km of roads, 12 km of rail, and the rehabilitation and
upgrade of the Toamasina port.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

60. A workshop on governance of mining revenues at the local level and an international
symposium on Madagascar’s new geological map were held in Antananarivo around the time of
Project closure to disseminate key results and explore the way forward. Key findings and
recommendations can be summarized as follows:
     Workshop on governance of mining revenues at the local level. With QMM in production
      since the beginning of the 2009 political crisis and Ambatovy about to start, much of the
      attention regarding good governance of mining resources focused on royalties – which
      represent the bulk of the revenues generated by mining (sometimes long after production
      starts). The Project produced a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in
      distributing and managing royalties, especially at the local level, in an equitable way. The
      workshop, attended by about 50 key representatives from the Government (Ministries of
      Mines, Finance and Decentralization), the Chamber of Mines, civil society members and
      development partners, was a great opportunity to identify possible solutions in a situation
      where no legal reforms were possible because of the transitory nature of the regime. The
      Project’s contribution was acknowledged both in terms of effort to offer a consensual
      approach to the identification of beneficiary communes and a working model to benefit
      sharing through a community foundation mechanism. A working group was proposed to
      urgently find a workable solution applicable to the case of royalties generated by Ambatovy.
     Symposium on the new geological map of Madagascar. Following years of acquisition and
      interpretation of geological information (airborne geophysical survey, geological mapping
      on various blocks, and a national synthesis map at 1:1,00,0000 scale), the Project
      successfully delivered the new geological map of Madagascar right at project closure. The
      objective of the international symposium, attended by more than 200 participants mainly
      from Government, academia and the private sector, was to show the importance of
      geological knowledge and illustrate the Project’s contribution to the development of the
      mining sector as well as demonstrate the progress made in the understanding of
      Madagascar’s geological and metallogenic potential. It was a unique occasion to discuss the
      renewed interpretation of the Precambrian shield in terms of six geodynamic building blocks
      (from southwest to northeast, the Vohibory, Androyen-Anosyen, Ikalamavony,
      Antananarivo, Antongil-Masora, and Bemarivo domains). A strong case was also made for
      keeping this reliable scientific information available to the public to improve the
      management of mineral resources.

61. Furthermore, feedback on the Project’s experience was solicited and received from a limited
number of key partners and stakeholders. Private sector respondents considered the Project’s
support to the mineral licensing system and the availability of high-quality reliable geo-data
information its main contributions to improving transparency and mineral resources governance.
Furthermore, the Project’s instrumental role in setting up the Chamber of Mines of Madagascar
was acknowledged, which was of great importance in structuring the sector
(www.chambredesminesdemadagascar.com). Civil society respondents expressed concern about
the rise in corruption in the sector following the 2009 crisis and underscored the need for
strengthened social accountability and other governance tools. Development partners commented

                                                28
on the Project’s role in facilitating the recognition that extractive projects play a critical role in
the country's sustainable development, and the fight against poverty. The EITI is deemed
essential to advancing transparency in Madagascar even though the persistent crisis makes it
difficult to implement the principles of good governance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

62. The following significant risks to the sustainability of Project investments were identified at
the time of Project closing:

   Financial sustainability of Project-supported institutions. As pointed out in the Project’s
    last ISR, some of the Project-supported institutions have been successfully integrated into
    Government institutions. Most notably, the decentralized environmental units, designed, set
    up and initially funded under the Project, were successfully integrated into the organizational
    chart of the Ministry of Mines. Civil servant positions were created and the relevant staff was
    recruited following the Ministry of Mines’ request. Similarly, the Bank noted during the
    closing mission that key staff at the Large Scale Mining and Investment Commission and the
    Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank – originally financed under the Project as
    consultants – had been offered positions at the Ministry. However, the Gemology Institute’s
    financial sustainability was still uncertain. Subsidizing this institution had been shown to be
    necessary for it to provide high-standard gemological training to the local population at
    reasonable cost. The Project and the Bank had repeatedly called for the enforcement of the
    existing legal provision (Article 294 of the 2005 Mining Decree), which earmarked a portion
    of the surface fees to the Institute. Given the visibility of this institution in the sector, it
    appeared likely but not confirmed that the Ministry was going to initiate such a budgetary
    transfer to ensure full continuation of the Gemology Institute.

   Uncertainty of institutional reforms. Due to the political crisis, and the Transition authorities’
    inability to carry out legal reforms, the institutional component (Component 1) did not lead to
    the creation of a Geological Survey and a new Inspectorate, but rather to a large number of
    tools, studies and recommendations, i.e. prerequisites for concrete next steps. Admittedly,
    few countries have fully outsourced mining inspectorate functions outside the Ministry of
    Mines, and sound management of geological data and efficient promotion of mineral
    resources can be achieved directly by a Directorate of Geology. However, international
    experience suggests that a degree of autonomy is needed for geological surveys to perform
    their role in a sustainable and efficient way. In addition, the Project strengthened the capacity
    of the Mining Cadastre designed and created under its predecessor operation. Considered a
    “best practice? model in Africa until 2008, the Mining Cadastre greatly suffered from the
    political crisis, which provoked a de facto moratorium on mining permits. The Mining
    Cadastre’s return to full functioning will be critical for the sector’s continuous development.
    More generally, the appetite for reform of future Governments and their ability to follow up
    on the institutional assessments and feasibility studies funded under the Project will partly
    determine their development outcome.

63. While Project achievements on the institutional side bear a significant level of risk, other
results, such as the contribution to the legal and regulatory frameworks, the data produced by the
geophysical airborne survey, the geological mapping, the pilots on artisanal and small scale
mining operators, and the innovative approaches to better integrate industrial mining into regional
and local developments, which brought about a culture change in the sector, are likely to have a
lasting positive impact on the development of the sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. The Project’s conceptual approach was, overall, appropriate and consistent with the Bank’s
and Government’s 2003 and 2007 strategies. It was in line with international good practice
experience at the time and in many aspects similar to other technical assistance projects of that
generation. However, the results framework could have been better structured. Some of the
targets were overly ambitious or not fully attributable to the Project, such as an increase in export
earnings.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65. Overall, the Bank’s supervision efforts were key to keeping most of the Project’s activities
reasonably on track until the political crisis, despite frequent changes at the top in the Ministry of
Mines. Bank teams conducted missions three to four timers per year and local staff (mainly on
procurement, financial management and safeguards) maintained a day-to-day dialogue. The main
shortcoming relating to Bank supervision was the lack of tracking of key performance indicators.

66. The Bank developed an exceptionally proactive implementation support tool when the project
was allowed to resume in 2011 after a two-years “freeze.? In order to catch up on the delays and
help the PIU to achieve a maximum of results in the limited remaining time, the Bank undertook
a comprehensive review of the Project in July 2011 and designed a dedicated integrated
monitoring tool, which reinforced the Project management and accounting system by ensuring a
week-by-week follow-up and facilitating supervision of Project activities and credit proceeds.
This tool, an Excel-based system called by the teams the “dashboard,? allowed to precisely
monitor procurement, contractual steps and payments, disbursement and overall budget planning
and monitoring. In the context of Project closure, the tool proved particularly useful as it was able
to instantly capture the Project’s financial situation and accurately forecast the final expenditures
at Project closure, based on existing contractual engagements, budget planning, the Project’s local
account balances and the Bank’s disbursement data. This function is often time-consuming in the
supervision of Bank projects, where the Task Team Leader (TTL) needs to reconcile data coming
from dedicated Project management and accounting systems with those of the Bank’s internal
disbursement system, which can easily lead to overspending of funds available under IDA credits.
The supervision of financial management and procurement aspects of the Project appears to have
been carried out in a timely, diligent and thorough manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67. Overall, Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, despite the above-mentioned
design and M&E shortcomings, given that, for the most part, the Project’s ambitious program was
accomplished, utilizing international best practice, despite the very challenging political context
of its three last years.




                                                 30
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68. The Borrower performance has to be assessed differently prior and after the political crisis
because its legitimacy and therefore its political and legal means to monitor the mining sector
changed:
       Throughout inception, preparation, and implementation until early 2009, the Project
        benefitted from strong commitment from the Ministry of Mines, other relevant agencies,
        and up to the MAP Secretary at the Presidency. Government support led to the quick
        implementation of Project activities and timely resolution of implementations issues.
       Starting with the political crisis, the MAP was still considered, by default, the main
        strategy of the new authorities. However, in the absence of a recognized Government,
        numerous Government changes, and a dramatic lack of resources following the reduction
        in international aid, planning and strategizing became challenging. Without any updated
        blueprint, the sectoral administration continued along the previous lines as much as
        possible. The most negative effect of the crisis on sector management was the de facto
        moratorium on mining permit allocations, which disrupted the functions of the Mining
        Cadastre and the Ministry of Mines. However, despite frequent rumors about the
        renegotiation of contracts or the mining "ordonnance" (questioning the mining code
        and/or the law on large-scale mining), no radical policy reversals took place. The
        Ministry of Mines remained supportive of the Project and of other transparency
        objectives throughout (it renewed for instance its adhesion to the EITI in 2011). However,
        in the current political instability, concern was expressed about the Ministry of Mines’
        ability to ensure the sustainability of project results.

69. Counterpart funding was continued throughout the Project life, even during the political
Transition, albeit occasionally with delays. At the time of Project closure the Government still
had arrears towards local consultants.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
70. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) played a pivotal role in successfully coordinating
Project activities across all of the components. In general, the PIU satisfactorily met its
disbursement, procurement and fiduciary obligations. Communication between the PIU and
Implementing Agencies was not always fluid and resulted in some frustrations on the part of the
Ministry of Mines. However, the PIU remained effective throughout the Project, including
during the two-year "freeze" imposed by the Bank, and successfully resumed activity during the
last year to catch up on the main deliverables. Operational expenses exceeded original forecasts
mainly because of the extension of Project duration.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71. Overall borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory in the light of the
Government’s mixed and overall Moderately Satisfactory and the Implementation Agency’s
Satisfactory performance.



                                               31
6. Lessons Learned

72. Key lessons learned from Project implementation include:

   High-level scientific oversight is key to ensuring the success of a complex geology program.
    The Project experienced a two-layer approach to quality control: both airborne geophysical
    surveys and field geological mapping activities were supervised by dedicated consultancy
    firms; and, in turn those supervisors themselves were coordinated by a panel of experts that
    provided guidance throughout the Project. Different interpretations of geology settings are
    common and pose the risk of inefficiencies or inconsistencies when the geology program is
    carried out with by multiplicity of providers. The panel of experts has typically maintained a
    very coherent scientific vision, which helped to renew the overall understanding of the
    Island’s geology.

   A multi-stakeholder approach is critical to promoting good governance of mineral
    resources. In situations of political instability like the crisis that hit the country in 2009 and
    affected the project during its last three years, achieving results in sensitive sectors like
    mining becomes very challenging. The Project successfully remained dedicated to the
    Government’s commitment to good governance in mining, and to building strong relationship
    with the private sector, civil society and donors.

component (as stated in the PAD, Annex 1)
1 - Strengthening Transparency and Governance in mining

Component 1.1: Adjustment of the Legal and Regulatory Framework

Indicator 1:             Status: Fully Achieved (100 %)
Special regime for
gemstones to             Results: A new regime for gemstones was achieved through various provisions
improve access to        included in the legal framework and the subsequent regulations, in particular: (i) a
the resource,            change in size of mining squares (from squares of 2.5 kilometers to squares of 625
liberalize               meters), which drastically improved gemstone miners’ ability to access resources (it
marketing, and           required a review of previously allocated mining titles); (ii) artisanal miners or
facilitate               entrepreneurs were given legal status, which allowed them to form associations and
normalization of         access mining permits - an important step towards accessing the market and
small-scale mining.      promoting formalization (or “normalization? as stated in the indicator); (iii) a one-
                         stop-shop for export was created and export procedures were streamlined; (iv) the
                         fiscal decentralization and collection of royalties strengthened local control over
                         gemstone production; and (v) provisions to allow the transfer of the responsibility
                         for the allocation of mining titles to smaller entrepreneurs to local authorities.

Component 1.2: Support to decentralized management of mineral resources

possess an outreach      communities were trained. Communication campaigns were systematically
program and will         conducted to inform and sensitize the public on the mining legislation. The pilot
conduct                  testing of this Mining Administration Center approach yielded important lessons for
communication            effectively addressing the informal and illegal exploitation of Gemstones in well
campaigns with           identified geographic areas in Madagascar. The pilot experience guided policy
local communities        makers in deciding on necessary adjustment to the regulations. A sector study
                         conducted in 2012 by the Project and WWF to develop a toolkit for the management
                         of rushes concluded that the BAM approach should be reinvigorated.

Component 1.3: Program for the certification and quality control of Gemstones

Indicator 3:             Status: Fully Achieved (100%)

Creation of small        Results: (i) Gemstones exchanges achieved (260 days of gemstone market
exchanges and            organized)16 and self-sustained; (ii) Quality Control capacity was put in place with

The following additional performance indicators, comprised of four mining-related and one
petroleum-related indicator were added at the time of approval of the Additional Financing (FA,
Schedule 2, p. 10):
(i) No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, updated hydrocarbons law and regulations,
    also addressing environmental concerns have been prepared in line with of international practice,
    and a draft law has been submitted to the Parliament.

Status: Not applicable. This indicator refers to activities not funded by the Project. Indicator was added at
Additional Financing approval, as part of the coordination agreement with the Government of Norway
when the Government insisted on having an integrated approach to extractive industry in accordance with
the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP, 2007). The Government of Norway launched the Oil for Development
project on hydrocarbon aspects in parallel to the Project and kept it active until February 2009. The work
on the new hydrocarbon law was well advanced; a draft was prepared and discussed widely among
stakeholders to integrate good international practices. However, the Oil for Development project was put
on hold after the political crisis and before the draft law could be submitted to the Parliament for passage.
(ii) No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, the fiscal framework for mining, including
     large scale investments, has been reviewed to include adjustments to optimize fiscal revenues, while
     maintaining a competitive edge to investments, and a draft law has been submitted to the Parliament.
Status: 50% achieved. A comprehensive assessment of the mining fiscal framework was conducted under
the Project and recommendations formulated in early 2009. However, the political crisis prevented
adoption of the draft and implementation of reforms. However, the detailed legal and fiscal analysis
provides valuable guidance to the Government in charting the future course of the fiscal framework for
mining.
(iii) No later than 18 months after the date of effectiveness, methodologies to control ASM rushes and to
      manage conflicts between ASM activities and protected areas have been developed and are ready for
      implementation at central and decentralized level;
Status: 100% achieved. The project supported the production of the 'ASM Rush Management Policy
Recommendations and Toolkit' in 2012 with a strong focus on mining in or near protected areas.
Recommended next steps are designed to be practical and readily implementable today, at relatively low
cost.
(iv) Within 24 months from the date of effectiveness, the National Geological Survey and the integrated
     sector data bank and information systems have been established and are operative;
Status: 50% achieved. The Project financed the setting up of the Mineral Resources Governance Data Bank,
which is the core of the National Geological Survey (BGN). The BGN could not be formally
institutionalized in the context of the Transition, but a comprehensive feasibility study on its sustainability


                                                     38
and its possible externalization out of the Directorate of Geology was undertaken during the last year of
Project.
 (v) No later than by December 2009, financial mechanisms for long term sustainability of mining
     institutions have been established and are operative.
Status: 50% achieved. Preparation of sustainability studies for the National Geological Survey (BGN), the
Mining Inspectorate (BIME) and the Madagascar Gemology Institute (IGM) started before 2009. During
the last year of the Project, those studies were successfully completed and produced recommendations for
the short and medium term. However, they could not lead to immediate decisions because of the inability of
the Transition Government to launch institutional reforms.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The Mineral Resources Governance Project (PRGM) was developed to meet the priorities of
the Government of Madagascar laid out in the declaration of mining policy of 2003and the
Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) of 2007. The project began during the second half of 2003, with
funding from the Government of Madagascar, the World Bank (Credit - 3754 MAG), plus some
parallel financing from USAID and AFD for a total budget of US$ 38,6 million. An additional
$US 8.8 million was granted by the Malagasy Government and the World Bank in June 2007,
without changing the initial objectives of the project.

2. The objectives of the project focused on three key points: (i) improving transparency and
strengthening governance in the mining sector, (ii) promoting institutional reforms for the
decentralized management of mineral resources; and (iii) promoting private investment and value
added in the mining sector.

3. The project was designed out of the crisis in 2003, and closed during another crisis. In line
with the measures taken by the entire international community against the unconstitutional
change of regime in March 2009, the funding for the project was suspended for two years.
Implementation of the project suffered from this decision because many activities had to be
suspended. When financing resumed in 2011, the project had merely a year before closure with
less than US$ 3 million of funds remaining uncommitted. At that time, given the Bank interim
strategy, the project had also to focus on interventions with direct effect on the population and
employment as well as those relating to private sector development.

4. Despite some indicators that could not reach target, partly because of this political context
prevailing after 2009, the Project achievements are tangible and are expected to produce
significant effects on the development of the sector over the long term. Major achievements of the
Project include the following:

       The development of geological knowledge is the most important achievement of the
        Project. The new geological map integrates the results of years of research based on
        detailed multidisciplinary technologies, fieldwork by teams of international and Malagasy
        scientists, covering about 70% of the territory. It marks a complete evolution of
        knowledge compared to the previous version developed in 60-70 years because of the
        entirely different conceptual perspective and interpretation. This wealth of data, maps and
        documents - stored in a state of the art GIS – will be of use to the development of the
        mining sector, but also to many applications such as land-use planning and conflict
        resolution on the use of natural resources.

       At the level of legal and regulatory frameworks, several legal texts were produced and /
        or revised including the Large-Scale Mining Investment Law and the Mining Code.
        These texts have contributed to the establishment of a more favorable mining
        environment, and helped to establish the confidence of major mining operators to invest
        in Madagascar. To date, more than $US 6 billion of FDI are engaged in research and
        mining, compared to about $US 23 million in 2005.

       Regarding institutional reforms, the Gemological Institute of Madagascar (IGM), the
        Promotion and Governance of Mineral Resources Data Bank (BPGRM), and the mining
        Environmental Units (CEM) have been developed and are currently functional. For its
        part, the Office of the Mining Cadastre (BCMM) was supported in its work to promote
        investment and was able to play its full role in the management of mining permits until

                                               44
        the advent of the political crisis of 2009. Before that date, it was recognized as a model
        among similar organizations in Africa. Those institutions represent key pillars in the
        institutional sector management and contribute to the objectives of strengthening
        governance, improving transparency and promotion of private investment and added
        value.

       However, some institutions were only partially established or designed. Typically, the
        Mining Management Centers (BAM) for artisanal mining ceased to be relevant following
        the Government's decision to ban the export raw gemstone in 2008. Similarly a feasibility
        study of the Private Sector Promotion Agency (APSM) revealed it could not be viable,
        and an alternative model was put forward with two other agencies: the Geological Survey
        and the Mining Inspectorate.

       Artisans and small-scale miners have benefited from awareness campaigns on mining
        policy and the mining code. Divided into 24 zones, over 2900 people attended. The small
        grants program was however discontinued after 10 small mining projects because it
        generated significant administrative costs and cumbersome procedures.

       In terms of capacity building, more than 400 people from the Ministry of Mines received
        training on governance and management of mineral resources.

       The various mining institutions at the central level are currently interconnected to
        facilitate communication and exchange of information through intranet and extranet
        implemented in the project.

       The project supported the municipalities affected by large-scale mining, so they can
        actually enjoy their economic impact. Indeed, the contribution of mining projects on the
        socio-economic development has been integrated into the local and regional development
        plans of their areas.

5. The project has helped put in place legal and regulatory frameworks and institutions, which
strongly favored the development of a mining industry as well as the development of value
addition in the artisanal mining sector. These reforms have helped to establish better and more
decentralized management, and governance and transparency in the sector. The current situation
demonstrates some of the building blocks remain fragile, but some of the most decisive
contributions, like the improved geological knowledge, have laid the foundation for the
development of research and mining for decades to come.

6. A weakness of the project was communication on objectives and achievements at beneficiary
level (artisans, small and large miners). Despite many workshops and communication tools like
its website, the Project lacked visibility in the activities it was undertaking. The symposium on
geology at project closure helped reveal the massive amount of work it had achieved, but relevant
communication around the BPGRM and the definition of transparent, non-discriminatory and
incentives for public access to its resources still require special attention.

In order to capitalize on the Project contribution and ensure sustainable outcomes, the Ministry of
Mines should ensure the continuation of efforts. Some of the material that the Project produced
should be used in the near future like draft texts for the creation of the Geological Survey and the
Mining Inspectorate. Capacity building of staff and senior Administration Mining remains a
priority area.
