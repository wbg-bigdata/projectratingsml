                         The Mineral Resources Governance Project (PGRM) was built to assist the Government of Madagascar in implementing its strategy to accelerate sustainable development and
                         reduce poverty in Madagascar through the strengthening of governance and transparency in the management of mineral resources. It was highly relevant in the context of the 2003
                         Declaration of Mining Policy and the 2007 Madagascar Action Plan which both expressed a clear intention to develop mining and improve the management of extractive industries so
                         that they sustainably contribute to the people. With mining rushes on precious stones and traditional gold mining that have continuously involved hundred thousands of workers

                         across the Island, and the dramatic development of multi-billion industrial mines during the life of the project, the project objective has remained extremely relevant until now. Under
                         the support of PGRM, the Government has developed cutting and polishing of gemstones, improved their trading, certification and export, and developed tools, pilots and other
                         initiatives to assist decentralized authorities in formalizing artisanal mining. Under PGRM, the Government has also strengthened its capacities to facilitate and monitor industrial
                         mining operations, including transparency. With the project, the Government also fully renewed the knowledge on the country's geology and mineral resources. The new geological
                         map of Madagascar, with a wealth of related geo-scientific information, represents a major public good for future developments.

                         Flagship achievements include:
                         1) The revision of the legal and regulatory frameworks (2005);
                         2) The new geological map of Madagascar and the national geo-databank (BPGRM);
                         3) The set up of the Gemology Institute of Madagascar (IGM);
                         4) The launch of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI);
                         5) The set up of environmental management units within the Ministry of Mines regional directions, including a fully integrated geo-referenced monitoring system;
                         6) A range of capacity building tools, pilots and approaches for i) formalizing artisanal mining and improving the gemstones supply chain (including a toolkit for dealing with rushes
                         around protected areas), and ii) integrating industrial mining into local and regional development (including recommendations for mining revenue sharing).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is approaching completion and as such activities are being wrapped up. The Government should ensure all geo-data acquired during the project are managed in a
                         sustainable way and stay accessible to the public.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
