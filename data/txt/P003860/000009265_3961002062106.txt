EMORANIDU  AND RECO    DATION OF THE MSIDEI T
OF THE INUTRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AID DVELOPMNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ZIDOUSIA
FOR A TREE CROP Sk4LLOLDER DEVELOPMT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$87.6 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The propoced Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
a Tree Crop Smallholder Development Project.
2         The Role of Agriculture. Agriculture is a major sector of the
Indonesian economy, accounting for 55 percent of total employment, and
20 percent of GDP. It is the principal source of income and employment for
Indonesia's predominantly rural population, the largest source of traded goods
in the economy, and contributes 25 percent of non-oil exports. Basically
sound Government policies have helped maintain long-term agricultural growth
at about 4 percent per annum, a rate that has outpaced population growth,
eabled self-sufficiency in food production, increased exports by about
5 percent per annum, and helped dramatically reduce the number of rural
dwellers with incomes below the absolute poverty line of US$82/headlyear, from
44 million in 1976, to 20 million in 1987. Given the general distribution of
income., 70 percent of farm families remain quite poor, with incomes less than
US$164Iheadlyear.
3.       Tbe Tree Crops Subsector.  Indonesia is a competitive producer of a
wide range of tree crops, which account for 17 percent of agricultural GDP and
80 percent of agricultural non-timber exports, with coconut, coffee, rubber
and oil palm being the principal crops. Tree crops are especially important
for small farmers in the outer islands, where the crops. are ideally suited to
the climate and soil conditions and are esseutial to stem depletion of the
forests and degradation of the widespread fragile soils. They provide about
12 percent of total employment, and a significantly larger proportion of rural
employment. With rice self-sufficiency achieved, and increasing pressure on
land and water resources, the agriculture sector's future growth performance
will increasingly depend on diversifying to higher value products including an
expanded use of the country's natural advantage in tree crops to increase the
growth of tree crop output above the rate of 3.4 percent achieved in the
1980Q.
4.        Rjuber, of which 90 percent is exported, contributes US$1 billion or
about 40 percent of non-timber agriculture exports. However, the stand of
trees is aging, and production and exports will decline from a projected
1.7 million tonslyear after 2000 unless yields and the current rate of
planting is increased. A reversal of this possible decline would involve the
combined efforts of the commercial sector, Govermment support services, and
smallholders. Coconuts are grown essentially for the domestic market by
smallholder farmer., particularly in poor coastal areas not suitable for other
cash crops. Of the total production of 800 million tons, 5 percent is
exported. Current and planned plantings are expected to increase exports to



-2
15 percent of the total crop by 2000. This would represent only a minor share
of world trade In coconut products, and a negligible share of trade in total
vegetable oils. Coconut oil has special uses in detergent and confectionery
industries, and growth in this market in industrial countries is expected to
be steady, in line with population increases.
5.        Government straterv recognizes tree crops:  (a) as the most
environmentally and economically sound means to alleviate poverty for the
outer Islands' rural population by raising their Incomes and promoting
regional development; and (b) as a vehicle for continuing agriculture's role
as an engine of environmentally sustainable arowth for incomes exports,
domestic food supplies and agro-industry development, .'k-ough economically
efficient and ecologically adapted farming systems. To achieve its goals in
the subsector, Government has adopted several major policy reforms over the
last few years: (a) deregulation of trade in edible oils to improve their
pricing and distribution; (b) encouragement of greater comercial sector
participation through streamlined investment approval procedures; (c)
improvements in the efficiency of public sector estates, by placing tbem on a
market-financed basis; and (d) financing arrangements for smallholders,
consistent with the long gestation period for investments, and the associated
inherent risks for farmers and lenders.
6.        Follawlzg the January 1990 banking system reforms which eliminated
most targeted bank credit for smallholders, and recognizing that the past
programs using the banking system had failed, Government decided to finance
its smallholder tree crop program through its development budget, rather than
through the banking system. This involves a grant for the establishment of
the crop, and credit managed by the Directorate General of Estates for
maintenance costs, with repayment obligations consistent with ability to pay.
The grant is required and justified to enable poor and near-poor farmers to
participate in a program with a long lead-time before trees are mature and
benefits accrue. Government is continuing to review the possibilities for
direct and indirect cost recovery mechanims and alternative credit schemes,
which might further enhance the longer-term sustainability of the program. A
study financed under a Japanese Grant is underway to assist the Government
conduct this review.
7.        Government's proposed new arrangements have four major advantagess
(a) subsidies will be explicit and financed through the budget;
(b) distortionary effects on the operation of the financial sector and rural
commercial credit mechanisms will be minumized; (c) poverty reduction is one
of the major purposes underlying the arrangements; and (d) Government will
achieve a significant improvement in the level of cost recovery. Under
current Indonesian projects, credit repayments are in the order of
10-20 percent, although the implicit expectations in the small intermediation
margins allowed at appraisals were for repayment rates near 100 percent. We
expect the proposed project to achieve a significant improvement in credit
repayment over the current situation, possibly to the level of 50-60 percent
achieved in comparable circumstances elsewhere.
8.        Past  gxoerience. Most Bank-assisted tree crop projects in various
countries have been implemented satisfactorily. In Indonesia, Government has
developed two approaches to foster smallholder productions First, a program
under which the Directorate General of Estates has used project management
units to provide extension and inputs, and subsidized credit from a state



commercial bank, to enable existing farmers to plant high yielding tree crops
on their land. The second approach has been the nucleus estate and
smallholders program, using estate companies to develop estates together with
small plots for farmers to be settled around the nucleus, that provides access
to inputs, credit, and markets. Both approaches have been valid for their
particular target groups. The Bank committed some US$880 million to eleven
planting projects from 1973 to 1985. Project completion, audit and progress
reports indicate the projects had achieved plantings of high-yielding
varieties of some 290,000 ha for 224,000 families, and had satisfactory
economic rates of return, despite lower comodity prices, and more severe
manpower, budget, and institutional constraints than expected at appraisal.
As recommended by the Bank, the Government has addressed these problems hy
deferring expansion programs, initiating a human resource development program,
simplifying the budget procedures, establishing inspection services to provide
for techaical quality control, and granting full authority over the program to
the Director General of Estates. The organization for overseeing project
management units is well managed, and the structure has the ability to
effectively execute large projects to a satisfactory standard.
9.        Bank Strateav and Rationale for Involvement.  The Bank supports
Government's goals mentioned above.  Since 1985, when the last tree crop
production project loan was approved for new planting, the Bank has
concentrated its efforts on Government's implementation of the past Bank-
assisted tree crop projects, pending adequate progress in investment financing
and cost recovery as described above. The Bsnk's only new lending in the
subsector since 1985 has been for human resource development (Loan 2992-IND)
and for processing facilities for oil palm and rubber (Loan 3000-IRD), aimed
at capturing the benefits of past investments. During this period, the Bank
has also pursued an active policy dialogue on all areas of recent policy
reforms highlighted above. Through these efforts, agreement has been reached
with Government and with the Asian Developmont Bank, the other major external
lender, on the overall policy framework which is now considered conducive to
renewed Bank support for a smallholder planting program.
10.       The current Bank strategy is to support:  (a) a continued enabling
policy environment; (b) continued improvements in the central and provincial
institutional frameworks for the subsector, including research and extension,
a stronger rural financial infrastructure, and the improved oversight of the
existing Government investments in estates; and (c) investments in smallholder
development, including ensuring the adequate upkeep of immature plantings. A
principal objective is to assist Government to determine what further
improvements to the financing and cost recovery system should be made to
provide a sustained flow of financing for smallholder tree crop development.
11.       Pro4ect Objectives.  The project would promote income growth and
employment opportunities in the outer islands. It vould target poor small-
farm families, with priority being given to the poorest in each area; improve
access to agricultural inputs, credit and extension; and ensure that poorer
families and women are not excluded by dispensing with requirements for a
formal land title as a condition of project entry. The project would also
help Government develop sustainable financing procedures for the smallholder
program.
12.       Proiect Description.  The project woulds  (a) through provision of
inputs, access tracks, and extension and training, assist 161,000 poor farm



-4-
families establish or maintain 130,500 ha of rubber and 51,000 ha of coconuts
in 12 provinces; (b) strengthen project management to undertake the project,
Including Implementing ite environmental management plan, and cost recovery
scheme; (c) strengthen sector lnstitutions In land titling, auditing,
monitoring and inspection of smallholder project activities; and (d) provide
for studies related to coot recovery, to a future project, and to poverty-
related agricultural development. All Indicative planting targets would be
subject to revie during implementation in line with the goale of maintaining
quality and cost control. The project, to be implemented by the Directorate
General of Estates over seven years, Is expected to cost US$154.5 million,
including US$10.8 million in taxes and duties and US$2.4 million in reserved
procurement of vehicles. The proposed Bank loan of US$87.6 million would
finance 62 percent of project costs exclusive of taxes, duties, and reserved
procurement. Some incremental operating expenditures would be financed on a
decliniug basis. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan; the amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements; a timetable of key project
processing events; and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are in
Schedules A to D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, go. 10288 dated March 27, 1992, is being distributed separately.
13.       Agtions Agreed. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government that it would: (a) after consultation with the Bank and not
later then March 31, 1993, revise, if necessary, its system for sustainable
financing and cost recovery for future smallholder tree crop development,
taking into account the recommendations of an ongoing study; (b) follow agread
criteria for selecting project participants; (c) through the Project
Management Units provide credit to farm families and administer smallholder
cost recovery agreements in accordance with agreed procedures; and (d) not
later than September 30, 1992, invite proposals from Consultants to carry out
the annual inspection. Disbursement Conditions Credit for immature phase
maintenance is to be granted under the Project to about 40,000 smallholders
who have establisbed about 52,500 bectares of rubber under the earlier Second
Smallholder Rubber Development Project (Loan 2494-IND). Related disbursements
would not be permitted until the Government has established procedures,
acceptable to the Bank, for the credit recovery from such smallholders.
14.      Role of Women.  Indonesian women are active participants in all
sectors of the economy. In general, households flexibly allocate labor for
tree crops cultivation without regard to gender, in order to maximize income.
Similarly, consumption and investment expenditure decisions are typically
taken at a faily level. The extension service, which employs mainly men but
also some wamen for identical duties, would direct its activities to all
involved family members--men, women, and youths. Spouses would co-sign
project participation and credit agreements. Where women are heads of
households, they would be fully eligible to join the project in their own
names, and their number would be monitored a maid-term review would determine
whether project activities had given rise to any specific problems relating to
women's participation.
15.      Envlrnm .  Government has screened each project site, and the
project as a whole, confirming that the environmental impact of the small
farmers developing their own land under the project is dominantly positlve,
with possible negative impacts able to be mitigated by adoption of appropriate
land preparation and access track construction, use of approved agricultural



-5-
chemicals, and other matters outlined in the environmental anagement plan.
Settlement is not involved, nor are there expected negative impacts upon
indigenous peoples, primary forests, or blo-diversity. Environmental Impacts
would be monitored under the project's mamagemat and inspection procedures.
16.       Proieot enegits snd Rsks.  The project would improve incomes of
161,000 farm families in the outer islande to about four times the absolute
poverty level of $82Ibeadlyear, promote non-petroleum export., and contribute
to domestic food supplies. It would lso further strengthen the Government's
capacity to Implement smallholder tree crop projects in an efficient and
environmentally sound manner, and assist in developing a sustainable financing
and cost recovery system for tree crop development. The project's economic
rate of return is estimated at 14 percent. No major technical risks are
expected, as project staff are familiar with the well proven technology. The
project would remain viable even if output prices were 20 percent lower than
projected. Past expcrience indicates that Indonesian tree crop production has
maintained its competitiveness more effectively than most other agricultural
producers, in spite of falling commodity prices.
17.        Rgcgmmeda *o.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
