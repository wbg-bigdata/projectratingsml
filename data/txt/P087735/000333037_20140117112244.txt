Executive summary
The Samawa – Nasiriya road rehabilitation project is part of the Component A.1 Highway
Rehabilitation Works of the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) financed by the World
Bank’s loan. The implementing agencies for the ERRP are the Iraqi Ministry of Construction and
Housing (MOCH) and the State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB).
The objective of the ERRP is to improve the condition of roads assets by rehabilitating highly
damaged segments of the country’s highway and rural road networks, re-establishing critical river
crossings, and restoring the capacity to manage and maintain road assets. The ERRP aimed to
benefit road users throughout Iraq, as well as promote the country’s economic integration, facilitate
trade, and support reconstruction efforts across all sectors.
This Environmental and Social Management Plan was prepared to identify environmental and
social impacts of upgrading the road section Samawa–Nasiriyah (both the construction and
maintenance phases), and propose mitigation measures to address the negative impacts identified.
The findings of the ESMP are presented in the management plan matrix.
Project description
The Samawa – Nasiriya road passes through the Al Muthanna governorate in Iraq. It is considered
one of the vital transportation roads that link these two governorates. The road traffic is heavy.
Heavy weight trucks, trailers, buses and personal cars use the road for the transportation of goods,
people, and agricultural products. The total length of the road (covered by this study) is about
20km, separated in two segments 10km long each. The road width is 7.3 m. The road on both sides
has a safe clearance of 3m each side.

The general objective of the project is to improve the transportation infrastructure in the area, which
will stimulate transport and trade given the heavy usage of this road. In addition, it is to improve
social and economic conditions for the local communities and for the road users.

The road rehabilitation will follow the existing alignment. The work will comprise repairs to
damaged road surfacing, drainage cleaning and repairs, restoration of eroded shoulders and road
furniture, re-installing stolen road signs and renewing pavement marking. The pavement layers for
the remaining length will be aggregate base course and asphalt concrete wearing course.

The project works started in November 2011. The remaining works include: paving 16 km of the
road section with asphalt concrete leveling course, 18 km with asphalt concrete binder course, 20
km with asphalt concrete wearing course, repairing culverts and stabilizing shoulders, making road
marking and installing traffic signs.

The project area is flat land. The western side of the road contains scattered agricultural fields that
are 400-700m away, while on the eastern side there are scattered faraway houses, and temporary
buildings (400-600m away) used as resting and food service area. No domestic or agricultural
structures or small commercial entities existed which encroached on the right of way (ROW); hence
to relocation of any entity has been, or will be, required. The road section is located 1 to 10km south
of the Euphrates River, and 85km away from the IBA of the Al-Hammar marshland (which is
located to the south east of the project area).

Legal Framework
The project is subject to the Iraqi Environmental Law and its guidelines. Regarding the national
legislation, the framework environmental law regulating amongst other requirements for EIA for
infrastructure project is the Law for the Protection and Improvement of Environment No. 27, 2009.
Other relevant national laws are: the law on Preservation of Water Resources from 2001, the 2008
law on the Ministry of Environment, and the law of Antiquities and Heritage of 2002. Iraqi laws do
not currently include provisions for mitigation and/or compensation for entities and structures
which have encroached on state-owned land. A gap thus exists between GOI laws and regulations
and World Bank policies. Given this, World Bank policies apply in this case, as are outlined in the
Environmental and Social Safeguards Assessment Framework (ESSAF) prepared for the ERRP.
This activity falls under the ESSAF prepared for the ERRP, and the activity is compliant with the
terms of the ESSAF.
Two Bank’s operational policies were triggered by the project. These are Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). According to the OP/BP
4.01 the project is classified as category B.

Environmental Baseline conditions
The baseline conditions allow assessment of the project impacts and their significance by
comparing the existing situation with the predicted situation (affected by the project impacts). The
baseline data include: climate, surface and groundwater quality, soil, topography, noise and
vibration levels, air quality, traffic, biodiversity, socio-economic characteristics, cultural properties.
The project area has arid climate with the average annual precipitation of 50-80mm. The land
adjacent to the road is flat with wide open areas. It is used for agriculture. The land is state owned
and hence there are no issues related to land acquisition. The air quality in the project area is good.
There are no significant sources of air pollution other than traffic emissions. The hourly noise levels
do not exceed 55 dB. The Euphrates River is located 1 to 10km to the North of the road alignment.
The groundwater level is 50-75m deep and it is brackish. Protected or endangered species were not
reported in the vicinity of the road alignment. The nearest protected area the Hammar Marshes is
located 85km SE of the road section. Al Sulaybiyat depression saline marshes are located 15-20km
south of the road alignment but the area is of low ecological value.
Environmental & Social Impact Analysis
The study found that the Samawa - Nasiriya road rehabilitation project will have no significant
negative impacts on the environment and local community during both the construction and the
maintenance phases. There will be very minor effects on the flora and fauna, as the area has very
scarce vegetation and wildlife. No impacts are predicted on the groundwater or surface water due to
the distance to the Euphrates River (1-10km) and deep groundwater aquifer that is not suitable for
human consumption or irrigation to its brackish conditions. The road has no impact on any
archeological, heritage, and cultural sites, as the road area and its surrounding are free from such
objects. From the social perspectives, there was no need for any land acquisition, as the road
alignment area is state owned. Community displacement or resettlement will not take place due to
the limited scope of works. No claims of any financial compensation were recorded either by
individuals, tribes or establishment. Furthermore, there are no encroachers and squatters identified
or recorded along the road alignment.

Any environmental and social impacts of the construction activities of the project are expected to be
minor and short-term. The project activities with the highest number of identified negative impacts
are: restoration of road surface; generation and disposal of construction waste. The physical aspects
mostly affected by the road repairs/construction phase are: noise level and air quality (including
dust). The significant positive and short-term impact of the project is generation of local
employment during the road works.

Mitigation Measures
The key mitigation measures during the repairs/construction phase of the project include (see Table
No 1):
  Avoid noisy operations at the night.
  Apply road watering during construction works and after heavy movements.
  Maintain vehicles and machinery in good condition to minimize gas emissions and noise.
  Avoid bitumen melting activities in open spaces.
  Ensure that construction preparations are located away from populated areas.
  Clear and clean underpasses for animal crossings.
  Minimize waste generation.
  General and construction waste must be stored in areas agreed with local communities and
     disposed of in the approved disposal sites.
  Refuse containers must be located at each worksite, and
  Establishment and operation of a citizens’ Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM)
The total estimated costs of implementing meeting measures is expected to reach 12,000 USD.
Environmental and Social Monitoring
The Environmental and Social Monitoring Plan presents the monitoring arrangements during both
the construction and the maintenance phases (see Table 2). It covers project activities from site
preparation, through construction, commissioning, operation of the road. The plan relates to the
handling of hazardous materials and wastes, emission and discharge monitoring. The plan will help
to verify the effectiveness of the prescribed mitigation measures designed to guarantee and achieve
the implementation of the ESMP recommendations. The cost of monitoring activities will include
primarily cost of full time monitoring specialist, vehicle, fuel, camera and other equipment. It is
estimated to reach 30,000 USD.
Environmental and Social Management Plan
Implementation of this ESMP will ensure that the project during construction and regular
maintenance will meet regulatory and operational environmental performance requirements. Hence,
the ESMP is essential to ensure that identified impacts are maintained within the allowable level,
anticipated impacts are mitigated at an early stage, and the expected projects benefits are achieved.
The overall implementation of the ESMP is the responsibility of the SCRB which includes qualified
environmental and social specialists. Table 3 presents the ESMP matrix for the backlog repairs and
maintenance phases. The total estimated costs of implementing the ESMP (mitigation measures and
monitoring activities) is estimated to be 42,000 USD.

1. Introduction

This report presents the Environmental and Social Management Plan of the Samawa – Nasiriya road
rehabilitation project in Iraq. The Samawa – Nasiriya project is part of the Emergency Road
Rehabilitation Project in Iraq – component A.1: Highway rehabilitation works. The road is located
in the Al Muthanna governorate which is situation in south Iraq (see Figure 1.1).

The objectives of this ESMP are to provide:-

       Prediction of negative environmental and social impacts of the road construction.
       Mitigation measures that will reduce predicted impacts.
       Practical and achievable plans to ensure that the project’s environmental requirements are
        covered.
       An integrated plan for monitoring, assessing and controlling potential environmental and
        social impacts.
       Local, State and authorities with a common focus for approval of conditions and
        compliance with policies and conditions.

The specific objectives of this ESMP are:
   Ensure that significant positive and adverse environmental and social impacts are identified.
   Mitigate negative impacts and avoid irreversible damage to the environment and people.
   Prepare environmental and social management and monitoring plan for the proposed project.
   Ensure that environmental and social factors are considered in the decision-making process
       of the proposed road upgrade including through effective consultation with potentially
       affected persons and stakeholders.
   Where necessary, provide guidelines for project design to ensure its fulfillment with the
       compliance and mitigation measures.


The Samawa – Nasiriya road rehabilitation project is part of the Component A.1 Highway
Rehabilitation Works of the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) financed by the
Bank’s loan. The implementing agencies for the ERRP are the Iraqi Ministry of Construction and
Housing (MOCH) and the State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB).
The objective of the ERRP is to improve the condition of roads assets by rehabilitating highly
damaged segments of the country’s highway and rural road networks, reestablishing critical river
crossings, and restoring the capacity to manage and maintain road assets. The ERRP aimed to
benefit road users throughout Iraq, as well as promote the country’s economic integration, facilitate
trade, and support reconstruction efforts across all sectors.
The road is located in the Samawa governorate. The road section Samawa – Nasiriya is 20km long
and the road width is 7.3m. The road has a safe clearance of 3m on each side. The road
rehabilitation will follow the existing alignment. The photographic evidence of the road condition
is presented in Annex 1.
The work will comprise repairs to damaged road surfacing, drainage cleaning and repairs,
restoration of eroded shoulders and road furniture, re-installing stolen road signs and renewing
pavement marking. The pavement layers for the remaining length will be aggregate base course
and asphalt concrete wearing course.
The construction materials will be brought to the site from the neighboring governorates of Wasit
(crused sand and gravel: from Badra and Jassan quarries) and Najaf (granular materials and natural
sand: from the Najaf quarry).


The contract for road works was signed on 27 October 2011. The works have started in November
2011. As of July 2013 the contractor has milled all the road, treated all cracks, paved an asphalt
concrete leveling course for milled area from Sta. (0+00) to Sta. (4+00) and paved an asphalt
concrete binder course from Sta. (2+00) to Sta. (4+00). Some bleeding of the exposed asphalt is
noted due to extensive traffic on the pavement without the new asphalt layers being put in place as
planned. This may require additional milling to be undertaken.
The remaining works include: paving 16 km of the road section with asphalt concrete leveling
course, 18 km with asphalt concrete binder course, 20 km with asphalt concrete wearing course,
repairing culverts and stabilizing shoulders, making road marking and installing traffic signs.

The Samawa – Nasiriya road which passes through the Al Muthanna governorate in south Iraq .The
project area is flat and very sparsely populated. There are scattered agricultural fields on the
western side of the road (400-700m away). On the eastern side there are scattered faraway houses,
and around (400-600m) from the side road there are some temporary building, used as resting and
food service area during religious occasions. The nearest settlement is the small town of Al Khidir
located 1km north of the road alignment. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show the aerial view of the road area.
Annex 1 presents photographic evidence of the project area.

Articles 10 of the Law for the Protection and Improvement of Environment No. 27, 2009 describes
the procedures related to EIA studies as follows:

A project owner must be committed with providing an EIA Study prior to project commencement.
The EIA study must include the following:

    Assessment of positive and negative impacts as a result of project activities;
    Propose mitigation measures to prevent or treat contamination and pollution sources in
       accordance with the acceptable environmental standards and guidelines.
    Adopt and discuss measures for the prevention of potential contamination and emergency
       pollution.
    Assessment of alternatives in terms of utilizing proper means/technology that cause the least
       impact to the environment; in addition to rationalizing and managing the consumption of
       resources.
    Reduce and manage wastes and adopt measures for reuse of recycling wherever possible.
    Estimating the environmental feasibility of the project and estimate the cost of pollution to

       production ratio.
The technical and economic feasibility study for any project must include the EIA study as
described in the first item.
Article 11 of the Law stipulates that any entity’s activities that may impact the environment are
prohibited from performing its activities without the approval from the Ministry of Environment.
The relevant law that applies in terms of social safeguards issues is The Republic of Iraq’s
Acquisition Law, No. 12 of 1981, which says the State has the right to remove encroachers and
settlers on State-owned land without compensation. Hence, a gap exists between GOI laws and
regulations and the World Bank’s OP4.12 policy in those national laws provide for removal of
encroachers without mitigation/compensation. However, the ERRP operates under the ESSAF
guidelines prepared and negotiated for the project, which specifies that no project activities may be
undertaken where there is a need for relocation of project affected people. In the case of the
Samawa-Nasiriya road works it has been confirmed that no relocation of encroachers is required.
Consequently, the project activity is in compliance with the ESSAF provisions.



The World Bank has ten operational safeguard policies which apply to various development
projects which the Bank is either implementing or funding. The purpose of these policies is to
ensure that social and environmental risks are prevented or at least minimized while increasing
socio-economic benefits of approved projects in addition to preserving the environment.

These policies have been a means to increase the effectiveness and positive impacts of development
projects and programs supported by the Bank.

The Bank’s 10 safeguard policies include:

       OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment
       OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats
       OP/BP 4.09 Pest Management
       OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples
       OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources
       OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
       OP/BP 4.36 Forests
       OP/BP 4.37 Safety of Dams
       OP/BP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways
       OP/BP 7.60 Projects in Disputed Areas
With respect to this project, two key policies were triggered. These are Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). Additionally, it should be noted that this
activity operates under the ESSAF prepared for the ERRP and complies with the ESSAF in that no
there is no encroachment on state-owned land in the project activity area and, hence, no need for
relocation of project affected people.
   OP/BP 4.01 - the key Operational Policy describing the environmental assessment procedure.
    The Bank requires environmental assessment of projects proposed for Bank financing. The
    objectives of the EA are to:
          Ensure that projects proposed for Bank financing are environmentally and socially sound
           and sustainable.
          Inform decision makers of the nature of environmental and social risks.
          Increase transparency and participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process.

   Involuntary resettlement OP/BP4.12, which focus on the following principles:
         Involuntary resettlement is avoided wherever feasible, or minimized, exploring all viable
          alternative project designs;
         Where it is not feasible to avoid involuntary resettlement, activities are conceived and
          executed as sustainable development programs. Displaced persons are to be meaningfully
          consulted and have opportunities to participate in the planning and implementing of
          resettlement programs affecting them; and
         Displaced persons are assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards
          of living, or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels
          prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. The
          mechanism of assisting displaced persons is based on full and prior mitigation and
          compensation for loss of assets or livelihoods.
         OP 4.12 applies whenever, in a Bank-financed project, land is acquired involuntarily or
          access is restricted in legally designated parks or protected areas.
The potential environmental and social impacts of the construction and/or rehabilitation works of
the proposed road alignment are typical of category B projects.

3. Environmental baseline conditions

The baseline conditions allow assessment of the project impacts and their significance by
comparing the existing situation with the predicted situation (affected by the project impacts). The
baseline components include: climate, surface and groundwater quality, soil, topography, noise and
vibration levels, air quality, traffic, biodiversity including flora, fauna, rare or endangered species,
socio-economic characteristics.



Samawa governorate is located in the southern part of Iraq and has an arid climate with the highest
temperatures in July and August reaching over 450C. The lowest temperatures are recorded in
January. They can reach 50C.



The annual rainfall in the project area ranged from 76.2 - 47mm between 2001 and 2010. The rain
falls during the winter months. Occasionally, heavy rain falls in a single day during the winter.



The average wind velocity is approximately 2.3m/sec. There are not many variations in the wind
velocity between months. Stronger winds are usually recorded in the spring.



The area surrounding the road section Samawa – Nasiriya represents an extension of the flat plateau
areas that stretches from the middle of Iraq till the mid-southern parts of the country. No specific
terrains or natural land are present in the project area. All surrounded areas adjacent to the road are
flat with wide open areas.



The land of the area surrounding the road alignment is used primarily for agriculture. The local
community living along the road section relies on farming based on irrigation as the main source of
revenue. The main cultivated crop is wheat.

The land is state owned and hence there are no issues related to land acquisition. No additional land
is required for the project. Involuntary nor voluntarily relocation of people and any individuals are
not needed.



Samawa city and its suburban area are situated in the basin of the lower reaches of the Euphrates
River. The alluvial soil is dominant in this region. The underlying rocks are silt-clay strata. No
Seismic activities have been recorded for more than 25 years.




                                                  19

The Ministry of Environment has established an air quality monitoring network which was
implemented under the Emergency Environment Management Project that was financed by the
Multi-donor Iraq Trust Fund. Ten fixed stations: 6 in Baghdad, 2 in Mosul and 2 in Al-Basra and
all 15 Governorates were provided with portable air quality monitoring equipment.

Efforts were made to collect data on air quality within the project area but no results were achieved.
The data from the Samawa city is used as proxy. In general the project area is comprised of
agricultural lands that do not include any major sources of air pollution .Traffic on the existing road
is considered a source of pollution considering the high volume of trucks using the road. Table 3.1
shows the average daily concentration of four air pollutants in the Samawa city (according to the
State of Environment Report, 2008 issued by the MoE). The data shows that the average daily SO2,
NO2 and CO concentrations in the air are well below the WHO and US EPA maximum allowable
concentration standards.

Table 3.1. The average (daytime) concentration (mg/m3) of SO2, NOx and CO in Samawa

          SO2                    NO2                   CO
          0.002-0.0041           0.008-0.03            0.21-0.78

          WHO: 0.02mg/m          WHO: 0.2mg/m          US EPA: 9mg/m3



The site visit reveals no significant noise emissions caused by traffic and affecting the nearby
population. The WHO limits value of 55 dB and the MOE standard limit of the noise level of maximum
70dB are not exceeded outside of the road alignment (State of Environment reports, 2009, 2010).



The road alignment passes parallel to the Euphrates River which is situated north of the road section
in a distance of 1 to 10km. Flooding of the road has not been reported in the past 40 years. The
Euphrates is polluted with chemicals from agriculture, industry, and sewage making it an unreliable
source for domestic use and restricting it for other usage (particularly below Baghdad). There are
many sources of the Euphrates water pollution including petroleum fuels and by-products, sewage,
solid waste, heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, radioactive waste, toxic wastes, nutrient and
sediments. The water quality in the project area is affected by high suspended solids (above 50
mg/l), BOD (5-10 mg/l) and increased salinity.

The depth of ground water in the area ranges from 50-75m, and is brackish. The flow of the
groundwater is from the south-west to north-east of the project according to the hydraulic gradient.
The groundwater in the project area is not used for human consumption or irrigation.

The project area is located in the Arabian Desert and Saharo-Arabian xeric shrub lands ecoregion.
This desert and semi-desert ecosystem is one of the largest ecoregions in Iraq. The biodiversity of
this region is the least known in the country. Several uniquely adapted plants are likely to exist in
this region e.g. several members of the chenopodiaceae family (Salsola sp. Atriples sp, Saueda sp.
etc.) and others Artemisia sp. Achilea sp. Tamarix sp.

This region was known to contain mammal species such as wolves, hyenas, gazelles, wild boars,
fox, bats and others. Several species have probably been eradicated from the area such as Arabian
Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) and Asiatic Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Spiny-tailed lizards (Uromastyx
sp).

Some of the common desert birds found in this ecoregion include: Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis),
Bar-tailed Lark (Ammomanes cincture), Temminck's Lark (Eremophila bilopha), Eurasian Eagle
Owl (Bubo bubo), Macqueen’s Bustard (Chlamydotis macqueenii), Spotted Sandgrouse (Pterocles
senegallus), Cream-coloured Courser (Cursorius cursor), Desert Wheatear (Oenanthe deserti), and
Desert Finch (Rhodospiza obsoletus). Breeding birds in this biom include SaroArabian breeding
communities as follows: Ammomanes deserti, Pycnonotus leucoti, Turdoides altirostris, Oenanthe
lugens and Rhodospiza obsoletus. Reports indicates that in the area an active hunting of the
Macqueen’s Bustard (Chlamydotis macqueenii) is taking place.

The road section passes near the Euphrates hosting (especially in the wetlands located 80km, to the
south east) species of water birds including: Sterna hirundo and S.albifrons that breed on islands
within flooded areas around Euphrates and Cursorius cursor, Merops superciliosus and Pycnonotus
leucotis that breed in the surrounding area. Wintering species include several waterfowls of Anser
anser, Tadorna ferruginea, Mergellus albellus, and Grus grus.

This Arabian Desert ecoregion is endangered due changes to traditional land management resulting
in overgrazing by camels and goats, off-road vehicles, agricultural and irrigation projects, as well as
un-assessed impacts from past and current conflicts. Many species have declined or became extinct
in this area due to hunting and human encroachment.

The wildlife of the project area is scarce. Protected or endangered species are not recorded along the
road alignment. The Al Sulaybiyat salty marshes are located in a depression 15 to 20km to the
south of the road alignment. They are reported of low ecological value.




The road alignment does not pass through any historical or cultural sites. There are no sites of
historical or cultural importance in the area. The nearest settlement is the small town of Al Khidir
located 1km north of the road alignment.

4. Environmental and Social Impacts of the Project

This section of the report describes the potential environmental impacts that are likely to result from
repairs, construction and maintenance of the road. The maintenance phase of the project will have a
very limited scope of works in comparison to the backlog repair works. Hence, the predicted
impacts of the maintenance phase of the project will be substantially more limited than the impact
predicted for the construction phase.



During the field work, scoping was used to identify the key potential impacts that should be given
more attention. Scoping was primarily conducted as expert exercise. However, input from the local
communities during this process were also considered and incorporated

Table No. 4.1 below provides a matrix of potential impacts associated with the implementation of
the sub- project and likely to occur. The key activities during backlog repairs and maintenance
activities are listed against physical resources, natural resources and social issues. The estimated
magnitudes of impacts are also presented.

The scoping exercise indicated that minor environmental and social impact are expected such as
waste generation and debris, soil erosion, noise, air quality (including dust), temporary disruption of
traffic circulation, and higher safety risks. Since this project does not involve the construction of
new roads, the negative impacts associated with resettlement and land acquisition are not expected.

The impact scoping exercise shows also beneficial impacts of the project primarily related to local
jobs creation and local economic development.

4.2.1 Impacts of Waste Generation and Handling

The project activities will generate construction waste (tar, sub-base, used gravel) during the repairs
and maintenance works. Improper disposal of waste can destroy agricultural land adjacent to the
road sections. Construction waste generation is also expected where segments of the road require
reconstruction (scrapped tarmac and shoulders fixing). During maintenance works, excess fill
material asphalt scrapping will be generated.

Another important waste generation is expected from cleaning of the blocked drainage system. The
generated waste should be stored temporarily in locations agreed with the local communities, reused
in road construction and ultimately disposed of in designated areas.

The temporary storage of debris and fill materials may lead soil erosion, and damage to soil and
agricultural land.
Waste generation may arise at the contactor’s base camp and work site as a result of inadequate
provision and use of sanitary and waste facilities and spillage or leakage of polluting substances.
Organic waste from labour camps may lead to local contamination of groundwater.

Overall, the expected volume of construction and general waste is low. The impact during the
backlog repairs phase is predicted to be minor, local and short-term. The impacts during the
standard maintenance phase are negligible due to the smaller scope of works and volume of waste
involved.

4.2.2 Soil Erosion, Mineral Extraction and Visual Intrusion

During the backlog repairs activities, any excavation and earth removal activities render slopes and
topsoil more vulnerable to erosion – especially during the rainy season. In addition to soil erosion,
excavations can result in visual impact on the landscape. No such impacts are expected during the
standard maintenance activities as these usually do not required earth removal and excavation
works.

The indirect impact of the backlog repairs is quarrying of construction granulates and their haulage.
The construction materials will be brought to the site from different quarries located in the adjacent
governorates. The quarries are located more than 10km away from the road alignment and not
adjacent to residential areas. Their operation will have no impact on the road alignment. The
quarrying operations will lead to minor increase of the overall volume of extraction, and hence will
result in minor increase of impacts within the quarries.

Soil erosion caused by backlog repair works can cause negative impacts agricultural land, soil and
vegetation, especially during rainy season. The soil erosion impact is minor, localized and
reversible. Soil erosion is not expected during the standard maintenance phase due to the limited
scope of works. The additional indirect impacts of quarrying will have no adverse impacts on the
road alignment as the quarries that will be used for extraction of sand and gravel are located in a
distance of more than 10 km from the Samawa – Nasiriya road.

4.2.3 Impacts of dust and vehicles emissions on Air Quality

During the backlog repairs phase, air quality can be affected negatively by dust generated by
excavation works, transport and storage of fill materials and granular materials from the quarries,
and construction waste, removing of the older layers of the pavement, resurfacing, cleaning of
culverts as well as gaseous emissions from operation of equipment such as dozers, excavators,
trucks. The dust arisings and emissions to air will be limited to less than a 100m wide corridor
along the road.

The nature of impacts during the backlog repairs phase on air quality impact is temporary,
localized, limited, minor and reversible. Impacts during the maintenance phase are predicted to be
negligible due to limited and localized interventions.

4.2.4 Traffic disturbance

During the backlog repairs works and standard maintenance phase, traffic flow along the road
undergoing the construction and repairs activities will be disturbed. This effect is very temporary.
The traffic flow will be affected because one lane of the road might need to close temporarily which
will affect traffic movement. This may lead to short-term traffic delays and impact on local
economic life.

This impact is very short term, localized and minor (during both backlog repairs and standard
maintenance phase).

4.2.5 Increased level of Noise and Vibration

Noise impacts are expected to increase during the backlog repairs works on the road, due to the use
of construction machinery. As estimated considering the major construction equipment to be used,
the daytime noise levels must be within the applicable standards of 85 dB when the noise receptor
is at a distance of 50m or more from the noise source. No such levels are expected to be exceeded.

Noise emissions will be much lower during the maintenance phase due to much smaller scope of
works that will involve less heavy machinery.

In both phases, the area that may be potentially impacted would typically be limited to less than a
100 m wide corridor along the road and the associated increase in noise level is expected to be less
than 10 dBA.

The nature of this impact during the backlog repair works is temporary, localized, minor and
reversible. The noise and vibration impacts during the standard maintenance phase are predicted
to be negligible.

4.2.6 Impacts on Surface Water and Ground Water

According to the field visits findings, there would be no impacts on the water supply system caused
by the road works. This is due to limited scope of works of the project (road repairs and
rehabilitation). The field surveys did not reveal any water pipes underneath or crossing the road.

                                                25
                                                               ESMP Samawa - Nasiriya Road. January 2014.


There are no wells in the project area. The groundwater level is 50-75m deep. The groundwater is
brackish and not suitable for consumption and irrigation. The effects on groundwater quality are
associated with drainage and soak away sinks. Contamination of ground water may be caused also
by hazardous wastes and spill. The risk is considered negligible as no significant spillages were
reported in the past 20 years.

The road alignment is located in a distance of 1-10km from the Euphrates River and so it will not
impact on the water quality.

The project impact on surface and groundwater, and water supply is minor during both the backlog
repairs and the maintenance phase.

4.2.7 Impacts on Runoff Water and Drainage

According to the survey data, there are several locations where drainage culverts are filled with
accumulated sand and other debris. Cleaning of drainage culverts will require unskilled workers,
and thus it will create job opportunity for the local population. During standard maintenance phase,
the issue of runoff water is not expected to be cause of concern. The periodic cleaning of culverts
should be conducted.

This type of impact is localized and negligible.

4.2.8 Impact on Fauna and Flora

The road repair/maintenance works will not cause adverse impacts on the wildlife as there will be
no significant noise disruption or no effluent discharges. The works will not cause fragmentation of
ecosystem as side fencing will not be installed. The project does not traverse any known
biodiversity hotspot, nor is it close to any area identified as neither having particular biodiversity
value nor hosting endangered species. Therefore, the activities from the backlog repairs as well as
maintenance are not expected to have any negative impact on fauna.

The nature of this impact is negligible during both the backlog repairs and standard maintenance
phases.

4.2.9 Health and Safety Conditions

The road works will increase the risk of car accidents due to traffic disruption, temporary
deterioration of road surface. The road works will create the risk of work accidents resulting from
the use of heavy construction equipment.

Road works activities pose potential risk to the safety of workers as well as the general public
through traffic disturbance or negligent-careless use of heavy equipment.

The nature of this impact is temporary, localized, minor and reversible.

4.2.10 Heritage environment

As the project is not near any cultural, archeological and historical sites, the backlog repairs and
standard maintenance works will have no impact on archaeology or cultural heritage. No
cemeteries, historical-cultural monuments, churches, mosques near the project need to be removed
in order to construct the road.

4.2.11 Socio – Economic

During backlog works the project will generate local employment opportunities in the area for both
skilled and unskilled labor. Negative socio-economic impacts include disruption of traffic and
social impacts of the workers camps. The project activities are being undertaken in what is a very
sparsely populated area and no entities have been found which encroach on the ROW or other state-
owned land in the immediate Corridor of Impact (COI). Hence, there are no people associated with
the road works who will be adversely affected through the need to relocate, or whose livelihoods
will be adversely affected by the road works activities.

The main economic benefits generated by the project will vehicle operating cost savings, reduced
travel time, cost savings from reduced accidents. The benefits from a reduction in the number and
severity of accidents an important element of the economic benefits .No land acquisition is
necessary under the project and no voluntary land donations are required.

The socio-economic impacts of the maintenance phase on inhabitants can be minimized by
adopting traffic management plans to ensure a safe and efficient movement of traffic during
maintenance as well as by informing the public about the schedule of road works activities

5. Mitigation Measures


To further assure environmental sustainability of the project, mitigation measures are presented.
The mitigation measures are proposed for the potential impacts associated with both the backlog
repairs and maintenance phases of the project. The mitigation measures will prevent or reduce
potential negative impacts and enhance positive effects of the project (see Table 5.1).

Contractors are responsible for adhering to these mitigation measures and implementing them
throughout the duration of their contracts in coordination with the Supervising Consultant and the
SCRF. The total costs of implementing mitigation measures is expected to reach 12,000 USD. The
cost of mitigation measures will be a part of the contractor’s fees and shall be disbursed at the
completion of a project upon satisfactory compliance with the mitigation plan.



The mitigation measure for the construction and resurfacing waste (including shoulders) is to
remove the excess material and dispose it in designated areas. In addition, the mitigation for waste
generation during cleaning of the blocked drainage is to dispose the waste at vacant land agreed
with the local population.

The contractor should provide waste containers and sanitation facilities for the construction camp.
All contractors must define and commit to a clear plan for solid and liquid waste management for
the SCRB approval prior to initiating repair and maintenance activities. Information signs should be
installed for road users about proper disposal of empty diesel, fuel oil containers along the road
alignment. The conditions of equipment used by the contractor should be periodically monitored.



The short-term impacts of road works on air quality can be effectively mitigated. The mitigation
measures include:
       Maintained equipment and project vehicles in good conditions.
       Using good quality fuel to reduce exhaust emissions.
       Cleaning of vehicle tyres.
       Spraying of water during dry periods and strong winds to reduce dust generation.
       Covering trucks carrying fine construction materials and fill to avoid dust generation.

The gaseous impact will be limited to less than a 100m wide corridor along the road and no impact
is expected on the neighboring habitat. During the standard maintenance phase, gaseous emissions
can be reduced by using good quality fuel and keeping equipment in good conditions to control
mufflers emissions.

                                                               ESMP Samawa - Nasiriya Road. January 2014.




The impact of road works on noise levels can be mitigated and reduced by using well maintained
equipment, and limiting noisy activities to normal daylight working hours. The contractor should
also inform the public about the location and timing of noisy activities.

The increase of noise levels during the maintenance phase will be very minor due to limited scope
of works. The mitigation measure that should be applied is limiting road works to daytime hours.
Road workers need to receive safety instructions and personal protective equipment.



The mitigation measures against the blockage of cross culverts during road works are to control
sediment runoff into culverts, cleaning of clogged culverts and side sloping. This type of work is
labor intensive which will create job opportunity for the local population.

Mitigation measure for protecting groundwater from hydrocarbon pollution is to store fuel,
lubricants and solvents in sealed containers, and conducting refueling and small repairs on paved
surfaces.
During the maintenance phase, the impact on drainage system and groundwater is negligible due to
the limited scope of works. Any blockages of culverts will require periodic cleaning.



The project does not traverse any known biodiversity hotspot, nor is it close to any area identified
as having particular biological values such as (birds and sensitive animals). Periodic cleaning and
maintenance of culverts will need to be applied to facilitate small animals crossing. Trees planting
can be applied at critical locations known as animal crossing pathways.

                                                   c
The impact of the road works activities on traffic can be mitigated by measures including: (i)
informing the public about the location and length of time expected for temporary traffic disruption;
(ii) the provision of alternative access roads during road works (such as to the Al Khidir town); (iii)
on the spot traffic management.



Road workers need to receive safety instructions and personal protective equipment. First aid
facilities must be available on site. Construction signs should be used to avoid accidents.
Implementation of traffic management plan and bypasses in the working areas should be organized
to establish a safe working environment.



The socio-economic impacts of the project on the nearby local communities (especially those of the
Al Khadir town) can be minimized by shortening the works period, adopting traffic management
plans to ensure a safe and efficient movement of traffic during road works, as well as by informing
the public about the schedule of road works activities.

        6. Monitoring

        Environmental monitoring of the road will be conducted to ensure that mitigation measures are
        complied with. Environmental monitoring will allow unwanted environmental and social impacts
        to be detected early and remedied effectively. It will also validate the impacts predicted in the
        ESMP and the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures. Lastly; it will also demonstrate
        compliance with national and International regulatory requirements. Table 6.1 presents the
        monitoring arrangements during the backlog repairs phase of the project.

        The monitoring activities for both environmental and social measures of this project will be the
        responsibility of the environmental and social specialists’ of supervision consultant. Monitoring
        activities will rely primarily on field observations, feedback from stakeholders and other affected
        people, and documentation of their reactions to the project works and their perception of the
        adequacy of the mitigation measures. Photographic documentation will be required in the
        continuous and regular monitoring. The cost of the monitoring activities will include one full time
        environmental specialist, vehicle, fuel, camera, and other equipment/meters if needed. The total
        monitoring costs is expected to reach 30,000 USD.

        The World Bank will monitor the implementation of the ESMP. In particular the Bank must ensure
        that proper monitoring takes place and that the reports are filed regularly. Should these reports
        indicate incomplete monitoring of specifically identified social issues; these will be reported to the
        responsible staff in the SCRB.

7. Reporting and Auditing

After each inspection, a report shall be compiled that is location and activity specific. This shall
identify areas of contractor’s non-compliance with the ESMP and provide guiding remarks on
actions to be taken. The significance of the non-compliance shall also be noted. The E&S
specialists shall prepare these reports and follow-up with the contractor to comply with all ESMP
items or otherwise corrective actions would be taken. In addition, an annual report of all the
environmental and social monitoring activities will be compiled by the SCRB and submitted to the
Bank as part of the overall project

All inspection and audit reports of environmental performance will be stored in the Audit and
Inspection Manager (AIM). The AIM is an electronic database that is used to enable corrective
actions identified during the inspection \ auditing process to be recorded, tracked and closed out.
The information will be made available to the relevant regulatory authorities as required. In addition
to the monitoring and reporting requirements documented in the relevant sections of the ESMP, the
following auditing regime will be implemented:

   a)    All incidents or accidents during the operation be reported immediately by legal authorities
         and measures will be taken to comply with the environmental rules and regulations.
         Detailed reporting must be provided within days.
   b)    All corrective measures must be discussed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
   c)    Reports for personnel training on environmental issues or emergency practices must be
         produced.
   d)    Progress reports, environmental monitoring report and other inspections reports must be
         produced periodically and will include all necessary details.

      8. Environmental and Social Management Plan

      The Purpose of the Environmental and Social Management Plan is to summarize findings of the
      study and establish a mechanism for implementation of mitigation measures addressing the
      expected negative impacts and monitor their efficiency.

      The report includes specific management plan based on the findings of consultations with local
      stakeholders (see Table 8.1 below). The ESMP for this project will be reviewed in accordance with
      the World Bank guidelines and disclosed prior to the launching of the works contract.

      The overall implementation of the ESMP is the responsibility of the SCRB, which includes
      qualified environmental and social specialists. The procedures of the SCRB are designed to
      incorporate, or “mainstream? environmental and social considerations into the overall process for
      road planning and implementation.

      The total cost of implementing the ESMP (mitigation measures and monitoring activities) is
      estimated to reach 42,000 USD. The quantities, specifications and specific costs of design measures
      to avoid or mitigate negative impacts will be assessed by the technical engineers at the SCRB who
      will incorporate them into the works bidding documents. Other costs will be disbursed at the
      completion of the project upon satisfactory compliance with the mitigation plan.

Public consultations were undertaken along the road with a road users including, public sector,
owners and workers in shops, vehicle workshops, two taxi drivers (one of temporarily residences of
the area and another building worker), residents in the area and other persons working within the
vicinity of the road. The consultations focused on the participants opinion regarding the road
project. These feed-back consultations were held along the road.

of the road .all acknowledged the danger presented to both travelers and roadside entities by the
poor road quality and fast moving traffic. Stakeholders were also very supportive of road work
opportunities that will provided to local residents given the prevailing high unemployment rate.

    10. Institutional Capacity Building and Training Activities
    The MoCH and the SCRB are the responsible agency for maintaining the road network and
    maintenance services contracts. The institutional capacity of the MoCH and the SCRB will be
    strengthened by training programs. In addition, all contractor personnel will be required to
    undertake appropriate environmental training and induction programs. All managers and
    supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that personnel under their control have the requisite
    competencies, skill and training to carry out their assigned tasks in accordance with the
    requirements of the ESMP. They will also be responsible for identifying additional training and
    competency requirements. All project supervisors and managers will have additional detailed
    training on the use and implementation of the ESMP. The total cost of institutional strengthening
    and training is estimated to reach 58,000 USD.

    The safeguards training will focus on (see Table 10.1):
            Introduction to basic environmental laws, regulations, and standards.
            Methods of environmental impact assessment (screening, baseline conditions,
             scoping, impact prediction, impact significance, mitigation measures).
            Pollution impact on health.
            Traffic and human safety measures.
            Identifying stakeholders in the projects: their social status and impact on the local
             communities.
            Promoting society participation.
