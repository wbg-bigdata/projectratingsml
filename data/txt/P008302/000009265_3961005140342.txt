MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE NTRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS
FOR A
FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.            I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on the
proposed loan to the Republic of Belarus for US$41.9 million to help finance a forestry development
project. It would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a term of fifteen years maturity,
including five years of grace.
Background
2.            The forestry and wood industry sectors contributed between 3 and 4% to GNP in 1990.
Industrial logging and wood processing constituted about 5 % of the industrial output and 6 % of industrial
employment over the same period. Forests occupy some 8 million hectares (or 34% of the country's total
land area).' The forestry resources utilized for commercial purposes are all planted forest. All "natural"
forests and some forest resources within special ecosystems (e.g. some wetlands) are within conservation
areas; they constitute only 11% of total forest cover. The commercial timber area is characterized by
the predominance of "young" growth (accounting for over 80% post-World War II replanting) and a very
snall proportion (2%) of full-growth harvestable stock.
3.            The Ministry of Forestry (MinFor) is responsible for management of about 84% of the
national forest cover through 86 local-level "forestry enterprises." The balance of the national forests
are under the management of a variety of other Government of Belarus (GoB) Ministries and agencies
(6%), kolkhozes and sovkhozes (6%), with 4% reserved for national parks. MinFor is empowered with
regulatory and inspection authority of all !he nation's forests, irrespective of ownership. Years of
under-investment in maintenance and resource improvement, particularly in overly dense stands, has
resulted in the need for considerable thinning to conform to modern management practices. A further
result of the lack of investment and operating capital is a steady decline of about 5% annually in the
harvest of industrial grade timber, from about 10.8 million tn3 ob2 in 1989 to about 8.8 million m3 ob
in 1993.
4.            Clear-cut harvesting is the responsibility of the Bellesprom3 enterprises, while MinFor
is responsible for the pre-commercial (maintenance) activities. In terms of output, Bellesprom has been
harvesting about 2.5 to 3.0 million mn3 ob annually harvest (i.e. over 90% of the mature wood harvested
from MinFor-managed forests). The wood processing industry, which is based almost entirely on the
processing of the mature wood, is dominated by Bellesprom. This is a "voluntary association" of state
enterprise and former state enterprises -- 32 large- and medium-scale wood processing and manufacturing
entities serving both the export and domestic markets. The Bellesprom enterprises do not own any forest
resources. The entire "down-stream" wood industry is based on unrealistically low and unsustainable

input prices for wood and energy. Processing machinery is outdated, product quality is low, and labor
is inefficient. At some sites there is inadequate use of waste products and unacceptable air and site-
pollution. Worker safety measures appear minimal.
5.            MinFor's processing activities concentrate on the semi-commercial conversion of
smallwood (i.e. ihnmature wood from the pre-commercial maintenance operations). In terms of total
processed wood output, MinFor's district (rayon). level enterprises account for about 20-25% of total
national output of processed wood products.
6.            The major environmental issue affecting forests in the Republic of Belarus is the
radioactive contamination resulting from the damage to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986. About
20% of the national forest cover (1.46 million ha) was found in 1987 to be contaminated' with long half-
life5 (30 year) Cesium-137 (137Cs) and Strontium-90 and with very long half-life (24,000 years)
Plutonium-239,240 in varying degrees.' The operative indicator in the Republic of Belarus is that of '"Cs
contamination, which for the forest resources' area is as follows:
Radioactivity Level        Area of forest affected
(Ci/kM2 from 137Cs)            ('000 ha)    (%)
1 to 5                      993      68%
>5 to I5                      279      19%
>15to40                        164      11%
>40                          25       2%
Total                              1,461    100%
7.            All areas with over 15 Ci/km2 contamination have been mandatorily resettled, while in
areas with levels between 5-15 Ci/km2, there has been voluntary resettlement. Such evacuated areas have
been given over to MinFor for management, "rehabilitation" and fire protection. There are a number
of significant issues (worker radiation protection and health, commercial exploitation of the contaminated
4.     Contamination is measured as Cuies (Ci) per surface area - the Cuie is a measure of irradiation
transmitted from radionuclides. Radioactivity exposure, or biological equivalent dose levels, are measured
in Sieverts (usually milli-Sieverts per annum - mSv/a). The International Commission on Radiological
Protection has set nuclear-industry and radiological worker exposure maximum dosage at 2OmSv annually.
A forest harvest worker continuously exposed year-round in the 15 Ci/km2 (of '"Cs) zone would receive
an annual dosage of 2mSv/a (AECL Research, 1993).
5.     The half-life of a radionuclide is the period of time in which it decays to half its radioactive strength; in
each subsequent equal half-life period it will again decay by half its strength: i.e. in 60 years a 13'CS
radionuclide will have passed two of its 30 year half-life periods and therefore be at 25% of its original
strength.

timber, land and forest resource maintenance and management, fire protectfon, etc.) that need resolution
in order for MinFor to commence rational management of this significaiit portion of the national forest
resources.
8.            Perhaps the most significant impact of the contamination has been the psycho-social
impact both on the residents of the contaminated areas, and on the potential international buyers of
Belarus' agricultural and forestry products.  Recent analyses7 indicate that the level of accumulated
contamination in most of the wood is sufficiently low, by international radiation safety standards, that it
should be acceptable in international trade. However, the public and market perception of the problem,
notwithstanding the facts on the contamination level, may give rise to market resistance to Belarus' wood
products. Recent analysis of the exposure risks to workers in forestry and wood industries8 also indicates
that, with some prudent protection measures, workers face no discernible health risk. Nevertheless the
psychological effect of working in known contaminated areas requires that special measures be taken to
alleviate workers' health fears.
Key Sector Issues
9.            These are: (a) rehabilitation of harvesting capacity and improving harvesting efficiency;
(b) improving forest resource management, including the forests contaminated by the Chernobyl accident,
and the introduction of ecological considerations in management plans and practices; (c) increasing
standing wood prices to reflect its true economic value; (d) removing wood-products price control and
state orders; (e) improving the wood processing industry efficiency, product quality and product mix;
(f) ensuring adequate competition in logging and in the wood market; (g) privatization of the Bellesprom
wood industries and MinFor's subsidiary wood processing enterprises; and (h) removal of the Bellesprom
enterprises' virtual regional monopolies, and the related issue of the down-sizing and rationalization of
many large sized wood enterprises targeted by GoB for privatization, to ensure oblast-level competition.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
10.           This project is a complement, in terms of both sectoral policy reforns and investments,
to the macroeconomic policy restructuring agreed by GoB and the IMF under the Systemic
Transformation Facility, and by GoB and the World Bank under the Rehabilitation Loan. Given the
central objective of supporting actions in the Republic of Belarus which would establish a better basis for
sustained growth and higher living standards for the Belarussian people, the strategy for the Bank's policy
program and operations is to support the transition to a private sector led market economy, encourage
a redirection of public sector involvement in the economy and assist with the provision of public sector
services that are complementary to private sector development.
11.           The limited Belarus Country Assistance Strategy which described the aims of the World
Bank program in the Republic of Belarus was discussed by the Board on November 16, 1993, at the time
7.     Workshop on International Health-related Studiesfollowing the Chernobyl Accident (WHO Eurc pean Center
for Environment and Health, Rome, December 1993).

Republic of Belarus (AECL Rearch, Canada, 1993).

of the consideration of the Rehabilitation Loan. This project assists the government to take steps toward
implementing the objectives as set forth during that discussion.
12.          The forests are one of the few renewable natural resources available to the Belarus
economy that can be responsibly exploited on a sustainable basis for economic growth provided they are
adequately managed. As the now immature timber reaches harvestable age, future actual allowable cuts
are significar.tly higher' than the actual present harvest (of about 9 million n3 ob). With economic
recovery in both the Republic of Belarus and neighboring former Soviet Union countries, there will be
an increase in demand for wood products. With appropriate forestry sector restructuring, the Republic
of Belarus should be in a competitive position to benefit fron. demand in these markets.
13.          Through reorienting and augmenting capacity of MinFor to undertake its appropriate role
of managing forestry resources within the Republic of Belarus, and providing opportunity for greater
private sector development within the forestry industry, the project supports GoB's overall objectives for
the sector -- to increase the contribution to GNP from forestry and wood processing industries through
sector efficiency improvements, increased output, increased domestic trade and exports, and, in the
medium term, increased efficient rural employment in forests and forest industries. The reforms and
associated investments supported by the project would have a pivotal impact on the structure and future
operations of the forestry sector, would contribute to the overall growth and improve living standards.
14.          The particular sector policy reforms which GoB has agreed to implement and which form
a basis for the project are: (a) a phased increase in wood pricing (stumpage policy); (b) allocation of
stumpage revenues directly to MinFor, allowing MinFor financial self-sufficiency from these revenues
and from sale of forest products; (c) liberalization of the domestic market for wood and wood products
through elimination of wood product price and profit controls, and elimination of the state order system
for wood products production; (d) introduction of a formal wood marketing facility with open market
price setting; (e) liberalization of international trade in wood and wood products and the elinination of
export disincentives (e.g. export taxes for goods whose prices are not administered); (f) privatization of
state wood enterprises (Bellesprom and MinFor) and promotion of inter-enterprise competition; and (g)
introduction of competition for harvesting contracts and transport services.
The Rehabilitation Loan
15.          In the second half of 1993, GoB, in cooperation with international financial institutions,
developed programs to restore macroeconomic stability and to sustain the pace of structural reform. The
stabilization program including monetary and fiscal measures was formulated in consultation with the IMF
and received support under the Systemic Transformation Facility in July of last year. That program
strengthened GoB's monetary and credit policy framework by setting targets for credit expansion
consistent with macro stabilization and realistic interest rates. It also sought to maintain the government
budget deficit at a level consistent with monetary targets ar.d sustainable debt accumulation by limiting
government expenditures, cutting consumer and producer subsidies, containing the growth of nominal
public sector wages and restraining the growth of social fund outlays.
16.          During the second half of 1993, GoB adopted a program of structural reform set out in
the GoB's Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies. This received the support of the Bank in
9.     Early 2000's levels are estimated at 14.5 million in3 ob, reaching 20 million m3 ob in the 2010's.



November through a Rehabilitation Loan for US$120 million. This program focused on measures to
promote competition, support the development of the private sector, stimulate the productive sector, and
provide a financially sustainable social safety net to protect vulnerable groups during the transition.
17.          Implementation to date of the program has been mixed. Since the initiation of the
program, GoB has achieved substantial progress toward objectives in some areas. To some extent the
uncertainty surrounding the monetary union with the Russian Federation delayed important measures such
as further international trade liberalization. In other areas it is evident that political consensus-building
within the Republic of Belarus on details of market-oriented reform is still in process. However, GoB
has stated that the limited progress represents only delay in the transition to a market economy. GoB
recognizes that delays in implementation of the planned measures are detrimental to prospects for
stabilization and recovery, and that it needs to take quick action in a number of areas.
18.          Under the Rehabilitation Loan GoB has made progress in: implementing measures to
reduce controls on prices and profits on enterprises with a dominant market position; reducing the
incidence of state orders, removing export licensing requirements for some agricultural and industrial
goods; establishing legislation to introduce a competitive and transparent public procurement system;
eliminating the implicit taxation of exports through surrender requirements at below-market exchange
rates; and distributing privatization vouchers corresponding to 50% of the value of 44 joint stock
companies. These policy reforms, though limited, are important steps toward a policy environment more
conducive to the development of a private market economy.
19.          Progress has been slower than originally planned with respect to other issues, and the
Bank has encouraged GoB to take quick action to bring the policy framework into line with the reform
program supported by the Rehabilitation Loan. The Bank has suggested that priority over the coming
months be given to: reducing subsidies and cross-subsidies on foodstuffs, rents, municipal services, and
electricity; enforcing the elimination of the ceilings on distribution and profit margins for retailers;
completing the implementation of the pilot demonopolization program for the trading conglomerate, and
extending the program to other conglomerates; setting and meeting new targets for the privatization of
small businesses by auction; implemenLing the exchange of privatization vouchers for shares of
enterprises; and corporatizing the 10 largest state-owned enterprises as had been agreed. Through such
action the Belarus government would contribute greatly toward achieving needed structural reform. These
actions could also take place irrespective of the status of negotiations over possible monetary union with
the Russian Federation.
20.          Implementation of this forestry project will help to further the fulfillment of the overall
policy reform program. Through dated covenants under this loan, GoB is committed to ensure the
removal of all export and import quotas and other restrictions and export taxes on wood and wood
products; to move forward with the liberalization of the domestic market in wood and wood products;
and to facilitate competitiomi and open domestic markets. Assurances have also been receivedl that
application of a new state procurement system would result in wood and wood product procurement by
the state using market mechanisms, that wood marketing is open to residents and nnn-residents on an
equal basis and that neither faces discriminatory taxation. These commitments would apply as well in
the event that customs and monetary union with the Russian Federation takes place. On the basis of
present understandings, a customs union between the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation will
be established as of May 1, 1994, and the external trade policies of the Republic of Belarus are planned
to be harmonized with those of Russia. According to plans of the Russian authorities, and as part of



-6-
Russia's programs with the IMF and the Bank, non-energy export quotas and licensing, including those
for wood and wood products, are to be eliminated by July and export taxes will be eliminated by end-
1994.
Project Objectives
21.           GoB's objective is to restructure the forestry sector to ensure that it can make its optimal
contribution to the economy. The short-term project strategy would support this objective by introducing
significant sector policy and management reforms to allow the sector to operate under emerging market
conditions; improve forest maintenance operating efficiency and cost-effectiveness; prolong the life of
existing harvest mechanization pool, and thereby reverse the decline in wood harvesting levels; maintain
and increase efficient rural employment; and possibly expand exports. Emphasis is placed in this project
design on a "minimum package" to provide fast returns, supplemented by selected longer term
interventions.
22.           The medium term strategy to serve GoB's economic objectives for the sector is to
improve forest resource management and the economic value of the standing tree-stock, and enhance the
forestry technology and human resource basis. In addition, phased policy reforms for the sector would
contribute to the emergence of a market-based production system, and introduce competitive pricing of
wood supplies and forestry sector services. The project would also support development of the sector
through establishing a framework for future reform of sector enterprises, including corporatization and
privatization of existing enterprises, removal of barriers to entry for new private sector participants, and
the training of future enterprise owners and managers, technical specialists and sector regulators.
23.           Project-specific goals are: (a) to improve forestry resource management and develop
medium-term strategic resource management plans; (b) to reverse the decline in timber harvest through
spare parts imports; (c) to reduce and eventually eliminate direct and indirect budget subsidies to the
sector; (d) to promote the establishment of private sector harvesting, transport and other services to the
forestry industry;'° (e) to begin the process of adjustment in MinFor's enterprises to the open market
economy; and (f) promote improved forest research, development and applied technology and the
capabilities of the existing and future professional and technical manpower in the sector.
Project Description
24.           The proposed project is the first investment project to be supported by the Bank in the
Republic of Belarus. The main components are: (a) Sector Policy Reform: to effect real price increases
in the stumpage fees, introduce open market pricing, liberalize both the international trade and domestic
markets for wood and wood products, and prepare MinFor enterprises for future privatization;
(b) Production Support: to implement intensified silviculture, create improved seed facilities; provide
harvesting equipment and spare parts, and introduce efficient harvesting practices; (c) Forest Fire
Protection: to provide adequate protection against forest fires and prevent the spread of radionuclide
contamination through forest fires; (d) Forest Ecology policy for: the preservation of biodiversity and
species mix; monitoring of forestry air pollution and radionuclide contamination; monitoring of fuelwood
utilization; assessment of the ecological impact of the harvest and maintenance systems; improved MinFor
regulatory functions and enforcement; and planning for wetlands and Chernobyl-contaminated forest
10.    with EBRD supporting the complementary developments in wood processing.



resources; (e) Institution Building: professional training in forestry and business; preparation for
operations within an open market economy; strengthening of forestry research and development; planning
of forestry higher education reforms; and (f) Technical Assistance: engineering and testing of
manufacturing prototypes; computerized planning systeni for forestry resource management; and
upgrading forestry resource and strategic planning, staff training, project management and audit.
Project Benefits
25.          The Project's composite Economic Rate of Return is 33%. Project benefits would include
immediate short-term benefits from increases in wood production, productivity improvements, and
savings of foreign exchange (wood and fuel ityport substitution and reduced fuel consumption"). Direct
cash flow benefits from the project would result from increased efficient production and sales of
smallwood for use either as fuelwood, pulpwood, or for manufacturing. The proposed new machinery
and spare parts to be imported under the project, and the associated new harvesting methods based on
increasing the use of manual labor, would arrest the output decline of the last five years, preserve
manufacturing and harvesting job-places, and significantly reduce fuel consumption in harvesting. The
fire protection component would increase the effectiveness of fire intervention in reducing fire-related tree
losses, and thus reduce the risk of spreading the Chernobyl-radioactivity contamination into neighboring
countries through smoke plumes
26.           Medium- and long-term benefits are also significant. These are primarily improvements
in the economic value of the standing trees, tree quality (genetic upgrading), tree health (reduced risk of
disease), and improved ecological conditions. Investments in forestry research and higher education,
machinery and equipment prototype development, forestry planning systems, and pollution monitoring
would also have a positive economic impact in the medium-term.
27.           Sectoral reforms to be implemented under this project would have an immediate impact
on the overall efficiency of the economy, and support newly emerging entrepreneurs through the
introduction of open markets for wood and forestry contractual services.
28.           Sustainability: The agreed changes in stumpage fees will result in increased revenues
to MinFor, providing financing to sustain and expand the intensive silviculture to all the forest areas
under their management after the completion of this project.
Project Risks
29.          Risk External to the Project: (a) Macro-policy Reforms: potential for slow
implementation of macro-economic policy reforms could delay sector reforms, with a negative impact
on. sector and project performance; (b) Sector policy Reform: potential for insufficient reforms, and
inadequate implementation of agreed and planned policy reforms; (c) Industrial Adjustment: the wood
processing industry may inadequately adjust to real price increases for roundwood and fuel, passing most
of the cost increases on to consumers, and become uncompetitive with imports; (d) Market Demand:
both the risk of higher product prices and the general state of the macro-economy may result in overall
dampened demand for wood and wood products, thereby lessening project benefits and cash flows from
11.   both heating- and machinery-fuel requirements.



- 8 -
wood sales and stumpage; and (e) Wood Markets: wood industries may find themselves without adequate
working capital to purchase wood in the open market. This would dampen market demand for wood.
As a further result, the Wood Exchange may not function successfully during its initial period,
discouraging its initiators from pursuing its effective functioning over the longer tern.
30.           Risks Internal to the Project: (a) Inadequw.fe Local Financing: GoB is operating
under a very tight budget ceiling and will rely on stumpage fees and profits from wood sales to fund the
local cost component of the project. Any shortfalls in these revenues could place at risk project
components with significant local cost funding by GoB; (b) Implementation Risk: this is the Bank's first
investment project in the Republic of Belarus with untested local project management skills and
procedures; (c) MinFor Enterprises: intensified silviculture operations would be carried out by MinFor's
rayon-level enterprises. While they have both the managerial and the manpower capacity, they need
strengthening to achieve efficiencies and adequate performance standards. While this is being provided
under the project's training component, the enabling environment may not have changed sufficiently due
to inadequate macro- and sector-policy reforms; and (d) Private Sector Development: the Project plans
to provide competitive access to the private sector to harvest contracts. If, however, the private sector
harvest contractors do not emerge during this period of transition, the Project objective of achieving
operating efficiencies through promotion of competition from the private sector in forestry services may
not be achieved.
Enviromnental Aspects
31.           The Project is classified as Environment Category B. The project would provide
significant environmental benefits.  The most significant benefit from the intensified silviculture
component and the changed mechanization regime would be the reduction in tree and soil damage, the
opening of the forest canopy to light, and the increasing of forest-floor space. This would promote the
natural generation of groundcover, understory, and encroaching species, thereby increasing the
biodiversity of the forests. The intensified silviculture would also reduce the risks to tree health from
pests and diseases. The seed component would result in genetic upgrading of the forests. The
introduction of terrain vehicles for maintenance and harvesting would reduce the need for forest roads.
The project would also support air pollution, radioactivity and wetlands monitoring of the facts. The
radioactivity monitoring program would contribute to forestry and wood industry workers' health and
protection.  The fire-protection component would reduce the risk of the spread of radioactivity
contamination through the smoke plume and provide improved health protection for fire-fighters. The
inclusion of environmental considerations in future forestry planning, operational guidelines and
enforcement, the training of present and future forestry professionals, and in the research programs would
all contribute to medium- and long-term benefits.
32.           Environmental assessments (EA) and reviews (ER)"2 were completed for the major
12.    Environmental Assessments and Reviews available:
Belarus: Assessing the State of Forest Fire Protection in the Republic of Belarus (Canadian Interagency
Forest Fire Centre, Canada, 1993).
Belarus: Forest Development Project: Environment Review (Euroconsult, Netherlands, 1993).
Belarus: Environmental Review of Forested Wetlands (International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research
Bureau, UK, in cooperation with Ministry of Environment, National Forest and Nature Agency, Demnark,

components and aspects of this project. The project has been designed to minimize the potential for
negative enviromnental impacts and to ameliorate other issues raised in the EAs and ERs. The project
would support the following environmental studies as elements of its planning activities: (a) within the
proposed Forestry Strategic Plan, an ER would be prepared to provide future recommendations on
resource management and exploitation, and an EA of long-term sustainability of fuelwood production;
(b) resources inventory, monitoring, plaming and regulation for wetlands and the wetlands forest;
(c) environmental aspects would be included ir the forestry education planning and the forestry research
plan; and (d) an EA would be prepared to support the future development and the management program
for the Chemobyl-contaminated forestry resources.
Project Financing
33.          An IBRD loan of US$41.9 million is proposed to finance 100% of foreign exchange costs
of the project. Most of the GoB funding of the local costs would come from increased stumpage fees and
incremental revenues to MinFor from market sales of wood. Industry participants in the Prototype
Development program would provide matching finances from their own resources.
Project and Policy Implementation Plans and Reviews
34.          The success of this Project rests with the implementation of macro-economic and sector
policy reforms. Consequently, GoB agreed at negotiations to a detailed sector policy reform program.
It was also agreed at negotiations that progress in sector policy reforms would be reviewed annually by
GoB and the Bank, before May of each year, and the policy reform implementation program for the
following year would be set.
35.          It was agreed at negotiation that the PIU's first task would be the preparation of project
implementation plans acceptable to the Bank. Project implementation would be subject to Bank staff
supervision, with heavy emphasis during the first 18 months. A mid-term Review (MTR) would be held
within three months of the completion of the Forestry Strategic Plan (expected about mid-1996). During
the MTR, GoB's proposed forestry strategy for the next decade, based on its in-depth considerations of
the recommendations of the FSP, would also be reviewed with the Bank.
36.          At negotiations, commencement and completion dates were agreed for the major elements
of the projects, including annual policy reviews, implementation timetable updates, simplification of
regulations for business licenses for the sector, implementation of the privatization program for
Bellesprom, commencement of the FSP, the development of the Forestry Management Information
System, reviews of research and training programs, and the establishment of the Prototype Fund.
Project Conditionality
37.          Covenants Agreed at Negotiations include (a) issuance, by December 1994, of relevant
decrees and regulation to further facilitate the liberalization of international trade in wood and wood

products; (b) by December 31, 1994, the establishment of a trading facility for wood, wood products and
related services (essentially an open market wood exchange); (c) by October 31, 1994, establishment of
a stumpage and royalty policy for wood and wood products for implementation from January 1, 1995;
and (d) by December 31, 1994, issuance of relevant decrees and regulations for the further liberalization
of the domestic market in wood and wood products.
38.          Condition of Loan Effectiveness: It was agreed at negotiations that as a condition for
loan effectiveness the PIU will have been established with staff and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, including the appointment of a Project Director and a Project Manager, the selection of the
procurement and project management consultants, and that the operating budget for the Project for 1994
has been made available by GoB to MinFor.
39.          Conditions of Disbursement have been agreed: (a) prior approval of annual budgets by
the Bank for contracted Forestry R&D, Environment monitoring, and the Forestry Management
Information System Development components; and (b) the formal establishment of the Prototype Fund
prior to disbursement of its capitalization financing.
Recommendation
40.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve this loan.
