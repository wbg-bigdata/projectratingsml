REPORT AND RECOMMINDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA FOR A
THIRD ENDE POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of
US$6 million on standard IDA terms, to help finance a third project for
the expansion of the services of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S. A.
(ENDE). Most of the credit proceeds would be relent to ENDE for 20 years,
including 3 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum;
$80,000 would be made available to Direccion Nacional de Electricidad
(DINE).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Bolivia" (WH-213a, dated November 9, 1972) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on November 20, 1972 (R72-254). Subsequent economic
developments, particularly those related to the financial reform. program
introduced in October 1972, were reviewed by an economic mission in March
1973. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Bolivia is the least-developed country in South America. The
majority of the economically active population is engaged in low-productivity
pursuits in agriculture, handicrafts and services, while the export sector --
mining, petroleum and cotton -- accounts for a small fraction of the gain-
fully occupied. Two-thirds of Bolivia's five million inhabitants are
Amerindian, only one-half of whom speak Spanish, the official language.
Most of the country's population is concentrated on the Altiplano, a barren
plateau at 10 to 15 thousand feet between the Western and Eastern ranges of
the Andes, while the tropical plains, which account for almost two-thirds
of Bolivia's territory, are sparsely inhabited by one-seventh of the coun-
try's population. The rugged topography of much of the country and the
low population density of the rest, make communications difficult and
costly. GNP per capita is estimated at almost US$200 but because of the
harshness of the environment, the regional income disparities and the
skewed income distribution, living standards of most of the population are
at subsistence levels.



- 2 -
4.        The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual
economic structure -- a narrow modern mineral export sector and
a broad traditional agricultural subsistence sector -- which
characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times. The
revolution sought to deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of
its economic base and substitute for its rule that of a new and
strong middle class. It also stressed the need for reinvestment of
mining nrofits to foster economic development and integrate the
Indian peasants into the nm-arket economy.  These objectives have
been only partially achieved. Despite the great social achievements
in eradicating feudal relations in the country-side, distributing
the land among the peasants and eliminating the warst obstacles to
social and economic mobility, the power vacuum left by the destruction
of the oligarchy led to political instability. In the economic sphere,
the agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines were followed
by sharp declines in agricultural, mining and manufacturing production.
GDP declined in the 1950's and did not recover to its pre-1952 level
until 1961.  Since then, output has been increasing steadily, but its
growth has been barely sufficient to keep up with population growth
in the lS50's and 1960's.  As a result, GNP per capita is now about
the same as at the time of 1952 revolution, although pcssibly somewhat
better distributed.
5.       CGrowth momentum was appreciably accelerated in the late 1960's
as a result of substantial increases in private and public investment
ard satisfactoryexport performance especially in the petroleum sector.
At the turn of the decade, however, the momentum was lost because of
political instability accormpanied by deteriorating public finances.
Private investment fell as a result of a crisis of corfidence and p-ablic
-nvestment was unable to fil1 the shortfall due to lack of financial
resources. The deterioration of public finances reflected a structural
flaw in the economy. Since the expropriations carried out in 1952,
Bolivia's public sector became proportionately one of the largest in
So-ath America and a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment of the
po-pulation. Welith the scarcity of e&aployment opportunities in the private
sector, pressures to ex- nd the ranks of public servants proved difficult
to resist.  Large expenditures on wages and salaries by the Government
and tUhe state enterprises, combined with a weak and poorly administered
tax systen, left few rescu:rces for public investment. Moreover, the
inability ci' the public sector to generate an adequate volume of savings,
limi;ed the Government's capacity to utilize external assistance. The
gravity of this situation was further accentuated during 1969-71 as a
result of increased hiring of personnel and substantial real earnings'
increases in the public sector.



-3-
6.        The growth pattern of the Bolivian economy since 1965 reveals
serious structural weaknesses which resulted in the absorption of
manpower in low productivity activities, in increased open unemployment,
and in an unfavorable income distribution. If the growth of the gas
and petroleum industry is excluded, the goods-producing sectors grew at a
rate barely above that of population in spite of the rapid expansion
of cotton and other commercial agriculture in the tropical plains.
Although the services sector was pressured into absorbing a good deal
of the urban unemployed, and some growth occurred also irn the labor force
employed by the goods producing sectors, employment opportunities continued
to trail the growth of the labor force.  As a consequence, on a country-
wide basis, open unemployment increased from 14 percent in 1965 to some
17 percent in 1971.
7.        The rapid growth of the predominantly urban services sectors
and the slow growth of non-commercial agricultural output, together
with a deterioration in the terms of trade of the agricultural sector,
contributed to a reduction in incomes of the poorest sections of the
community.  This group includes most of the 70 percent of Bolivians
earning their living from agriculture. These tendencies towards more
unequal income distribution were further aggravated by an increasing
polarization of economic activity in the tropical plains. As a result
of the rapid growth of gas and petroleum production and of commercial
agriculture, the per capita income differential between the plains and
the Altiplano increased from 21 percent in 1965 to 42 percent in 1970
in favor of the plains. Because of the smaller population of the plains
-- some 1 percent of Bolivia's total -- and its less egalitarian income
distribution, this shift in regional income shares damaged the overall
national income distribution pattern which in 1968 was considerably worse
than that of Latin America as a whole; although average per capita income
in Bolivia was one-third of the Latin American average, income of the
lowest Bolivian quintile was only one-fifth of the sane population group
in Latin America.
Recent Developments
8.        Coming to power in August 1971, President Banzer's Government
faced the urgent need to stimulate investment and provide jobs for the
urban unemployed. The new Administration encouraged private investment
by introducing favorable legislation, settling nationalization claims and
providing very large increases in credit to the private sector. These
expansionary policies were successful in achieving an upsurge in private
investment and in bolstering the rate of economic growth to 7.1 percent in
1972. They also resulted, however, in a large budgetary deficit and
heavy losses of international reserves. To redress the foreign exchange
position and improve the budgetary situation, the Government introduced
in October 1972 a "Stabilization and Development Plan". The Plan included
the following measures: a reduction in the par value of the peso from



-4 -
$bll.8& to $b20.00 per US dollar; the introduction of a 20 percent tax
on the value of traditional exports and a 15 percent tax on non-traditional
exports; a 5 percent tax on the revaluation of corporate assets resulting
from the devaluation of the peso; a general wage increase of $bl35 per
month, to be followed by a one-year wage freeze; and a freeze on
residential rents. Government current revenues which averaged 13 percent
of GEP in 1971-72 were expected to increase to 20 percent in 1973, mainly
as a result of the imposition of new export taxes. The transfer of
resources from consuirmption tto savings was to be achieved through a
reduction on the average by 10 percent in real wages. The flat nominal
salary increase provided for in the Plan ensured that the brunt of this
reduction would be borne by the better paid wage and salary earners.
9.        Wh-le the Plan's results have not been as successful as
envisaged, they have been orn the whole positive.  Largely because of
US Government- and IMF prograum support, the Plan's effect on the foreign
exchange position has been favorable, with the Central Bank's foreign
exchange reserves increasing from US$19-5 million at the end of Septernber
1972 to US$46.4 million at the end of June 1973. And although the
Treasury's current revenues are not expected to meet the Plan's targets,
they are likely to increase to 15-16 percent in the current year, as
compared with 13 percent in 1972.
10.       The fiscal outlook beyond this year is far from favorable
unless more lasting fiscal improvements are introduzced.  The Govermnent
recognizes thiis and is currently considering proposals of a tax reform
coiiaission nrepa-red by an OILS technical assistance teamr of fiscal experts,
for a reform of Bolivia's structure of taxation. A reasonable objective
for the reform. of the tax system would be to raise public sector savings
from an annual average of 3.7 percent of GDP during 1965-71 to 6 percent
during 1973-77. This level of public savings would make it possible,
allowing for some internal borrowing, to cover some three-fourths of an
increased public investment program, averaging 10.5 percent of GDP over
the period.  Tnis level of capital formation (which would be consistent
with GDP grcwth of between 6) and 7 percent per annum during 1973-77)
should, if achieved, help Bolivia accelerate greatly its process of
development and render it easier to achieve a more equitable distribution
oLf the benefits of growth.
External Assistance Requireents
1'.       Sc e   .US$63 million of the public investment program of about
U S$ 0b -  ion annually during 1973-77 are expected to boe suitable for
exter:al :ar~a.icang. The foreign exchange component of these projects
is likely to be some two-thirds of total costs or about US$44 million
a.nnually. lEowever, to carry oUt its investment activities and meet
amortization payrents, the puablic sector would require a gross annual
average inflow of U$&51 million.  Thus, if external lenders were to
li_mit thsei- financing to the foreign exchange costs of the proJects suit-
able :or external financing, they would not fully cover the public sectorts
external capital --requirerents.  To fill the remaining gap of US$7 million,
it -will be necessary that external lenders permit about 15 percent of their
oa is to be used to meet local currency costs.



12.       To sustain an annual growth of GDP by 6 or 7 percent, gross
external capital inflows into the public and private sectors combined
will have to average some U$68 million in 1973-77 as compared with
us$42 million in 1965-71. Provided public sector savings increase in
line with the above targets, Bolivia's public sector may reasonably
expect to obtain an average of U$51 million annually during 1973-77
from undisbursed loan balances and new loans from multilateral and
bilateral agencies. The remaining U$17 million may be expected to come
in the form of suppliers' credits and from private investors. Should this
pattern of external financing materialize, Bolivia's outstanding external
public debt would increase slowly, from US$596 million in 1972 to US$640
million in 1977. The annual debt service burden, however, is expected to
fall from 20 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services in 1972
to about 15 percent in 1977, mainly on account of Boliviats favorable export
prospects: earnings from exports may well reach about US$330 million by
1977, up by some 40 percent from the 1972 level.  Bolivia's export pros-
pects may be further enhanced by the success which the Government is having
in attracting foreign risk capital for oil and gas exploration.
13.       The Bolivian Government has made considerable efforts in the past
two years to remedy the precarious fiscal situation although the results
have fallen short of expectations. Provided additional fiscal measures are
implemented promptly, they would justify external financial assistance of
the magnitude indicated above. In the meantime, given Bolivia's great poverty,
its recently improved performance, as well as its lack of creditworthiness
for Bank borrowing, IDA is justified in making the proposed credit.
PART II - THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE IN BOLIVIA
Introduction
14.       Bolivia is an original member of the Bank but did not receive arny
Bank Group resources until 1964. Bank Group assistance to Bolivia has had
to take account of the country's difficult budgetary position and its
limited capacity to service external debt. Except for a Bank loan to help
finance an "enclave" project, lending to Bolivia has been in the form of
IDA credits. Until the end of 1972, Bank Group financing was limited to
those projects which made no call on the Government's budget for domestic
contribution. However, following the adoption by the Government of the
Stabilization and Development Plan, IDA made in December 1972 a $8 million
credit in support of the rehabilitation program of the Bolivian Railways
which was dependent upon the Government finances. Because of the narrow
scope for private investment, the first IFC investment was made in 1973 only.
Status of Bank Group Operations
15.       A summary statement of Bank Group operations is attached as Annex II.
Up to now, the sectoral distribution of lending has been fairly limited. In
addition to the railway credit mentioned above, IDA has made three credits for
power generation and distribution ($22.4 million), and three for livestock
development ($10.2 million). The one and only Bank loan ($23.25 million)



helped finance the construction of a pipeline to transmnit natural gas for
export.
16.       The first lending operation in Bolivia benefitted the electric
oower sector.  It consisted of two DA credits made in 1964 for a total of
$15 million. ENDE, the newly- established, Government-owned power company,
received $10 million to build. the Corani hydroelectric plant and trans-
missioon and distribution facilities.  The old-established, privately-owne(
3o1ivian Power Cormany, Ltd. (BPC) received the other $5 million to bu-l d
the Chururaoui hlydroelectric plant and some transmission lines. Both
projects were executed efficiently and completed on time.  In 1969, a $7.4
million credit -w,as made to assist ENDE in constructing the Santa Isabel
hydroelectric plant.  Tnis project had experienced delay-s and cost overruns,
but has now been comlleted and -will still show a satisfactory econormc rate
of return.  Th 1967, !DA made its first credit of $2 million for livestock
development in the Beni regicn.  The proceeds, together with a contributioll
from Banco Agricola de Bolivia, supported a credit program for beef ranchers
and related technical services.  The money was taken up rapidly and IDA
followed -an with a second credit of $1.4 million in 1970.  In June 1971, IDA
lent 3^6.8 million for a third livestock project, consisting of credit
programs for beef ranchers in. the Beni region and small sheep ranchers on
the Altiplano, and of some processing facilities. To help finance the first
stage (1973-1974) of the Government's plan for the technical and financial
rehabilitation of the Bolivian Railways, an IDA credit of $8 million was trade
available in Decemiber 1972. The plan is being implemented with the support
o: UNDP-f-inanced technical assistance.
17.       h.e ornly Bank ope-.ation in Bolivia has been ti-e $23.25 mil'lion loan
on July 1969 to Compania Yacibol Bogoc Transportadores (YABOG) Lor the con-
struCtion of a gas nipeline frcm the oil and gas fields around Santa Cruz to
the Argentine border. This loan was renegotiated in 1971, in the afterrath
cf the nationalization of the field installations formerly run by a subsidiary
of Gu!1 Oil Cor0oration.  The project wias coirpleted in April 1972.  Since then,
abo-at 15G million cubic feet of natural g.s per day (6 - 7 percent more than
orininaly,v nlanned) has been delivered to Argentina, bringing in some 51i-l§
million amnnually in export earnings. Out of those earnings, service payments
are oe-inc frmade on the loans which financed the pipeline, compensation is being
paid to Gulf for 'rthe properties taken over by the Government, and the balance
reoresents a net addition Li Bolivia's foreign exchange earnings.  The IDB
JoLned the Bank in 19'71 in the financing of tnis project.
Bank Groun "ole in External CaTital Assistance
v3.       The orooosed credit would be the Bank Group's ninth operation in
Bo -v d, brini-`ng the amcunt of TDA assistance to $46.6 million. Including
undisbursed balances, Bolivia s debt to the Bank and DA now represents only
about 10 nercent of its external public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio
1Eht increase to about ;5 percent.   As a source of financial assistance to
. ivia, the Bank Group ranks well below the US Government and the IDB.
-?eth.eless, its activities have been expanding: Bank/IDA lending in the

Future Direction of Bank Group Lending
19.       In the next few years, Bank Group activities in Bolivia may
be diversified through operations in the mining sector and in the agri-
cultural sector outside animal husbandry. In line with the Government's
development objectives, these operations would help promote larger
production, primarily for export, and the creation of additional employ-
ment opportunities. In addition, we would continue lending for electric-
ity services, railways and pipelines. We would also endeavor to support
the Government's rural development efforts by financing projects which
would improve the quality of life on the Altiplano, as well as schemes
for resettling rural inhabitants from the Altiplano to the vast tropical
lowlands in the east of the country. Three or four lending proposals may
reach the negotiation stage in the next twelve months or so. The first
could be a credit program for private medium-sized mines, primarily Bolivian-
owned. A banking institution was recently designated by the Government to
serve as intermediary in relending the proceeds of a possible IDA credit to
the miners to enable them to import machinery and equipment to develop and
improve the operation of existing mines and to expand mineral production for
export. The appraisal report on this project is now being prepared.
Another possible mining operation would be the expansion of a tin tailings
recovery plant at Catavi, a joint venture of the Government and foreign
private enterprise. However, this enclave project has been delayed by the
sponsors' inability to complete the financing plan. Another proposed credit
program would benefit agricultural producers, mainly cotton and sugar planters
in the Santa Cruz area and dairy farmers in the Cochabamba area. This project
has been delayed by a serious deterioration in the organization and financial
position of Banco Agricola which has raised doubts as to its capacity to
handle an additional credit program at this time. IDA and other lending



-8-
agencies are presently discuss:ing with the Government a plan of action,
wnich would remedy the administrative and financial shortcomings of Benco
Agricola. Finally, IDA may be able to help finance expansion of the
electricity transmission and distribution network in and around La Paz.
The Government does not wish to move forward with this project until it
has worked out arrangements for the purchase of the Bolivian Power Company,
and a possible IDA credit will onrly be considered after the Government has
raised tariffs in La Paz, thus putting the electricity supply. operation
there on a sournd financial basis.
PART III -- THE POWER SECTOR IN BOLIVIA
Introduction
20.       For about forty years, beginning in the mid-twenties, the Bolivian
Power Company,Ltd. (BPC), a subsidiary of the US-controlled Canadian Inter-
natIonal Power Company, was the sole public service supplier of electricity
in Bolivia, supplying the city cf La Paz, the mines around Oruro and the
municipal distribution company at- Oruro. A modern power sector came into
being only in the mid-sixties, when the Bolivian Government established ENDE
as an autonomous public utility to build and operate generation and trans-
mission facilities outside La Paz, and set up the Direccion Nacional de
Electricidad (DDiE) to regulate the electricity industry, including electricity
tariffs, throughouz the country. in 1968 the Government enacted an Electricity
Code, thus laying a uniform basis for the operation, regulation and expansion
of thie electr_city industry.  The implementing regulations to the Code were
ccmpleted recently.
21.       Dur_ng the past twe:lve years, energy production in Bolivia increased
from L)77 Gwh to e72 Gwh, the annual rate of growth averaging 5.7 percent.
BPC still accounts for 46 percent of the energy produced, with IXDE represenr-
ing 25 percent; the remaining 29 percent is divided between COMIBOL, the
Governm,ent-owned mining corporation, and other self-producers. The installations
are in good ph;ysical condition and the power companies are being operated
efs ciently. However, despite recent growth in production, the use of
e1.ec.riciTy in Bolivia is still quite limited. Installed generation capacity
,-ll reach a ;nodest 330 l- Rt the end of 1973, 70 percent of this being hydro-
electric pian-f. No elecoric-Ly is available to people living outside the
urban centers and mining areas, and only one-fourth of Bolivian households
have access to it.  Per capita consumption is one of the lowestin South America,
amoir_ting to about one-third cf that in Peru and to one-seventh of that in
Argentina.
22.       With: the 7DB-financed e)xansion of ENDE's Sucre-Potosi system near-
ing cormpletion, and the Santa Ciuz and Cochabamba-OrLro systems' expansion abcut
to be la-unched with the help  of the proposed credit, the extension and strengthen-
ing of the Ba Paz transmission and distribution network, and the interconnection
of the four power systems will- be the next power investment to be undertaken.
A pre-feasibiiity study of the Cochabamba-La Paz intereconnection, financed by
IDA -.wh tne proceeds of the 1964 MDE credit, demonstrated its technical and
ecor.oAmic Justification and the final study and design are included in the pro-
pZccd project.



23.       Related to the proposed credit is a proposed USAID loan of
USZ10.8 million for rural electrification in the areas of Cochabamba and
Santa Cruz. The proposed AID loan, which will cover the entire cost of
the project including that in Bolivian pesos, would be made to the Govern-
ment for relending to ENDE, to the Cochabamba distribution company, and
to the rural electricity cooperative in Santa Cru.z. The project will
represent the first comprehensive approach to the problem of electrifying
rural areas, thus raising earnings from agriculture and the standard of
living of the rural population.
24.       Looking further ahead, there is need for undertaking a compre-
hensive energy sources survey in Bolivia. Its results would make it
possible to elaborate a strategy for the sector and identify priorities
for power development. With the funds made available to it under the
proposed credit, DINE will carry out some studies of the availabilities,
prices and consumption of energy by sources. Moreover, the UNDP is
considering a grant of about $620,000 to ENDE for the preparation of an
inventory of hydroelectric resources and of a plan for hydroelectric
development in the decade 1981-90. At the same time, exploration for
hydrocarbons has been launched in some parts of the country.
Recent Problems in the Power Sector
25.       The main problem in the Bolivian power sector has been the tariff
issue.  Bolivian public opinion has not yet fully recognized the link
between adequate electricity tariffs, needed to finance expansion, and an
adequate electricity supply.  Neither has there been full understanding of
IDA's position that the public sector, given the many unsatisfied claims
on its scarce resources from the underprivileged sectors of Bolivia's
population, should not subsidize electric service made available to the
higher-income strata of the country. La Paz tariffs, in particular, have
long been a sensitive political issue and DINE has never felt free to
authorize BPC to move them in line with operating costs and expansion
requirements. The 9 percent return on net fixed assets provided for in
the Electricity Code has not been achieved, and needed investments have
had, at times, to be postponed.
26.       Throughout 1970 and 1971, the Government and BPC sought IDA
support for the financing of the Cahua hydroelectric project near La Paz.
As the Government was reluctant to borrow from IDA for relending to a
foreign-owned power company exclusively, the then Minister of Finance
asked IDA in July 1971 to consider an operation which, in addition to
Cahua, would also include a small ENDE project consisting mainly of
preparatory work on the Cochabamba-La Paz interconnection. However,
inadequate tariffs in La Paz prevented our participation. By February
1972, when the Government finally saw its way to raising tariffs sub-
stantially, construction of Cahua had advanced too far to make IDA parti-
cipation possible.



- 10 -
27.       After the increase in La Paz tariffs in February 1972, IDA
scheduled a field review of the most urgent investment requirements of
both power companies. During three visits made to Bolivia in June,
September and December 1972, twro projects were prepared and appraised,
one for BPC and one for ENDE. However, a serious deterioration has
occurred in the finanrcial position of BFC in the aftermath of the devalua-
tion of the peso, and it is impossible, in the absence of an adequate
rate lncrease, to proceed wi-h the BPC project at this time. On the other
hand, the devaluation did not affect ENDE's finances to the same extent
and the Government saw its way, at the turn of the year, to letting DINE
enforce higher tariffs in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Sucre. Moreover,
the Government has assured IDA that tariffs meeting the requirements of
the Electricity Code will be put into effect in La Paz no later than
August 31, 1974, and is taking action to strengthen BPC's financial
position in the short term. Meanwhile, the Government has entered into
negotiatims with BPC which could lead to the sale of the Company to a
Bolivian entity. The Government plans to request IDA assistance in
financing a transmission and distribution project in, La Paz after arrange-
rents for the purchase of BPC have been completed. A credit for this
project is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors after La
Paz tariffs have been adjusted in accordance with the assurances given
IDA. Taking these factors into account, and bearing in mind the economic
loss which w!ould result from furither postponement of the ENDE project,
IDA is justified in proceeding with the ENDE project without delay.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The Project
28.       The ENDE part of the project, to be carried, out in about two years,
forms part of ENDE's expansion program for 1973-77 and consists of (i) the
expansion of the Santa Crus diesel power plant by installing two 8 mi gas
turbine units; (ii) construction of a 22 km long 66 kv transmission line
between the s.Dsubtations at Warnes and Montero in the Santa Cruz area;
(iii) construction of a h; km long 66 kv transmission line from Miguillas
substation to tmo mines near Viloco, and a Lo loT long 115 kv transmission
line between the Santa Isai0el plant and the Sacaba substation in the
Cochabamba-Cruro arba; (iv) expansion of severaL sabstations in the Santa
Cruz and Cochaba:,m.ba-Oruro areas;5 (v) retention of consu.tants to carry out
studies of She Cochabamba-L1a FPaz interconnection, the Corani plant expan-
sion ^and Possible future generation projects, and to provide ENDE with
marnagement advice; and (vi) construction of a central office building in
Cochabamba. The D1EB part of the project consists of improvements in its
Drocedures and practices, and of sector studies. The project will supply
energy to satisfy the rapidly rising demand in Santa Cruz, and strengthen
and expand the transm-ission syatems in the L3anta Cruz and the Cochabamba-
Oruro area.  X Credit and Project Summary -s attached as Annex III.



Project Execution
29.       To avoid a drastic worsening of the electricity service in Santa
Cruz, a timetable has been drawn up calling for the first gas turbine
unit to be installed by September 1974 and the second by the end of 1974.
Specifications and bidding documents for the expansion of the Santa Cruz
plant were drawn up in a manner satisfactory to IDA. The bids for the gas
turbines were invited in May of this year and are to be opened in the middle
of September. The line to the Viloco mines should be commissioned in early
1974; the other transmission lines and the substations should be completed
in the fall of 1975. The bidding documents for the transmission lines and
substations are being prepared by ENDE with some outside assistance.
30.       The Government would relend $5.92 million of the credit to ENDE,
which would carry out and operate its part of the project. ENDE was estab-
lished in 1965 in the form of a limited liability company. Its capital
stock is mainly held by Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (CBF), a Government-
owned development corporation.  Ex officio, the Minister of Energy and
Hydrocarbons chairs ENDE's six-man Board, consisting of three CBF Directors
and one Director each for COMIBOL, the Government-owned mining corporation,
and YPFB, the Government-owned petroleum enterprise. According to ENDE's
statutes, the chief executive is a General Manager appointed by the Board.
A decree of September 1972 vested the appointment of general managers of
Government-owned enterprises in the Ministers responsible for the respective
sectors, subject to approval by the President of the Republic. The Govern-
ment has now agreed that the General Manager of ENDE would be appointed in
accordance with the provisions of ENDE's statutes.
31.       The present General Manager is an experienced engineer and a
competent executive. Faced with some distortions in ENDE's organization
arising from rapid growth, and recognizing that continued expansion will
require structural changes to allow ENDE to conduct its operations more
efficiently, he has introduced some administrative improvements and
engaged a management consulting firm to advise on organizational matters.
That firm's recommendations in respect of operating procedures and report-
ing practices would be put into effect with the help of the consultants to
be retained under the project.
32.       The Government will pass on $80,000 of the credit to DINE, which
will be responsible for its part of the project. The terms on which the
credit proceeds are made available to DINE will be determined by the Govern-
ment. Set up as a regulatory agency for the power sector, DINE has, since
1968, administered the Electricity Code and, with the help of consultants,
drawn up the regulations implementing the provisions of the Code. While
DINE's performance has, on the whole, been satisfactory, its authority to
set up tariffs has, at times, been severely restricted by the Government.



Project Cost
33.       The cost of the proposed project is estimated at $7.3 million
equivalent, of which about $6 million is in foreign exchange and about
$1.3 million in local currency. The breakdown of the cost estimate is
given below (in US$ million)::
Foreign        Local
Exchange      Currency       Total
Santa Cruz gas turbines               3.0            0.3           3.3
Santa Cruz transmission system        o.4            0.1           065
Cochabam.ba transmission system       1.1            0.3           1.4
Office building                       0.1            0.2           0.3
Consulting services for ENDE           0.6           0.3           0.9
Consulting services for DINE          0.1            -            0.1
Contingencies                          0.7           0.1           0.8
6.o           1.3            7.3
A physical contingency allowance of 6.5 percent has been built into all
categories, except consulting services, to cover unforeseen cost increases.
An escalation contingency of 8 percent has been included to meet price
increases of imported goods, and one of 7.5 percent for local price increases.
EVDEts Finances
34.       During its eight years of existence, EIDE's finances have been
managed well.  Through Government contributions, retained earnings and
borrowing, its capitalization has increased to $32.1 million equivalent on
Decemoer 31, 1972, $16.1 million in equity and $16.0 million irn deb>t. On
the same date, gross fixed assets, including work in progress, were worth
$27.6 million equivalent.
35.       ENN'DEts equity consists of the assets of the old power division oi-
CBF, taken over in 1965, and of the proceeds of the US$10 million IDA credit
of 1964, wht^ch the Government passed on to ENDE as a capital contribution,
together wi h earned surplus and reserves. Furthernore, ENDE receives, as
a Government capital contribution, the service payments which 3PC makes semi-
annually to CBF under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement providing for the relend-
ing to PC or the proceeds of the US$5 million IDA credit of 196h. Because
of the deterioration in its :inances, BPC was not in a position to make on
due date the December 31, 1972 and June 30, 1973 service payments.   They have
now been r.ade owing to certain measures taken by the Government to remedy the
short-term position of EPC.  Practically all of ENDE's indebtedness is long-
term borrowing from IDA, the IDB and USAID, and bears interest at 1 percent
to 6.5 percent ner annum.



- 13 -
36.       An unfavorable aspect of ENDE's finances has been the accumulation
of accounts receivable in payment for electricity supplied to the Govermnent,
public entities, and the distribution companies.  At the end of 1972, these
accounts corresponded to about four months' billings. The situation has
improved in recent months and ENDE now expects to reduce its receivables to
no more than two months' billings by the end of the third quarter of 1973.
Another difficulty arose in 1970 when CBF forced ENDE to lend it, for three
months, US$250,000 and 3 million pesos, free of interest, and failed to repay
these loans. The Goverrment has now made CBF pay back the dollar loan and
a part of the peso obligation, with the balance to be fully repuid before
the end of March 1974.
37.       ENDE's earnings record is satisfactory.  With energy sales growing
at an average of 22 percent per annum from 66 Gwh in 1967 to 170 Gwh in 1972,
net operating income rose from 4.7 million pesos in 1967 to 11.1 million
pesos in 1971 and to 22.8 million pesos in 1972 after the devaluation.
Nevertheless, as a result of the rapid expansion of ENDE's facilities between
1967 and 1971, the average rate of return on assets was only 5.4 percent in
those years. In 1972, however, ENDE achieved a return exceeding the 9 percent
stipulated in the Electricity Code. Between 1973 and 1977, energy sales are
estimated to grow from 214 Gwh to 388 Gwh and net operating income from 40.3
million pesos to 71.1 million pesos. This would give ENDE an average re-tun
of 9 percent and be sufficient to make a reasonable contribution to expansion.
An obligation to maintain tariffs yielding a rate of return consistent with
the provisions of the Electricity Code has been included in the Credit and
Project Agreements. The Project Agreement also stipulates that EiNDE would
periodically revalue its assets in accordance with methods satisfactory to
IDA and DINE.
The Financing Plan
38.       IDA would finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the project,
thus providing 82 percent of the total cost. IDA would pay for domestically
produced cables, if the contract for them (expected to amount to about
$250,000 equivalent) were awarded, after international competitive bidding,
to a Bolivian producer. The proceeds of the IDA credit would be relent by
the CGovermnent to ENDE for 20 years, including a 3-year grace period, at
7-1/4 percent interest.  ENDE would cover the remaining 18 percent of the
project cost from internal cash generation. The relatively modest contri-
bution by ENDE is justified at a time when the Company is meeting from its
own resources the substantial cost overrun on the Santa Isabel plant.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       All equipment for the project would be procured, and the contracts
for erection of equipment and for the office building awarded, through
international competitive bidding. For the purpose of bid comparison, the
only local producer of cables would be accorded a 15 percent margin of



- 14 -
Dreference or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower. The estimated
rate of disbursement is shown in Annex III.  About $50,000 in retroactive
financing would be required for the study, colMMissioned in January 1973, of
the Santa Cruz expansion and for management consultants approved by IDA.
Economic Evaauation
40.       The proposed expanzsion of generation and -transmission facilities
in the Santa Cruz system is justified by the very rapid increase in demand
for energy, arising from the steady growth of population and economic
activity in the area. Demand estimates for the next five years show a
prospective increase of abou; 22 percent per annum. This arises not only
from the establishnnent of new industries, some of them serving the local
oil and gas operations, b-t also from the change-over of existing enter-
prises from costly self-generation to more economic public supply. The
economic return on the investment in the gas turbines is estimated at 9
percent, reflecting the low load factor in a system which started operat-
ing in 1970. The rate of return on the proposed transmission installations
is expected to reach 29 percent. The proposed investment represents the
least cost solution to meeting the demand for electric energy in the Santa
Cruz area.
41.       The investment in the Cochabamba-Oruro transmission system, which
is the least cost solution, is urgently needed in order to strengthen the
system, reduce transmission losses, and ensure greater continuity and nigher
quality of service in the area. Moreover, the investment would also include
the transmission line between the Santa Isabel plant anc. the Sacaba sub-
station which would be the first section of the Cochabamba-La Paz inter-
connection to be built within the next few years.
42.       The construction of a new office building, in which the activities
of E^,  would be centralized, ought to raise considerably the efficiency of
thc nanagemenr- and staff.  At present, the staff performs its duties in
three 1ocatlons in different parts of Cochabamba -with consequent loss of
tLine and effcrt.
PALRT V - LaGAL INSTRUMENTS .4ND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and
the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
Enpresa Nacional de Electricidad S. A., the Recommendation of the Committee
orovided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and
the tecxt of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
vo the E)cecutive Directors separately.  The draft Agreements conform to the
normal pattern for credit's for power projects.



- 15 -
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed

C. PROJECT3 IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 148 - Second EUDE Power Project, UStYCh million  Anril 2E, l9699
Closing Date: September 30, 197-
The Santa Isabel hydroelectric project is now expected to be
inaugurated in. Setber 1973, about 16 months late. Wnen the
nearly completed plant was undergoing tests :.n Maroh 1973,
the penstock suffered a pipe rupture.  The repairs, for Which
the pipe manufactuLrer has assumed respcnsibiiity, took four
months. The closi5ng date was recently extended unzil Sentember
30, 1974. The revised cost estimates show a project cost of
US$12.1 xillion as cuo.,pared to the orig-inal estimaate of US$10. L
million. The causes for the overruns are adverse geological
conditions in tumnelling and substantial wage increases granted
byr -the previous Government. At the revised cost, the Santa
Isabel project, is still the least-cost alternative for meeting
the load forecast for discount rates up to aboout 18 percent; this
compares very favorably with the opportunity cost of capital
in Bolivia.
Credit- 261 - Thniat, livestock Development Project, UJS$6.8 maillion1 Jane, 25,~, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After a slow start, loan approvals under the project's beef
component are pLxgressing satisfactorily.  Lending to sheep
f:armers and cooperau.ives is likely to deavelop more slowly until
the project has became rore widely known and measures relative
to land titling aad cooperctive organization have been implemented.
In view of substantial price increases in Bolivia in late 1972 and
early 1973, and i-n accordance with the provisions of' the Credit
Agreement, the C-overnment, IDA ancd Dlnco Agricola agreed at the
erLd of April 1973 to introduce indexing of loans to ranchers Which
wofl'd assure a 6 percent real rate of interest. The much delayed
study by consultants who would fomnulate recommendations for a-
npprcpriate rc   poli'cy was also launched at the end of April.
The Government is taking measures to improve the administrative
and financial cositicn of Banco Agricola which had deteriorated
during the last lb mnonths.
1/ These notes are designed to in'orm the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution,l and in particular to report any problems which
are being encountered, and thie antion being taken to remedy them. They should
be read in tn S sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 3h6 - Railway -Project, US$8 million, December 1, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975
This credit became effective on February 21, 1973. The
technical and financial rehabilitation of the Railways
(ENFE) has started. The action program is now under way,
with some delays due to slow arrival of imported materials
and equipment. The UNDP-financed technical assistance has
entered its second phase, with emphasis on the training of
staff. A revised freight tariff was introduced in mid-1972;
changes in the passenger tariff are now being studied. The
agreed financial target for 1973 will be met only when the
Government approves an aarly tariff increase. Debt service,
investment and operations have become more costly due to the
devaluation of the peso and related price increases. However,
the Government has undertaken to provide the necessary additional
funds and to authorize the tariff increase.
