F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The development objectives of the proposed project are derived from the country's
strategic plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and its effects, and for preventing the further spread
of HIV/AIDS by means of a multisectoral program approach. They are essentially similar
to those under the predecessor project. Thus, complementing the activities financed by
other sources, the purpose is to help Benin Government implement its new 2006-2010
National Strategic Framework for boosting its national response to HIV/AIDS by
contributing to increase and improve the coverage and utilization of prevention services,
treatment and care for specific high-risk and vulnerable groups. More specifically, the
project will contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and increasing utilization of
prevention services for vulnerable groups (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups
such as the commercial sex workers and staffs of some key ministries; (b) improve access
and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and affected
persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and orphans and vulnerable
children (OVC); and (c) consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring
and evaluation of the national response to HIV/AIDS for its sustainability.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

There were no changes to the original PDOs. However the baseline and target values of
several PDO-level indicators were adjusted to take into account newly available data and
the results framework was updated accordingly.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

 1.     In 2007, Benin was a very poor and highly indebted country (ranked 163rd out of 177
 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index) relying mainly on cotton exports (55.9% of
 total exports in 2007) and services sectors (mainly transit trade with Nigeria). The Gross
 National Income (GNI) per capita was US$510. Fighting poverty was the Government’s main
 objective, given that prevalence of poverty had risen from 26.5 percent in 1996 to 33.8 percent
 in 2002.

    2.     In the health sector, infectious diseases were the leading causes of deaths and accounted
    for close to 60% of consultations in health facilities. The maternal mortality ratio was about 400
    deaths per 100,000 live births while the child mortality rate reached 120 per 1000 live births. In
    other words, Benin was off track for reaching the MDGs 4 (child mortality) and 5 (maternal
    mortality). Among communicable diseases, prevalence of HIV/AIDS was low in the general
    population (i.e. 2%), but still high within some groups, such as sex workers (25.5% in 2005).
    For this reason, the epidemic was considered as “concentrated?. 1

    3.     The Government was committed to fighting HIV/AIDS and had just put out, through a
    participatory process involving the donor group and other stakeholders, its second Strategic
    Plan for Fighting HIV/AIDS covering the period 2006-2010. 2 This strategy focused on six
    strategic axes: (i) coordination, partnership and resource mobilization; (ii) preventing and
    promoting tests; (iii) access to care and treatment; (iv) support to people infected or affected by
    HIV/AIDS and respect of human rights; (v) strategic information: epidemiological and
    behavioral surveillance and research promotion and; (vi) monitoring and evaluation.

    4.    At the time of appraisal, the World Bank had just closed its SDR 17.8 million (i.e. about
    US$23 million) Multisectoral Assistance Project for the control of HIV/AIDS (MAP) and the
    Government of Benin was striving to close the financing gap to fight the epidemic. The
    HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in the general population had fallen down to 2.0% in 2006 according
    to a Sero-surveillance Report published by the National Program Against HIV/AIDS (PNLS).
    But HIV-/AIDS prevalence could be much higher in high-risk groups. For instance, among
    female sex workers, this rate was as high as 25.5%. 3 Funding the fight against HIV/AIDS

1
   According to David Wilson (2006), “an HIV epidemic is concentrated if HIV transmission is primarily attributable to HIV-
vulnerable groups and if protecting HIV-vulnerable groups would protect the wider population. In contrast, an HIV epidemic is
generalized if the converse is true – HIV transmission is not primarily attributable to HIV-vulnerable groups and protecting HIV-
vulnerable groups would not in itself protect the wider population.? (Wilson, David, “HIV epidemiology: a review of recent
trends and lessons?, Sept 2006).
2
  This second strategic plan for HIV-AIDS had roughly the same objectives as the first one. In particular, it maintained the
principle of addressing prevention and treatment at once. However, as for implementation, the second strategic plan took into
account the lessons learnt from the previous plan and especially the fact that prevention can best be delivered through NGOs
and social mobilization.
3
  This shows a decline from its 2004 level of 27.9% (the EDSB-III put this rate at 1.2 for the same year). Background studies done
for the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Project in 2005 show even higher rates for sex workers (30.1%) while for the police and military
personnel prevalence was 8%.

                                                                1
    remained a serious problem because, although funds had been pledged by development
    partners, 4 a sizeable gap (close to US$160 million) had been identified.

    5.     Beyond the need to close this funding gap, there were two main reasons for the World
    Bank to be involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Benin. The first reason was the previous
    experience gained by the Bank when it funded the first MAP in Benin (i.e. the PPLS) which had
    been set up to support the implementation of the First HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. This Project
    had shown that the WB had strong comparative advantages in designing and supporting
    multisectoral approaches and in mainstreaming and unifying coordination arrangements for the
    fight against HIV/AIDS. The PPLS was seen as a success 5 (i.e. its ICR shows that ISR ratings
    for DO and IP were consistently rated as satisfactory) and the WB presence and involvement
    was perceived as “instrumental in ensuring the effectiveness of the “Three Ones? principles?. 6
    The second reason was that the WB involvement was expected to facilitate leveraging
    additional funding for HIV/AIDS from other development partners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

    6.    As stated in the PAD, the Project was to contribute to three outcomes:
             a. strengthening access to and increasing utilization of prevention services for
                  vulnerable groups (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups such as the
                  commercial sex workers and staff of some key ministries;
             b. improve access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS
                  infected and affected persons, notably people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA),
                  and orphans and vulnerable children (OVC); and
             c. consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring and evaluation of
                  the national response to HIV/AIDS.

    7.   To reach these outcome objectives, a set of seven key indicators were defined. These are
    shown in the results framework table below.

              PDOs                                                  PDO-level indicators

  In addition to the US$ 68 million pledged by the Global Fund (until 2010), the African Development Bank (AfDB) had
committed US$ 4 million per year (until 2008), USAID US$ 7 million (until 2010), Denmark US$ 8.8 million (until 2010) and part
of the US$ 45.6 million set up by the Global Fund for the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor involving 5 countries.
5
  By achieving all its stated development objectives, this project (the PPLS) had a positive impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS in
that it built capacity in both the private and public sectors, and accelerated these sectors’ response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
Benin.
6
  The “Three Ones? principles were a set of principles for fostering aid harmonization and alignment and agreed by major HIV-
AIDS donors in 2004. The "Three Ones" principles are: (i) one agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that provides the basis for
coordinating the work of all partners; (ii) one national AIDS coordinating authority, with a broad based multi-sector mandate;
and (iii) one agreed country-level monitoring and evaluation system.

                                                                 2

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reason/justification.

 8.     There were no changes to the original PDO. During the first restructuring of the Project
 (December 21, 2010), the baseline and target values of four PDO-level indicators (numbers 1, 2,
 4 and 5) were adjusted to take into account newly available data and the results framework was
 updated accordingly The main reason for this adjustment was that most of the original baseline
 values referred to data collected in 2005 and released in 2006. As the Project became effective
 only in 2008, these baseline (and consequently target) values were mostly outdated, giving a
 picture that did not reflect the situation at the actual start of the Project. Moreover, for indicators
 number 1 and 2, the original baseline values were inconsistent, as they were higher than current
 values at restructuring. When new figures were provided by the Second Generation STD/AIDS
 Surveillance Survey (ESDG) in 2008, the Benin counterparts and the World Bank Team agreed
 during the Mid Term Review to use those figures as they were the main data source for several
 of the Project’s core indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

    9.    The individuals and organizations expected to be the primary target groups of the Project
    were (i) those at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS; and (ii) those already infected or affected
    by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. More precisely, the Project was targeting (i) vulnerable groups
    (women and youth), high risk groups (including commercial sex workers and staff of some key
    line ministries), and (ii) people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and other infected or affected
    people and orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC). Other beneficiaries were partner
    organizations (local NGOs, Ministries…), which received funding or assistance from the
    Project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

    10. The Project had three main components. The first component focused on prevention,
    while the second component concentrated on testing and treatment services. The third
    component supported Project coordination, management and M&E.

    11. Component 1: Social Mobilization and HIV Prevention Services (US$11.90
    million 7): This component was to provide funds for further scaling up of HIV/AIDS prevention
    efforts in Benin. Activities under this component were to be carried out mostly as subprojects
    by local communities, civil society and community based organizations and the private sector to
    support persons living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups such as youth, commercial sex
    workers and orphans and vulnerable children. Activities under this component also included
    psychological and economic support to infected and affected persons. These activities were
    grouped under two sub-components, namely (i) support for community and NGO prevention
    activities to encourage behavior change, and (ii) support for impact mitigation activities for
    OVCs and PLWHAs.

7
  There seems to be a little confusion in the costing related to these components as they are shown in the PAD annexes. There
are discrepancies in the document as, comparing annex 4 and 5, shows that US$ 35 million is only the baseline costs and does
not include contingencies. If, as annex 5 shows, contingencies are included, the project cost increases to reach a total of US$
37.45 million. In the annex 4 however, the total cost is US$ 36.75. The footnote to annex 5 of the PAD (page 45) does not clarify
this.

                                                               4
 12. Component 2: Access to Treatment, Care, and Impact Mitigation Services
 (US$15.40 million): This component, which was to be implemented by the PNLS, was to
 provide support to targeted activities in order for the country to achieve the goals of care and
 treatment for all people infected with HIV/AIDS, as spelled out in the 2006-2010 National
 HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework. Three main areas were to be covered under these activities:
 prevention, treatment and care.

 13. Component 3: Coordination, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
 (US$7.70 million): Under this component, the Project was to: (i) provide support for a unified
 national and decentralized coordination system and leadership; (ii) provide support for a
 uniform national monitoring and evaluation system; and (iii) provide financing for the
 coordination and management of the Project implementation unit.

1.6 Revised Components

14.    During the two restructurings, neither the Project components, nor the activities included
in each of them were revised, but allocation of funds to these different components was modified
following the changes in the allocation of proceeds, as described in the next section.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.    Implementation Arrangements. As implementation was somewhat slow during the first
years of the Project, changes were introduced in the institutional arrangements to clarify roles
between the SP/CNLS and the Project Implementing Unit (PIU). Practically, after an institutional
assessment and the Mid-Term Review, the Project Implementation Manual was revised and
expanded so as to define clearly the respective roles of the SP/CNLS and the PIU, especially
regarding procurement processes.

    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis
17.      The background analysis done for this Project was thorough. First, the Project team
benefited from various analytical reports, including the 2005 OED evaluation of the Bank
multisectoral HIV/AIDS Projects (MAP) in Africa. This report was highlighting the need to
strengthen and harmonize M&E arrangements. In addition, the Project team could draw on data
collected and analyzed during the previous MAP. It therefore built on the achievements and
lessons learned from the previous Project, the PPLS. 8 More specifically, as a continuation
Project, it drew on the PPLS’ experience in scaling up the fight against HIV/AIDS and in setting
up priorities among the national HIV/AIDS strategies and emphasized a need for cost
effectiveness and results. It also took note of the weak coordination of activities management and
M&E that were at the root of inefficiencies during the previous Project. Indeed, while the PPLS
was being executed, the PNLS and various NGOs and bilateral agencies were implementing their
own programs without coordinating with the SP/CNLS. That explains the heavy reliance put by
this new Project on the “three ones? approach. Other important lessons learned were: (i) that
community engagement for the promotion of HIV/AIDS testing was widely accepted and
generated overwhelming demand at health centers; (ii) that participatory approach worked well
by improving understanding and support and producing better action plans for operations; (iii)
that stigma reduction was possible if appropriate messages were used and disseminated, and; (iv)
that PLWHA could be reached successfully through community mobilization and use of multiple
channels.

Assessment of Project design
18.     The Project design at appraisal is deemed as appropriate. Although the design was
slightly more complex that for the PPLS, it was using only institutions that were already existing
and that had been used successfully during the PPLS. The Project departed from the PPLS only,
by helping to set up a strong SP/CNLS (and agreeing to be integrated in this structure) and a
strengthened and single M&E framework and operational plan. Conversely, it followed on that
Project’s footstep by using community mobilization and multiple channels to reach those
infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, given the success of this strategy in the previous Project.

Adequacy of Government’s commitment
19.     With strong support from the Office of the President, the Government was highly
committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS, as is shown by its increased budget allocations for the
fight against this epidemic from US$ 1.0 million in 2002 to US$ 3.6 million in 2005. By 2006 it
had established a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan ready to be tested by the new PMLS2. It also


8
 In the ICR prepared at the end of the PPLS, this previous project was considered to have attained its development objectives
and reached its outcome and output objectives. The PPLS succeeded in training 652 civil organizations, establishing 3,137
community-based groups, establishing and supporting 33 national and local associations for PPLWHA, engaging nearly all
government administrative infrastructure in the fight against HIV/AIDS, facilitating testing for 202,000 people (of whom 1,233
turned out to be seropositive), providing capacity building, equipment and ARV drugs (toward the end of the project), and
providing sensitization and other services to HIV/AIDS infected or affected staff in 40 non-health public ministries and agencies.

                                                                6
showed its commitment by fulfilling all the conditions needed to be included in the Bank’s MAP
program.

Assessment of risks
20.      The risks identified at appraisal were real and very relevant. The risk associated with a
weak M&E system was adequately assessed and addressed with relevant mitigation measures
(i.e. intense capacity building on M&E). The other main risk, relating to the staffing and
leadership capacity of the SP/CNLS, was also rightly identified at appraisal. However, during
implementation, the mitigation measures (also consisting in capacity building for the SP/CNLS)
proved to be insufficient as section 4 below shows.

2.2 Implementation

21.     Despite strong Government’s commitment and the PPLS experience, it took eight months
for the Project to become effective and implementation remained slow after effectiveness
because of major bottlenecks. The main reason for the 8 months gap between credit signature
and effectiveness has to do with delays in getting the Parliament authorization to ratify the credit
agreement. This delay was due to the strained relations between the Government and the
Parliament (in which the President did not hold a majority). As for implementation, although the
Project disbursed 97% of its budget and achieved most of its indicators, it was challenged by a
few issues: (i) the 2007 Presidential Decree on allowances (“per-diems?) to be paid to Civil
Servants attending training sessions and seminars; (ii) some conflicts originating from the
existing institutional arrangements; and (iii) procurement delays.

22.     The 2007 Presidential Decree set maximum amounts that could be paid to civil servants
as per-diems for their missions and training. Many civil servants viewed the maximum amounts
as too low. But while the Bank complied with this decree, several donors continued their past
practices of offering higher per-diems to civil servants attending their training. Thus this decree
had two unintended consequences. It reduced the motivation of health workers to attend needed
training sessions and seminars (especially those funded by the Government, which includes the
PMLS2), which slowed down Project implementation. And it was one of the root causes of
numerous strikes by health workers.

23.     Another challenge was related to the institutional arrangements between the SP/CNLS
and the Project Implementing Unit (PIU), two units that were supposed to work very closely
together. As described later in the ICR, a sort of “mission creep? occurred with the SP/CNLS, as
it increasingly tried to take more responsibilities in implementation (for instance in procurement
processes) although its role was merely one of coordination. These jurisdiction problems
between the two institutions were eventually solved by clarifying roles after a Bank-
commissioned institutional assessment prepared for the MTR.

24.     Some procurement delays were generated by the Direction Nationale de Contrôle des
Marchés Publics (National Agency for Public Procurement Control). It is important to note that
this bottleneck is not a sectoral one, but rather a national one. All Bank Projects in all sectors
have faced procurement delays because of this national agency. Also, these delays did not
prevent the Project to disburse almost all its budget.

                                                 7
25.     The Mid-Term Review took place in January 2010. Despite some implementation issues
(which were discussed with the Government), the MTR concluded that the Project was making
satisfactory progress both on PDOs and implementation. Indeed, at MTR stage, the Project had a
disbursement rate close to 50%. No restructuring was therefore proposed at this stage, but the
Bank asked the Government to prepare a document spelling out clearly the respective
responsibilities of the SP/CNLS and the PIU.

26.     The Project was restructured twice during its implementation phase. The first
restructuring, made after the mid-term review, was triggered by the recent availability of the
findings from the 2008 Second Generation STD/AIDS Surveillance Survey (ESDG). The
restructuring was signed on December 21, 2010 and involved adjusting the PDO indicator values
to factor in the newly available data from the 2008 ESDG. It also included a reallocation of the
proceeds of the Credit to take into account, among other things, the fact that expenses under
some categories had been overdrawn to face higher levels of spending (for rehabilitation works,
equipment and other types of expenditures) and a depreciation of the dollar. This reallocation
also took into account the fact that only about a third of the funds set aside for the Project
preparation (PPF) were actually spent.

27.     A second restructuring occurred on June 10 2011 and involved another reallocation of the
proceeds and an extension of the closing date of the Project (from December 2011 to June 2012).
At this time, the Project had disbursed 80% of its credit. The restructuring was merely a reshuffle
of funds between the different disbursement categories in favor of medical equipment, drugs and
reagents with the aim of giving the Government the means to scale up the implementation of
Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT). To compensate for this increase, and to
take into account the government’s new strategy of better targeting of high risk groups and
putting the focus on quality rather than quantity, cuts were made on the grants to civil society
organizations and community-based organizations categories. The Project extension by six
months was to give the Project enough time to complete activities that were critical to reach the
end targets, especially those related to the only indicator that was lagging behind, the prevention
of the mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

28.    Tremendous efforts were made to ensure that Monitoring and Evaluation was one of the
strongest assets of this Project. These efforts have been mostly successful, although some
weaknesses are still present.

M&E Design

29.     The Project fully supported the recently validated national M&E framework. As
mentioned earlier, for the sake of harmonization and alignment, the Bank agreed at appraisal to
use the national M&E framework, notwithstanding that some capacity building was still
necessary (and was included in the Project). A performance indicator tracking table was designed
for the Project to show the expected evolution of indicators over the course of the Project, the
data collection instruments, the frequency of the reports and the institution responsible for the

                                                8
data collection. These national M&E indicators were to be reviewed annually. M&E specialists
were to be deployed at the national and decentralized levels and an array of approaches was
defined to collect routine data and to support epidemiological surveillance and operations
research focusing on at-risk populations. The SP/CNLS (at the national level) and the CDLS and
CCLS (at the decentralized level) were to be responsible for implementing and coordinating this
system. At appraisal, the capacities of these entities were assessed as weak, which explains why
the Component 3 included capacity building for the M&E system. As stated in the PAD, the
M&E of progress toward Project objectives was to rely on “a combination of routine health
services data collected at the national and decentralized levels, monitoring data on HIV/AIDS
program activities, periodical behavioral and surveillance surveys and periodic surveys on the
coverage and quality of services?.

M&E Implementation

30.     During implementation, M&E was the only field that has been constantly rated as
Satisfactory in the ISRs (except during the Mid-term Review when it was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory because some indicators had to be clarified and better tied to activities,
therefore generating a new results framework). Afterwards, M&E was consistently rated as
Satisfactory.

M&E Utilization

31.     Information collected by the M&E system was very useful to Project managers and to the
Bank team as it provided real time data, thus allowing some change in Project proceeds after the
mid-term review. Produced data induced a focus on more efficient interventions like those
targeting high-risk groups. As mentioned previously, routine data provided by the M&E system
showed the need to review and clarify indicators and better tie them to proceeds.

32.     One challenge faced with the M&E system was regarding the collection of data from
households 9 and from specific population groups. As such, the first three PDO indicators
pertaining to specific groups were best monitored through data collected by an independent
survey (i.e. the Second Generation STD/HIV-AIDS Survey or ESDG). It is worth noting that, in
this ICR, when data was available for these indicators from both the ESDG and the DHS, the
ICR team retained the DHS numbers. Although ESDGs are usually reliable because of their
focus on data collection among high risk groups, the 2012 ESDG encountered difficulties related
to organizational issues with data collection and problems in the analysis and interpretation of
collected data that made the reliability of its results questionable to all the sectors’ stakeholders.

33.    The decision to use the DHS data explains why the ICR is produced 12 months after the
closing date of the Project since the ICR team had to wait for the final results of the 2012 DHS

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

9
  Data for households is best obtained with very large surveys, such as DHS. DHS findings are always the most reliable ones, due
to their very large sample size (about 17,000 households for a DHS versus 4,000 for an ESDG).

                                                               9
34.      Based on the Bank policy on safeguards, the Project triggered BP/OP 4.01 on
environmental assessment. The existing medical waste management plan (MWMP) was updated
and used for this Project. While activities to be funded by the Project were not expected to cause
any harm to the environment, in order to make sure that any potential risk was mitigated, the
borrower assigned an environmental health specialist with responsibility for following up on the
recommendations made by the MWMP. Also, to mitigate the risks inherent to biomedical waste,
the Project (i) provided 24 Montfort type incinerators and 2 large electric incinerators for health
facilities generating large quantities of biomedical waste; (ii) trained 253 health auxiliaries in the
management of biomedical waste; and (iii) printed and distributed training documents pertaining
to the management of such waste. Furthermore, the Project organized - in conjunction with the
Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Organization - a regional dissemination workshop for the simplified
waste management manual in the 5 countries involved in the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor. Overall,
no environmental issue occurred during the Project’s implementation.

Fiduciary Compliance

      a. Financial Management Issues

35.    The initial intent was to use the Country Financial Management System (CFMS) and
Standard Public Expenditures Procedures (SPEP) for this Project and to have it audited
externally by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). However, as the PAD stated “it is uncertain
how the Country FM will be implemented?. Due to the risk presented by the slowness of
implementation of the CFMS and the fact that the SAI was not yet accustomed to the Bank audit
procedures, mitigating measures had to be taken before these two issues were fully resolved.

36.    The main mitigating measure was to ensure the PMLS2 would, like other HIV/AIDS
Projects/programs, have its own FM system in line with other IDA financed Projects. For audit
purpose, an independent accredited auditing firm was contracted for the first two years.

37.     During Project implementation, financial management complied with Bank policies and
procedures and was always rated satisfactory, except in two instances. At the end of 2008, some
weaknesses in the organization of accounting tasks and in the follow up of advanced funds to
certain institutions 10 were observed and quickly addressed by the PMLS2. In addition, some
expenditures were deemed to be ineligible by an audit conducted in 2009 (for the 2008 fiscal
year). The US$ 28,000 that had been unduly spent on gasoline was subsequently refunded by the
Government.

      b. Procurement Issues

38.    Procurement Plans have been regularly prepared by the PIU and the hiring of a
Procurement Specialist at the beginning of the Project helped to successfully implement these
plans. Procurement was closely monitored as each Bank supervision mission included a
procurement specialist. Post reviews carried out by the Bank team generally concluded that Bank

10
     For instance, delays ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months, instead of the 72 hours mentioned in the Manual of Procedures.

                                                              10
policies and procedures were properly followed. However, the Project experienced some delays
in its procurement processes.

39.     While the Project disbursed 97% of its funds, it encountered procurement delays, due to
tensions between the SP/CNLS and the PIU on one hand; and long delays in approval by the
Direction Nationale de Contrôle des Marchés Publics (National Agency for Public Procurement
Control). Jurisdiction problems between the SP/CNLS and the PIU were eventually solved by
clarifying roles after a Bank-commissioned institutional assessment. Regarding the second
factor, lengthy procurement delays, a common problem in Benin, slowed down the delivery of
drugs, equipment and medical supplies on occasions, thus affecting progress under component 2
of the Project. It has also at times delayed the hiring of critically needed staff (for instance M&E
specialists, database and procurement officers) or the delivery of equipment like mobile
laboratories. Near the end of the Project however, these delays were drastically cut as the
approval process by the Direction Nationale de Contrôle des Marchés Publics dropped to 2
weeks instead of up 4 to 12 weeks as previously experienced.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.     While the Bank has no plan for a next phase, the Global Fund has ramped up its financial
support to the national HIV-AIDS strategy so that there is no funding gap (see section 4 for
financial details). Furthermore, institutional arrangements which the Bank-financed Project
helped to set up are still in place and will profoundly help in controlling the spread of HIV-AIDS
in the future.

41.      For instance, the “Three Ones? system is now fully operational and partners have all
subscribed to it, therefore intervening within one strategy framework coordinated by one
institution (the SPCNLS) and using one single M&E system. The Bank-financed Project has also
strengthened institutions that are key in the fight against HIV/AIDS and will be essential in
furthering the progress already made. At the government level, it has helped strengthen the
capacity of the SP/CNLS (both at the central and regional levels); the Project has helped
Ministries elaborate action plans that can be used in the future; it has also strengthened the
capacity of health facilities to provide services needed to fight the propagation of HIV/AIDS, by
providing technical equipment , rehabilitating physical facilities, training staff; it has increased
the overall testing capacity by decentralizing laboratory activities, through the provision of
mobile laboratories and by rehabilitating the national reference laboratory; it has strengthened
the SIDAG and transformed it into a national reference and training center to be used by other
Voluntary Counseling Centers in the country; finally, it has strengthened the biomedical waste
management capacity through the provision of incinerators and septic tanks to health facilities.
For community social mobilization, the Bank-financed Project has also strengthened the
institutional and technical capacities in community organizations, CSOs and various HIV/AIDS
related associations. Even if the Bank does not continue its presence in the fight against
HIV/AIDS in Benin, by contributing to these arrangements and by strengthening these public
and non-public institutions, it has left a long-lasting mark in the fight against this epidemic in
Benin, and has left institutions and a setting that will be used in the future to more effectively
control the spread of HIV/AIDS.

3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

Relevance of Objectives

42.     Relevance of objectives is rated as highly satisfactory. The PDOs are fully in line with
the existing national HIV/AIDS strategy as well as the national health strategy plan and the Bank
Country Assistance Strategy. They are also consistent with the current evidence-based
recommendations at global level. In particular, these global recommendations insist on (i)
supporting both prevention and treatment; and (ii) focusing on vulnerable and high-risk groups in
countries of low-intensity epidemic like Benin. For the latter, the available evidence in Benin
confirms that HIV prevalence levels have been 10 to 20 times higher among female sex workers
than among women in the general population. Prevalence is also several-fold higher among male
clients of female sex workers than among men in the general population. Therefore, targeting of
female sex workers is essential for preventing the spread of HIV in the general population.

Relevance of Design and Implementation

43.     Relevance of design and implementation is deemed as satisfactory. The Project
benefited from lessons drawn from the previous Project (the PPLS) and therefore was built
around a unique coordinating body (the SP/CNLS), developed a strong M&E system and heavily
used community mobilization and multiple channels to reach beneficiaries. As this approach was
recommended when faced with a HIV/AIDS concentrated epidemic 11 , the Project was well
suited in choosing HIV prevention policies focused on changing sexual behavior patterns in
high-risk groups and in the general population, particularly focusing on reducing multiple and
concurrent partnerships, as well as other prevention technologies. The only point in the design
where flaws could be traced is in the institutional arrangements that were initially set up, and
specifically, the definition of roles between the SP/CNLS and the PIU. This reduced the
synergies that could have been brought by these 2 entities working closely together.

Overall Relevance

44.    Considering both the high relevance of objectives and the adequate relevance of design
and implementation, the overall relevance is rated as satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

  See in Mishra S, Sgaier SK, Thompson LH, Moses S, Ramesh BM, et al. (2012) HIV Epidemic Appraisals for Assisting in the Design of Effective
Prevention Programmes: Shifting the Paradigm Back to Basics. PLoS ONE 7(3): e32324. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032324.

                                                                      12
45.     As the HIV/AIDS Control Strategy framework was a national endeavor involving many
partners and stakeholders, the achievement of development objectives cannot be attributed solely
to the World Bank Project, but it nevertheless provided a sizeable portion of the funds used to
implement the strategy. With US$ 35 million, the World Bank was the second financier behind
the Global Fund (in addition to the US$ 68 million pledged until 2010, this institution also
provided US$ 45.6 million to be shared between 5 countries, including Benin, in the Abidjan-
Lagos Corridor Project). Other financiers included the USAID with US$ 7 million until 2010, the
AfDB with a commitment of US$ 4 million per year until 2008 and Denmark with US$ 8.8
million until 2010. More importantly, while the Global Fund has been mostly funding treatment
costs, the Bank was the main financier for prevention costs. Therefore, most of the results
achieved in prevention (i.e. Component 1) can be reasonably attributed to the Bank Project.

46.     Out of the seven PDO indicators, five have surpassed their target values and two have not
(but have come very close, as one reached a 94% achievement rate while the other reached 83%).
The overall rating given to the “Achievement of Project Development Objectives? was not only
based on the success in reaching the revised PDO indicator targets of the Project. As these
indicators were modified during the 2010 restructuring, the ICR guidelines recommendation to
do a split evaluation was followed as is shown further below.

47.     The weighted rating (based on the respective disbursement levels) of the achievement of
PDO indicators at the time of restructuring and at the end of the Project is presented in table 3.
At the time of the 2010 restructuring, available data show that three out of four PDO indicators
had achieved their targets, and only one had not. For the other 3 PDO indicators (PDO indicators
1, 2 and 3), data was not available for measurement, before the 2012 ESDG, which was to be
done at the end of 2011. If the focus is put on the intermediate indicators, the picture becomes
even brighter (see below).

PDO-LEVEL INDICATORS

PDO 1: Strengthen access and utilization of prevention services for vulnerable groups
(women, youth, etc…) and the high-risk groups (such as the commercial sex workers and the
staff of key line ministries).

48.     PDO 1 achievement is rated Highly Satisfactory, given that two indicators met their
targets and one only partially met its target. The component 1 was addressing this first PDO: To
that end, the component 1 was mostly supporting more than two thousand subprojects managed
by communities and local NGOs. Most of these subprojects consisted in (i) carrying out
behavioral change activities for young people and women, and (ii) distributing about 5 million
condoms. Prevention plans from 12 Ministries were also funded. Radio stations were also
supported for disseminating messages on HIV/AIDS prevention.
Three indicators were proposed for assessing progress regarding this PDO:
-       Percentage of young women and men aged 15 -24 who both correctly identify ways of
preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV

intercourse with a nonregular partner in the last 12 months) (UNGASS).
-       Percentage of sex workers who report using a condom with their most recent client
(UNGASS).

49.     PDO indicator one: Percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 who both correctly
identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions
about HIV transmission in the last 12 months. The ICR Team considers that this indicator met
its target. Although there are two sources of data for this indicator (ESDG-2012 and DHS), the
ICR team retained the one produced by the DHS, because of its higher accuracy and because of
the many problems linked to this specific ESDG. The preliminary results from the DHS (the
2011-2012 EDS-MICS-B IV) provide an estimate of 67.6%, much higher than the target value
(45%). 12 Note also that this indicator reflects the impact of the Project on access to prevention
services, while indicators 2-3 (use of condoms) and 6 (testing) correspond to utilization of these
services. This achievement of this PDO-level target can be linked to the outputs of Component 1,
whose activities (i.e. outreach and IEC programs) have reached more than 5.5 million individuals
(which is almost the entire targeted population in Benin).

50.     PDO indicator two: Percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 reporting the use
of a condom during the last sexual intercourse with a non-regular or non-cohabitating partner
(of those reporting sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner in the last 12 months). With a
percentage level of 68.1% reported by the 2012 ESDG, this indicator met its target. This
achievement can be explained by the Project activities, which has distributed about 7.6 million
condoms, as well as funded massive communication campaigns (as seen earlier).

51.     PDO indicator three: Percentage of sex workers who report using a condom with their
most recent client. This indicator, computed at 84.9% at the end of the Project, did not meet its
target of 90% according to Project figures and the 2012 ESDG results. One can nevertheless see
that the Project misses this target by a very thin margin. Indeed, although using a slightly
modified indicator, a PSI report 13 shows this number to be consistently above 90% (91.7% for
2007, 92.3% for 2009, and 94.6% for 2011). These PSI numbers would tend to show that the
target has been reached.

The Project (with its Component 1) was indeed focusing on this high-risk group. This group
benefited not only from massive distribution of condoms (see supra), but also from about 50
subprojects targeting female sex workers on better awareness regarding HIV-AIDS.




12
   The indicator measured by the DHS is a close proxy of the PDO indicator given that it measures the percentage of women and
men aged 15-24 who know that using a condom and reducing the number of sexual contacts to those with one non-infected
partner can reduce the risk of contracting HIV. Note that the other source of data (2012 ESDG) gave an actual percentage of
14.7. However, during the workshop held in November 2012, the accuracy of the numbers produced by the 2012 ESDG were
widely criticized by stakeholders and members of the PIU.

PDO 2: Improve access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and
affected persons, notably the persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and Orphans and
Vulnerable Children (OVC).

52.     PDO 2 achievement is rated Satisfactory, given that two indicators met their targets and
one did not. The component 2 was focusing on the second PDO and funded a wide array of
activities for strengthening delivery of HIV/AIDS treatment and care, including (i) the support of
dozens of health facilities for improving PLWHA care, (ii) purchase and distribution of ARVs,
and (iii) training for health workers.
Three indicators were used for monitoring progress on that PDO:
-       Percentage and number of people with advanced HIV infection receiving antiretroviral
combination therapy. (UNGASS).
-       Percentage and number of pregnant women receiving a complete course of antiretroviral
prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT (UNGASS).
-       Number and Percentage of persons aged 15 and older who undergo HIV voluntary
counseling and testing in the last 12 months and know the results.

53.      PDO indicator four: Percentage and number of people with advanced HIV infection
receiving anti-retroviral combination therapy. This indicator surpassed its target by 7%, under
the assumption that only the aggregated value of the indicator is to be taken into account. It
should also be mentioned here that the revised target was 475% higher than the initial one, and
still the target was reached. 14 This result can be safely attributed to the Project, given that the
recipients of ARV drugs were tracked by the PMLS2. Indeed, the Project records mention that
25,522 patients with advanced HIV infection had received ARV drugs through the PMLS2.

54.     PDO indicator five: Percentage and number of HIV-infected pregnant women receiving a
complete course of antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT. This indicator did
not reach its target value. Conflicting numbers were produced for this indicator, as the latest
ISR mentions an actual value of 6,654 drawn from the December 2011 Project Report while the
PNLS-generated “Annuaire Statistique Provisoire 2011? shows it to be 1,560 (58%). This latter
figure, which also appears in the Beneficiary ICR, was confirmed by the PIU during the ICR
mission to Benin. There is no actual percentage available at the end of the Project for comparison
purpose. Note that this indicator is the only one that has been lagging throughout the Project
implementation.

55.    PDO indicator six: Number and percentage of persons aged 15 and older who undergo
HIV voluntary counseling and testing in the last 12 months and know the results. This indicator
surpassed its target by about 176% (1,035, 740 for a target of 375,000). In comparison to the
other PDO-level indicators, this last result is more difficult to attribute to the Project itself. One
can only conclude that this result may be partially explained by the communications efforts


14
   This conclusion has to be qualified however by the fact that both the baseline and target values for this indicator had two
groups to monitor, adults and children. Only one aggregated number (including both adults and children) was given at the end
of the project. In September 2011, 19,279 adults were already receiving ARV therapy, it is not too far-fetched to assume that
this number did not increase by more than 1,500 in one quarter (October to December 2011), thus leaving children to be the
remaining 2,000 people receiving ARV therapy.

                                                             15
financed by the PMLS2, efforts that have reached about 5.5 million people in the country and
that may have lured them to ask for counseling and testing.

PDO 3: Consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring & evaluation of the
national response to HIV/AIDS for its sustainability.

56.     PDO 3 achievement is rated as Highly Satisfactory, as its indicator fully met its target.
The component 3 was set up to contribute to the third PDO and supported various activities for
(i) strengthening the SP/CNLS (rehabilitation, office equipment, vehicles), (ii) supporting the
national M&E system (IT consultants, training, equipment), and (iii) covering the operating costs
of the Project.
One indicator was used for assessing the progress made towards this PDO.

57.    PDO indicator seven: Annual joint reviews and work planning exercise by all donors
(under the coordination of SP/CNLS). This indicator fully met its target. As noted earlier, the
PMLS2 has been instrumental in fostering the implementation of the “Three Ones? approach and
can therefore be credited for this achievement.

INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

58.     All intermediate outcome indicators have reached their revised targets. For Component 1
(Social mobilization and HIV prevention services), all four indicators reached their revised
targets; at restructuring however, one of the indicators (the number of female and male condoms
distributed) did not meet its target. 15 A possible explanation was that the target was unrealistic.

15
 To determine the target values at the time of restructuring, expected annual values shown in the PAD were used to estimate
what these values should be.

                                                            17
This explains why this target value was lowered by two third at restructuring. For Components 2
(Access to treatment, care and impact mitigation services) and 3 (Coordination, management and
M&E), all indicators met their target (both compared to original and revised ones). 16

59.    Thus, as is shown in the table below, by factoring in results from both the PDO and
Intermediate indicators, the ICR team concludes by rating the achievement of objectives as
Satisfactory.

  A possible question is whether the revised targets for this Project were not set too low. Without being able to confirm with
certainty that it was not the case, the ICR team believes that the fact that all Intermediate Outcomes indicators have been
reached (whether the original or the revised targets are used) suggests that the revision of targets was done in a realistic and
honest way.

                                                              18
3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The interventions funded by the Project are among the most cost-effective ones for
fighting HIV-AIDS. Most of these interventions are indeed part of the Copenhagen Consensus
(which rigorously estimates the most cost-effective interventions in development aid). 17 Also,
there is a very strong body of evidence confirming that interventions focusing on sex workers.
(and more generally on high-risk groups) are the most cost-effective ones against HIV-AIDS.
For instance, Hogan and others (2005 18 ) found that these interventions (i.e. focusing on sex
workers) have an average cost US$3-US$4 for one averted DALY 19, while other interventions
(such as school based education) require at least US$400-US$500 for one averted DALY.

61.     As for the efficiency of the interventions as implemented by the Project, HIV/AIDS
interventions have been implemented by the Project in a very efficient way, thanks to the
following factors: (i) the Project did not create any new entity but rather built on existing ones.
For instance, advocacy on HIV/AIDS was done through contracting with communities and
existing NGOs; (ii) partnerships with local councils have been fostered, not only for efficiency
but also for sustainability; (iii) the Project has implemented some “task-shifting? 20 to increase
the capacities of existing health workers (i.e. nurses) for providing high-quality HIV/AIDS
treatment. A much less efficient way would have been the recruitment of new health workers,
such as doctors; and (iv) grants have been managed more efficiently than during the previous
HIV/AIDS Project, as evidenced by the evaluation of AGeFIB’s performance in 2010, which
concluded that the grants were adequately managed.

62.     A study, commissioned by the Bank in 2011, explored the cost-effectiveness of the
services provided by the Project to sex workers. The study found that the average cost per
reached sex worker (including testing and preventive treatment) was about US$107 and was
therefore in line with the costs observed in other similar Projects. 21 Similarly, the study found
that the average cost per sex worker visit (supported by the Project) in a health care facility was
about US$28 and that this average cost was similar to the costs faced by other donors in Benin
and was even lower than for similar Projects elsewhere (for instance, lower than the US$36 for a
Project in India). Also, Project’s operating costs accounted for less than 14% of the total Project
costs, which is a reasonable ratio (and better than the previous HIV/AIDS Project, where the
percentage was 19%).


17
   The 2004 Copenhagen Consensus rated “control of HIV-AIDS? as the most cost-effective intervention, compared to other
interventions in health and other economic sectors.

   Task-shifting means that, instead of training new highly skilled (and expensive) health workers (such as doctors), existing (and
lower skilled) health workers are trained to be able to perform selected procedures. This approach has been extensively used in
the field of HIV-AIDS.

63.     As for the overall economic analysis (see annex 3), it could not be updated, because of a
lack of data. However, the ICR team has been able to verify that the assumptions made by this
analysis at Appraisal turned out to be correct. That further supports the conclusion that the
interventions funded by the Project were highly cost-effective.

64.      For all these reasons, efficiency is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome rating

Rating: Satisfactory

65.   Considering the substantial rating for relevance, achievement of objectives and efficiency
shown by this Project, the overall outcome is rated Satisfactory by the ICR team.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social development

66.     The Project, by reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and by providing treatment to those
infected by HIV/AIDS, has likely helped reduce catastrophic health expenditures and thus reduce
poverty. Furthermore, by funding income-generating activities, it has given those infected or
affected by HIV/AIDS the mean to provide for themselves, therefore reducing poverty. Indeed,
the Project has funded 88 subprojects for helping PLWHA to start or continue income generating
activities.

67.     High focus was put on high-risk groups like female sex workers and schoolgirls. Indeed,
as the most at-risk group and the group with the highest prevalence in the population, female sex
workers received special attention from the Project.

68.    Finally, the PMLS2 has provided significant support to Orphan and Vulnerable Children
(OVCs). For instance, it has funded 8 training facilities for OVCs so that they could still benefit
from schooling.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

69.    The Project was instrumental in implementing the “Three Ones? approach and therefore
has helped in improving aid harmonization and alignment in Benin. In particular, the Project
supported the strengthening of the SP/CNLS and its decentralized units (such as the communal

                                                  20
and departmental committees for the fight against HIV/AIDS) with equipment (computers,
vehicles, etc.), training, studies and offices (only for the S/CNLS). It also posted M&E
specialists in the departmental committees and focal points in all 77 communal committees.
Thanks to this support, the SP/CNLS is now fully considered as the coordinating body for the
fight against HIV/AIDS. Similarly, the national M&E is recognized by all donors, who are much
less often setting up their own M&E arrangements.

70.     In the 2012 Beneficiary Survey, carried out by the Project, institutional partners (like the
UFLS, the PNLS, the AGeFIB, personnel in health facilities, CD/CNLS, CC/CNLS and
managers of deconcentrated technical services) appreciated and recognized the PMLS II as a
Project that came to bridge the gap in the fight against HIV/AIDS. They felt that their
collaboration with the Project had been very good and that the Project intervention approach had
been very efficient. Regarding direct beneficiaries, 68% of those interviewed were positively
satisfied with the quality of services provided to fight HIV/AIDS with the main reasons given
being the regularity of IEC actions (for 83% of them), the free provision of condoms (72%) and
the efficiency of STI treatments. Furthermore, 76%, 74% and 67% of those interviewed were
satisfied respectively with (i) PMTCT; (ii) screening/IEC and promotion of condoms; and (iii)
access, care and socioeconomic support received.

71.     During the stakeholders’ workshop, the message relayed by beneficiaries to the team was
that the WB was funding services, such as prevention, that other partners did not care to cover
and that, without these services, gains that have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS would
quickly be lost.

4. Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome


Risk to Development Outcome is rated as Moderate

72.    The main risk to the sustainability of development outcome is related to the funding of
the national HIV-AIDS strategy. Some stakeholders have indeed expressed concerns that the
absence of a follow-up to the Bank Project would jeopardize the sustainability of the Project’s
achievements. For the period 2012-2016, the Government has estimated its essential funding
needs at about US$120 million. The Government has received two installments from the Global
Fund: a US$60 million grant, complemented by an additional US$80 million grant.
Consequently, there is no funding gap for the HIV-AIDS strategy in Benin.

73.     Furthermore, as is shown on the Grant Agreements it signed with three institutions in
Benin (the PNLS, Plan Benin and the Industrial and Building Electricity Company [SEIB], the
Global Fund financing greatly reduces the “programmatic? risk. This is the risk, mentioned by
beneficiaries, that programs that were covered mostly or solely by the Bank funding would cease
to exist once the Project was over. The Global Fund financing not only continues covering


                                                21
activities it was previously funding, but also takes over most prevention activities previously
funded by the Bank. For instance, one of the goals of the Grant Agreement with the SEIB is to
“reduce the risks of HIV transmission in the general population, among women and key high risk
populations by intensifying the prevention interventions? while another is to “strengthen the HIV
prevention interventions at the workplace, including apprentice programme workplaces?. In the
Grant Agreement signed with the Ministry of Health (i.e. through the PNLS), one objective is
“strengthening the access and quality of the services of counseling and testing, prevention of
HIV Mother-to-Child Transmission and blood transfusion safety?. In the Grant Agreement with
Plan Benin one of the objectives is “to reinforce social mobilization and communication
interventions for the fight against HIV/AIDS among women, adolescents and young people and
key populations with a high risk of HIV infection?. The key high-risk groups will therefore be
covered by the Global Fund financing.

74.      Another risk to development outcome is the institutional risk. The experience with the
SP/CNLS has left stakeholders wondering if that institution’s perceived weaknesses would not
have a negative impact on the achievements made by the Project. By doing an institutional
assessment, the Project has been able to define better how responsibilities were to be split
between the different stakeholders. The Project has also strengthened institutions, including the
SP/CNLS (both at the central and departmental levels). In so doing, it has considerably lowered
the institutional risk that the achievements made by the Project would not be sustained. In light
of all this, the risk to development outcome is rated as Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance



5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

75.      The Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated as Satisfactory. As
mentioned previously, the background analysis done by the Bank for this Project was thorough
and the Project was strategically highly relevant to the situation of Benin at the time. The results
framework was complete, although time showed later that the values of some of the baseline
indicators were not properly assessed. Technical aspects were well covered and took into account
lessons learned from the predecessor Project (the PPLS). As this was a follow-up to the PPLS (a
Project which has been rated satisfactory in its ICR), the Bank made sure not only to keep the
same Project format but also to fine tune it by taking into account all the lessons drawn from the
PPLS. Specifically, it made sure that community mobilization would be used as the preferred
means to reach people affected or infected by HIV/AIDS. Safeguards were properly assessed and
mitigation measures well defined. Institutional aspects were properly assessed and potential
issues identified, specially the one relating to the leadership role of the SP/CNLS. Among those
institutional aspects, using a private Financial Management Agency (which had been used in the
PPLS), the AGeFIB, to manage the downstream flow of funds, thus relieving the PIU of a
cumbersome task, was a very good idea. As for the M&E design, the Bank invested heavily
                                                22
(both in time and resources) in the design of a single and efficient system that was to be used by
all stakeholders in the spirit of the WHO-backed “Three Ones? approach. This focus on a single
and national strengthened Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system draws its origin from the
PPLS experience. Risk assessment was well done and provided proper mitigation measures,
although in the end these proved insufficient. The Bank input and processes was of high quality
as it brought in a strong multidisciplinary team and worked closely with all stakeholders to make
sure that this Project would achieve its planned development objectives.

   (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

76.     The Quality of Supervision is rated as Satisfactory. The Bank made sure that each of its
supervision missions would involve at least one specialist in each of the fiduciary topics
(Financial Management and Procurement). Regular fiduciary reviews were held during the
course of the Project and training was suggested for stakeholders involved in the Project when
insufficiencies were detected. When the Project progress warranted it, it also brought other
specialists to focus on removing the bottlenecks. For instance it brought an environmental
specialist when the institution in charge of the management of biomedical waste showed its
limitations. It was also very quick to identify the lack of clarity in the way responsibilities were
shared between the SP/CNLS and the PIU in the Project implementation (it did mention it as
early as in its June 2008 mission aide-memoire, less than 6 months after Project effectiveness). It
repeatedly brought the issue to the authorities and facilitated its resolution by bringing in an
external consultant to do an institutional review in order to solve the problems that were slowing
down the Project. The Bank used the Mid-term review to bring corrective measures to various
issues, such as the lack of precision in some indicators or the lack of balance in the initial
allocation of funds to Project categories. The Bank was also quick to track, highlight and suggest
corrective measures when needed. For instance, near the end of the Project, it suggested
changing the focus to at-risk groups like sex workers and the youth and re-allocating funds
accordingly. On another instance, when there was slow progress on the implementation of the
safeguard issue, it took the initiative to suggest corrective measures (such as outsourcing key
activities to the civil society and the private sector) that, once applied, brought the situation back
to normal.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

77.   In view of the ratings for the Quality at Entry and the Quality of Supervision, the Overall
Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.




                                                 23
5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.       Government Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. On one hand, the
Government was able, during the design stage, to create the conditions for a strong and unified
M&E system and to support the preparation of one Strategic Plan to which all stakeholders
aligned themselves. In doing so, it created the basis needed for the Project to succeed and for
activities to be scaled up in the future if and when funding becomes available. On the other hand,
the Government was unable to remove key bottlenecks encountered during Project
implementation. The Project took 8 months to become effective due to strained relations between
the Government and the Parliament. Once the Project became effective, the Government chose to
change the Permanent Secretary of the CNLS twice instead of tackling more upfront the
institutional problem. It did not fully support the strengthening of the capacity of the CNLS.

79.     Other Government’s responsibilities that had a bearing on the Project. While it deposited
the counterpart fund in an account to be used for the payment of civil servants involved in the
Project at the SP/CNLS, the initial funds could not be used as the “Arrêtés? needed to use them
took time to be signed by the Government. Around that same vein, was the 2007 Presidential
Decree on allowances given to civil servants attending seminars and other training sessions. This
Decree, which among other things caused strikes from Ministry of Health staff, also had the
undesired effect of keeping staff away from training needed to implement Project activities.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.    Performance of the main Implementing Agency, the PIU, is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Under adverse circumstances due to not clearly defined share of roles and
responsibilities with the SP/CNLS, the PIU was able to steer the Project and remove many
bottlenecks. Project management was rated less than satisfactory after the first year of
implementation due to the tensions with the SP/CNLS on acquiring equipment, medical supplies
and hiring needed staff and problems caused by other Government institutions (that delayed the
purchase of goods, medical equipment, drugs and reagents). The Project management rating was
upgraded after changes were implemented following the mid-term review and the institutional
assessment.

81.     Performance of the AGeFIB is rated as Satisfactory. This Financial Management
Agency which piloted the implementation of Component 1 did very well in managing the
funding provided for sub-Projects to civil society organizations, community-based organizations
NGOs and private sector companies that were supporting people living with HIV/AIDS, at-risk
groups like orphans, youth, women, sex workers, and in providing support to infected and
affected people. Most of the achievements under this component can be linked to the AGeFIB.



                                               24
   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     In view of the Moderately Unsatisfactory performance of the Government and the
Moderately Satisfactory Performance of Implementing Agencies, Overall Borrower Performance
is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The justification is that the implementing agencies (PIU
and AGeFIB) have played a much more important role in the implementation of the Project that
the Government had. A higher weight is therefore given to their rating.

6 Lessons Learned


Wide general application

83.      Monitoring indicators based on household data is always challenging and innovative
solutions should be used. Even a very strong (routine) M&E system will have difficulties in
collecting reliable data at household level. Such data is best collected through very large surveys,
like DHS. But DHS are typically done only every 5 years. A long-term solution is to
institutionalize annual “mini-DHS?. Senegal is currently implementing this approach. Another
solution is to use survey techniques such as LQAS (Lot Quality Assurance Sampling). Such
surveys should have been planned, financed and carried out under the Project.

84.    It is crucial to express effectiveness conditions in precise terms in order to avoid
loopholes that can jeopardize Project implementation. This was the case for the counterpart funds
that were to be made available to cover top-ups for civil servants involved in the Project.
Although the effectiveness condition was met, as the funds were set aside by the GoB as
required, the laws that were to make them readily available to health staff took a very long time
to be signed by the Government. These laws should have been included in the effectiveness
condition.

85.    Having a thorough understanding of HIV/AIDS epidemic dynamics by population group
and geographic areas is a mandatory pre-requirement to design programs and invest resources
where they can achieve the highest impact.

86.    The selection of indicators in the results framework needs to be aligned with the likely
major contribution made by the Bank resources, following the results chain. In this Project, while
most of the prevention activities target sex workers, their clients and partners, outcome indicators
measure behavior change in young population. As this behavior change is the result of a
combination of programs and interventions, it is impossible to attribute it to one specific
program, although this program may have been the main contributor.

Project specific




                                                25
87.     Using a fiduciary agency to manage the subproject component can be the key to
successful implementation as it leaves the PIU free to concentrate on coordination instead of
getting involved in a field for which it does not have a comparative advantage.

88.     Using a fiduciary agency, like AGeFIB, to run the financial management of simultaneous
funding of community-based organizations increases operation efficiency where community-
level action is required.

89.    While setting up a sector-wide coordinating mechanism (i.e. the SP/CNLS) is a highly
relevant objective, the potential risks are not only with the inadequacy of capacity building, but
also with a “mission creep? issue. This latter risk is highly likely with institutions that are brand
new and with a vague (“coordinating?) mandate. Allocation of roles and responsibilities should
be defined precisely upfront.

90.    Using local councils to work with NGOs and to be responsible for implementing and
coordinating the M&E system at the decentralized level can be a key to success by producing
needed data in a timely and efficient manner.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: Social Mobilization and Prevention Services

Under this component the Project provided funds for interventions to continue to scale up
HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, particularly for activities relating to information, education, and
communication (IEC) leading to behavioral change; for care and support of infected and affected
persons; to support promotion of health services not under MOH, and for the distribution and
social marketing of condoms.

Subcomponent 1 (a): Support for community and NGO prevention activities to encourage
behavior change

The subcomponent funded 985 subprojects and 1,178 community action plans dealing with
HIV/AIDS prevention and behavior change activities and providing support to vulnerable groups
such as orphans, women, youth, TB patients, and commercial sex workers. The component
aimed to increase and scale up prevention efforts undertaken during MAP I, but with a specific
focus on reaching the vulnerable groups with interventions designed to encourage behavior
change in a participatory fashion. The subcomponent helped consolidate and increase the number
of “caisses de solidarité? and train their committee members (“porte paroles?) in evaluating sub-
Projects and identifying good practices to be replicated.

(i) Promoting access to HIV/AIDS prevention information and services for all. The
subcomponent provided financial assistance to CSOs and NGOs that carry out prevention
activities in communities. Priority was given to CSOs that deal with PLWHA, commercial and
clandestine sex workers, youth and adolescents, women, and traditional healers and midwives.
NGOs that direct their activities to vulnerable groups such as fishermen, drug users, transport
workers, refugees, and amulet vendors were also assisted. The activities financed included: (i)
prevention activities relating to HIV/AIDS and reductions in STI (training will be provided to
NGOs and CSOs leaders on the norms and procedures for fighting STIs and behavior change
interventions developed under MAP I); (ii) advice and promotion of voluntary HIV/AIDS
testing; (iii) promotion of the use of condoms (both of male and female condoms); (iv)
strengthening prevention messages and utilization of prevention mechanisms among youth and
women; (v) intensification of communication that encourages changes in sexual behavior and
patterns; (vi) promotion of communication between various associations, including those of
traditional healers; and (vii) support to local radio stations for their HIV/AIDS-related programs.
These activities have been identified as being particularly relevant to ensuring behavior change
in the vulnerable groups since it was already identified under MAP I that the use of public
service messages delivered by radio and TV and the use of community activities to encourage
testing were highly effective. Public service messages of this type were so successful that they
generated an overwhelming demand for testing at the health centers, which were not equipped to

                                                28
handle the demand. The activities of national and “departmental? NGOs with proven experience
and expertise in reaching high-risk groups such as professional and clandestine sexual workers,
men having sex with men, or doing social marketing activities among the vulnerable groups,
were also financed to implement larger scale activities.

(ii) Priority Line Ministries. The subcomponent supported action plans prepared by line
ministries in the public sector. The component financed annual action plans prepared by Focal
Point Units in the key ministries and approved by SP/CNLS, targeting the client groups of the
key ministries. The key ministry action plans included: (i) prevention activities for raising
awareness; providing communication that encourages changes in sexual behavior and practices;
(ii) advice and promotion of voluntary HIV/AIDS testing; (iii) advocacy, communication, and
availability of information and guidance on HIV/AIDS matters in the ministries; and (iv)
offering psychosocial counseling of infected persons. The Ministries of Education, Youth,
Family, Women and Children, and Agriculture were identified as those that could be most
effective in reaching the greatest coverage and target vulnerable groups for prevention and care.
The Ministry of Defense had also been identified as a key ministry and was used to support
activities for personnel that are located within other ministries but represent the vulnerable group
of uniformed personnel, such as policemen, park rangers, and border patrol officers, and who
often utilize the Ministry of Defense health facilities. The Ministry of Family, Women and
Children was supported to ensure their role in coordinating and supervising the quality of NGO
interventions funded under subcomponent 1(b) for the care and support of OVCs. This Ministry
was also critical in encouraging changes in cultural and male behavior patterns that contribute to
increased HIV vulnerability in the society.

(iii) Capacity building. Besides financing subprojects, effective implementation of the
subcomponent also required capacity building at several levels. Capacity building activities
included (generally as part of subprojects), standardization of the participatory approach at the
local level, and strengthening of institutional and technical capacities in community
organizations, CSOs, and various HIV/AIDS related associations. NGOs were recruited, when
needed, to provide technical capacity building to the local communities on how to prepare better
action plans with identified results and targets contributing to the overall results framework,
implement them effectively, and carry out “self-evaluation? (evaluation of subprojects and their
implementation by beneficiaries). The activities benefited committee members in communities,
“agents d’accompagnement,? radio producers and speakers, and staff of CSOs and HIV/AIDS-
related associations.

(iv) Intensification of the fight against HIV/AIDS in the workplace. The subcomponent financed
activities that (a) improve the advocacy, communication, and availability of advice in the
workplace concerning HIV/AIDS; (b) increase prevention and understanding of HIV/AIDS and
the effects of HIV/AIDS on infected persons; and (c) reduce the stigma of the HIV infection. The
activities included training, development of communication programs, development of
workplace strategies and policy regulations on HIV/AIDS, and mitigation of the impact on
                                                29
PLWHA. Some key non-formal sector groups were targeted, such as the motorbike taxi
operators who by virtue of their business may be vulnerable to HIV infection, or groups such as
the young female vendors along the roads who sometimes also engage in clandestine commercial
sex work. Health personnel of the public, private, and religious organizations are particularly
vulnerable because they are constantly exposed to HIV in their workplace, and often unaware of
their own risk and how to protect themselves. The Ministry of Health had already initiated
activities within the public sector to train health personnel on reducing their exposure to HIV in
the workplace and was supported to extend this training to all health personnel in Benin, even
outside the public sector, in conjunction with the Global Fund support. The subcomponent also
improved policy knowledge, training in biomedical waste management and helped protect health
personnel against infection from such waste. Training was provided on improving medical waste
management in health facilities and appropriate use of waste management equipment provided
under Component 2 and under the Benin PRSC.

Subcomponent 1 (b): Support for impact mitigation activities for OVCs and PLWHAs

This subcomponent allowed for support to be provided directly and indirectly to mitigate the
impact on people living with HIV and orphans and vulnerable children infected and affected by
the epidemic (including psychosocial and economic support).

During MAP I, faith-based and charitable organizations proved to be effective in caring for
HIV/AIDS-infected and affected people. Under this subcomponent financing was made available
for subprojects for looking after infected and affected people and operated by faith-based and
other organizations. These may be private, religious organizations or other association-run health
centers that have been accredited by the Ministry of Health PNLS unit to provide (i) ARV
treatment and management of opportunistic infections and that take care of AIDS patients; (ii)
care for infected children; (iii) provide nutritional support to families affected by AIDS; or (iv)
provide psychosocial care and counseling to individual patients or families. There are several
such institutions that are already providing ARV care, are recognized as providing high quality
services and often present the closest option for ARV services to PLWHAs, but are now limited
in their ability to scale up services to more patients because of the question of payment. Project
assistance subsidized existing or new activities for these purposes. This support was provided
directly to these facilities on the basis of the identified number of patients treated at the facility
over a given period of time.

In order to ensure that the Project reaches the intended beneficiaries and has an impact directly
on the people living with HIV, this sub-component also supported the activities of the PLWHA
associations at departmental and national level and their networks, to ensure that they have a
voice in policymaking and in activities that are intended to benefit them.

In addition, this subcomponent allowed for PLWHA to benefit from income-generating activities
(IGAs) that will be funded through the PLWHA associations for the benefit of indigent members

                                                 30
or all the members of an association. This IGA support was provided at no interest in a limited
amount (generally about US$4,000 for each association) and the associations were required to
reimburse the funding to the financial management agency engaged by the Project after a
specified period of time to demonstrate the sustainability and performance of the IGA.

The component also provided funding for care and support of orphans and vulnerable children
(OVCs), as identified by communities or health centers as being infected or affected by
HIV/AIDS. The Ministry of Family, Women and Children had the responsibility and lead
authority to work with OVCs and had put in place a national minimum package of support for
orphans that the Project also supported. The component support OVCs in ensuring that they had
access to this minimum package of support that has been agreed upon by the Ministry and other
partners. The orphans were supported to ensure that they were able to re-enter the education
system and provide support to purchase their books, uniforms and other necessary school
equipment since Benin has a free primary education policy in place. In addition, where there
were orphans who were either the heads of household for child-headed household or where their
re-entry into school would not be possible, the component supported them through assistance for

Component 2: Access to Treatment, Care, and Impact Mitigation services

The objectives of this component were to enable Benin, by year 2010, to: (i) increase by 10
percent each year the number of people tested to reach a target of 600,000; (ii) provide, each
year, ARV treatment to 3,000 HIV positive pregnant women; (iii) provide medical checkups to at
least 6,000 CSW at least twice in each year; (iv) provide ARV treatment to 3,300 PLWHA
including 900 children; (v) provide biological follow-up services for 6,500 PLWHA under ARV
treatment; (vi) provide psychosocial support to 10,000 PLWHA (with the Ministry of Family
Affairs being the implementing agency of this assistance); (vii) provide nutritional support to
3,300 PLWHA under ARV treatment; and (viii) strengthen the system of epidemiological
surveillance and monitoring evaluation of the PNLS/MOH.

Under this component, the Project supplemented the financing provided by the Global Fund and
others, in order to help the country achieve the ultimate goals of care and treatment of HIV/AIDS
infected people as spelled out in the national HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework 2006-2010.

To achieve these objectives, the PNLS/MOH relied on the following strategies:

                                               33
• Moving forward with the decentralization of the minimum care package through increasing the
number of VCT, PMTCT, care and treatment sites throughout the country in order to reach as
many patients as possible.

• Effective integration of HIV/AIDS related activities with basic care services provided in all
health facilities (TB-HIV/AIDS, Malaria/HIV/AIDS).

• Strengthening of health facilities through the rehabilitation of main buildings, improvements in
the technical equipment and standards of laboratories, the provision of reagents and other
medical drugs, and capacity building of health personnel.

• Strengthening the referral laboratory by rehabilitating its physical facilities and improving its
technical capabilities.

• Decentralization of laboratory activities with the provision of two mobile laboratories equipped
to provide VCT services.

• Strengthening of SIDAG (the national service for free voluntary and anonymous testing) to
transform it into a national reference and training center for other VCT centers.

• Integration of HIV teaching in the curriculum of medical schools and technical training centers.

• Strengthening of activities initiated under other Projects (such as SIDA 3 financed by ACDI)
targeting high risks groups such as CSWs and mobile populations.

• Promotion and dissemination of sound practices in the management of medical waste in line
with the policies adopted in the Medical Waste management Plan (MWMP).

This component complemented funding by the Global Fund and other financiers and provides
support to the following activities:

   •   Testing of HIV. The Project financed the establishment, at reasonable cost, of 6 new VCT
       centers, materials and reagents needed in testing and by providing equipment to the
       testing laboratories, as well as by training their staff.
   •   Increased access for PMTCT. The Project helped the health sector extend efforts to
       prevent mother-to-child-transmission to all zones where the Project is active. The
       assistance included (i) strengthening of the health-sector staff capacity in PMTCT
       management; procurement of reagents, medicines, and other requirements such as
       computers; (ii) monitoring of and medical, social, and psychosocial support to children
       born as seropositive; (iii) social mobilization and sensitization of the population to accept
       the seropositive children; and (iv) nutritional care of infected and affected children.
   •   Treatment of AIDS patients. The Project continued to provide medicines for patients who
       need ARV drugs, an activity started by the predecessor Project PPLS. In addition, the


                                                34
       Project financed procurement of reagents and consumable materials needed in medical
       care and treatment of these patients, and improved the quality of the treatment facilities.
   •   Prevention and treatment of STIs and OIs: The Project accelerated promotion of the
       methods of diagnosing and treating of STIs among high risk groups and procure
       medication, reagents, other materials, and condoms for prevention and treatment of STIs
       and opportunistic infections.
   •   Support for the safety of blood transfusion. The Project provided reagents and other
       materials to secure the quality of blood used for transfusion, improve the technical
       capacity of the transfusion personnel, and encourage the sexual fidelity of blood donors;
       improvement of blood security by strengthening blood banks with laboratory equipment
       and two mobile laboratories will be acquired to support the implementation of health
       advanced strategies.
   •   Capacity building for health staff at all levels of the health pyramid for diagnosis, care
       and treatment of STIs, HIV/AIDS and OIs, as needed.
   •   Restructuring of selective health facilities in order to facilitate the integration of
       HIV/AIDS related activities (VCT, care and treatment to other basic health services such
       as ANC, TB and Malaria).
   •   Management of medical waste by financing activities underscored in the MWMP.
   •   Nutritional support to PLWHA, including training in sound nutrition practices.
   •   Strengthening of epidemiological surveillance, operational research, monitoring and
       evaluation.
   •   Support to traditional medicine by financing operational research on ethics used,
       strengthening collaboration between traditional and modern medicine, and promoting
       research on plants used for traditional medicines and their potential usefulness in
       treatment of STIs, OIs, and AIDS.

Component 3: Coordination, Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation

This component had three sub-components:

   •   Support for a unified national and decentralized coordination system and leadership of
       CNLS;

                                              37
   •   Support for a uniform national monitoring and evaluation system, and
   •   Finance the coordination and management of the MAP II.


Subcomponent 3 (a): Support for a unified national and decentralized coordination system
and leadership of CNLS.

The Project strengthened the SP/CNLS to allow it to carry out its role, especially in
implementing the “Three Ones? principles. The assistance included support to capacity building
in CNLS and decentralized units (regional units, communes, “arrondissements,? and local
committees), procurement of vehicles and equipment, and funds for technical assistance.

Subcomponent 3 (b): Support for a uniform national monitoring and evaluation system

UNAIDS and GAMET jointly financed development of an important element of the “Three
Ones?--the nationally functioning M&E system--that was completed in early 2006. The Project
helped finance the testing of this system and its implementation at all levels in the country during
the Project period. The activities that were supported included (i) recruitment of additional staff
at both central and decentralized level of the SP/CNLS, necessary equipment and materials,
extensive training of persons involved in M&E; (ii) financing of collection, processing, and
publication of data from operations of this Project and those of other HIV/AIDS Projects; (iii)
special studies relating to HIV/AIDS in Benin and evaluation of Project results (under CNLS
supervision); and (iv) technical assistance.

Subcomponent 3 (c): Financing the coordination and management of MAP II

Under the auspices of CNLS, the Project was managed by a small Project Administration unit
(PA), with the support of a Financial Management Agency (FMA). The Project financed the
costs of these units. The support included (i) training of PA and FMA staffs; (ii) administration
of the Project, including financing of FMA activities; (iii) updating and strengthening of the
computerized financial management system; (iv) replacement of vehicles, equipment, and
materials used for Project activities; (v) operation of the Project-specific M&E system (as part of
the nationwide M&E system, but potentially with additional features and indicators); and (vi)
financing of external audits.

The outputs for this component were the following:

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

After appraisal, no follow-up analysis has been carried out to estimate the economic impact of
the Project. Consequently, the ICR is reviewing here the assumptions made at appraisal.

As indicated in the PAD, the benefits of the Project were estimated in terms of the number of
deaths averted, as suggested by World Bank (1996). The estimation considered a number of
alternative scenarios and attempted to assess whether the Project was likely to contribute towards
a significant improvement in welfare for a given budget. In particular, the analysis concentrated
on the cost-effectiveness ratio defined as the cost of the Project divided by the number of
premature deaths prevented if the Project is implemented, when compared to the counterfactual
that no action is taken. According to World Bank (ibid.), a conservative estimate of the value of a
year of life saved is annual per capita income. The number of deaths averted cover the effects of
the Project in terms of mortality, but one should also consider the benefits of other direct impacts
such as avoided treatment costs, as well as indirect benefits, such as the reduced number of
HIV/AIDS orphans and the implications in terms of human capital accumulation and need for
support.

The demographic Projections used in the PAD analysis were obtained from the SPECTRUM and
the AIDS impact model (AIM) software packages. The first package was used to make general
demographic Projections based on data from the UN statistical division. The latter package
allows to estimate future numbers of infections, AIDS cases and AIDS deaths, as well as other
impacts of the epidemic, given assumptions about the future course of adult HIV prevalence. In
the analysis a number of different scenarios were considered based on Benin’s Cadre Stratégique
National de Lutte Contre le VIH/SIDA/IST 2006-2010 and different assumptions about future
prevalence rates. The Cadre Stratégique sets targets in terms of coverage rates for a number of
prevention and treatment services that were incorporated to the scenarios when necessary. The
baseline scenario assumed that the country will continue with the current levels of coverage of
prevention and treatment services and would constitute the case were the MAP II Project is not
implemented, i.e., assuming that the status quo remains for the period of the Projection until
2015. The prevalence rate is also assumed to remain constant at 2 percent during the Projection
period. Furthermore, in the high prevalence scenario, the levels of coverage of services remain
constant at current levels, but the prevalence rate increases to 3 percent by 2015. In order to
obtain estimates of the number of HIV/AIDS orphans data from the Benin DHS survey on the
percentage of women aged 15-19 that never married was used. ART started in Benin in 2002
with a coverage rate of 3 percent of those in need (CNLS, 2006). For those two scenarios,
coverage rates for ARV treatment for both adults and children were set at the current levels from
2005 onwards.

The MAP II scenario considered what would occur if the Project is implemented and contributes
to achieving the target coverage rates set by the Cadre National Stratégique. Nonetheless, this
scenario considers that HIV prevalence rates remain at 2 percent. One should note that increased
efforts in terms of treatment and prevention may not lead to decreases in the prevalence rate in
the short run, as more people infected with the virus survive for extended periods of time.
Finally, the low prevalence scenario assumes that Project is implemented and the prevalence rate


                                                41
declines to 1.8 percent by 2010 in line with the target set in the Cadre Stratégique, i.e., this is the
prevalence figure used for the national strategy.

The figure below illustrates the number of deaths due to AIDS under the different scenarios. One
can estimate the number of deaths averted simply by subtracting the number of deaths that would
occur if the program is not implemented, i.e. Baseline and High Prevalence Scenario, from the
estimated number of deaths in case the program is adopted. The figure provides a glance on the
large welfare implications of HIV/AIDS interventions, even when one only considers the
relatively short 5-year Project period. One should also bear in mind that if efforts to avert new
infections are effective, the benefits of the Project still accrue well beyond 2010. A cursory
comparison between the High and Low Prevalence Scenarios until 2015 gives us a rough
quantification of the potential benefits in terms of deaths averted of reductions in the incidence
rate over the Project period.




                                                  42
The analysis of the ratio of the cost of the program to number of premature deaths averted
revealed that this cost decreases substantially over the period of the Project under all scenarios.
When one considers the MAP II scenario using the Baseline as the counterfactual, one can
observe that the ratio goes from FCFA 10.2 million per death averted in 2007 (around
US$19,500) to FCFA 3 million per death averted in 2010 (around US$5,800). Estimates of the
cost per death averted seem to be fairly robust, as significant differences do not emerge between
the distinct scenarios and counterfactuals. Overall the estimates for the whole period from 2006-
2010 range from an upper bound of FCFA 6.43 million (approximately US$12,200) to a lower
limit of FCFA 6.27 million (approximately US$11,900). It is crucial to emphasize that one needs
to contrast those costs with the possible financial and economic benefits discussed previously,
such as a substantial reduction in hospitalization costs, the reduced negative fiscal impact of
HIV/AIDS, as well as the reduced negative impact on the stock and accumulation of human
capital among other issues.


At ICR stage, it appears that the low prevalence hypothesis was the right one, given that the
overall prevalence remained below 2%. One can conclude that the assumptions made by the
economic analysis were correct.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


During Project implementation, two beneficiary surveys were contracted out, one at the end of
2009 to a local firm and, one in 2012 near the end of the Project to a foreign consulting firm.

The first one was a rapid survey whose purpose was to measure beneficiary participation and
their satisfaction two years after the start of the Project. The study method included a desk
review of Project documents and direct interviews of a sample of beneficiaries and service
providers. These included the Civil Society (CSOs, Community action Plan Management
Committees, etc…), public sector organizations (i.e. HIV/AIDS focal points in priority and non-
priority ministries), beneficiary private sector institutions (i.e. focal points of organizations
affiliated to the Coalition of Private sector firms). Also included in the survey were the SP/CNLS
and its decentralized field units and the AGeFIB and its decentralized field units. Among these
groups of beneficiaries, specific focus was put on Associations and networks of PLWHA, NGOs
and Health facilities and local radio stations. Questions related to the following topics: (i)
knowledge and appropriation of the Project by beneficiaries and service providers; (ii)
participation of partner structures to the Project activities; (iii) capacity building and
partnerships, including beneficiary opinion on their collaboration with other structures, and (iv)
partner structure satisfaction with the impact and consequences on beneficiaries, including
beneficiary satisfaction when it comes to the impact of subprojects and activities on communities
and beneficiary target groups, and including beneficiary direct satisfaction when it comes to the
implementation of subprojects or activities.

The study found that almost all (i.e. 99.2%) of the managers of structures and the beneficiaries
interviewed during the survey knew the PMLS II, and 98.4% knew that their structures benefited
directly or indirectly from its actions. The existence of AGeFIB, the partner institution of the
PMLS II in this Project, was known by only 57% of the beneficiaries. When it comes to the
Project objectives, 52.3% of partner structures mention the reduction of HIV/AIDS prevalence as
the main objective while 32.3% saw fostering social mobilization and enhancing prevention
services as the second most important objective. Regarding tools used to reach its objectives,
51.5% of partner structures identified their own implication as the main tool, followed by
community implication (identified by 44.6%).

The objective of the second survey was to assess beneficiary needs and priorities and to measure
the level of satisfaction drawn from the quality of services offered through the funding brought
by the PMLS II over the years. The study method covered 6 of the 12 departments of Benin. It
included a desk review of Project documents and direct interviews of a sample of beneficiaries,
service providers and other stakeholders.

In general, institutional partners (like the UFLS, the PNLS, the AGeFIB, personnel in health
facilities, CD/CNLS, CC/CNLS and managers of deconcentrated technical services) appreciated
and recognized the PMLS II as a Project that came to bridge the gap in the fight against
HIV/AIDS and felt that their collaboration with the Project had been very good and that the
Project intervention approach had been very efficient.



                                               47
Regarding beneficiaries, 68.01% of those interviewed were positively satisfied with the quality
of services provided to fight HIV/AIDS with the main reasons given being the regularity of IEC
actions (for 83% of them), the free provision of condoms (72%) and the efficiency of STI
treatments. Furthermore, 76.8%, 74.8% and 67.8% of those interviewed were satisfied
respectively with (i) PMTCT, (ii) screening/IEC and promotion of condoms and (iii) access, care
and socioeconomic support received.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The implementation of the Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project was to strengthen the
national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This Project whose Financial Agreement was
signed November 14, 2007 between the Government of Benin and the International
Development Association (IDA), has 3 components: (i) Component A: Social Mobilization and
HIV prevention services; (ii) Component B: Access to treatment, care and impact mitigation
services; and (iii) Component C: Project management, coordination and monitoring and
evaluation. Project objectives are the following:

   -   Strengthening access to and increasing the utilization of prevention services for
       vulnerable groups (women, youth, etc…) and high risk groups such as commercial health
       workers (SW) and key ministries;
   -   Improve access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and
       affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and orphans and
       children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS;
   -   Consolidate the coordination, management and the monitoring and evaluation of the
       national response to HIV/AIDS.

By the end of its implementation, the Project had reached its objectives in many fields and its
performance indicators, for the most part, had reached the expected levels and, sometimes, had
even surpassed them.

On the other hand, it is hard to give an appreciation of its development indicators because most
of these indicators come from the Enquête de Surveillance de Deuxième Génération (ESDG)
whose results are still not available.

For beneficiaries however, the support provided by the PMLS II has been beneficial and has led
to good results when it comes to the provision of care and treatment to PLWHA.

Indeed, those who benefited from Project interventions are mostly poor people who have found
relief through activities provided by the Project. Progress can be seen not only in the provision of
medical, psychological and nutritional care but also in the support provided to orphans and other
vulnerable children (OVC). The Project has positively impacted the health environment. By
building the capacity of health agents, buying equipment, drugs and other medical products and
rehabilitating or building infrastructures, the Project had a profound impact on the health
environment.

Activities targeting professional sex workers have led to a clear improvement in the attendance
rate of services fit for the case detection and management of STIs through the implementation of
community activities.

                                                50
Communities, on the other hand, have been actively involved in the implementation of Project
activities. Innovations seen in the PMLS II (compared to the PPLS) like the introduction of focal
points in the town halls, widening the target group to include the OVCs, the strong involvement
of religious and traditional heads have considerably reduced the sociocultural constraints that
undermine the fight against this disease. Involving the CCLS, CALS and CVLS and also Civil
Society Organizations, Community-Based Organizations, NGOs and other stakeholders close to
communities and using different strategies to implement activities has strengthened the
ownership of Project interventions by the communities.

The Project has also supported the strengthening of the CNLS and its decentralized units in order
to enhance its capacity to better fulfill its role and specifically its role of coordinating,
harmonizing and monitoring interventions by different partners, Projects and programs geared at
the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Regarding governance, the PMLS II was, through the existing institutional channels, able to
strengthen its capacity for intervention by engaging MSAS services through a partnership with
the PNLS, the DHAB and the AGeFIB as a fiduciary agency. Using the services of the
Organisme d’Appui aux Communautés (OAC) to technically support the communities in the
elaboration and the implementation of their action plans to fight HIV/AIDS and using NGOs to
support the elaboration and implementation of subprojects has strongly contributed to the
achievement of the Project outcomes.

As of March 31, 2012, three months before Project closure, the global commitment rate by
expenditure categories was 95.3% and the disbursement rate was 87% of this commitment rate.

Project performances would have been clearly better if the implementation had not been done in
such a difficult environment characterized by constraints mostly linked to the bureaucracy
surrounding procurement activities and by constraints linked to the respect of the terms of the
Memorandum Of Understanding.
