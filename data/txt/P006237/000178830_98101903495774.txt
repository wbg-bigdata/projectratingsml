SUIiMARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of Central Eletrica
de Furnas, S.A. (Furnas) consisting of the construction of the 360 Mw Porto
Colombia hydroelectric plant and associated transmission in the south-central
region of Brazil. The project is estimated to cost a total of US$69.8 million
equivalent and the proposed Bank loan would amount to US$22.3 million equi-
valent. The project represents a part of the overall expansion program of
Furnas, the total of which is estimated at US$380 million during the project
construction period 1969-1974 inclusive.
ii.       The Borrower would be Furnas, an autonomous electric utility company
principally owned by the Federal Government. Two previous loans No. 211 BR
for US$73 million in 1958 for the construction of the Furnas hydroelectric
station and transmission and No. 403-474 BR for US$96 million, which was made
in two tranches in 1965 and 1966 for the Estreito hydroelectric project, have
been made to Furnas. Experience with the two loans has been satisfactory.
iii.      The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable
and the arrangements for engineering, procurement and construction are satis-
factory. The facilities to be provided are necessary to enable Furnas to
meet the expected demands for power. The financing arrangements are satis-
factory.
iv.       Furnas would be a suitable borrower.  Since its inception in 1957
it has operated its organization and properties efficiently and has made good
progress in developing its staff and methods.
V.        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$22.3 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of six and one half years.

APPRAISAL OF THE PORTO COLOMBIA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
CENTRAL ELETRICA DE FURNAS S.A.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas), a corporation owned
principally by the Federal Government, has asked the Bank for a loan of
US$22.3 million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of a project
with a total cost of US$69.8 million equivalent. The project would form
part of the Furnas development program over the period 1969-1974 inclusive
which is estimated to cost a total of US$380 million equivalent.
1.02      The project would consist of the construction of the 360 Mw Porto
Colombia hydroelectric project and associated 345 kv and 138 kv transmission
facilities. This would be the third loan to Furnas. The first, No. 211 BR
in 1958 for US$73 million financed the construction of the Furnas hydro-
electric station which is operating satisfactorily. The second, No.403-474 BR,
which was made in two tranches in 1965 and 1966 financed the construction of
the Estreito hydroelectric station which is to be placed in service in 1969.
1.03      The proposed project, and those previously financed, were studied
by Canambra, a consortium of three consulting firms, under a United Nations
Special Fund grant for which the Bank acted as Executing Agency, which had
as its objective the determination of a long range expansion program for
development of the electricity facilities in the south-central region of
Brazil.
1.04      The proposed loan to Furnas is one of two companion loans for
electric utility development, the second of which is proposed for Centrais
Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (Cemig) to finance the 400 Mw Volta Grande
hydroelectric project and transmission. Both projects are located on the
Rio Grande River and their output would be delivered to the interconnected
345 kv transmission system to supply the south-central region. Because of
the closely linked nature of the two projects they are considered jointly
in this report where appropriate.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of Bank missions in February
1968 by Mr. D. King and in April/May 1968 by Messrs. D. King, M. J. Reis
and F. Rydell.
1.06      Subsequent to the preparation of this report, the official exchange
rate was changed on August 27, 1968 to NCr$3.65 to US$1 from NCr$3.22 to
US$1. Since this does not substantially affect the overall financial situ-
ation and plan of Furnas inview of the provisions of Brazilian law regarding
tariffs as described herein (Annex 9), the financial statements have not
been recast. Delay in the preparation of this report has thereby been avoided.

2. THE BORRCJTER
2.01      The Borrower would be Furnas, an autonomous Government corporation
established in 1957, and a subsidiary of Centrais Eletricas Btasileiras S.A.
(Eletrobras), a Federal Government limited liability company created in 1961
to implement Federal Government policy in the electric power sector. Eletrobras
is a holding company wxhich controls the operaticn of the federal utilities,
administers public funds to expand the federal power systems, assists with
the expansion of other electric utilities in need of financing and helps in
the financing of power facilities in the less developed areas of Brazil.
Furnas is the largest of the federally owned utilities under the control of
Eletrobras.
2.02      As of December 31, 1967, total share capital of Furnas was NCr$300
million divided as follows:

Total Number of Shares                      150,000,000       150,000,000
2.03      Furnas is administered by a council of administration of 12 members,
six of whom are Directors appointed from within the organization and six
Councillors appointed from Government and business circles. The Directors
are the President, Vice President-Technical, Vice President-Financial, and
heads of the Administration, Operation and Planning, and the Contracts and
Tariffs Departments. The Technical Department comprises 830 personnel, 700
of whom are engaged in construction, and the remainder in engineering and
supervision. Operations and Planning has 1,100 personnel, including a
planning group of ten engineers with responsibility for plant and system
operation and maintenance. The Finance Department has a staff of 120 dealing
with finance, accounts and internal auditing. The Contract Group numbers 90
and the Administration Group kOO making a total of approximately 2,600
personnel.
2.04      The organization has developed well.  Furnas engineers are sent to
the United States for post graduate studies at universities and additional
training with major utility systems and manufacturing companies. Financial
training is also obtained abroad. Operators and maintenance men are trained
in Brazil in a technical school operated on a permanent basis by Furnas.
Provision is included in the proposed loan for additional training.



- 3 -
2.05      For the design and construction of major projects Furnas employs
consulting engineers and hires contractors. With this help and with the
development of its staff through experience and training Furnas has been
able to administer the large construction program which is underway and to
satisfactorily conduct its operations. The organization of Furnas is satis-
factory and given the scope of activities the number of personnel it employs
is reasonable.
The Facilities of the Borrower
2.06      As the federal entity, as distinct from state entities, entrusted
with generation of power in the south-central region, Furnas has large gen-
erating and transmission facilities. Annex 1 lists existing generating
stations and those under construction or planned. Present generating capacity
is 1,310 Mw. On completion of the generating stations under construction,
and of the facility planned for construction under the proposed loan, the
total capacity would be increased to 3,330 Mw in 1974.
2.07      The transmission system of Furnas is shown on the map.   In operation
and under construction is a total of 2,500 km of 345 kv transmission line
circuit.
2.08      All power generated by Furnas is sold on a bulk power basis to other
utilities for resale to the ultimate consumers. The utilities which purchase
Furnas power are listed in Annex 3. They are located within the south-central
region, in the States of Guanabara, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro,
and Espirito Santo, in which also operate three other important utilities,
Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP), Cemig, and the Brazilian Power Company
subsidiary Light S.A. - Servicos de Eletricidade. In 1967 Furnas energy sales
amounted to about 5.5 billion kwh and the demand was over 900 Mw. Total
energy sales for that year in the south-central region exceeded 18 billion
kwh.
3. SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
3.01      Coordination of the operation and development of electric power
facilities in the south-central region, which represents two-thirds of the
country's total market, has evolved to the point where the responsibilities
of individual companies are fairly well defined. This coordination has been
achieved gradually during the past four years, the urging of international
lending agencies having been an important factor in this connection. In the
State of Sao Paulo which provides the major market, CESP, the state owned
utility, now supplies a portion of the market but has underway a very large
construction program which will enable it eventually to supply virtually all
of the State's future increase in demand. Cemig, also a state owned company,
is responsible for the supply of the State of Minas Gerais, another important
market area. The city of Rio de Janeiro in the State of Guanabara is supplied
by Light S.A. Furnas supplies the generation requirements of the south-central
region to the extent they are not provided by the above three main utilities.



Furnas has negotiated contracts, details of which are contained in Annex 3,
with the utilities to which it supplies bulk power including Cemig. In
addition, CESP has made a contract arrangement with Light S.A. for the supply
in future of the city of Sao Paulo.
3.02      The Canambra study established a long-term plan of development and
provided a priority list of power development sites based on the unit cost
of each development. The main entities concerned, Furnas, CESP and Cemig --
representing the Federal Government and two of the most important states --
have generally followed this priority list in planning their respective
expansion programs and the lending agencies which have assisted the develop-
ment program in the south-central region have used the priority list in
orienting their assistance.
3.03      Development of the high voltage transmission system was planned
along broad lines in the Canambra report and Furnas and Cemig have made a
review in connection with the proposed loans. The major companies in the
south-central region have organized a system interconnection committee, the
purpose of which is to establish procedures leading to the most efficient
operation of the combined systems, collaboration in the release of equipment
for maintenance, particularly generating facilities, arrangements for mutual
assistance in the event of emergencies, load and frequency control, and co-
ordination of system protection.
3.0o      As the south-central power facilities have grown coordination of
the planning and operations of the main utilities therein has grown commen-
surately. This has been essential. Wqhile much has been done it will be of
prime importance to continue the effort and translate it into operating
efficiency as new facilities come in operation.
3.05      Most important has been the development of the distribution systems
which ultimately use the power from the new generation facilities. The Bank
and other lending agencies are playing an important role in this connection.
The Bank financed the rehabilitation and expansion of four of the major dis-
tribution systems in the south-central and adjoining regions under Loans
475-478 ER, in December 1966, totalling US$61.6 million. The work covered
systems in the cities of Belo Horizonte and Niteroi and of CPFL, Paulista,
in the south-central region. This work should be completed about 1970.
AID has financed the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution systems
in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in an aggregate amount exceeding
US$4O million. This program is to be completed in 1969 and Light S.A. is
seeking financial assistance for further expansion of its distribution facil-
ities.
3.06      Cemig is undertaking a major expansion of the distribution system
in the State of Minas Gerais. The State of Sao Paulo and CESP are respon-
sible for distribution in the areas in that state which are not under conces-
sion to Light S.A. and CPFL. In general, therefore, there is reasonably
adequate provision for the expansion of distribution facilities, but it will
be essential to maintain progress in the 1970's so as to keep pace with load
growth and fully utilize the new generating facilities being provided.



L. GENERATION EXPANSION PROGRAM
4.01      In addition to the proposed project Annex 1 lists generating capacity
presently under construction or planned and includes Marimbondo, 1,200 Mw
capacity, which is in the early planning stages and tentatively scheduled for
operation in 1975. To meet this date a start would be necessary in 1970.
Further studies are to be made by Furnas to determine the timing of this
project.
4.02      Furnas is considering the possibility of installing the remaining
two 150 Mw units, Nos. 7 and 8, at the Furnas hydroelectric plant to offset
possible delay to Ilha Solteira (paragraph 7.11); a decision may be reached
in 1969 to enable the units to be brought into operation in 1974 should this
be necessary. Assurances have been received that during the construction
period, 1969-1974, Furnas would not undertake any additional major projects
other than Porto Colombia and those already under construction as listed in
Annex 1, without the approval of the Bank. A similar condition is contained
in Loan 403-474 BR.
5. THE PROJECT
5.01      The project proposed for Bank financing represents about
18% of the expansion program of Furnas which during 1969-1974 includes the
construction of about two million kilowatts of new capacity as listed in
Annex 1. It would consist of the construction of the Porto Colombia hydro-
electric station with a capacity of 360 Nw, the construction of a 345 kv
transmission line between Porto Colombia and the present terminus of the
Furnas system at Estreito and 138 kv transmission facilities between Porto
Colombia and Barretos, where they will connect to the Paulista system, and
associated 345 kv and 138 kv substation facilities.
Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Station
5.02      The Porto Colombia hydroelectric station would be located on the
Rio Grande River nine km upstream from its junction with the Pardo River and
approximately 500 km from Sao Paulo, as shown on the map. It would be down-
stream from the Furnas and Estreito hydroelectric stations. A drainage area
of 78,000 sq. km, of which the run-off from 52,000 sq. km are regulated by
the Furnas station storage reservoir, would supply water to Porto Colombia.
The hydrology of the Rio Grande River was studied in detail by Canambra and
the geology of the Porto Colombia site was investigated during the Canambra
feasibility studies of potential hydroelectric sites.
5.03      Porto Colombia would be equipped with 4-90 Mw units.1/   The plant
factor would be 45% providing an annual firm energy capacity of 1.38 billion
kwh based on driest season conditions as experienced in the serious drought
period of 1953/1956. The station would operate at a head of 21.3 meters
utilizing Kaplan type turbines suitable for comparatively low head operation.
1/ During the detailed design phase of the project the possibility of
substituting a smaller number of machines, that is, 3-120 Mw, to
yield the same total capacity will be considered.



- 6 -
5.04      The main feature of the civil works wiould be the earth-fill dam
25 meters high with a crest length of 1,200 meters and a volume of 4,300,000
cubic meters. Total concrete content of the project would be about 240,000
cubic meters, of which the power station would account for about one-third.
The powerhouse would be of the aboveground enclosed type. No major con-
struction problems are anticipated.
Transmission
5.05      The output of the proposed Porto Colombia power station would be
delivered to the interconnected system over the new 345 kv and 138 kv trans-
mission lines. The single circuit 345 kv steel tower transmission line
between Porto Colombia and Estreito, 150 km in length, would be equipped
with twin conductors similar to existing 345 kv circuits. The 138 kv steel
tower transmission line 60 km long, from Porto Colombia to Barretos would
be double circuit. Power wJould be transformed from the 13.8 kv generator
voltage to 138 kv at Porto Colombia by 133 Mva generator transformers. It
would be transmitted directly over the new 138 kv lines to the CPFL system
at Barretos and by means of a 150 Mva, 138 kv/3L5 kv transformer at Porto
Colombia, over the new 345 kv line to Estreito.
Estimated Cost
5.06      The estimated cost of the project is given in Annex 2 and is
summarized below:

The total cost of the project would be US$86.9 million equivalent including
interest during construction of US$17.1 million equivalent. The proposed
loan of US$22.3 million equivalent is the estimated cost of equipment to be
purchased after international competitive bidding, including contracts won
by Brazilian suppliers (paragraphs 6.01, 6.02), exclusive of interest during
construction. The proposed loan would represent 26p of the total estimated
cost of the project including interest during construction and five per cent
of the total construction expenditures planned by Furnas during the 1969-1974
construction period. INo reimbursement would be made for expenditures incurred
prior to the signing of the proposed loan.

works contract and wphich would be bid upon separately.

5.07      The unit cost of Porto Colombia would be US$175 per kw, excluding
transmission and interest during construction, which places it in the category
of low cost hydro. The cost estimate is based on the feasibility study made
by Canambra updated by Furnas engineering staff and its consultants. Con-
tingency allowances of 15% for the civil works and other local financing costs
and ten per cent for equipment and other Bank financed costs have been in-
cluded.
5.08      Experience with recent power loans in Brazil has been that the
Bank financed portions of the projects were somewhat overestimated, in part
due to provision in the estimates for the additional cost of orders which
might be awarded Brazilian manufacturers under the 15% preference formula
(paragraphs 6.01, 6.02). As it is likely, on the basis of experience, that
substantially less than half of the equipment orders would be awarded to
Brazilian suppliers, the equipment costs estimated contain in effect built-in
contingency amounts. In view of this, and since the proposed loan would not
finance civil construction, which is usually the most important source of
cost overrun on hydroelectric projects, the loan does not include in it an
amount for contingencies.  In the cost estimate, paragraph 5.06 and Annex 2,
contingency amounts are therefore shown as local financing items.
Engineering and Construction
5.09      The feasibility study made by Canambra provided the necessary
information for planning and financing purposes. Detailed design of the
hydroelectric station would be carried out by Furnas' consultants, Inter-.
national Engineering Co. of San Francisco and its Brazilian associates,
Companhia Internacional de Engenharia e Construcoes. The civil works would
be undertaken by a Brazilian contractor of adequate experience chosen on the
basis of competitive bidding. As in the case of the Estreito project separate
contractors would be employed to erect the penstock and gates and Furnas would
construct the powerhouse superstructure. These arrangements are satisfactory.
The provisions contained in Loan 403-474 BR requiring the employment of con-
sultants and contractors satisfactory to the Bank would be repeate:d in the
proposed agreement.
5.10      Engineering and design of the project would commence toward the
end of 1968. Tenders for major equipment would be called and the main
construction contracts awarded during 1969. Construction would begin in
the latter part of 1969 with completion of the first generator scheduled
for mid-1973 and of the whole plant for the spring of 1974. The construction
period is reasonable for a project of this size.
6. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
6.01      Procurement of the goods and equipment financed under the loan would
be on the basis of international competitive bidding except in the case of
certain minor items for which such bidding would be impractical. As in the
previous case of power loans in Brazil, Brazilian suppliers would be eligible
to compete in the bidding with the advantage of a 15% preference.



- 9 -
6.02      The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids to be procured
under the loan would be as agreed between the Government and Bank in con-
nection with the previous power loans and which is quoted in part as follows:
"The borrower intends to invite firms producing goods in Brazil
to participate in the international competitive bidding. In the case
of goods produced in Brazil the borrower may award the order to the
lowest Brazilian bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions
provided that his offered price does not exceed the offered price of
the lowjest acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15%. Comparison
of bids will be made without taking into account customs or other
similar duties. For firms in Brazil the delivery price will comprise
the f.o.b. plant cost plus freight, insurance and other delivery costs
to the site. For non-Brazilian firms the delivery price will be based
on the c.i.f. landed costs, port of entry, before customs duties plus
inland freight, insurance and other delivery costs to the site. As
the 15% preference allowed firms in Brazil is in lieu of customs duties
the 15% will be added to the c.i.f. landed cost (excluding customs
duties) of the non-Brazilian goods before inland freight, insurance
and other costs. In the case of bids composed of both cruzeiros and
foreign currency the cruzeiro portion thereof will be dealt with as a
Brazilian bid and the foreign exchange portion as a non-Brazilian bid.
For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be con-
verted into cruzeiros at the bid comparison rate of exchange. The
bid comparison rate of exchange is understood to be the dollar selling
rate of the Banco Central de Republica do Brazil plus the exchange
surtax!/ (but not to exceed 30%) if any prevailing on the date 30 days
prior to the date on which bids are closed. It is further understood
that the Bank will on its own initiative or at the request of the
borrower or guarantor reconsider and if necessary revise the bid
comparison rate of exchange whenever there should be a substantial
change in the Brazilian exchange system which would in the judgment
of the Bank render such rates unsuitable for bid comparison purposes.
The guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary
in order to facilitate the importation of goods purchased outside
Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the loan
agreement."
7. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Growth - Furnas
7.01      Annex 3 gives the actual and forecast sales demand for the period
1965-75. Past sales have been predominantly to Light S.A. for supply to the
city of Sao Paulo. Commencing in 1968, sales will be made to a number of
1/ The exchange surtax was discontinued in 1965.



- 10 -
other utilities, the largest of which are Light S.A. (Sao Paulo), Light S.A.
(Rio), Cemig and CPFL, in accordance with the arrangements for the supply of
the south-central region which have been agreed by the Federal Government,
the respective State Governments and the companies involved.
7.02      As noted in Annex 3, page 1, Furnas' commitments for 1968 and
for the subsequent years are covered by power contracts with each of the
utilities. The contracts are on conventional lines. They provide for the
amount of demand in each year, with energy to be normally supplied at 60%
load factor or at a higher load factor with the agreement of Furnas if ad-
ditional energy is available, and stipulate that the contract year is from
April 1 to March 31. The contracts stipulate that tariffs will be determined
on the basis of the applicable tariff regulations administered by the res-
ponsible Federal Government agency.
7.03      Since Furnas has committed itself to the power contracts it must
provide adequate capacity to supply them and this is the basis for its pro-
posed expansion program. The demand and energy requirement of each contract
are predicated on the load growth prospects of the respective utilities and
their requirements for purchased power. A reviEw of the individual situations
indicates that the contract amounts stipulated are reasonable.
7.04      In the case of the Light S.A. (Sao Paulo) Furnas undertakes to
supply a moderate annual increase until 1970 after which Furnas sales to
Sao Paulo would not be increased. CESP, the state owned utility, will bring
into service its 1,200 Mw Jupia hydroelectric plant in the period and will
supply all increases in the Sao Paulo demand after 1970. In 1967 the energy
demand of Light. S.A. in the city of Sao Paulo was 9.3 billion kwh and the
maximum demand was about 1.8 million kw.
7.05      In the case of Furnas' second largest consumer, Light S.A. sup-
plying the city of Rio de Janeiro, substantial supplies of energy were only
initiated in 1967; prior to this the company's own facilities were sufficient.
Furnas will supply the entire load growth of Rio in the future as it is the
policy of the Federal Government that Light S.A. should not build any new
generating stations. In 1967 the demand of Light S.A. in Rio was approximately
4 billion kwh and about 900 Mw. The Furnas contract for Rio de Janeiro and
Sao Paulo, together with the CESP contract for t;he supply of Sao Paulo,
provide for a load growth of about nine per cent; annually for the two cities
which is reasonable given the concentration of industry and population in
them.
7.o6      When the Furnas hydroelectric station with a capacity of 900 Mw
was built, it was agreed that Cemig would have a right to half the total
capacity or 450 Mw. Cemig has not exercised its rights to a significant
extent to date but in 1968 it will begin to purchase large blocks of Furnas
power, reaching its full 50% share by 1975. As considered in detail in the
companion appraisal report concerning the proposed loan to Cemig for a new
hydroelectric station, the overall expansion program of Cemig is justified
and the amounts and timing of the purchases from Furnas appropriate.



- 11 -
7.07      The remaining twio largest companies to which Furnas will sell power,
CPFL and CBEE are distribution subsidiaries of Eletrobras.   Both companies
are in the process of substantially expanding and. rehabilitating their dis-
tribution systems with the assistance of Loan 475-BR in the city of Niteroi
and environs, and Loan 477-BR in the CPFL service area covering much of the
State of Sao Paulo. A marked increase in demand is expected as the rehabili-
tation and expansion program progresses since load growth has been severely
curtailed by inadequate distribution facilities in the past. The average
annual growth rates of the CPFL and CDEE systems are forecast at nine per
cent and eight per cent respectively, which wouldL be adequate to absorb the
power which Furnas has contracted to supply.
System Capacity
7.08      Annex 1 sets forth a tabulation of existing and planned capacity and
Annexes 4 and 5 show in chart form the relationship between system capacity
and demand for both the peak and energy requirements. The latter indicate
that with the planned expansion program the capacity of the Furnas system
with respect to both peak capacity and energy would keep pace with the demand.
In the case of energy production the effect of very dry years is taken into
consideration and output of the hydroelectric plants and their energy capa-
bility is based on the experience in dry years, particularly 1953-56, and
for peak capacity, allowance has been made for equipment maintenance and
spinning reserve.
7.09      As noted in paragraph 1.04, Furnas and Cemig transport power over
345 kv systems which are fully integrated and supply about 60% of the south-
central market. A shortage of capacity experienced by either of these two
systems would in practice be compensated for by spare capacity, if available,
on the other system. A shortage of capacity in the balance of the south-
central systems, particularly the area served by CESP in the State of Sao
Paulo, would be made up by any spare capacity available from the combined
Furnas-Cemig systems. Annexes 6 and 7 show the total firm capacity and
demand of the combined Furnas-Cemig systems.
7.10      These charts show that the capacity and estimated demand of the
combined systems are in approximate balance for most of the period to 1975.
In 1974 on completion of the proposed project and the project proposed by
Cemig, which together would provide 760 Mw, the combined demand would be
approximately 4,000 Mw. The firm capacity reserve would be about 150 Mw
representing about four per cent of the demand on the combined systems, and
the firm energy reserve would be about 1 billion kwh or five per cent of the
total energy requirement.
7.11      This firm reserve is modest for a system of this magnitude.   It
would barely provide for delay in commissioning to full capacity of the
Furnas and/or Cemig projects, and in assisting the supply of the remainder
of the south-central region in the event of delay to the scheduled start of
operations in 1973/74 of the very large Ilha Solteira station of 1,700 Mw
capacity which is under construction by CESP. The construction of hydro-
electric projects has often been delayed in Brazil by physical, organizational,



- 12 -
and financial difficulties, and there is a possibility of delay to nha
Solteira, given its very large magnitude. The Federal Government, in view
of its predominant position in the power sector and its responsibility for
the national economy, and Furnas consider that it. may be advisable to bring
into operation additional generating facilities by 1974 to safeguard against
serious delay to Ilha Solteira, but will wait developments with regard to
the progress of construction during the next year before reaching a decision.
7.12      From the standpoint of the combined Furnas-Cemig systems, the
possibility of not attaining the demand indicated in Annexes 6 and 7 for
197h is more than offset by the possibility of delay in commissioning of
Porto Colombia, Volta Grande and particularly Ilha Solteira. If the projects
are not brought in service as presently planned, there would be a reduction
in the amount of load which could be carried on 1he interconnected south-
central system. In the case of Furnas, failure to provide the planned
capacity would necessitate an equivalent reduction in the amount of power
committed under supply contracts.
Canambra Forecast
7.13      The Canambra study concluded that load growth in the south-central
region would develop at an annual rate of between nine per cent and 11%/ and
accordingly it provided a high forecast at an 11% rate, a median forecast at
ten per cent and a low forecast at nine per cent for planning purposes. On
the basis of the region demand in 1967 and the lowest Canambra projection,
nine per cent, the expansion program underway, including the proposed Bank
projects, would just suffice to meet the 1974 demand when the proposed
projects are completed.
7.14      The possibility of this rate of growth being achieved is supported
by the Bank's 1968 Brazil Economic Mission which considered that the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of Brazil could likely increase at an annual rate of
approximately five and one half per cent between 1968 and 1970 and six per
cent in the following decade. Past experience in Brazil shows that the
annual increase in power demand in the south-central region is between one
and one half and two times that of the annual increase in GDP and on this
basis the annual increase in power demand should be at least nine per cent.
7.15      In view of the foregoing, the Furnas expansion program and the
Porto Colombia project are justified on the basis of individual utility
forecasts, Furnas contract commitments, the forecast of demand for the
region, and in the context of economic growth estimates. Additionally
the rate of return on the proposed project is adequate as noted in the
following paragraph.
Internal Rate of Return
7.16      Under Brazil tariff regulations utilities are authorized to earn
a ten per cent return on assets and are assured continuance of this return
when a new asset is placed in service. This has the effect of producing an
incremental rate of return in the order of ten per cent on new facilities.



- 13 -
Accurate analytical determination of the incremental return is limited by
the fact that given the high rate of inflation experienced in Brazil the
book value of assets does not necessarily reflect; real cost which raises
some question as to the tariff to be used in the calculation. Subject to
this limitation, the calculation as described in Annex 8 indicates an incre-
mental rate of return of 11.6% on the project. This is considered satis-
factory since the economic rate of return would be expected to be substan-
tially above the internal rate and thus would exceed the opportunity cost
of capital in Brazil which for the Canambra report was estimated to be
between eight and ten per cent. Moreover, in addition to the power rates
charged by the utilities certain taxes are levied on the consumers for in-
vestment in the electric power sector (Annex 9).
7.17      In a broader sense, given the relationship between GDP and growth
of the power sector (paragraph 7.14), failure to develop the sector to keep
pace with expected GDP would result in some deterioration of the economy.
This was evident during 1961-64 when political developments and the failure
of the Government to allow adequate tariffs to be levied resulted in a
virtual cessation of expansion of electric utility facilities leading to the
inability of utilities to make an adequate supply of power available to new
industry in the south-central region. Partly as a consequence of this, new
industrial development was stagnant in the period.
Alternative Sources of Capacity
7.18      The proposed projects represent the most economic form in which
additional generating capacity can be provided. Canambra made a study of
alternative sources in which it was shown that the ideal alternative, mixed
hydro-thermal development, in which minimum cost hydro peaking would be
installed at existing stations to complement new thermal plant operated at
high load factor to yield power at system load factor at minimum cost, would
equalize Porto Colombia at a discount rate of approximately 11%. This is
evidence of the low unit cost of Porto Colombia and the comparatively high
cost of imported fuel oil, taxes excluded, in Brazil, amounting to US$0.46
per million Btu and is characteristic of hydroelectric sites in the south-
central region recommended for development by Canambra.
8. TARIFFS
8.01      In recent years many changes have occurred in Brazilian legislation
relating to tariffs for the power sector. Such changes were brought about
because of inflation in Brazil and the past inability of electric utilities
to obtain a reasonable rate of return. Thus they were unable to generate
a sufficient portion of funds necessary for normal expansion of facilities.
A detailed description of the tariff regulations and other related subjects
is included in Annex 9.



- 14 -
8.02      Under the present legislation, the system is working well.  Most
of the major power utilities have been achieving a reasonable rate of return.
As a result they are generating funds which are being used for construction
purposes and, with the assistance of additional funds from the Government
and foreign loans, a broad expansion in the power sector is taking place
which is necessary to meet the increasing demands for power.
8.03      Revaluation of assets (see Annex 9, paragraph 4), which reflects
inflation, is now mandatory, but applications for tariff increases based
on such revaluations remain voluntary. The Bank is protected by three
provisions in the existing and proposed Loan and Guarantee Agreements as
follows:
(a) A requirement that Furnas will make applications for rate adjust-
ments, based on revaluations, within five months after the end of
every calendar year so that its rates will be sufficient to ensure
operations in accordance with sound financial and public utility
practice.
(b) A requirement that the Government of Brazil shall cause agencies
with jurisdiction over Furnas' rates to act on rate applications
within a period of not more than 30 days after their receipt.
(c) An event of suspension and cancellation in case the applicable
legislation is changed materially and adversely affecting the
Borrower's business.
8.0h      During the years 1965 through 1968 Furnas promptly filed applications
and promptly received authorizations for rate increases based on revalued
assets. The rate structure of Furnas which sells power at wholesale is the
same for each of its seven customers (Annex 3).
9. PAST OPERATIONS
9.01      Income statements for the three years 1965 through 1967 are shown
in Annex 10. During this period kwh sales increased substantially from kwh
2,678 million in 1965 to kwh 4,374 million in 1967. Tariffs were increased
each year following revaluation of assets. The average rate per kwh in-
creased from NCr$0.01758 in 1965 to NCr$0.02788 in 1967, or an increase of
about 59%.
9.02      Operating income of Furnas and the rate of return earned on
remunerable investment as defined in Annex 9 (paragraph 2) for the three
years were as followis:
Operating Income          Rate of
Year                   (thousand NCr$)          Return
1965                       23,966                 7.0%
1966                       38,939                 10.1
1967                       59,019                 9.2



- 15 -
9.03      Rates of return calculated in accordance with the test applied by
the Bank under Loan 403-474 BR to ascertain whether any changes in legislation
materially and adversely affect the financial position of Furnas, show returns
of 11.8%, 1L.9% and 14.3% for the years 1965, 1966 and 1967 respectively.
The Bank's test is based on a minimum rate of return of ten per cent per
annum calculated as the percentage of operating income (adjusted for straight-
line depreciation at a two and one half per cent rate and excluding income
taxes and amortization from cost of service) to the average of the revalued
net fixed assets in operation at the beginning and end of the year. Net
fixed assets at the beginning of the year are revalued on the basis of the
coefficient applicable to the value of such assets at December 31 of the
prior year, and net fixed assets in operation at the end of the year are
revalued on the basis of the coefficient applicable to December 31 of the
current year. The rate of return on remunerable investment calculated by
Furnas is less than the return calculated under the Bank's test, primarily
because it charged depreciation at five per cent, amortization at three per
cent, and included income taxes as a cost of service.
9.04      Interest coverage, which was only 1.3 times in 1965, improved to
2.1 times in 1966 and 2.9 times in 1967 because of higher earnings resulting
from increased sales at higher tariffs based on revalued assets.
10. PRESENT FINAICIAL POSITION
10.01     Furnas' financial statements have been audited since 1958 by the
Brazilian branch of Arthur Andersen and Company, a United States firm of
Certified Public Accountants. These arrangements have been satisfactory.
In order to assure that adequate auditing continues in the future, a covenant
similar to that contained in existing loans requiring Furnas to employ
auditors acceptable to the Bank is included in the proposed Loan Agreement.
10.02     As provided in Schedule 2 of Loan Agreement 403-474 BR, Furnas
contracted with Arthur Andersen and Company to reorganize the accounting
department, train accounting personnel and supervise the installation of
a computerized accounting system. This contract has been completed. All
accounting, statistics, and budgeting by areas of responsibility have been
computerized. In furtherance of its training program, Furnas intends to
send some of its accounting trainees to the United States for advanced training
and experience.
10.03     The financial position of Furnas as of December 1967 is shown in
Annex 11. The following summary balance sheets, presented below, show the
actual audited data and the effect of revaluing Furnas' accounts based on
the latest published coefficient and a foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to
US$1.

10.04     In February 1968 the Government issued the coefficient of 1.22
for revaluation purposes and Furnas revalued its assets accordingly in April
1968 and at the same time Furnas revalued its foreign loans on the basis
of the exchange rate of NCr$2.715 to US$1 as of ])ecember 31, 1967.
10.05     The official foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1 (see Annex
9, paragraph 4) although published on December 213, 1967 was not effective
until January 4, 1968. In order to show in this appraisal report a more
realistic financial position as of December 31, 1L967 the foreign loans were
again revalued based on this exchange rate.
10.06     Total revalued fixed assets at December 31, 1967 amount to NCr$1,172
million or about 95% of Furnas' total assets. The amount is more than double
the total fixed assets at the end of 1966. This large increase consisted of
three elements: (1) increase in construction worlc during the year; (2) re-
valuation of assets; and (3) acquisition of Companhia Hidreletrica do Vale
do Paraiba's (Chevap) assets.
10.07     Chevap was granted a concession by Decree 50,798 dated June 16,
1961 for developing the hydroelectric potential of the Paraiba River in-
cluding the Funil project, located at the boundary of the States of Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Additional concessions were granted to Chevap for
the construction of the Santa Cruz thermal generation plant in the State of
Guanabara in 1963 and for a transmission line from the Funil plant to the
Sao Paulo Light system in 1965. However, on August 30, 1965, the Government
rescinded these concessions and placed the properties under the control and
ownership of Eletrobras. On March 10, 1967, the Government, by Decree 60,350,
transferred the former Chevap concessions and assets from Eletrobras to Furnas.
Complying with Section 5.11 of Loan Agreement 403-h74 BR, Furnas obtained the
Bank's consent to absorb the assets and obligations relating to the Chevap
concessions.
10.08     Furnas' balance sheet at the end of any year usually reflects a
weak current financial position. Actual balance sheets for the years ending
in 1965 through 1967, see Annex 11, indicate current ratios of less than
0.50/1.00. Nevertheless Furnas has always been able to meet its current
obligations. The working capital position at December 31 generally reflects
the worst current position for any 12-month period because many of the current
liabilities are not due for payment until six to twelve months later.
10.09     At December 31, 1967, Furnas' total equity was about NCr$h53.1
million, about 37% of the total assets. Included in the equity is about
NCr$85.6 million representing the reserve for future capital increase.
This reserve, resulting from revaluation of accounts, will be converted
into share capital in 1968 by the issue of additional stock.
10.10     Total debt is NCr$693.0 million, classified as long-term debt of
NCr$674.8 million, and NCr$18.2 million as long-term debt due within one
year. A detailed schedule of individual loans is shown in Annex 12. Long-
term debt at December 31, 1967, was about 59% of the total fixed assets.



- 18 -
This is well within the 66-2/3% debt limitation as provided in Section 5.16
of Loan Agreement 403-474 BR.  A similar debt limitation covenant is included
in the proposed Loan Agreement.
10.11     Included in long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1967, is
a US-AID loan to partially finance the Furnas/Guanabara Transmission ',roject
including substations and equipment. A particulzr covenant in this Loan
Agreement, number 512-L-023 dated October 2, 1964, is Section 6.3 subpara-
graph (i) which requires US-AID's prior approval before Furnas may incur
any additional debt maturing in more than twelve months. This approval has
been received.
11. PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN
11.01     A forecast of the source and application of funds for the eight-year
period 1968 through 1975 as shown in Annex 13, arLd the plan for financing
this expansion program over the period are summarized in the following table.
As shown in this table total funds required for the eight-year period are
estimated at about NCr$1,976.0 million. Under the present expansion program,
estimated construction expenditures excluding interest charged to construction
amount to about NCr$1,693.2 million, or about 86% of the total requirement
of funds. The proposed Porto Colombia project is estimated to cost about
NCr$224.8 million or about 13% of the construction expenditures during this
eight-year period. A detailed schedule showing the estimated foreign and
local costs of the various projects included in the expansion program is
shown in Annex 14. The remainder balance of the required funds consists
of about NCr$250.8 million for interest charged to construction and about
NCr$32.0 million for increases in working capita]..

11.02     Based on the revenue forecast as shoarn. in the income statements,
Annex 10, about NCr$474.3 million, or 24% of the required funds is expected
to be provided from Furnas' internal cash generation after payment of interest
charged to operations, amortization of long-term debt, dividends and bonuses.
The balance of the required funds is expected to be provided by long-term
borrowmings and additional equity investment. Annex 13 shows a detailed

11.03     With the exceptions of the proposed Bank Loan for the Porto Colombia
project and the future loans for the Marimbondo project, all borrowed funds
for the eight-year expansion program will be provided from existing loans.
Total borrowings have been estimated at about NCr$1,087.2 million of which
68% is expected from foreign sources and 32% from local sources. Estimated
yearly drawdowns on these loans are shown in the source and application of
funds statements, Annex 13. There is only one small suppliers credit among
the existing foreign loans, bearing interest at seven per cent, and which
is amortized over a three-year period. The remaining foreign loans from
the Bank and AID have extended amortization periods ranging from 15 to 22
years. Interest rates on these loans vary from five and one half per cent
to six and one half per cent.
11.04     For the purposes of this report, it has been assumed that the terms
of the proposed Bank Loan for the Porto Colombia project would be: six and
one half year grace period, 81g2 year amortization period, and interest at
six and one half per cent. The same terms have been assumed for the future
foreign loan in respect to the Marimbondo project.
11.05     All local borrowings are from Eletrobras.   Of these, a small loan
for minor works represents Inter-American Develcpment Bank (IDB) funds
loaned to Eletrobras and reloaned to Furnas. Terms of this loan to Furnas
were six and one fourth per cent interest and an amortization period of 11
years. The other Eletrobras loans have interest, rates between eight and one
half per cent and 13% and amortization periods of 15 and 20 years. The future
Eletrobras loan for the Marimbondo project has been included in the financial
projections as a 25-year loan including a six-year grace period with interest
at 13% corresponding to the rate charged by Eletrobras during the past few
years.
11.06     Detailed schedules of the annualinterest and amortization payments
for all these loans have been included in Annex 15, Interest Schedule, and
Annex 16, Amortization Schedule.
11.07     Additional equity investments during the eight-year period ending
December 31, 1975 are estimated at about NCr$414.9 million. These equ'ity
investments represent the reinvestment of 85% of the dividends paid. Furnas
intends to declare a five per cent dividend semiannually. Recipients of
these dividends are subject to a 15% tax of the amount of the dividend. As
a matter of convenience, Furnas pays the tax directly to the Government and
records it as part of the cash dividend paid. The balance of the dividend
is recorded as paid to the shareholders, who immediately reinvest the amount
in Furnas and receive a similar amount in additional shares. Since 85% of
the total dividends will be immediately reinvested, Furnas could consider
these transactions as stock dividends which would have had no effect on
the balance sheet. However, in this event, the summary funds statement on
page 19 would show Furnas' net internal cash generation to be about 45.0%
of the total capital requirements instead of only 24.0%.



- 22 -
11.08     The proposed financial plan is reasonable.  Assurances are provided
in the proposed Guarantee Agreement that in the event of a shortage of funds
the Government would provide Furnas with the necessary funds to carry out
the Bank project.
12. ESTIMATED FUTURE OPERATIONS
12.01     Forecast income statements for the eight-year period 1968 through
1975 are included in Annex 10. This forecast is based on the assumption
that Furnas achieves the permitted rate of return of ten per cent on its
remunerable investment. Foreign exchange expenditures have been cast in
terms of the official foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1 effective
January 4, 1968. Normal increases in operating costs have been considered,
but no provision has been made for future loss of value of the cruzeiro as
most of the effects are provided for under the tariff arrangements and
adjustments for inflation, see Annex 9, (paragraph 3).
12.02     In 1968 Furnas intends to charge five per cent for depreciation and
three per cent for amortization and these amount;s will be included in the
cost of service recovered by increased tariffs. These high rates are being
applied because of the need for construction funds in 1968 especially in
regard to construction costs relating to the former Chevap properties.
Furnas plans to reduce the depreciation rate to four per cent during the
years 1969 through 1971 and to three and one half per cent during the
years 1972 through 1975. Depreciation at these rates has been included in
the forecast income statements. Amortization charges will be discontinued
after 1968.
12.03     The estimated kwh sold during the eight-year period are based on
the sales contracts with Furnas' consumers as described in paragraph 7.01
and shown in Annex 3. The average rate per kwh is projected to increase
from NCr$0.02788 in 1967 to NCr$0.03351 in 1968 primarily because of tariff
increases resulting from the April 1968 revaluaticn of assets. The average
rate per kwh is expected to increase again in 19369 because of the addition
of the Estreito and Funil hydroelectric plants to the rate base. Thereafter,
the estimated average rate per kwh generally tends to decrease, reaching its
low point of NCr$0.02335 in 1975.
12.04     Projected operating income increases from NCr$74.2 million in 1968
to NCr$200.6 million in 1973, and then decreases in 1974 and 1975. Operating
income decreases after 1973 because no large plants are placed in service in
1974 and 1975 and the remunerable investment during these years decreases
due to the annual depreciation charge. After the large Marimbondo plant,
which will have been under construction for several years, is placed in
operation and included in the remunerable investment, the operating income
will again show a substantial increase. This will be the normal pattern of
Furnas' operating income. It will show increases in the years when large
plants will be added to plant in service followed by years of decreases.



- 23 -
As a hydroelectric producer and wholesaler with no distribution properties,
Furnas engages in major construction projects which make no contribution
to operating income until the year in which they are placed in service.
12.05     Interest coverage of 1.2 times in 1968 is very low because of a
high depreciation charge and the inclusion of a three per cent amortization
charge. Excluding the amortization charge and recording a normal depreciation
charge of two and one half per cent, the interest coverage for 1968 would
have been about 2 times. The estimated interest coverage is 1.9 times in
1969 and decreases to 1.6 times during the three years 1973 through 1975.
12.06     Operations are expected to result in annual increases in surplus
after appropriations for legal reserve, dividends and bonuses. Annexes 10
and 11 show the ending balance of surplus each year, increasing from about
NCr$10.5 million in 1968 to about NCr$239.7 million in 1975. As indicated
in the forecast source and application of funds statements, Annex 13, debt
service coverage is about 2.1 times in 1969 and averages abcut 1.5 during
the following six years.
12.07     The percentage of total long-term debt, to total fixed assets is
expected to reach its highest level of 61.5% by the end of 1969. It remains
at about 60% during the next three years, and then decreases annually to
an estimated 53.5% by the end of 1975.
13. CONCLUSIONS
13.01     The project is technically sound and will provide facilities
necessary to meet the expected demand for power.. Estimates of cost are
reasonable and arrangements for engineering construction and procurement
are appropriate. The financing plans are satisfactory.
13.02     Furnas is operating satisfactorily and has made good progress in
improving staff, organization and methods.
13.03     The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$22.3 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of six and one half years.

PORTO COLOMBIA PROJECT
Internal Rate of Return.
1.        The internal rate of return of the Porto Colombia project
was determined as follows, and is the discount rate at which the
present worth of the cost of the project equals the present worth of
the revenue producedl by it over its life.
2.        For this purpose the pertinent information is as follows:
A. The capital cost of the project is shown in Annex 15.
B.  The life of the project is 40 years.
C. The annual net revenue is the annual gross revenue less
operating costs. Annual gross revenue is equal to the
annual kilowatt hours sales attributed to the project
multiplied by the applicable tariff.
D. The annual kilowatt hours figure was determined by
apportioning the total sales of Furnas to the respective
plants in accordance with the estimated operating con-
ditions and is estimated at 1.28 billion kwuh for Porto
Colombia. This would involve operation at about the
firm plant factor of Porto Colombiia and is conservative
given that during normal hydrological years the output
would be somewhat higher.
E. The tariff employed is 0.023 NCr. per kilowatt hour
corresponding to that estimated in 1975, the first
year of full operation. This is substantially less
than that in the immediately preceding years, the reduc-
tion being due primarily to the effect on tariffs of
the large asset changes resulting from the almost con-
tinuous construction program.  The tariff is conservative
therefore. Annual gross revenue amounts to 29.4 million
NCr. Gross operating expenses were determined as 3.3
million NCr. annually.
3.        On the basis of the above it was determined that the present
worth of capital costs would equal the present worth of the revenues
over a forty year period at a discount rate of 11.9%.

Tariffs
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water Cobde
of 1934, subsequent amendments and decrees including decrees dated February
26, 1957 and November 4, 1964 and Law 5,073 enacted on August 18, 1966.
Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic value of invest-
ment, thereby not reflecting the substantial inf:Lation that occurred in Brazil.
The 1964 decree allows utilities to revalue thei:r investment to reflect changes
in price levels. The 1966 legislation made year:Ly revaluations of assets
mandatory.
2.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Waters Division of the Ministry of Mines and Energy every three years
or at shorter intervals at the initiative of the W4aters Division or the
utility.  Utilities are permitted to apply for tariffs which would yield
revenues covering (a) operating costs including income taxes; (b) straight-
line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, excluding land and land
rights, at annual rates of up to eight per cent for thermal plants and up to
five per cent for all other facilities including hydro plants, but with no
minima in either case; (c) a reversion provision of three per cent or an
amortization provision of up to five per cent, on the total gross fixed
assets in operation; and (d) a return of ten per cent on the remunerable
investment. Remunerable investment is defined as the book value of the
estimated end of year gross plant in service (excluding assets acquired
through contributions in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion
or amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds and an end-of-
year allowance for working capital consisting of materials and supplies,
receivables equivalent to two months' billings, and cash (up to the value
of the reserve for depreciation balance) excluding cash representing contri-
butions in aid of construction. In principle, shortfalls in achieving the
return of ten per cent in the three-year tariff period may be recovered in
the subsequent three-year period. However, another provision in the regu-
lations permits tariff adjustments for recovering shortfalls at more frequent
intervals.
3.        WVithout advance approval of the Waters Division surcharges between
tariff revisions may be added by utilities to current tariffs to cover com-
pulsory increases in wages, social benefits, cost of fuel and purchased power,
and for increases in foreign debt service due to changes in the foreign ex-
change rate. Effective with the billings for the month of January, 1968
Furnas adjusted its rates to reflect the increased cost of interest and
amortization on foreign loans based on the latest official exchange rate
of NCr$3.22 to US$1.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of reva].uation of balance sheet
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients)
showing the variations in the price level are published. The coefficients
are issued annually about one or two months after the end of each year for



ATNEX 9
Page 2
the use of industry in general.   The coefficients are applied by utilities
to update the values of plant in service, depreciation and amortization or
reversion reserves, and certain local currency loans of the National Devel-
opment Bank and Eletrobras. Increased tariffs resulting from revaluation of
assets based on coefficients do not, however, completely offset the effects
of inflation. In any given year construction expenditures incurred in the
immediate prior year are not revalued.   Furthermore, the effects of inflat'cn
in the current year are not recognized because utility plant is revalued as
of the beginning of that year. In addition, no price level adjustment is
made for shortfalls in earnings which are to be recovered in succeeding years.
Foreign currency components of the book value of fixed assets are converted
into local currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets
are acquired. At the same time as the application of the coefficient, but in
lieu of the use of the coefficient, Furnas, as i.s permitted, adjusts its
assets constructed with foreign currency to changes in exchange rates as
applied to its foreign debts. This adjustment as of December 31, 1967 did
not reflect in remunerable investment the full impact of changes in the
official exchange rate because the rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1 although published
on December 28, 1967 was not effective until Jaruary 4, 1968.   However, the
higher debt service on foreign loans was provided for in a surcharge. As
offsets to these factors, it must be recognized that cost of service for a
given year is related to remunerable investment as of the end of the year
and that both cost of service (which includes taxes on income) and remuner-
able investment are based on estimated projections. Furnas in its tariff
applications makes adjustments to reflect the fact that rates for a given
period do not go into effect until some four or five months after the close
of the calendar year. Furthermore, as indicated. in paragraph 2 above, liberal
allowances are permitted for depreciation and am!ortization.
5.        In addition to a basic tariff and surcharges, consumers pay three
other charges. The Federal Government levies two charges to raise additional
resources for the financing of power development., a tax called the Imposto
Unico (sole tax), which varies among consumer classes, and the Emprestito
Compulsorio (compulsory loan), which is equal irn amount to the sole tax.
These amount to some 20-25% of the charge for service except for certain
groups (such as rural users) who are exempt. The proceeds of the sole tax,
which was first imposed in 195h, are distributed, after retention of five
per cent by the Ministry of Finance, as follows:: 39% to the Federal Electri-
fication Fund, administered by Eletrobras; 50% to the States; ten per cent
to the municipalities; and one per cent to the Mlinistry of Mines and Energy
to cover collection costs. The compulsory loan, introduced in 1962 and
scheduled to be discontinued at the end of 1973, is administered by Eletrobras
and invested in power projects as share capital or as loans generally with a
13% effective rate of interest.   Consumers receive debt certificates for the
amount of the compulsory loan they pay; the certificates are revalued annually,
pay six per cent interest, and are repayable in 20 years. Finally, the total
rate for power includes a social security tax amounting to ten per cent of
the charge for service.
