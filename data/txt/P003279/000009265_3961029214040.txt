IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ZIMBABWE: SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
Loan Number 2533-ZIM
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Small Scale Enterprise
Project in Zimbabwe, for which loan 2533-ZIM in the amount of US$ 10 million equivalent was
approved on August 8, 1985 and made effective on August 1, 1986. The loan was scheduled to
close on December 31, 1992 and actually closed on June 30, 1994. Final disbursement took
place on November 3, 1994, at which time a balance of US$ 332,000 was canceled.
This ICR was prepared by Mark Dorfman and Dambisa Moyo in the Southern Africa
Macro, Industry and Finance Division of the Africa region and reviewed by Ataman Aksoy,
Division Chief, and Judith Edstrom, Project Adviser. Granny Seape (Intern) prepared an earlier
draft based on a different format. The Borrower provided comments that are included as an
appendix.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's mission from March 13-24, 1995.
It is based, inter ali on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project
Agreements; Supervision Reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda. Upon completion, the Borrower will have contributed to preparation
of the ICR by: (i) reviewing major points included in the report; (ii) providing SEDCO and
subloan data; and (iii) preparing the Borrowers' Assessment section.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ZIMBABWE: SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
Loan Number 2533-ZIM
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.           At independence in 1980, Zimbabwe had strong infrastructure, a well developed
financial sector and a relatively high per capita income (US$780). Although the Government had been
pursuing economic policies supporting an inward orientation, in 1983 it established the Small Enterprise
Development Corporation (SEDCO) to provide financial assistance, training and management counseling
to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). From the time SEDCO was founded until 1991, the policy
environment continued to favor existing enterprises, inhibiting entry and the broadening of participation.
While Zimbabwe's economy developed a diversified manufacturing base and achieved overall growth of
about 3 percent per annum, growth rates only kept pace with population growth and achieved virtually no
increase in employment. With liberalization through the Economic Structural Adjustment Program
(ESAP) in 1991 and subsequent policy reforms, the Government took more aggressive measures to
reduce entry barriers to SMEs. The hope then and now is that SMEs would help broaden economic
participation and thereby increase employment.
Project Objectives
2.           Objectives. This was the first World Bank loan made to support SMEs in Zimbabwe,
aimed at supporting SEDCO in carrying out its mission. The objectives stipulated in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) were: (i) institution building, through the strengthening of the SEDCO, (establishing and
strengthening small businesses could be effectively achieved if SEDCO was a strong intermediary); (ii)
employment creation; and (iii) broad-based socio-economic development through establishing and
strengthening SMEs. The project objectives were clear.
3.           Components and Covenants. The project had three components: (i) a US$ 8.5 million
line of credit destined for SMEs; (ii) a technical assistance component of US$ 0.6 million to provide
training for SEDCO employees; and, (iii) a construction study of US$ 0.9 million to assess opportunities
for small construction. Important loan covenants included: (a) SEDCO would appoint two experts--an
Operations Adviser and a Technical Adviser; (b) the Government would pay into SEDCO an annual
equity contribution of Z$5 million; and (c) SEDCO would have audited accounts prepared in accordance
with Bank requirements.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.           Achievement of Project Objectives was mixed: Institution building was achieved as
SEDCO staff received training through the technical assistance component of the project, which later led
to improvements in SEDCO's operations (better quality staff, more efficient project appraisals, and some
reduction in the percentage of loan arrears at that time). However, training offered by SEDCO to its
borrowers had been mixed, based on SEDCO's own institutional capacity.
5.           Employment creation data in May, 1995 suggests that 1,095 jobs have been created by
subloans supported by the project. A separate review in 1994 suggested that, according to subloan
applications for approved projects, over 5,000 jobs were to have been created under funded subloans. If
one assumes that approximately 50% of loans were non-recoverable (see below) and of this amount, only
1/5 of the non-recoverable loans could be recouped through collateral seizures and sales, then 40% of the
$8.5 million credit line or $3.4 million would have been lost, not recovered and the Government would
have to repay to IBRD. Based on this methodology, the cost of the 1,095 jobs above would have been
about US$3,100 per job, excluding interest on the IBRD loan. This could be considered a moderate cost
per job based on that projected in the SAR and generally relatively high cost-effectiveness.



- ii-
6.           Achievement of socio-economic development through establishing and strengthening
SMEs was also mixed. Of 470 enterprises projected, 246 were supported under the loan and data on the
subsequent economic circumstances of such enterprises is limited. Of the subloans which still remained
on SEDCO's books (end-February 1995), approximately 55% were either not servicing their loans or
servicing but not paying on time, suggesting that borrowers have financial difficulties and thus the
subloans have resulted in limited socio-economic impact. As SEDCO estimates that 70% of subprojects
were successfully implemented and performing well, this suggests a positive result.
7.           Achievement of Financial Objectives. The loan significantly increased the SEDCO's
funds for onlending and thus was able to support SMEs formerly without funding as such. In terms of
yielding a sustainable result, SEDCO's portfolio losses have compromised its ability to fully use loan
repayments to project itself on a sustainable footing. Such losses, corroborated by figures indicating
SEDCO's net lending, indicate SEDCO's dependency upon new capital injections. Numerous measures
were taken to improve loan collections as well as to improve loan initiation. In some cases, loan arrears
rates did improve, albeit increased significantly in the early 1990s as the effects of adjustment made the
business environment more turbulent and thus increased the risks of financial difficulties or bankruptcy
for SMEs.
8.           Bank Performance. The Bank did a satisfactory job in preparing and supervising this
project. The difficulties in the project had more to do with the shortcomings in its design than in its
execution. The project was developed in 1985 when the models for financial intermediary loans tended to
support intermediation through State-owned institutions with credit targeted, in this case to SMEs.
However, the Bank could have: (i) supported measures to support financing to SMEs through
commercial institutions in addition to SEDCO; (ii) achieved greater clarity as to financial performance
requirements and monitoring indicators for SEDCO; (iii) sought to address the other policy and
institutional barriers to SME development under the project; and (iv) remedied SEDCO's transport
problems limiting SEDCO's rural outreach.
9.            Borrower Performance.  SEDCO sought to and succeeded at developing a loan
origination, approval, monitoring and recovery capacity in-house. These functions appear to have been
conducted professionally with the sincerest of intent. Project appraisals included detailed submissions
and reviews of the financial position and projections of prospective borrowers, assessments of
management, labor issues, competitive analysis and even site visits. After some struggle, SEDCO did
develop and put into place a strong computer monitoring system for the arrears. The maintenance of
clean external audits throughout the project is a laudable accomplishment.
10.          SEDCO's performance was hampered by limited Government commitment which
contributed to implementation difficulties. Stronger support by Government could have been provided
guidance on interest rate policy, assisted with committed capital, reinforced SEDCO's debt-recovery
authority, provided strategic guidance for SEDCO and supported policy changes supporting SMEs.
Moreover, little integrated vision was evident in the process of approving other Government and donor
initiatives for similar credit support. Long delays were also experienced in the approval process for legal
matters with parent ministries.
11.          Thus in spite of the best intent, SEDCO experienced difficulties throughout the project,
the greatest being high arrears in its loan portfolio, both for funds financed under the project as well as
credits financed out of its own capital. These problems in arrears reflected: (i) macroeconomic changes,
including dramatic effects of drought and exchange rate movements which adversely affected SMEs, (ii)
limitations in SEDCO staffing, particularly early in the project, and (iii) some weaknesses in accounting
and credit management information systems. Other difficulties experienced also reflected limited
Governmental support of the institution.
12.          Project Outcome. The overall project outcome has been satisfactory. The project more
or less achieved its major objectives, although there were shortcomings in the project's design more than



- iii -
in its execution. Although economic rates of return have not been calculated for subprojects financed,
net present value calculations were undertaken by SEDCO. If one looks at the cost-effectiveness of jobs
resulting under the project and the number of enterprises supported, the project is moderately
satisfactory. While the results in terms of sustainability of SEDCO are poor, sustainability at the firm
level is likely satisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
13.          Continuation of SME Lending. Liberalization and adjustment measures undertaken
since 1991 significantly altered the policy environment for SMEs, reducing barriers and increasing
incentives. Banking institutions however, remain reluctant to fund SMEs due to the risks and higher
transactions costs involved. SME lending thus needs to be facilitated by examining and supporting the
mechanisms by which commercial financing becomes available. SEDCO could continue to have an
impact on the financing for SMEs but its own financial position has limited its impact. A recent policy
decision to separate technical assistance to SMEs from financing as well as to consider private capital for
SEDCO are both measures which might increase SEDCO's effectiveness.
14.          Future Operations. Although the Bank has not worked with the Borrower to prepare a
plan for the continued and future operation of SEDCO, SEDCO management has undertaken such an
analysis. The Bank's approach to reaching the objectives in this project has changed considerably from
the time when this project was developed. For the same reason, there are not performance indicators to
judge the future success of this project. Preparation was begun during 1993-1994 on a subsequent
second Small Scale Enterprise Project and agreement ultimately was not reached as to its design. In late
1994, discussions began on a new IDA project, an Enterprise Development Credit that would provide a
broader array of both financing and business services as well as aim to address difficulties faced by
exporters in addition to SMEs.
15.          Lessonsfor Future Projects. The main lessons for future projects are:
* Provision of credit to SMEs cannot lead to a sustainable result unless the macro, policy and
institutional barriers to SME development are also addressed. While financing is often a constraint
(as in this case), other barriers often limit enterprise development, such as entry barriers; distribution
systems giving exclusive privilege to existing companies; and limited information networks which
enterprises need in order to thrive. Project preparation should include identification of the principal
constraints to SME development and the project should address these constraints in a comprehensive
fashion;
* Critical to the success of support measures for SMEs is vision for the SME sector, a strategy to
achieve the objectives of that vision; and strong commitment by the Bank, Government and other
stakeholders to that strategy;
* Using a single financial intermediary such as SEDCO can help to develop expertise in SME lending,
but does not result in the establishment of such expertise in the commercial marketplace on a
sustainable basis. Intermediation through a unique intermediary such as SEDCO should be avoided.
If a state-owned institution such as SEDCO is chosen, the project should foresee a medium-term
alternative, such as privatization of the institution or the supplementing and eventual replacement of
the institution's functions by commercial means;
# Whether through one or more intermediaries, on-lending access by retail institutions should require
continuing compliance with explicit eligibility criteria including both financial performance (solvency
and efficiency) as well as a qualitative capacity to effectively lend to the SME sector;
# To the degree possible, lending and technical assistance to SMEs may need to be separate functions to
ensure that borrowers feel the correct set of incentives; and
* Lending rates both to and from intermediaries should be comparable to market rates and positive in
real terms to avoid financial and real market distortions.






PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Project Objectives
I.          The objectives of the Small Scale Enterprise project as stipulated in the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) were: (i) institution-building through the strengthening of SEDCO
(establishing and strengthening small businesses could be effectively achieved if SEDCO was a
strong intermediary); (ii) employment creation; and (iii) broad-based socio-economic
development through establishing and strengthening small and medium scale enterprises. Loan
2533-ZIM provided funding to SEDCO to assist it in financing SME participation in
Zimbabwe's economy. The project aimed to provide urgently needed financial assistance,
training and management counseling to small-scale entrepreneurs and thus generate employment.
2.          The context of pursuing the project's objectives were that the Government in
1983 had established SEDCO to provide financial assistance, training and management
counseling to small and medium commercial and industrial enterprises. The policy framework,
however, since independence had supported an inward orientation which favored existing
enterprises, inhibiting entry and the broadening of participation.  Zimbabwe's economy
developed a diversified manufacturing base and achieved overall growth of about 3 percent per
annum from the import substitution policies. However, growth rates only kept pace with
population growth and achieved virtually no increase in employment.  As time passed,
Zimbabwe's economy experienced a downturn and per capita income stagnated.  With
liberalization through the ESAP in 1991 and subsequent policy reforms, the Government of
Zimbabwe took more aggressive measures to reduce entry barriers to SMEs. The hope then and
now is that through broadened economic participation, SMEs would increase employment and
broaden the local manufacturing base. Thus, the project sought to support SMEs through
financing while the policy environment remained discriminatory towards their development.
3.          The project had three main components: (i) a US$ 8.5 million line of credit to
finance SMEs; (ii) a technical assistance component of US$ 0.6 million to provide training to
SEDCO employees; and (iii) a construction study of US$ 0.9 million to assess opportunities for
small construction companies. It was anticipated that the project would provide support to an
estimated 470 SMEs and create approximately 4,000 jobs.
4.          The project had three modifications during implementation: (i) a sub-loan was
approved to assist with a transportation problem at SEDCO. This problem had a direct effect on
SEDCO's program to increase the collection of outstanding arrears; (ii) the free limit for
Borrower loan approval was increased from US$50,000 to US$100,000 in July, 1988; and (iii)
because the minimum owner equity participation criteria for projects (15% owner's equity in
relation to the project amount) proved too stringent and therefore excluded otherwise attractive
sub-projects, SEDCO management lowered the amount to 10% for co-operatives.
B.   Achievement of Project Objectives
5.          The operation's goal of providing financial support to SMEs by expanding access
to long-term credit was clear. The project objectives ("i"-"iii" in para. I above) were defined and
targeted towards achieving this goal. Achievement of these objectives however, was mixed.
Institution building was achieved as SEDCO staff receive training through the technical
assistance component of the project, which later led to improvements in SEDCO's operations



-2-
(better quality staff, more efficient project appraisals, and some reduction in the percentage of
loan arrears at that time). However, training offered from SEDCO to borrowers had been mixed,
based on the institutional capacity of SEDCO affected by high staff turnover.
6.          A small sample of SEDCO subborrowers interviewed in a 1994 survey' expressed
concerns that the loan application process slow, with in some cases clients waiting 12-18 months
for responses from SEDCO2. In the same survey, cases were cited where by the time a loan was
approved, the cost of the equipment the loan was intended to purchase had increased
significantly yet the credit amount could not be increased in the same way. A third and related
complaint was that many of the subborrowers only received a fraction of the loan amount
requested. Consequently, SEDCO did provide financial assistance to many SMEs, but the loans
were less effective since the subborrowers had to find additional funding elsewhere to meet their
requirements. Finally, many of the subborrowers received little or no technical assistance. Some
borrowers felt that SEDCO had inadequate training in small business management.
7.          Employment creation data in May, 1995 suggests that 1,095 jobs have been
created by subloans supported by the project. A separate review in 1994 suggested that,
according to subloan applications for approved projects, over 5,000 jobs were to have been
created under funded subloans. If one assumes that approximately 50% of loans were non-
recoverable (see below) and of this amount, only 1/5 of the non-recoverable loans could be
recouped through collateral seizures and sales, then 40% of the $8.5 million credit line or $3.4
million would have been lost, not recovered and the Government would have to repay to IBRD.
Based on this methodology, the cost of the 1,095 jobs above would have been about US$3,100
per job, excluding interest on the IBRD loan. This could be considered a moderate cost per job
based on that projected in the SAR and generally relatively high cost-effectiveness.
8.          Achievement of the third objective, socio-economic development through
establishing and strengthening SMEs, was also mixed. Of 470 enterprises projected, 246 were
supported under the loan and data on the subsequent economic circumstances of such enterprises
is limited. Of the subloans which still remained on SEDCO's books (end-February 1995),
approximately 55% were either not servicing their loans or servicing but not paying on time.
This suggests that many such clients have financial difficulties and thus the loan has had a
limited socio-economic impact. As SEDCO estimates that 70% of subprojects were successfully
implemented and performing well, this suggests a positive result. The volume of firms that have
graduated from SEDCO and gone on to expand their operations also demonstrates a positive
result.
9.          Achievement of Financial Objectives: Given that SEDCO in 1986 was starting
from a very small capital and portfolio base, the loan significantly increased the SEDCO's funds
for onlending and thus was able to support SMEs formerly without funding as such. In terms of
yielding a sustainable result, SEDCO's portfolio losses have compromised its ability to fully use
loan repayments to project itself on a sustainable footing. These losses began as early as when
the first loans were initiated in 1986. As of end-February, 1995, approximately 55% of
SEDCO's portfolio was estimated to be affected by arrears of three months or more (Clients
1 The data is summarized in Levy and Bradburg, The World Bank, mimeo, forthcoming.
2 Such delays were validated by SEDCO's own records. Delays resulted from a combination of factors indicated, including
delays in subproject approval by IBRD.



-3-
either not paying or paying late. At end-1993, a study indicated that the estimated figure was
Z$77.7 million-US$11 million, principal and interest of a total of Z$128 million). This is a very
high level of arrears and is corroborated by figures indicating SEDCO's net lending. Thus, new
lending has relied upon new capital injections because of limited reflows. Numerous measures
were taken to improve loan collections as well as to improve loan initiation. In some cases, loan
arrears rates did improve, albeit increased significantly in the early 1990s as the effects of
liberalization and adjustment made the business environment more turbulent and thus increased
the risks of financial difficulties or bankruptcy for SMEs.

established that SEDCO would review the interest rate structure yearly and inform the Bank of
proposed changes.
I.            Disbursement Profile: Loan effectiveness was delayed by nine months because
the Government and SEDCO did not meet two requirements to make the loan effective, namely
provision of Z$5 million towards SEDCO's capital base and the appointment of an Operations
Adviser. Consequently, the technical assistance and credit components of the loan did not
disburse in a timely manner. The SAR anticipated that the loan would be 50% committed by
end-1988. Only 6% of the loan actually disbursed by that date. The managed funds account for
risky projects was not utilized until well into the project, in part due to the credit ceiling
established. The slow disbursement is attributed to: (i) the delay in loan effectiveness; (ii) loan
processing delays because SEDCO was understaffed; and (iii) delays in setting up the special
account with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Lending did eventually pick-up and by June 1990,



-4-
60% of the loan had been committed. In July, 1990, SEDCO's capital base was raised to Z$25
million which meant it was able to increase loan disbursements and take on much needed
additional staff. The component of the loan initially set aside for the construction study was
redirected to the credit portion of the project. The closing date of the loan was extended from
December 31, 1992 to June 30, 1994. An undisbursed balance of $332,000 remained at the end
of the project.
12.         A review of the sub-loan profile indicates that a number of loans early in the
program had been made to rural borrowers. With limited staff capacity for appraisal of these
loans, a number of these loans resulted in poor performance. Subsequently, the drought in 1992
not only affected the rural loans but had a depressing effect on the economy and thus the
portfolio at large. Finally, measures adopted under the 1991 ESAP changed the business
environment in such a way that some borrowers were adversely impacted.
13.         Sub-loan Processing: SEDCO faced many problems in the processing of loans.
This was primarily because of a critical shortage of staff to process the applications, which in
turn created a backlog. The actual process of loan appraisal had too many steps and proved to be
lengthy. In some cases, loan processing, which included review and approval from Bank staff,
took as long as twenty months. Some subborrowers surveyed complained that by the time the
loan was approved, the price of the item the funds were intended for had increased so
dramatically, they could no longer afford to purchase the item. Fortunately, by late in the
project, there was a noticeable improvement through the hiring of staff and strengthening of
procedures.
14.         Impact on Sub-borrowers:  Because of a dearth of data which tracks
subborrowers who are no longer on SEDCO's books, it is difficult to assess the medium-term
impact on sub-borrowers. A 1994 survey I did track 18 SEDCO borrowers who in general had
very positive results. This data as well as anecdotal evidence suggests that SEDCO has had an
important impact on individual businesses as well as on the degree to which indigenous
businesses have developed in Zimbabwe.
15.         The most important impact on subborrowers has been the effects of measures
beyond the scope of this project, namely the significant economic policy changes in the late
1980's and under the 1991 ESAP. The latter, in particular, significantly changed the incentive
structure under which SMEs operate in Zimbabwe. Monopolistic distribution channels which
had made it virtually impossible for SMEs to compete were largely officially removed.
Moreover, zoning and other entry barriers were also reduced. Perhaps the most important
incentive or deterrent to SME development has been the nexus of fiscal and monetary policies.
The liberalization of the exchange rate mechanism has enabled SMEs to have more ready access
to foreign exchange. However, three years (1992-1995) of fiscal crowding out and tight
monetary policy has resulted in very high real interest rates which in themselves has dramatically
constrained the growth potential of SMEs far and beyond the impact SEDCO could have had.
16.         Rate of Return:  The SAR stated that a rate of return calculation was not
applicable for this project. Individual subprojects however, were required to have cash flow
3 The data is summarized in Levy and Bradburg, The World Bank, mimeo, forthcoming.



-5-
projections indicating that the financial rate of return was higher than the interest rate applied to
the subloans. This calculation was undertaken by SEDCO for each subproject.
C.   Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting The Project
17.         As indicated above, a number of issues arose which delayed or hampered effective
project implementation. Many of these issues relate to the apparently limited Governmental
commitment to the project: (i) Loan effectiveness was delayed because of the GOZ not providing
funds towards SEDCO's capital base and delays in appointing an Operations Adviser; (ii) Slow
disbursements were also hampered by transport problems and understaffing at SEDCO. In July,
1990, SEDCO's capital base was raised by the Government to Z$25 million which meant it was
able to increase loan disbursements and take on additional staff.  In light of improved
performance (and changes to the loan agreement), the project rating was raised from a "3" rating
to a "2" rating overall in July 1990. A useful debt recovery unit was also instituted at the same
time. By late in the project, there was a noticeable improvement through the hiring of staff and
some strengthening of procedures, albeit arrears continued to be a problem. While reported
arrears decreased in the 1990 period, they subsequently increased.
18.         SEDCO did undergo a learning process in SME lending. Early in the process,
some loans were approved which had significant repayment risk and were thus more vulnerable
to economic circumstances. A strong move was also made for rural lending, before the expertise
in making such loans had fully matured. As lending volume increased in 1990, so too had the
level of project appraisal ability. Measures to establish a Debt Recovery Unit generally had good
results, trying to improve collection procedures. Problems did arise sometime however, as some
branch managers were less effective in implementing the debt recovery procedures than others.
19.         One issue which significantly affected SEDCO's ability to process subloans was
the significant demand generated by the ability of SEDCO borrowers to get access to foreign
exchange via SEDCO sub-loans. While subloans were denominated in Zim$, a borrower with an
approved sub-loan could use such a subloan as a basis for a foreign exchange allocation. This
accelerated demand for subloans. In addition however, delays in actually getting the foreign
exchange very often disrupted the businesses of sub-borrowers.
20.        It should be noted that while the combined objectives of providing credit and
technical assistance to borrowers may have been complementary, they also may have created
difficult signals for SEDCO borrowers. The credit function is often more risk-averse than the
development function.  One measure which could address this potential difficulty is the
Government's announcement in 1995 of its intent to separate the technical assistance and lending
functions of SEDCO into two separate institutions.
D.   Project Sustainability
21.         SEDCO Operations: Ideally, there are two possible sustainable scenarios for
SEDCO. The first is that SEDCO would continue and grow as a viable financial institution
supporting the SME sector. As SEDCO's commercial viability increases, it would mobilize
additional capital through private investors. As a commercial entity, under partial or full private
ownership, and lending to SMEs, such an institution could be under a sustainable footing. The
latter scenario is under consideration by the Government. A second ideal alternative is that as



-6-
the loan demand for SEDCO is increasingly absorbed by competing financial institutions,
SEDCO works itself out of a job, i.e., SEDCO is removed as a State-owned financial institution
in the marketplace. The first option would require further strengthening of staff, procedures and
debt collection efforts.
22.         Continuation of SME Lending: Some of the barriers that inhibit SME lending
remain largely as much today as they did when this project was begun. Liberalization and
adjustment measures undertaken since 1991 have significantly altered the policy environment for
SMEs and both reduced the barriers and increased the incentives for them to thrive. Banking
institutions however, remain reluctant to fund SMEs due to the risks and higher transactions
costs involved. SME lending thus needs to be facilitated by examining and supporting the
mechanisms by which commercial financing would become available. SEDCO can conceivably
continue to have an impact on the financing for SMEs but its own financial position has limited
its impact. While in 1993 the GOZ committed itself to inject Z$ 100 million per year for five
years into SEDCO, it has not fully made good on this commitment. A recent Government
decision reportedly to consider private capital for SEDCO is a measure in the right direction.
E.   Bank Performance
23.         The Bank overall did a satisfactory job in preparing and supervising this project.
The difficulties in the project had more to do with the shortcomings in its design than in its
execution. The project was developed in 1985 when the models for financial intermediary loans
both in the Bank and throughout much of the world tended to support intermediation through
State-owned institutions with credit targeted, in this case to SMEs. Moreover, when project
preparation began in 1983, there were very few indigenous-owned businesses, virtually no
financing of such businesses, virtually no expertise in doing so, and thus the needs for
developing such a capability were overwhelming. However, having said this, the Bank could
have: (i) embarked on measures to support financing to SMEs through commercial institutions in
addition to SEDCO; (ii) achieved greater clarity as to financial performance requirements and
monitoring indicators for SEDCO at appraisal; (iii) achieved greater clarity as to mutual
objectives for the SME sector, been more clear as to the racial character/broadening participation
issues involved; and (iv) sought to address the other policy and institutional barriers to SME
development under the project. Bank supervision was generally strong, with a remarkable level
of review of individual subprojects. Each project over the quite low free-limit of US$50,000
(later increased to $100,000) was reviewed carefully by Bank staff.
F.    Borrower Performance
24.         The level of commitment by Government to the process envisioned under the loan
was very limited, which contributed to implementation difficulties.  Stronger support by
Government to SEDCO could have been provided, for example in providing guidance on interest
rate policy, being forthcoming in committed capital, reinforcing SEDCO's debt-recovery
authority, providing strategic guidance for SEDCO, supporting changes to policies supporting
SMEs. Moreover, the Government also channeled donor and its own funds through competing
institutions at subsidized rates which in some cases undercut SEDCO's role. Further, little vision
was evident in the process of approving donor initiatives for similar credit support. Long delays
were also experienced in the approval process for legal matters with parent ministries.



-7-
25.         As indicated, a step in the right direction in terms of Government support has
been the Government's consideration of proposals to allow SEDCO to source equity capital from
outside Government. Moreover, the Government has strengthened SEDCO's debt-recovery
authority by passing a law to amend the SEDCO Act so as to give SEDCO the powers to realize
securities against its loans.
26.         Although the objectives of the project were laudable, it appears that neither the
Government nor the Bank envisioned a strategy for the entire SME sector when the project was
developed in 1984. Project objectives were developed by the Bank in association with the
Government yet it seems that actual Government commitment to the project objectives was
limited. There was also limited overall strategic planning of the SME sector. The lack of a
coherent strategy was further manifest in the way in which multiple donor initiatives for credit
support to SMEs were not dealt with in an integrated fashion and at times were even
discouraged.
27.         In this context, SEDCO sought to develop a genuine loan origination, approval,
monitoring and recovery capacity in-house.  SEDCO's loan appraisal, origination and
supervision appear to have been conducted professionally with the sincerest of intent. Project
appraisals included detailed submissions and reviews of the financial position and projections of
prospective borrowers, assessments of management, labor issues, competitive analysis and even
site visits. After some struggle, SEDCO did develop and put into place a strong computer
monitoring system for the arrears. The maintenance of clean external audits throughout the
project is a laudable accomplishment.
28.         SEDCO did experience difficulties during the project. The most important
difficulty was arrears in its loan portfolio, both for funds financed under the project as well as
credits financed out of its own capital. The problems in arrears reflected: (i) macroeconomic
difficulties which adversely affected SMEs, (ii) limitations in SEDCO staffing, particularly early
in the project, and (iii) some weaknesses in accounting and credit management information
systems. In the latter case however, accruals were of sufficient quality to sustain clean audits and
were kept relatively accurate.
29.         Other difficulties which SEDCO experienced throughout the project were: (i) the
effectiveness date had to be changed four times because the SEDCO did not have the Z$5 million
Government capitalization requirement; (ii) until July 1986, the Operation Advisor position in
SEDCO remained vacant; (iii) SEDCO suffered a severe lack of local currency to finance SME
projects and, as a result, disbursement of subloans was often slow and in most cases in partial
amounts; (iv) disbursements initially proceeded at a very slow pace due to problems with setting
up the special account with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe; (v) there was a critical shortage of
qualified staff at SEDCO; and (vi) a lengthy process of loan approvals ensued. SEDCO
management responded to these problems by hiring more staff and setting up a debt recovery
unit. Credit management also initially suffered from problems in the delivery of audit reports
according to the required standard format. The latter problems were ultimately addressed.
G.   Assessment Of Outcome
30.         The overaUl project outcome has been satisfactory. The project more or less
achieved its major objectives, although there were shortcomings in the project's design more



-8-
than in its execution. Although economic rates ofreturn have not been calculated for subprojects
financed calculated, SEDCO calculated positive net present values for each approved subproject.
If one looks at the cost-effectiveness of jobs resulting under the project and the number of
enterprises supported, the project is moderately satisfactory. While the results in terms of
sustainability of SEDCO are poor, sustainability at the firm level is likely satisfactory.
H.   Future Operations
31.         Although the Bank has not worked with the borrower to prepare a plan for the
continued and future operation of SEDCO, SEDCO management has undertaken such an
analysis, including an assessment of opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses. While
such an assessment is valuable, it has not been complemented by a pronouncement of specific
Government policy as to its vision for the SME sector and the potential role of SEDCO in it.
The Bank's approach to reaching the objectives in this project has changed considerably from the
timne when this project was developed. Moreover, performance indicators to judge the future
success of this project had not yet been developed.
32.         Preparation of a subsequent second Small Scale Enterprise Project was begun
during 1993 but no agreement was ultimately reached as to its design. In late 1994, discussions
began on a new IDA project, an Enterprise Development Credit that would provide a broader
array of both financing and business services as well as aim to address difficulties faced by
exporters in addition to SMEs. SEDCO's participation as one of the intermediaries in the
Enterprise Development Project would be contingent on sustainable financial perfornance. By
applying such criteria to all participating financial intermediaries, the project seeks to mitigate
the possibility that financing wouldn't continue on a sustainable basis. Liberalization measures
undertaken since 1991 have significantly altered the policy environment for SMEs reducing the
barriers and increasing the incentives for them to thrive. On the other hand, the effects of
adjustment, and high interest rates in particular have hindered the financing of SMEs as with
other enterprises in the economic. It is in the liberalized environment that SMEs become even
more important to Zimbabwe's growth strategy.
33.         Ideally, a future impact evaluation by OED should be timed so as to evaluate how
the lessons of the SSE project have been incorporated into the design of the Enterprise
Development Project. It is in the context of this second project that we hope to see a more
sustainable result.
I.    Key Lessons Learned
34.         The main lessons learned are:
* Provision of credit to SMEs cannot lead to a sustainable result unless the macro, policy and
institutional barriers to SME development are also addressed. While financing is often a
constraint (as in this case), other barriers often limit enterprise development, such as entry
barriers; distribution systems giving exclusive privilege to existing companies; and limited
information networks which enterprises need in order to thrive. Project preparation should
include identification of the principal constraints to SME development and the project should
address these constraints in a comprehensive fashion;



-9-
* Critical to the success of support measures for SMEs is vision for the SME sector, a strategy
to achieve the objectives of that vision; and strong commitment by the Bank, Government and
other stakeholders in that strategy;
# Using a single financial intermediary such as SEDCO can help to develop expertise in SME
lending, but does not result in the establishment of such expertise in the commercial
marketplace on a sustainable basis. Intermediation through a unique intermediary such as
SEDCO should be avoided. If a state-owned institution such as SEDCO is chosen, the project
should foresee a medium-term alternative, such as privatization of the institution or the
supplementing and eventual replacement of the institution's functions by commercial means;
* Whether through one or more intermediaries, on-lending access by retail institutions should
require continuing compliance with explicit eligibility criteria including both financial
performance (solvency and efficiency) as well as a qualitative capacity to effectively lend to
the SME sector;
# To the degree possible, lending and technical assistance to SMEs may need to be separate
functions to ensure that borrowers feel the correct set of incentives; and
* Lending rates both to and from intermediaries should be comparable to market rates and
positive in real terms to avoid financial and real market distortions.
35.         Each of these lessons has been drawn upon in the preparation of the subsequent
Enterprise Development Project, under preparation.

SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT (LOAN NO. 2533-ZIM)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
AIDE-MEMOIRF
While a formal project completion mission was not conducted for this project, multiple
missions discussed project completion, both in the context of the preparation of the second small-
scale enterprise project as well as in March 1995 in the context of the preparation of the
Enterprise Development Project. In June, 1995, a subsequent mission formally reviewed the
draft ICR with SEDCO representatives and incorporated select changes to the document based
on these frank and open discussions.

BORROWERS ASSESSMENT
Within its limited scope of assessment on the oonception of the project SEDCO's view is that project
had nobli objectives broadly defind irL schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement as
*  (1)  'To erha.nce the entrepreneurial and fediial capabilitres of co operatives and entrepren6urs-
-c,ilgedhin saa-sd1e-entcrptises^in Zonbobw.v  -- . 
(ii)  To assist SEDCO in. becoming an effeciive organisation to provide financial and technical
assistance to small-scale enterprises, and
(iii) To improve the efficiency of contractors in the construction industrv in Zimbabwe.
These objectives were formulated against a background of an economic environment characterised bv
shortage of local funds on the money market, shortage of foreign currency and spare parts coupled with
very tight foregn currency control by the goverrnment and therefore the project could not have come at
a more apportine ime.
The focus of the project as set on schedule I to the Loan Agreement was on Investment projects. This is
refleoed by the allocation of USS8 100 000 out of a total of USSIO million loan amount. The allocation
was boosted to USS9 357 256-46 million by a fujrther USSI 257 256-46 which had been allocated to
parts B and C of the project as g-ven in schedule I of loan agreement. Part of the funds which were
re-allocated to investment projects 2 years down the line were from the small contractors project which
d fa'iled to take off the growwd.
In the absence of specific goals SEDCO implemented the project within the framework of the poli)c
objectives in its mandate and in accordance with provisions of the Loan Agreemnent, the Project
Agree_mt and the Subsidiary Agreement.
Ibe agreemn;w was finally signed on 8th August, 1985 and the programme was supposed to be
implemented by 6th November, 1985 and run for 7 years until 31sT December, 1992. Though timing of
the programme was perfect, there were delays in implementation mainly due to protracted nezotiations
on the modalities of disbursement and procurenent to the extent that it was not until 1988 that
meaningfiul disbursements started with obvious consequences of a delayed response to a problem.



2
In the final analysis the mode of operation for the project was adequately designed to ensure effective
and emficient implementation of the project. Evaluation and disbursement procedures were clearly set
though other modalities relating to procurement of goods were left to be finalised by SEDCO (minuted
in minutes of the Washington Negotiations - March 25-28, 1985). At the initial phase of project
implementation in 1986 SEDCO was well geared to handle the processing of World Bankl Loans as it
was zoing to apply the same investment project appraisal and selection criteria and procedures as it had
been using on its projects.
Consequently fewer problerns were.experienced on the appraisal and approval of the subprojects
gspL;6IIy rhose below free. lini;. .Cnsid.e ab1e delays.were e,cpen,nced on sub-projects aboye free, limit
where turnaround time was up tol2 months. Some delays occurred mainly because of communication
hiccups. Also reliance on specific project managers at The World Bank presented a problem in that in
the absence of such individuals no action could be taken on the submissions thereby delaying decisions
(refe to table attached).
Foreign disbursement and procurement were unfamiliar tasks to SEDCO and therefore at an initial stage
the Corporation went through a learning phase, as a result a number of problems were aecntered in
puttng together adequate documentation to enable payment to be effected. Further to that the tight
foreign exchange controls that existed required that bureaucratic procedures had to be foUowed to
secure import licences which were a pre-requisite for disbursement. The World Bank on the other hand
used to take a long time to issue re-imbursernent guarantees to back-up the Letters of Credi
A samiple of sub-projects and details relating to their implementation is shown as an appendix to confirm
the Above assertion.
Apparent from the table are delays that occurred in getting sub-projects above free limit approved by the
World Bank and issuance of reimbursement guarantees. The effect of the delays was that by the time
the sub-projects were comrnissioned the investment cost would have sky-rocketed to more than double
the onginul cost. Ths was brought about by either general price increases or flactuatios in the
aechange rate. The impact of the foreign exchange rate volatility was two fold:
i)  IWdation of the local currency equivalent of the foreign component denominated in hard currencies
through direct conversion.
u) 1The corollary of the above was that costs incidental to the importation e g. duty charged on the
imported commodity became more thereby fianher compounded the problem.

Most projects were hit hard by this problem and rendered not viable during the period June to December
1992 when the exchange rate was very volatile and the Zimbabwean dollar depreciated to its lowest ebb.
As a consequence of the above the following problems beset the sub-projects from the onset:-
1)   sub-projects were implemented well behind schedule and therefore failed to cope with changed
economic environment.
2)   sub-projects were under capitalised and therefore ran into cashflow problems. This problem was
exacerbated by the fact that this occurred at a time when SEDCO could not rescue clients as it had
finnci a_or  rais and* governnrnr financial help was minimal.
3)   some sub-projects ended up highly geared and eventually failed to meet their debt obligations.
4)   In caes where it was ascertained that the sub-projects were no longer worthwhile implementing
clients declined loan offers and SEDCO ended up stuck with decommitted funds thereby delaying
fiurther drawdown on the line of credit and in some cases clients irsisting on implementation on
condition that they were granted concessions.
5)   The design of the procurement system did not provide tight controls in the sourcing of goods.
This loophole was exploited by some clients who ended up importing unauthorised goods to the
detriment of both the sub-project and SEDCO.
6)   Preshipment inspection did not include a technical report on suitability of equipment imported
wrhich resulted in the procurenent of sub-standard or incompatible equipment. Clients were as a
result exploited by suppliers.
After realisation of such a problem some measures like the pre-shipment inspection were put in place to
try and arrest the situation but this did not prove effective as the problem was still experienced.
The above notwithstanding        , a considcable number of the sub-projects financed under loan
2S33 have registered noticeable successes so far. Their paformance is measured using SEDCO
standard investment project w=ss indicators nameuy:-
(i)  Profitability level and repayment record.
(ii)  Asse accumulation.
(iii) Employment creation
(iv) Sustainability and potential for growth.

Inevitably in the absence of well defined project outcomes in the Loan/Project Agreement the overall
success indicators of loan 2533 derive from its objectives and the above indicators and are therefore
broadly listed as follows:-
1) Development of small enterprise sector especially the productive sectors.
2)   Creation of wealth.
.~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .-                                              .  -.  .     *-    
3)   Raisin* the standard of living of most peoplk through provision of essential services.
4)   Creation of employment
On the basis of the above definitions the project recorded the foUowing successes;-
1) Out of the USS9 357 256-46 million allocated to investment projects a total of USS9 023 135-66
was disbursed. Of the 246 sub-projects financed about 70%/ were successfuly implemented and
we performing reatively well.
2.   The portfolio size is ZS49 657 987-08 and only about 14% of this is in arrears.
3)   The investment created a total of 1 095 jobs at an average cost of ZS34 929-41 per job.
4)   All in all a sgni5cant contribution was made to the development of small scale enterprises.
These outcomes are annrbutable to:
()  Projet thrust and design and its operational guidelines.
(a)  Expetise of SEDCO in appraising and providing extenon services to investment projects.
(i) Flemdbility of the agreement and cooperation of the lender in being responsive to the changing
economic environment.
(iv) Govemment          support
(v)  World Bank's assistance in setting up   debt recovery unit.



5
(vi) World Bank's technical support which enabled efficient delivery of services.
Overally the project made a significant impact on both the industrial and service sectors especially on the
transport sector at a time when the country was facing a transport crisis. This positive impact was
spilled over to the Agricultural industry and the economy at large.
Drawii from  the experience on the line of credit as discussed in the report are ihe following
i1ssonstrecommnendations for fiuture facilities:    .*.
1) Non-bureaucratic but effective procedures should be employed i.e. decisions on loan applications
and payments should be done expeditiously. The lender should consider the idea of doing away
with the free lirnit and give the borrower the ultimate authoriy in, deciding on which sub-projects
are elligible for finding.
This would ensure that prompt decisions are made and a more responsive attitude prevails to meet
the borrower's continuously changing needs.
2) Adjustments to the agreement that allow efficient implementation of the project should always bc
done promptly to minimise dysfinctions in the system.
3)   The procurement process should be tightened and procedures clearly defined to ensure that
procurement is made to the best advantage of both the borrower and the lender.
4)   Consideration should be given to financing a project in its entirety where the cient can meet his
equity requirements to avoid undercpitalisation.
5)   Outcomes should be clearly defined to provide guidance on implementation of project.
In conclusion it is SEDCCs view that the ben_ts that accrued as a resul of this project are more than
the weaknesses cited but nevertheess it is hoped that the latter wil incite a more objective review of the
programme wih a view to making future progammes more responsive to the borrwers needs.
