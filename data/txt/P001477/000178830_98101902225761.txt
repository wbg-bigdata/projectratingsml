INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC
FOR A VILLAGE LIVESTOCK AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a prorosed
development credit to the Malagasy Republic for the equivalent of US$9.6
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Village Livestock and Rural
Development Project. The Government would relend to the OMBY State Farm:
a) $260,000 for 13 years including three years of grace with interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum to develop a beef fattening program and b)
$300,000 for 20 years including one year of grace with interest at 5 per-
cc.nt per annum to finance a pilot pig production schere.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Recent Economic Position and Prospects
of the Malagasy Republic" (Report No. AE-lla) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 27, 1971 (R71-17). A basic economic mission visited
Madagascar in November 1972. Its report was discussed with the Government
in February 1974 and will shortly be distributed to the Executive Directors.
Country data are attached as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Madagascar has developed at a rather slow pace since
independence of the country in 1960. There was virtual stagnation up to the
mid-1960s and income per capita actually declined during this period. Between
1967 and 1971, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 3.6 percent in real
terms. Since then, the uncertainties about future economic strategy and policies
resulting from the change in Government have adversely affected production and
incomes. Real GDP declined by about 3 percent in 1972 and did not recover much
in 1973.
4.        The sluggishness of agriculture accounts in part for Madagascar's
limited growth performance. Agricultural output has risen at about the same
rate as population whereas production of foodstuffs lagged behind growth in
domestic demand. Agriculture supports directly about 80 percent of the popul-
ation and contributes about one-third to GDP. Most of the country is well
suited for diversified agriculture. The hot and humid eastern coast produces
coffee, spices and bananas. In the north, there are timber and vanilla, while
the west is suited for cotton production and cattle raising. Rice is the
staple food; it is grown on more than half of the area under cultivation and
accounts for about half of the country's crop production.



-2-
5.        While the country is sparsely populated - 13 inhabitants per square
kilometer - there is great pressure on cultivable land in specific regions.
In these areas, people have standards of living close to subsistence level;
nutrition is deficient and child mortality is high. Another
difficulty has been the lack of an adequate inland transportation network.
Despite the heavy investments which took place in the last decade, oniy one-
third of the highway network is all weather roads and only 3,000 kilometers
are paved in a country where production centers may be as far as ,200 kilo-
meters from the capital. Finally, it seems that the Government has been slow
in taking appropriate steps to ensure the farmers (through price incentives
and marketing facilities) that additional efforts in increasing output would
be rewarded. With respect to rice in particular,. a policy aimed
at maintaining a low retail price for the urban consumer adversely affected
domestic production. Madagascar, which was a net exporter of this commodity
in the 1960s is now facing shortages. Imports rose from an average of 4,000
tons in 1966-68 to 124,000 tons in 1973 and the deficit for 1974 is
estimated at-about 50,000 tonss.
6.        Manufacturing has made a small contribution to overall economic
growth although it has expanded faster than GDP. It still is a small sector
occupying about 42,000 people or less than 2 percent of total active population;
it contributed about 12 percent to GDP in 1972. Industrial production is
almost entirely devoted to consumer goods for domestic use. As it ei.:anded,
the imports of non-food consumer goods declined as a percentage of total
merchandise imports from 42 percent in 1960 to 28 percent in 1972. However,
the scope for further import substitution is limited by the smallness of the
monetized domestic market. In addition, this industrial growth has required
high protection against competitive imports and resulted in a sharp increase
in imports of raw materials and intermediate products utilized for local
processing.
7.        During 1966-72, total capital formation averaged 15.5 percent of
GDP, a ratio probably too low for a country which needs to build its infra-
structure, promote its industry and develop its agriculture. During this
period, domestic savings averaged 9.7 percent of GDP, and financed over 60
percent of total capital formation.  In 1972, the investment ratio declined
and the country relied more heavily on its own savings.
8.        Government policies were not sufficiently geared to economic and
social development. To a certain extent, they favored manufacturing and trade
through protective policy; they favored urban consumers through price controls
on domestically produced commodities; they favored high income groups through
liberal imports of goods that did not compete with local production. At tne
same time, reliance on foreign technical assistance was substantial autd re-
course to external borrowing was limited. This relative conservatism can be
explained in part by the inertia of a tradition-bound society, the regional
fragmentation and the ethnic diversity. It can also probably be explained
by an institutional framework inherited from the colonial period, ivhich was
not geared to rapid development.



-3-
9.        Other impediments to faster economic growth probably were insufficient
investment in development projects, and inappropriate development policies and
programs. Madagascar's first five-year development plan (1964-68) sest specific
productior objectives, but the investment p-rogram was expressed in general terms
only. In 1967, it became clear that progress of both investment and production
was in ufficient.  By that time, public capital expenditure in the transport-
ation sector had amounted to almost half of the target program, but agriculture
was lagging behind with only 34 percent. The Government decided to take remedial
action and in 1968 introduced an interim program "Le Programme des Grandes
Operations" which consisted of a number of investment projects, mainly in agri-
culture to be implenented over the subsequent two years. Since then, Madagascar
has not had a formal development program. A draft interim plan for 1972-1974
was prepared but was never adopted.
10.       A set of new economic policies are being prepared and will be inter-
grated into a new plan, the outline of which has been submitted in late 1973
to the National Development Council for discussion. The Government is expected
to adopt the plan in late 1974. The Government increased the producer price
for paddy by close to 90 percent. The retail price of meat and the producer
price of groundnuts have also been substantially increased. Village communi-
ties are being associated with the management of development projects, the
marketing and processing of agricultural commodities and the distribution
of agricultural inputs, including credit. The Government has also taken
steps to increase the role of nationals in the management and ownership of
private enterprises. In the framework of new cooperation agreements with
France, Madagascar left th_ Franc Zone in July 1973. This withdrawal has
been accompanied by the introduction of exchange control regulations and the
establishmernt of an autonomous central bank. Imports of non-essential com-
modities have been curbed by licensing and an increase in import taxes.
11.       The long-term prospects of the balance of payments are favorable.
The country's export trade is already diversified. Coffee, cloves and vanilla
face inelastic demands on international markets; their future depends to a
great extent on developments in these markets. They account, however, fcr
only half of Madagascar's total merchandise exports. Investments and policies
favoring production of meat, high quality rice, fish and sugar should permit
Madagascar to improve its export position. In addition, the association with
the EEC should provide in the long run markets for an industry more oriented
towards exports. There is also some potential for tourism.
12.       The short-term prospects, however, are uncertain.   Net foreign ex-
change reserves still account for about four months of merchandise imports,
but Madagascar is likely to face during the next few years a balance of pay-
ment constraint due primarily to the high cost of rice and oil imports. While
total imports in 1972 amouinted to about $230 million (against exports of about
$200 mils.ion) the cost of rice imports is expected to increase from $4.7 mil-
lion in 1972 to about $38.0 million in 1975, while net imports of oil products
would rise bv about $20 million. The scope for reducing domestic consumption
of oil products without hampering seriously economic activity seems very
limited. Heavy taxes are levied on passenger cars and gasoline, and these
taxes were increased further in 1973. The deficit on current account is
tentatively projected to grow from $59 million in 1972 to $80 million in 1976.



- 4 -
13.       In the 1970-72 period, external assistance averaged $73 million
annually, mostlv in the form of technical assistance grants. Annual dis-
bursements on medium and long term official aid amounted to about $12 million.
As a result of this concessionary assistance, and further to the cancellation,
in 1972, of about 45 percent of Madagascar's debt vis-a-vis France, the current
level of Madagascar's indebtedness is relatively low. The external public
debt, disbursed only, outstanding at the end of 1973, was estimited at about
$117 million, of which the Bank Group's snare was 33 percent.  St the same
time, total external public debt, including undisbursed, amounted to $200
million, of which the Bank Group's share was 45 percent. The service on
public debt amounted to $11 million in 1973 or about 4.1 percent of exports
earnings, of which the Bank Group's share was $0.8 million. As indicated in
paragraph 11 above, Madagascar is facing difficult adjustment problems which
require particular attention. In the next few years, the need for foreign ex-
change will be greater than the imported component of externally-financed
projects. It would therefore be appropriate that external assistance finance
a substantial share of local costs. At this time, it is difficult to forecast
how Madagascar's projected resource gap will be financed. If one assumes
that about one fifth would be financed on soft (IDA-type) terms, three-fifths
on IBRD-type terms and the baiance on commercial terms, the debt service ratio
would remain below 10 percent by 1980, but would rise steeply thereafter to
reach close to 20 percent by 1985. This points to the need for most
external assistance to continue to be provided on concessionary terms,
although Madagancar shouldremain creditworthy for moderate amounts
of Bank lending. Even with some increase in our program, the Bank Group's
share in Madagascar's disbursed foreign debt is expected to decline gradually
over the next 10 years to reach about 25 percent by 1985. Over the same
period, the Bank Group's share in Madagascar's debt service would remain
below 15 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Madagascar has received seven IDA credits totalling $67.2 million
and four Bank loans totalling $26.1 million.  About 67 percent of the total
lending has been for transport, 27 percent for agriculture and the balance
for education. There have been no IFC investments. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA credits as of May 31, 1974 and notes
on the execution of on-going projects. Except for the Livestock project
(Loan ,85-MAG) and to some extent for the Tamatave Port project (Credit 200-
MAG), both of which are covered in greater detail in Annex II, the execution
of Bank Group financed projects has been satisfactory. The Morondava irrig-
ation project (Credit 322-MAG), however, may face serious problems in the
future due to heavy increases in implementation costs.
15.       The emphasis 'ln our lending for transport and agriculture conforms
to Madiagascar's development requirements and objectives. Our program in
transport is geared to: (i) the development of the main road network; (ii)
the construction of penetration roads into promising agricultural areas;



- 5 -
(iii) the improvement of port facilities; and (iv) the strengthening of the
railroad which provides the most economic means of transportation in certain
areas and for certain commodities. The Tamatave Port Project, currently in
execution, will soon provide an improved outlet for exports. Roads financed
by the Bank and IDA in the central, northern and part of the western regions
have helped to increase all-weather land connections within the island. A
secondary network, however, is largely lacking and secondary roads in exist-
ence are in poor physical condition; this hinders the development of poten-
tially rich agricultural areas. Under the Railway project, assistance is
given to prepare a program of secondary road improvement.
16.       In agriculture, Madagascar's development objective is to regain
self sufficiency in rice by expanding production, and to diversify and increase
production for export. The Bank is assisting the Government in the implement-
ation of this policy by two of the ongoing projects whose principal production
will be rice, while the proposed project will increase beef exports. Several
additional projects for general agricultural development are at various stages
cf preparation and should result in Bank Group financing in the next two fiscal
years. A forestry project has recently been appraised. The Government is
currently preparing, with Bank assistance, a scheme to rehabilitate various
irrigation works that would enable Madagascar to expand rice production.
Consideration is being given to devise mechanisms whereby financial assistance
could be provided to local communities to finance small development projects.
In education, an important reform is underway, on the basis of which a project,
suitable for Bank Group financing, may materialize in FY 1976. Finally, a
hydro-electric power project and a development finance company project are
also under preparation.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK SECTOR IN MADAGASCAR
17.       Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy of Madagascar.
It directly supported about 80 percent of the population, contributes about
one-third of GDP, and is the source of about 85 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. On farm consumption absorbs about 60 percent of total agricultural
production. Basic food crops are rice, maize and manioc. The principal
agricultural exports are coffee, cloves, vanilla, pepper and beef. Livestock
production accounted for about 10 percent of total GDP in 1972, and contri-
buted about 11 percent of total exports.
18.       There are five major agricultural production regions in the country:
the "high plateau" in the central part of the island, accounting for most of
the irrigated rice grown; the east coast, where the main products are coffee,
rice and bananas; the northern zone, which has a tropical climate, growing
mainly cash crops such as sugarcane, cocoa and spices; the middle west, where
soil and climate conditions are ideal for livestock development; and the west
coast, where the population is scarce and where food crops (rice, cassava) and
livestock are the main traditional activities. The high fertility of some of



- 6 -
the alluvial flood plains in this latter region has led to the development of
cotton aHd tobacco cultivation as well as to the production of high quality
rice for export.
19.       In spite of the population pressure on the high plateau and east
coast, agricultural development in these regions is difficult because of the
relatively limited potential of the former and unfavorable topographic condi-
tions in the latter. Increasing emphasis is therefore being given by the Gov-
errment to the development of the less populated but highly productive middle
west and west coast regions. The proposed village livestock and rural devel-
opment project would support the Government's regional development efforts by
promoting livestock expansion and rural development in these areas.
20.       The country's livestock population is estimated at about 10 million
cattle, about 1.7 million sheep and about 0.7 million pigs. Growth of the
national herd has averaged about 1 percent annually over the past decade.
About 900,000 head of cattle are slaughtered annually, a total offtake of
about 9 percent. Only about 350,000 are marketed or slaughtered through
commercial channels, resultin, in a commercial offtake rate of about 3.5
percent. Virtually all beef production comes from the traditional sector
since commercial beef production is limited to the OMBY 1/ State Ranches
and a few private producers. Exports of live cattle, meat and meat products
have increased significantly in recent years:   fresh and frozen meat exports
rose from 1,060 tons in 1955 to 3,340 tons in 1966 and 10,250 tons in 1972.
Livestock exports in 1972 reached about US$23 million. The most important
markets are France, Mauritius, and La Reunion.
21.       The potential for expanding exports is considerable, since
Madagascar, because it is free of food-and-mouth and other diseases, has
access to European and other markets. Export growth, however, is hampered
by the slow increase in overall beef production and by the rapid population
growth, which induced the Government, about a year ago, to adopt temporary
measures to restrict exports and control domestic meat prices. The Govern-
ment, however, is conscious of the need to increase meat exports and to pro-
vide adequate incentives to farmers to encourage livestock production.
Actually, meat prices (consumer price) have recently been raised by more
than 40 percent of their 1973 level. It is the Government's intention to
phase out price controls and lift export quotas over a period of four years,
or even earlier, if developments in the livestock sector, especially the im-
provement of the national herd, occur as anticipated.   The Government
has agreed to consult with the Association, at least once a
year, on its pricing, export quotas and other policies relating to the
production and marketing of beef cattle with a view to encouraging production
and export of beef products and to ensuring the financial viability of live-
stock producers (Section 4.11 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).

under the Beef Cattle Devel_opment ?rolect (Loan 585-MAG).

22.       Much of Madagascar is covered by vast natural pastures.   Under the
traditional management system (where pasture is burned every y-ar and grazing
is uncontrolled), the carrying capacity of these natural pastures is about
10 ha per animal unit. With improved grazing management and controlled burn-
ing, this can be increased to about 4 ha per animal unit. By planting a sub-
tropical legume "stylosanthes," which remains green and provides good feed
during the dry season, due to its deep rooting ability, the carrying capacity
can be improved to about 1.5 ha per animal unit. The improvement of pasture
by planting stylosanthes has been highly successful under the Beef Cattle
Development Project, which was the first major effort to apply this technology
to commercial farming. Apart from its evident value in improving natural
pastures, the broader agricultural implications of stylosanthes are still
more important. It can aid in transforming vast areas now under grasslands
into productive cropping land, as stylosanthes helps to build soil fertility
and humus.
23.       The Department of Livestock and Fisheries of the Ministry of Rural
Development is responsible for veterinary and extension services, livestock
marketing and slaughtering, research and the establishment and supervision of
state farms for livestock. The field operations of the Department are organized
on a provincial basis with a Chief Veterinary Officer responsible for oper-
ations in each province. Although the headquarters staff in Tananarive are
well trained and competent, the services provided by the Livestock Department
at the provincial level, and particularly in villages, are generally weak.
The veterinary service reaches only between 40 and 50 percent of the total
cattle population annually. This is due largely to inadequate transport and
cattle handling facilities and to insufficient field staff at the lower levels.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Madagascar - Appraisal of a Village Livestock
and Rural Development Project" (No. 403a-MAG), dated June 25,1974 is being,
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A creait and project
summary is provided in Annex III, and the project area is shown on the
attached map (IBRD No. 10854).
25.       The project was appraised in the field in September-October 1973.
Negotiations were held in Washington in May 1974.   The Malagasy delegation
was led by Mr. Pierre Rajaonah, Secretary-General, Ministry of Rural Devel-
opment.
The Project Area
26.       The project area, which covers the Majunga Province in the north-
west of Madagascar and the Tsiroanomandidy sub-prefecture of the Tananarive
Province in the Middle West Zone (about 16.2 million ha), is relatively
sparsely populated (about 1.1 million). With three million cattle, it is one
of the principal breeding and fattening regions of Madagascar. Average herd



- 8 -
size is about fourteen animals per family. The potential for livestock
development and for increased cropping is good, as the soils are generally
rich and the climate favorable. Cattle owners, however, are facing serious
problems, namely the poor quality of feed during the pronounced dry season,
poor animal health, and inadequate supply of drinking water for cattle on
the range land.
27.       The project area is one of the least developed regions of Madagascar.
About 90 percent of the population lives in rural villages, most close to
subsistence levels. Poor communications are a critical constraint to develop-
ment, since few roads are passable year-round and the rural population is often
cut off completely from other parts of the country for 6 to 8 months of the
year. Difficulties of access hamper agricultural extension efforts, limit
both social and economic services, and make marketing of crops difficult, if not
impossible, outside the producing villages. Social services also are very
limited. There are few doctors or health centers in the rural areas; and
less than 50 percent of school-age children attend primary schools.
The Project
28.       As pointed out in paragraph 14 above and described in greater detail
in Annex II, the Bank's First Livestock Project in Madagascar (Loan 485-MAG of
1969), while successful in certain respects such as pasture development, has
encountered from the outset a number of serious problems. Most of these re-
sulted from the fact that the scheme had been devised as a ranching enclave,
under expatriate management, without taking fully into account the presence on
the ranch area of farmers who had been using large tracts of land for tradition-
al grazing and for the cultivation of paddy. The proposed project aims at
avoiding the mistakes of the past and addresses itself directly to the trzadi-
tional farmer. At the same time, it is designed to spread those components
of the first project that have proved successful, particularly in the field
of pasture improvement. The project would be a broadly based program to assist
Government's livestock and village development schemes over four years through
the provision of improved veterinary and extension services, as well as essen-
tial rural infrastructure in about 2,000 villages in the project area. It
would also comprise three pilot development schemes in the Middle West Zone
which would assist villagers in the development of livestock and mixed farming
enterprises. It would specifically comprise:
(a) Development of an intensive veterinary and livestock extension
service;
(b) improvement of 10,000 ha of communal pasture for about 200
villages through the introduction of stylosanthes;
(c) construction of water facilities for about 300 villages;
(d) improvement or construction of about 170 km and maintenance
of about 280 km of secondary and tertiary roads;



- 9 -
(e) construction of 28 village schools, an agricultural training
center, and provision of eight mobile health units;
(f)  three pilot development programs in the Middle West Zone:   an
extension, veterinary, and community development program, a
beef share fattening program, and a pig production scheme; and
(g) provision of technical services, training, project monitoring
and evaluation, and preparation of follow-up proiects.
29.       The principal objective of the project is to increase meat
production in the project area by providing an efficient
veterinary and extension service, by providing water for cattle and by
demonstrating the value of improved pasture. The road program would contribute
directly to the project by facilitating access to villages. Although the
modest education and health programs included in the project would not
contribute directly to increases in production, they constitute a necessary
support and would assist in promoting general development in the project
area.
Detailed Features of Project Components
Intensive Veterinary and Extension Service
30.       An intensive veterinary and extension service would be developed for
seven of the eighteen sub-prefectures of the Majunga Province (see map). The
service would ensure annual vaccination of all village cattle against black-
leg and anthrax, and would provide advice on animal husbandry techniques and
range management.  When fully operational, in about 4 years, the service      Id
reach about 1.1 million cattle grazing over an area of about five million ha
and owned by about 1,900 village communities.
Pasture Improvement
31.       The pasture improvement program would cover about 200 villages
scattered throughout the Majunga province. About 10,000 ha of village com-
munal grazing land would be improved over four years through the introduction
of stylosanthes on a broad basis.   The main items financed under the program
would include seed, fertilizer, tractors, and machinery.
Construction of Water Points
32.       Drinking water for cattle and human beings   would be provided in about
300 villages through the construction of about 100 ponds, 50 shallow wells
and 150 boreholes. The main items financed would include earth-moving
equipment, fencing, water piping, vehicles and spare parts.
Road Improvement
33.       The feeder road network in the MVajunga Province would be improved to
facilitate access to villages gor veterinary and extension agents as well as



- 10 -
for supplies and marketing. About 170 km of secondary roads would be upgraded
or built over four years. The average cost of improving these roads would be
about US$5,000 per km. Provision would also be made under the project for
the arnual maintenance of about 280 km of roads at an annual cost of about
US$300 per km.
Village Schools, Agricultural Training and Health Facilities
34.       The project would include:   (i) the construction of 28 village
primary schools, most of which would be located in the Maintirano prefecture
where there is a serious shortage of school facilities; (ii) the establishment
in Maintirano of an agricultural training center for about 80 young farmers,
which would specialize in practical training in livestock husbandry; and (iii)
the provision of eight mobile health units, most of which would operate in
the Maintirano prefecture where access to medical care is limited. These
health units would emphasize basic health education such as sanitation and
nutrition, and preventive medicinei.
Middle West Pilot Development Programs
35.       OMBY Extension Program:   The project would assist the OMBY State
Farm to establish an extension program for 40 villages surrounding its four
ranches financed under the Beef Cattle Development Project (Loan 585-MAG).
Each ranch would provide villagers with veterinary and crop extension services,
tractcr services, and seeds and fertilizer on short-term credit. A primary
school and health center would be constructed on each ranch.
36.       Pilot Pig Development Scheme:   Fifty small pig farms would be de-
veloped by OMBY with the assistance of ODEMO in the vicinity of the Kianjasoa
research station. ODEMO is a government agency responsible for a wide range
of rural development activities in the Middle West Zone. Pig farmers would
be provided with essential services including veterinary and extension ser-
vices, machinery, contract service and credit and marketing facilities by a
management unit established under the project.
37.       Cattle Share Fattening:   A share fattening program wculd be organized
in about 30 villages in the Middle West Zone by OMBY with the aid of ODEMO.
In each village, OMBY/ODEMO would improve about 25 ha of land by planting
stylosanthes and purchase about 100 4-year old steers per village. Villagers
would herd cattle on both the improved and unimproved communal pasture and
follow veterinary and husbandry techniques under the general guidance of an
extension and veterinary service provided by OMBY/ODa4o. After about one
year OMBY/ODEMO would market the steers and the gross profit would be divid-
ed equally between OMBY/ODEMO and the villagers. Share fattening on these
lines is traditional in Madascar, but has not so far been linked to improved
pasture and veterinary and extens:.or services.



Project Implementation
38.       In view of the diversity of items included in the project, the
Government has decided that the Livestock Department of the Ministry of Rural
Development should have overall responsibility for coordination and implement-
ation of all project activities. Under its general direction, a livestock
development unit (FAFIFAMA) established in March 1974, would have responsibility
for coordinating and supervising all project activities in the Majunga Province.
Project components outside Majunga Province would be carried out by OMBY with
the assistance of ODEMO under arrangements to be entered into with the Gov-
ernmer2t. FAFIFAMA, which is set up as an autonomous agency responsible for
livestock development, will be built on an existing government organization,
the Majunga Provincial Livestock Service, and will take over its facilities,
budget, personnel and functions for the seven sub-prefectures where it will
operate. The technical and administrative capability of the new livestock
unit will be strengthened by about 75 additional staff provided under the
project. FAFIFAMA will be administered by a General Manager with full control
over day-to-day operations and responsible to a Board of Directors which in-
cludes the Director of Livestock and representatives of the Ministries con-
cerned, as well as representatives of the local communities in the project area.
The intensive veterinary and extension service included in the project would
be administered by two senior Malagasy veterinarians and each would be
assisted by an internationally recruited senior veterinary adviser. An
animal production adviser would also be provided to strengthen animal pro-
duction aspects of the service. The road improvement program would be executed
by the Ministry of Public Works while the mobile health units would be
operated by the Ministry of Social Affairs. FAFIFAMA would be responsible
for building and equipping the village schools in cooperation with the
Ministry of Education and the village councils.
Projects Costs and Financing
39.      The total cost of the project, including taxes and duties ($700.000)
is estimated at US$12.8 million with a foreign exchange component of US$6.4
million. The proposed IDA credit of $9.6 million would cover about 80 percent
of total project costs, net of taxes and duties, including $6.4 million of
foreign exchange costs and $3.2 million of local costs. The villagers'
contribution would be about $150,000 equivalent, and the balance of
US$2.3 million exclusive of taxes and duties would be financed by the
Government.



12 2
40.       The proceeds of the credit would be used as follows:
(i) $4.0 million by FAFIFAMA for the veterinary and extension
service, pasture improvement, construction and maintenance
of water points, road and rural schools in the Majunga
Province;
(ii) $400,000 by the Ministry of Social Affairs for the mobile health
units;
(iii) $400,000 by the Ministry of Rural Development to finance technical
services;
(iv)  $530,000 by OMBY as a Government grant for the extension program
in the Middle West Zone;
(v)  $560,000 US Government loans to C4BY:   a) 260,000 to finance
the share fattening program at 7-1/4 percent annually for
13 years including 3 years of grace; and b) $300,000 for the
pilot pig program at 5 percent annually for 20 years includ-
ing one year of grace. This interest rate of 5 percent is
considered appropriate in view of the experimental nature
of this component. OMBY would onlend to pig farmers at
7-1/4 percent annually for 5 years including one year of
grace; and
(vi) about $3.7 million will be available to meet contingencies.
Before the Credit Agreement becomes effective, the Government would enter
into a Project Funds Agreement with FAFIFAMA and a Financing Agreement with
OMBY, under terms acceptable to the Association (Section 6.01 of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       Contracts for vehicles and equipment (US$2.4 million) would be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Contracts for borehole construction (US$1.2 million) would be
tendered locally since the amount involved is unlikely to attract inter-
national competition. Construction of piggeries and buildings for the
pilot pig scheme would be subject to local competitive bidding or carried
out directly by the project managemer.t.  Draft tender documents for all
contracts exceeding US$50,000 would be submitted to the Association for
approval before invitations are issued. Since the diversity of items and



their dispersed location would be unlikely to attract international and
local bidding, construction of cattle handling facilities, buildings, housing,
schools, water ponds, and stylosanthes planting would be carried out directly
by FAFIFAMA. The Department of Public Works would carry out road improvement
and maintenance by force account. Because of the small size of individual
purchases, items such as single tractors, single tractor attachments, spare
parts, furniture, veterinary equipment and supplies, etc. would be procured
locally; supplies are adequate and competition between firms is satisfactory.
Cattle and pigs would be purchased locally.
42.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed over four years
to cover (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 85 percent of local ex-
penditures for road construction and maintenance equipment and for other
equipment and vehicles; (b) 75 percent of total expenditures for civil works
carried out by contractors and by force account, and for agricultural inputs;
(c) 65 percent of total expenditures for wages and salaries of additional
staff to be provided under the project; and (d) 100 percent of foreign ex-
penditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for technical services.
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
43.       At full production in 1986, the project would produce an additional
70,000 head of cattle, or 10,600 tons of meat annually - a 27 percent increase
in output for the project area. The project would also result in increased
output of pigs, rice, maize, manioc and peanuts. About 80 percent of the
incremental beef production would be exported, and the net foreign exchange
earnings from these exports would total about US$10 million annually. The
economic rate of return from the project is estimated at nearly 70 percent.
The sensitivity of this return was tested under a variety of unfavorable
assumptions. Under all, the rate of return remains high. An increase i.l
project costs of 20 percent would lower it by 13 percent, and a decrease in
total benefits of 20 percent would lower it by 16 percent. In addition, there
would be substantial benefits accruing from the project, particularly from the
health and education components, which are difficult to quantify, but woul'
help raise the standard of livinl in the rural areas.   Separate financial
rates of return on investments have been calculated for those project com-
ponents which are directly productive, and each of these is satisfactory
varying from 22 percent to over 100 percent. The project, however, does
involve an element of risk. While the potential for expanding livestock
production through village producers is great, successful development is
dependent on an effective and well organized veterinary and extension service
and efficient implementation of other project works. The indications are
that the Government, which places a high priority on the development of the
livestock sector, would ensure an efficient execution of the project.
44.       Despite the satisfactory economic and financial returns, it would
not be possible for the Government to recover all investments directly9 since
several of the investments require long demonstration periods before poor
and isolated villagers are convinced that the services provided are essential.
On the other hands the existing tax structure (primarily taxes on the
movement of animals, market taxess meat and slaughter taxes and export taxes),
when applied to the expected output of the project, would increase Govern-
ment revenuepand at full development, the project is expected to yield about
W.5 miion annually. The Government nonetheless expects gradu1ally to in-
crease its direct recovery of costs from beneficiaries to the extent
feasible without detracting from the project's purpose of improving sarnices
and demonstrating new techniques: in particular, through a system of annual



charges,, villagers will pay in fuli the cost of maintaining water pointsi
and of operating the veterinary and extension services. Similar arrangenents
would apply to the cost of drugs, seeds and fertilizers. Through the mech-
anism of landing to participating vilagers, OMBYT and ODEK) would recover the
full cost of extablishing and operating the share fattening and the pig
development programs, and in the Middle West Zone, which is more developed
and prosperous than the Majunga Province, project costs would be reoovered
directly from beneficiaries salwt in their entirety. The capital and 3per-
ating costs of road iprovement, schools and mobile health units would 'be
viewed as a public service but villagers would contribute about 30 percent
of the total cat of school cnstructiv,.
45.       The project would assist about 80,000 poor rural families (400,000
persons) in the Majunga province and would increase their per capita cash
incomes from about US$20 to US$30 a year. In the Middle West Zone, under the
OMBY extension program, per capita cash incomes in 40 villages (8,000 persons)
would increase from about US$35 to US$65 a year. The project would primarily
benefit villages living close to subsistence level.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Malagasy Republic
and the Association, the %ecommendation of the Committee provided for in Arti-
cle V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit is being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
47.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 21 and 40 of this report. The addi-
tional conditions of effectiveness include the entering into the FAFIFAMA
Project Funds Agreement and the OMBY Financing Agreement, and the appoint-
ment of FAFIFAMA's General Manager (Section 6.01 of the Development (redit
Agreement).
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed devel-
opment credit.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 90-MAG - Road Project; $10 million credit of August 2, 1966;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The proJect is now completed with the exception of a
feasibility study and a master plan of three road sections, scheduled 2or
completion shortly.
Loan No. 585-MAG - Beef Cattle Development Project; $2.8 million loan of
February 14, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
This project was intended to introduce to Madagascar a
new system of land use for beef production. To that end, six cattle ranches
were to be developed, one of which would also produce stylosanthese seeds to
improire pasture. In certain respects, particularly in pasture development, the
project has been extremely successful. On the other hand, it has encountered
from the outset a number of serious problems. Some of them were of a tech-
nical nature in that the imported Brahman bulls were susceptible to stepto-
tricosis which was not foreseen at appraisal. The surviving animals and their
progeny, which proved resistent to this disease will, in fact, make a useful
contribution to the improvement of Malagasy livestock but at a considerably
greater cost than would have been encountered had this problem been anticipated.
The major problems, however, resulted from the fact that the scheme had been
devised as an enclave without taking full accoumt of the presence, on the ranch
area, of farmers who had been using large tracts of land for traditional graz-
ing and for the cultivation of paddy. This created strong opposition against
the ranches .nd resulted in substantial cattle theft, destruction of fences and
burning of pasture. Relations were also made more difficult by the fact that
ranch management had been entrusted to expatriates who were unable to establish
contact with the local population. Following discussions with the Government,
however, considerable progress has been made in modifying the concept of the
project to make it possible for the local population gradually to share in
the benefits of the project and-to use the ranch as a focal point to spread
modern technology in the area. The proposed project would include the
financing of three pilot development schemes in this region Which would aasist8
villagers in the development of livestook and mixed farming enterprises. In
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the solutions taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution,.



ANNEX II

addition, expatriate ranch managers have been replaced by Malagasy
nationals. As a reBults relations with local farmers have improved con-
siderablys, cattle theft has been drastically curtailed and the burning
of pasture during the current dry season was virtually eliminated. In
short5 the beginning of an effort to relate the ranches to the people of
the area has been made. The results appear to be favorable but further
developments wifl need to be followed closely.
Credii No. 200-MAG - Tamatave Port Project; $9.6 million credit
of June 19, 1970; Closing date: December 31, 1974.
Civil works are proceeding satisfactorily and completion
on schedule by July 1974 is expected. On the other hand, the reorganization
of port administration is proceeding more slowly than expected, since manage-
ment assistance provided under the Credit has not been very effective. This
resulted in serious management and financial problems. At the Government's
request IDA has agreed to the employment of Malagasy nationals in the most
important posts of Director General and Chief of Finance. In addition,
consultants are expected to be hired shortly to assist in strengthening the
Port's finances. The Association also agreed to increase the amount of the
Credit from US$9.6 million to US$11.4 million to cover the shortfall in foreign
exchange requirements; the necessity for the increase arose ent;irely out of
the realignment of currencies.
Credit No. 214-MAG - Lake Alaotra Irrigation Project; $5 million credit
of August 17, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The Project's main objective is the expansion and inten-
sification of paddy production in the Lake Alaotra Region by rehabilitation
of the Irrigation and drainage networks on 4,000 ha and construction of such
networks on about 6,000 ha of marshland. In addition to the 1,200 families
already on Project lands, some 1,700 farming families will be settled.
After initial delays, Project construction has been progressing satisfactorily
and the major civil works were completed by the end of 1973, in accordance
with the revised schedule. SOMALAC, the Project Authority, has suffered from
poor management which has had several consequences, principally the fact that
virtually no progress has been made so far with respect to settlement of
farmers.  However, changes have been made and indications are that satis-
factory progress will be achieved in the near future.   A competent new marager
is in post, a study of infrastructure and general layout of the villages has
just been completed and works are expected to start shortly. Finally, a
competent consulting firm has been engaged to re-structure SOMALAC' s account-
ing system.

Credit No. 322-MAG - Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The Project is designed to provide irrigation to three
operationally independent units, totalling 9,300 ha; about 2,100 families
are to be settled in the Project area, where 1,300 families are already farm-
ing. The credit was declared effective in April 1973. Since then, progress
on preparatory work has been satisfactory but the Project is facing serious
problems due to heavy increases in implementation costs. Recent tenders for
the major civil works are about double the appraisal estimates and it is possible
that overall implementation costs will be greater in about the same proportion.
Although, because of increased prices for Project production, the economic
viability is virtually unchanged, continuation of Project implementation will
depend upon the Government's ability to secure additional funds to finance
construction. The problem is being reviewed by the Government and the
Association.
Credit No. 351-MAG - ($15 million) and Loan No. 876-MAG ($15 million);
Third Highway Project of January 17, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The major components of the project are construction
works on about 400 km of primary roads in the central part of the country,
and consulting services for detailed engineering of a further 200 km of primary
roads. Project execution is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 488-MAG - Railway Project; $6.0 million credit of June 27, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The Project will assist in financing part of the Malagasy
Railways' 1973-75 investment program; services of consultants to improve the
railways' management and operations; and technical assistance to strengthen
the planning cell of the Ministry of Amenagement du Territoire. While the
credit was approved last January, signing of the Agreements has been delayed
pending the enactment of enabling legislation. Meanwhile, however, project
implementation has begun and progress is satisfactory.
