MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESEI)ENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 23.6 million, the equivalent of
US$35.0 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a National
Agricultural Services Project. Cofinancing totaling US$27.8 million would be provided by the
European Union, the French Ministry of Cooperation, and the Caisse fran,aise de
Developpement.
2.          Country and Sector Background. Guinea is richly endowed with renewable
natural resources, high rainfall and rivers with considerable potential for irrigation and power
generation, land that can be further developed, and forests that are important assets nationally and
internationally. Guinea has a population 6.2 million with an annual growth rate of about 2.8
percent. From the late 1950s through the mid-1980s Guinea's policies were designed to assert
central control over the economy. In 1985, a change of government and adoption of an economic
stabilization and adjustment program led to implementation of policies to promote sustainable
growth by reducing the role of the state in the economy and instituting market-based economic
management. From 1988-1994, real GDP grew at an average of 4.1 percent per year compared
to an average rate of 2 percent during 1958-1984. However, although Guinea's GDP per capita
of $510 in 1994 is higher than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, income distribution is highly
skewed with agricultural incomes about one-third the national average and Guinea has some of
the lowest quality of life indicators in the world.
3.          The First Republic (1958-1984) taxed agriculture heavily and provided little
support for technology development and dissemination or rural infrastructure. Consequently,
agriculture's performance was poor and the agricultural trade balance became negative. With
economic liberalization, agriculture has grown since the late 1980s by over 3 percent p.a.,
reaching a peak of 5.1 percent in 1994. Agriculture has great potential for increased production
and income generation through yield increases, given Guinea's favorable climatic and agro-
ecological conditions, and the currently low levels of technology. Guinea's agriculture today is
characterized by small holdings (70 percent of farms have less than 2 ha), and very low labor and
land productivity. Consumption of fertilizers is only about 8,000 tons per year, and pesticide
consumption is negligible. Average yields for the major crops are 600-1,500 kg/ha for paddy, 900
kg/ha for corn/millet and sorghum intercropped, 600 kg/ha for groundnuts, and 7,000 kg/ha for
cassava. Yields are low due to declining natural soil fertility, low input use, poor seed quality, and
poor husbandry practices; production increases have been mostly due to area expansion. Over the
years, the agricultural trade balance has deteriorated as rice imports increased and agricultural
exports stagnated. In 1994, rice imports totaled about US$50.0 million, five times the value of
major agricultural exports.



- 2 -
4.           The Government's goals and strategy for the agricultural sector are articulated in
its 1991 Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (LPDA), which was submitted to IDA as part
of the National Agricultural Export Promotion Project (Cr. 2407-GUI). The overall goals are to:
(i) promote food security and reduce food imports (especially of rice); (ii) promote agricultural
exports (coffee, fruits, and cotton); (iii) provide essential support services to rural producers, and
(iv) ensure a rational management of natural resources. The strategy to achieve these objectives
is to: (a) pursue the macro-economic reforms agreed under the SAL and sector adjustment
programs to reinforce the market economy; (b) continue to disengage the State from productive
activities and from services that can be privatized; (c) improve business conditions to attract
private agricultural investments, (d) improve agricultural research and extension, and develop a
seed industry; (e) improve rural infrastructure, and (f) build up local administrative capacity.
5.           The 1995 IDA/Government public expenditure review raised the following issues
concerning agriculture: (a) public sector involvement is disproportionately large -- the functions,
structure and size of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Forests (MAEF) need to be
reexamined, particularly as producer organizations, village associations and small enterprises are
increasingly able to carry out activities formerly provided by the Government; (b) the pattern of
funding is untenable -- salaries take up 97 percent of MAEF's recurrent budget while donors
finance 85 percent of investment and 80 percent of recurrent expenditures, leading to a donor-
driven and fragmented investment program; (c) too little attention is paid to operation and
maintenance -- strategies for maintenance and cost recovery are needed, especially for rural
infrastructure; and (d) the cost of public investment is high (including large expenditures for
technical assistance) and its impact is limited -- criteria are needed for accepting and ranking
projects, and for ensuring that they fit into the core investment program, that their numbers
remain manageable, and that their development impact is commensurate with the expenditure
made. As implementation capacity in MAEF expands, and to accelerate this process, public
sector projects should be integrated into national programs under the line departments. All of this
will require a new partnership between MAEF and donors, in which the role of long-term
technical assistance is reduced and replaced, over time, with national staff and short-term
consultancies, ad hoc missions or periodic support missions, whenever outside expertise is
needed.
6.           The Government is aware of these issues and has started to rationalize public
investment in agriculture, and to coordinate the interventions of different donors more closely.
Two steps in this direction are: (a) development of the National Agricultural Services Project
(NASP) as a tool to rationalize public expenditures and harmonize donor support; and (b)
formulation of an agricultural sector policy note (Annex 5 in the Staff Appraisal Report). The
agricultural policy note, which is an integral part of this operation, states the Government's
position regarding: (a) respective roles of the public and private sectors in agricultural
development; (b) improvements in the quality of individual investment projects and in the
agricultural public investment program as a whole; (c) cost recovery and recurrent cost financing;
(d) technical assistance; (e) input supply; and (f) updating the Agricultural Development Policy
Letter. In the policy note, MAEF states that its primary role is to encourage private sector
initiative and investments by creating an enabling environment and by limiting itself to the
provision of services and infrastructure that have a public goods nature. The agricultural policy
letter referred to in para. 4 will be formally revised by December 31, 1996, by which time the
Government, after consultation with IDA and other donors, will organize a donors' meeting to



- 3 -
review investment needs not covered by this project.  Main areas for investment are rural
infrastructure (rural roads, village water supply, and small-scale irrigation), and credit.  The
agricultural sector policy note will form the basis for the revised letter. MAEF is determined to
transform the managerial administration of a bloated public sector under the First Republic into a
lean, technically competent development organization. To this effect, MAEF has carried out an
institutional analysis of all its units and their staff and is in the process of readjusting the staffing
of the Ministry in accordance with a more narrowly defined mandate. The proposed project will
help accelerate this process and promote a viable solution to the problem of overstaffing within
the Ministry through voluntary staff reductions.
7.           Project Rationale. The agricultural sector in Guinea has great potential for
responding rapidly to a carefully designed investment program with special emphasis on the
provision of agricultural services (technology generation and dissemination, and improved animal
health and husbandry practices).  Agriculture can play a significant role in the economic
adjustment process by providing the initial supply response needed to stimulate economic
activities, and also by reducing food imports and providing a sustainable source of export earnings
to support long-term economic growth. If the anticipated growth is to materialize, MAEF's
policy formulation and coordination capacity needs to be strengthened, and greater efficiency in
service delivery and responsiveness to producers will be essential. Donor support to Guinean
agriculture also needs to be well coordinated and MAEF needs to regain control over externally
funded projects. Under the NASP, there would be a partnership between the Government and
donors for the provision of agricultural services. The Government would be responsible for
identifying and preparing its priority programs, and would work with donors to improve the
efficiency and sustainability of those programs, without sacrificing ownership.
8.           None of the alternative channels through which agricultural services have been
delivered in Guinea in the past have yielded satisfactory results in terms of broad based
productivity increase and financial sustainability. Agricultural extension and applied research
undertaken in the context of commodity development (filiere) projects traditionally have a high
overhead, reach too few farmers, and are mono-crop specific. When undertaken in the context of
area development projects, the delivery of these services loses in professionalism and creates
parallel structures with conflicting approaches (a source of confusion to farmers). In addition,
area development projects, by internally undertaking activities that could best be delivered by
other (public or private) operators are often sources of scope diseconomies. Private extension in
Guinea currently does not seem feasible.
9.           Project Objectives. The NASP's overall development objective is to improve
nationwide agricultural productivity and production, incomes of farmers and food security. The
operation is designed to: (i) reshape the public sector's role to complement the private sector and
support private sector led growth; (ii) develop human capital, i.e., the knowledge and skills of
both professionals (researchers, extension agents and livestock specialists) and farmers; and (iii)
improve MAEF's capacity to provide services that are 'public goods" and to arrest environmental
degradation. The project's implementation objectives are to: (a) strengthen the field presence
and technical capacity of MAEF in the areas of sectoral policy formulation, project and donor
coordination, and agricultural statistics; (b) strengthen agricultural extension to accelerate the
dissemination of appropriate and sustainable technologies, and increase land and labor
productivity; (c) improve agricultural research's output of appropriate technologies for increased



- 4 -
productivity; (d) improve animal production and veterinary support services to herders; and (e)
increase responsiveness to social and gender issues as well as environmental concerns.
10.          Project Description. The NASP would expand the scope of agricultural services
throughout the country. It is a direct successor to two ongoing operations financed by IDA and
other donors -- the Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-GUI) and the Agricultural
Research and Extension Project (Cr. 1955-GUI) -- and would build on their achievements. It
would also be closely coordinated with the IDA-financed Rural Resources Management Project
which is scheduled for Board presentation in FY1997. The NASP has four components:
(a)   institutional capacity building in MAEF:  (i) support to the Agricultural Policy
Coordination Office (BCPA) to carry out priority studies; (ii) support to the MAEF's
agricultural statistics office to produce reliable data; (iii) rehabilitation of MAEF's office
space for staff at the regional and departmental levels; and (iv) implementation of a pilot
operation (entrepreneurship capacity building scheme) to encourage MAEF employees to
leave the public sector and become private entrepreneurs.
(b)   agricultural extension:   provision of a continuous flow  of appropriate extension
recommendations to Guinea's 670,000 farm families;
(c)   agricultural research:  building of a sustainable research capacity within Guinea's
agricultural research institute (IRAG); and
(d)   livestock and animal health: increased vaccination coverage, and improvements in animal
production systems and livestock infrastructure.
11.          The program is being supported by the European Union (EU), France (MC and
CfD), and IDA. The EU is financing animal health, genetic selection of milk cattle, animal
traction, and slaughter and marketing facilities in certain parts of the country, as well as
agricultural research in one of the six research stations. France is financing technical assistance
for IRAG through its Ministry of Cooperation (MC), and the component to strengthen producer
organizations and support to the development of poultry and small ruminants through its Caisse
francaise de Developpement (CfD). IDA support would cover the remaining gaps for policy
analysis, project coordination, and agricultural statistics; agricultural extension; agricultural
research in the remaining five research stations; and animal health and livestock marketing and
processing in the areas not funded by EU. This four-year, US$90.5 million program (about
US$22.6 million/year) represents about 40 percent of the Government's annual public expenditure
in agriculture, and will give farmers throughout the country access to quality agricultural services.
No investments in extension, research or livestock services over and above the NASP would be
made unless they meet agreed criteria of economic return and the funding required to cover their
recurrent costs is assured. All project components include actions to improve the social and
gender responsiveness of the agricultural services. A small unit will be created inside the SNPRV
at the national level and selected agents will act as socio-cultural Subject Matter Specialists at the
regional level. All extension agents will receive training in dealing effectively with different target
groups. Transformation and conservation technologies (typically women's activities) will be
introduced into the research and extension agendas; promising income-generating activities will be
tested with women's groups; and female leaders will be trained in group and financial
management. All project components also include actions to reduce possible negative effects of



- 5 -
agricultural production technologies on the natural environment and to enhance their positive
impact. A Project Preparation Facility advance of $1.0 million was granted in October 1995 to
finance project start-up and prepare project executing agency staff for integrating previous
projects' activities into the new national program.
12.         Project Implementation. MAEF  would  have  overall responsibility  for
implementing the project and no parallel administrative project units would be created. Each of
the executing agencies, i.e., BCPA, SNPRV, IRAG, and DNE would be responsible for the
execution of their respective components. To coordinate implementation of all NASP
components, the Borrower will establish by June 30, 1996, and thereafter maintain: (a) (i) a
Project Steering Committee; and (ii) a Project Technical Committee; and (b) ensure that each
technical department of MAEF responsible for carrying out any part of the Project is headed at all
times by experienced and qualified staff. The chairman of the NASP Steering Committee would
be the Secretary General of MAEF and members would comprise the Directors of the executing
agencies, the Director of the Rural Resources Management Project, senior officials from the
Ministries of Plan and Finance, and representatives of the private sector (farmers' organizations).
BCPA would be responsible for consolidating the annual work program, preparing sector budgets
for approval by the NASP Steering Committee, and would coordinate with donors on annual
reviews, supervision missions and implementation issues. The Steering Committee would have a
sub-committee on environmental impact monitoring, composed of the Directors of BCPA, the
Rural Resources Management Project, the PNAE, and the NGO Guinee Ecologie. The Project
Technical Committee would be composed of the Directors of the executing agencies.
13.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proliferation of
small, uncoordinated donor-financed projects has in the past overtaxed MAEF's sector
management capacity, leading to parallel implementation arrangements, insufficient counterpart
funds, lack of Government commitment, and contradictory philosophies of development. This
approach needs to be replaced with long-term national programs. Synergy between agricultural
services is best achieved when projects are under common management. Experience under the
Gueckedou Agricultural Development Project and the First Agricultural Services Project (Credits
1635/1636-GUI), for which Performance Audit Reports are available, shows that it is essential to:
(a) have flexible and simple program designs with clear objectives and well-defined management
structures; (b) ensure timely availability of counterpart funds; and (c) avoid complex co-financing
arrangements. Draft Implementation Completion Reports are also available for the recently
completed Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-GUI) and the National Seeds
Project (Cr. 1864-GUI). The main lessons learned from the successful Livestock Rehabilitation
Project are the importance of: (a) a proper macroeconomic incentive framework; (b) good
identification and preparation which highlight the main difficulties facing the subsector; (c) regular
supervision missions staffed with the right skills and including cofinanciers; (d) constructive
dialogue with the line implementing agency; and (e) training for project staff and beneficiaries
(herders). Experience with this project also highlighted the problems associated with inadequate
counterpart funding. Major lessons learned from the less successful Seeds project are: (a) the
need to create a demand for improved technology through effective agricultural support services
(research and extension) and appropriate pricing policies; (b) the importance of involving private
sector stakeholders at the outset to develop a private seeds industry; and (c) the importance of
strong management based on the development of local capacity, with less reliance on expatriate



- 6 -
technical assistance. All of these lessons have been incorporated in the design of the present
project and plans for its implementation and supervision.
14.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The NASP is consistent with the Bank's
country assistance strategy (CAS) for Guinea, which was presented to the Board in February
1994. It is the first step in a strategy to move towards integrated investment lending in the
agricultural sector, and constitutes the first in a series of time slices financed under a long-term
program.  It is cofinanced by several donors and links key subsectors of the agricultural
investment program more closely. IDA's strategy in supporting NASP is to: (i) focus on the
provision of basic, core agricultural services, (ii) concentrate on systemic solutions in the form of
time slices within long-term national programs, and (iii) assist the Government in mobilizing a
concerted donor effort in these areas.
15.          Agreed Actions. The Government has agreed to the following actions: (a) as
covenants: (i) completion of several organizational and policy studies, and implementation of the
entrepreneurship capacity-building scheme; (ii) measures to improve IRAG's performance; (iii)
establishment of a Project Account with periodic replenishments; (iv) establishment and
maintenance of a Project Steering Committee and a Project Technical Committee; (v) submission
of work programs, investment proposals and related budgets; (vi) maintenance of policies and
procedures to permit monitoring and evaluation of the NASP; and (vi) a joint mid-term review
with the cofinanciers no later than March 31, 1998; (b) as conditions of credit effectiveness: (i)
establishment of the Project Account with an initial deposit of US$300,000 equivalent; (ii)
execution of a grant agreement on behalf of the Borrower and IRAG; (iii) contracting of
independent auditors and certification by the auditors that the accounting system of each
implementing agency is operational; and (iv) adoption of a Project Implementation Manual; and
(c) as a condition of disbursement for the entrepreneurship capacity building scheme, receipt of a
report and recommendations on implementation modalities and schedules satisfactory to IDA.
16.          Environmental Aspects. The NASP is rated "B" for environmental assessment
purposes, and an environmental analysis was carried out during August/September 1995. The
assessment concluded that the NASP would have a neutral or positive impact on the natural
environment, provided that the mitigation plan to be funded under the project is put in place and
carried out. The plan consists of (i) a careful evaluation and selection of agricultural technologies
that have a positive impact on the natural environment, with emphasis on soil and water
conservation practices and agroforestry; (ii) environmental training for staff and a mass
communications plan; (iii) training of farmers and their organizations to deal with soil degradation
problems; (iv) environmental monitoring, and (v) adaptive research aimed at environmental
sustainability. These activities will be carried out by staff of the implementing agencies and their
performance will be assessed during the mid-term review.
17.          Program  Objective Categories. The program will contribute to broad-based
reduction in poverty in the country through increasing crop and livestock production and
diversification, increasing food security and improving nutrition levels. Women play important
roles in Guinea's agricultural sector as farmers, managers, decision makers, and farm laborers, and
are expected to be major beneficiaries of the NASP. Increased incomes for women should result
in improved household food security, nutrition and health areas where women are largely the
decision makers.



- 7 -
18.          Participatory Approach. The design of the NASP is based on experience gained
in the implementation of two, ongoing, IDA-funded projects where stakeholder participation is
seen as one of the keys to success. Design of the agricultural extension component is based on
Training and Visit (T&V) management principles that have been internalized, have proven
effective, and are being applied flexibly. SNPRV now uses systematically a method for farmer
participatory research which has been developed through pilot operations that were started in
1994. Hence, extension recommendations are developed jointly between researchers, extension
agents and farmers and are situation-specific. This has been facilitated through considerable
investments in training (abroad and in-service) of staff, especially Subject Matter Specialists.
Special attention has been given to attune the extension service to women farmers' needs and to
involve NGOs in service delivery. Finally, with support from CfD, producer organizations are
being strengthened, which in turn facilitates the task of developing and providing extension
advice. In the design of the research component, care was taken to address all the fundamental
weaknesses of IRAG and to systematically build up its research capacity. Research priorities
were defined through a participatory process that brought together all the major stakeholders. All
activities under the livestock and animal health component are extension of activities that were
already successfully carried out under the IDA financed Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project
(Cr. 1725-GUI).
19.          Project Benefits. The NASP would benefit the economy in several ways. It
would focus the role of the Ministry of Agriculture on the provision of key agricultural services,
increase the efficiency and impact of these services, and reduce waste in public expenditures. The
institutional improvements in extension, research, and animal health would translate into the
widespread diffusion and adoption of better agricultural technology, increase farmers
productivity, production and incomes, and accelerate agricultural growth. The main beneficiaries
would be farmers and herders, including rural women.
20.          The project's economic justification is based on (i) cost-effectiveness and cost-
benefit analysis for the research and extension components combined, (ii) cost-benefit analysis for
the livestock component, and (iii) fiscal impact for the whole project. For research and extension,
assuming that the national agricultural extension service will cover 50 percent of the territory by
the year 2000 (up from 30 percent currently), that about 70 percent of rice farmers (compared
with less than 50 percent today) would adopt the improved technical messages (with
corresponding increases for other crops), and that, based on monitoring surveys by SNPRV,
yields will increase by about 30 percent for farmers having direct contact with the extension
service, the estimated economic rate of return is 46 percent. Ex-post and independent measures of
the economic impact of agricultural extension in countries with lower potential than Guinea
suggest returns ranging from 70 to 100 percent. Under the recently completed National Research
and Extension Project (Cr. 1955-GUI), it was estimated that to achieve a 25 percent ERR,
aggregate crop yields would have to increase by 15 percent. Actual yield increases were much
greater, suggesting that the 46 percent ERR is reasonable. Sensitivity analysis also shows that for
the project to break even at a discount rate of 12 percent, benefits would have to decrease by 53
percent, or costs increase by 115 percent, or costs increase by 50 percent and benefits be delayed
three years (for example, because of a shortage of counterpart funds). These events are
considered unlikely based on experience with similar projects in Guinea and elsewhere in Sub-
Saharan Africa, and historical movements in the international prices of the main project
commodities over the past 40 years.

21.          Most of the benefits from the livestock component would come from increased
beef and milk production in cattle herds with better animal health and a more conducive
institutional environment. The rate of growth of the cattle herd is assumed to increase from 1
percent in 1996 to 1.35 percent by 2009. Similarly, milk production would increase by about 30
percent over the same period. Under these assumptions, the National Livestock Department
estimates that the economic rate of return would be 30 percent. An independent ex-post estimate
of the ERR for similar investments under the Livestock Services Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-
GUI) was 18 percent.
22.          In terms of fiscal impact, annual expenditures for the services covered by the
project as a percentage of agricultural GDP in 1994 (US$750 million) are 0.7 percent for
research, 0.8 percent for extension, and 0.7 percent for livestock services. These percentages are
well within international norms. All three components were tailored to the absorptive capacity of
the executing agencies, and the proposed investments represent least-cost solutions. Support to
institutional strengthening, including the much-needed restructuring of MAEF, would have a
positive impact on public finances and can be expected over time to lower the salary bill. By
integrating investments in research, extension and livestock services into national programs, the
unit costs for these services will be lowered significantly. Especially in the case of extension, the
cost per farm family will be reduced from between US$20 - US$100, depending on the type of
crop- or area-based project, to US$10. In the case of livestock, pharmaceuticals are sold on a
commercial basis while herders pay half the cost of vaccination services. Overall, the project
would generate an estimated annual incremental recurrent cost of US$6.5 million equivalent in
1995 prices, representing 6 percent of total public expenditures on agriculture in 1994. Given the
low income of most of the rural population, cost recovery at this time would have adverse welfare
implications and is not practicable. However, MAEF will analyze the possibilities for partial cost
recovery for agricultural services as part of its review of the sector investment program, to be
completed and submitted to IDA for review by end December 1997.
23.          Project Sustainability. Alter studying the multiplicity of projects in extension,
research and livestock development carried out in the past, the Government has, on the basis of
results and least-cost considerations, committed itself to a national program which will integrate
ongoing and future efforts in the provision of agricultural services. This approach will lower the
unit cost of delivering these services and limit it to some US$20 per farm family or about 2
percent of agricultural GDP. Expenditures of this magnitude fit within the country's public
finances and are likely to be sustained over the long term. Through the provision of more
professional and regular agricultural services, the project will contribute to a growing confidence
of the farming community in the administration, which should, if successful, ensure longer term
sustainability of project efforts. Further, the Government will study the possibilities for cost
recovery through introduction of a levy on commercial crops, and/or some cost recovery for
extension advice.  Finally, the Government will pilot initiatives for private sector/NGO
participation in extension on a cost-sharing basis. Over time, it can be expected that improved
prosperity of the farmning community will permit more cost recovery and generate a demand for
extension services from sources other than those publicly funded. The institutional sustainability
of the program is enhanced by the fact that there is strong government and beneficiary ownership;
the program has been designed by Guineans and would use existing channels for implementation.
24.          Risks. The risks foreseen include: (i) ineffective management and training of widely
scattered extension, research and livestock agents; (ii) the failure of Government and/or donors to



- 9 -
sustain the long-term commitment required to achieve durable improvements in the effectiveness of
agricultural support services; and (iii) shortage of counterpart funds and long-term fiscal
sustainability. Concerning agricultural services, good management and improvements in staff
quality are expected as a result of the application of T&V management principles. Performance of
the project executing agencies will be assessed through the monitoring and evaluation arrangements
and through joint support missions in the field by IDA and the co-financiers. The multi-donor
annual review of work plans and budgets, as well as the mid-term review, will allow fine-tuning of
programs. The combination of these measures should lead to visible impact on farmers' yields,
production, and incomes and thereby ensure long-term commitment to agricultural support services
by Government and donors. Regarding counterpart funds and fiscal sustainability, the reduction of
independent projects and the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture will significantly reduce
the unit costs of these services, and thereby increase the capacity of the Government to fund the
single national agricultural services program. Also, it is expected that the review of the agricultural
sector investment program will identify new possibilities for cost recovery, and that accelerated
agricultural growth and exports will increase fiscal revenues.
25.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Livestock                                          30%
Main Assumptions:  All output prices are liberalized; 20% duty on imported rice
Exchange rate is freely floating
Discount rate - 12%
Extension coverage - from 30% in 1996 to 50% in 2000
Adoption rate - from 50% of contacted farmers in 1996 to 70% in 2000 for rice
Yield increase - from 1.2 tons/ha to 2.0 tons/ha for rice
Livestock mortality rate - from 5% in 1996 to 4% in 2009
Herd growth rate - from 1.0% in 1996 to 1.35 % in 2009
Switching Values of Critical Items: (Research and Extension)
-   For NPV at 12% to become negative:
incremental value of production (quantities and/or prices) would have to be 53% lower
than expected; or
incremental costs would have to be 115% higher than expected; or
incremental benefits would have to be delayed 3 years and costs 50% higher than
expected.
Nature of Benefits:
- improvement in agricultural public expenditure planning and monitoring;
- incremental output of major food crops (rice, small millet, groundnut, maize, and cassava) and
livestock products (meat and cow milk);
- the project will extend improved crop and livestock husbandry practices to all 33 prefectures of Guinea as
opposed to 20 currently;
- improvement in Government coordination of donor activities in support of agriculture.
Main Beneficiaries: Farmers and herders, including rural women.

Assumptions:
- Base case projections for budgetary revenues and expenditures as per latest staff estimations in the
Green Cover Public Expenditure Review (December 1995). These projections are lower than those
presented in
the Policy Framework Paper 1995-1998 (SECM-95/1173) which assumed that the Government
will take stronger measures to enhance revenue mobilization.
- Constant inter-sectoral share of public expenditures from 1996 to 1999.
- Constant intra-sectoral share of public expenditures in agriculture from 1996 to 1999.
Risks:
Inter-sectoral allocation may change, leaving little margin for achieving project objectives.  To
mitigate this risk, annual reviews of sectoral public expenditures would result in rationalization of the
expenditure program and limit waste. In addition, cost recovery, especially for animal health services
rendered by the public sector, would be sought.

and a $3.0 million contract for secondary cities has been prepared.
This, plus actual disbursements, amount to 80% of the credit. An

the release of the second tranche have been or are being met.
However, there are two outstanding problems which may delay
second tranche release: (i) the third year ESAF program supported
by IMF resources is off-track; talks with the IMF are scheduled to

Government has not reduced its majority share in the Banque
