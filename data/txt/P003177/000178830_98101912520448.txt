STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENVIRONMENT
A.   The Industrial Sector
Manufacturing 1/
1.01      Background.  Until independence in 1964, Zambia's manufacturing
sector was constrained by the competition of imports from South Africa and
Southern Rhodesia and contributed less than 7% to GDP. In the decade fol-
lowing independence, the sector showed a rapid and steady growth, facil-
itated by high protection from imports, availability of foreign resource
surpluses from copper exports for covering imports of manufacturing equip-
ment and supplies, and the high degree of urbanization due to a modern mining
sector. Between 1965-1974, manufacturing value-added at constant prices grew
at an average rate of 10% p.a., about five times faster than the rest of the
economy. In more recent years, however, value-added at constant prices has
declined, mostly due to external constraints (para. 1.10).
1.02      Contribution to the Economy.  For an African country, Zambia has a
large manufacturing sector 2/ which, in 1978, was estimated to contribute
K 394 million or 17% to the country's GDP, and employ 50,000 people or 14%
of total formal employment. However, activities in the sector have tended to
concentrate on the final stages of consumer good production requiring large
imported inputs, and contribute only 1% to Zambia's exports. This concentra-
tion may be attributed to: (i) a rather strong currency supported by copper
exports, which disadvantaged manufactured exports; and, (ii) low or zero
duties on intermediate goods, which advantaged manufactures with higher import
contents. In recognition of this problem, the Government now plans to give
priority to manufactures based on local resources through its import licens-
ing (para. 1.30).
1.03      With a value-added per employee of US$10,600 p.a., labor produc-
tivity in manufacturing is rather high compared to other African countries,
and about six times higher than in the rest of Zambia's labor force. On the
other hand, the sector has a relatively high capital-intensity, and in its
1/   Does not include mining which is dealt with separately.
2/   By the share of national GDP, it was the fourth largest in 1977 among
African countries, after the Republic of South Africa, Egypt and Zimbabwe.



- 2 -
large public subsector net fixed assets per employee reached US$22,500 in
1979. The Government is concerned about this high capital-intensity and
recently started to take corrective measures, including: (i) increasing
tariffs on capital goods from 7.5 to 10%; and, (ii) a tax exemption of K 500
per year for three years, for each job created by existing enterprises.
1.04      Structure.  In 1978, the formal manufacturing sector was estimated
to comprise 722 establishments including a rather high proportion (45%) of
larger firms having more than 50 employees. The sector - particularly larger
firms - showed a high and persistent concentration around the line-of-rail and
Lusaka, due to poor infrastructure facilities and a low disposable income in
rural areas. In 1977, the Copperbelt Province and the Central Province (in-
cluding Lusaka) each accounted for 40% of manufacturing employment, and the
other six provinces together for only 20%. With a view to contain the high
migration towards cities, however, the Government recently gave priority
status to rural enterprises (para. 1.26) and further granted them an income
tax rate of 30%, lower than the norm of 48%, during their first five years of
operations.
1.05      In 1978, the manufacturing sector's value-added mostly came from:
beverages and tobacco (31%), rubber and chemicals (17%), metal-products and
machinery (16%), textiles (12%), and food (11%); with the fastest growth at
constant prices since 1970 in textiles (12% p.a. on average) and rubber and
chemicals (5.5% p.a.). Due to a shortage of qualified Zambians, expatriates
still held about one-third of managerial positions and accounted for 5.7% of
manufacturing employment.
1.06      To accelerate investments and reduce foreign control after indepen-
dence, the Government has gradually expanded its ownership in manufacturing
during 1968-1975, with an emphasis on large-scale, technically advanced
manufacturing. In 1977, Government-controlled enterprises accounted for 45%
of manufacturing employment and more than half of manufacturing value-added.
1.07      INDECO.  INDECO, a large holding company grouping all Government
equity participations in manufacturing, is wholly owned by the Zambia Indus-
trial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO), an apex holding company for parastatals
placed under the Ministry of Finance. INDECO has large autonomy in conducting
its activities but refers major investment and pricing decisions to the ZIMCO
Board chaired by the President of the Republic. In principle, INDECO's role
is to accelerate through ownership control the implementation of Government
policies in the manufacturing sector, such as Zambianization, employment gen-
eration, economic diversification and rural development. In 1979, INDECO had
31 subsidiary companies and employed 24,800 people. Its subsidiaries produce
all the sugar, beer, fertilizer and cement, and most of the maize/wheat food,
cotton products and edible oil in the country.
1.08      Although INDECO is intended to operate on a profitable basis, it has
suffered from: (i) difficulties in retaining competent staff because of Gov-
ernment salary limitations; (ii) excessive debt-financing of fixed investments;



and, (iii) Government price control on a few basic consumer goods.  As a
result, consolidated profit has been low since 1975 and, in FY79, INDECO
made a loss amounting to 2% of total assets; its ratio of long and short-term'
debt to equity reached 5:1.  To correct this situation, the Government accepted
major increases in controlled prices (except for maize/wheat meal) in 1979.
Furthermore, it intends in the future to set these prices at levels allowing
INDECO to finance its expansion and plans to consolidate INDECO-s equity
basis, although it lacks the necessary resources at present.
1.09      Role of Private Enterprises.  The private manufacturing sector is
still important with 55% of manufacturing employment. Private firms are gen-
erally smaller, more labor-intensive, more concentrated in the Copperbelt and
Lusaka, and using more expatriate staff. Private entrepreneurs had firs t-been
apprehensive, following Government 1968 pronouncements for state control of
industry and INDECO's subsequent expansion. In more recent years, howeveK,
the Government has clearly recognized the useful role of private enterprise,
particularly in rural and small-scale industries, as reflected in the Indus-
trial Development Act and the policy objectives of its Third Plan (paras. 1.26
and 1.28). Entrepreneurs appear to have regained confidence and showed increas-
ing initiative in the last 2-3 years.  This resulted in particular in a swift
increase in the proportion of private investments proposed to DBZ for loan
financing (para. 2.23).
1.10      Constraints and Prospects.  The major weakness of the manufacturing
sector is its high dependence on imported supplies and raw materials, com-
pounded by the long distances from sea-ports to landlocked Zambia. The
sector was thus particularly affected by: (i) the severe restrictions on
imports of industrial supplies following the sharp fall in copper prices in
1974; and, (ii) the closure of the Rhodesian border in 1973, and subsequent
transport rerouting through the congested port of Dar es Salaam. As a result,
manufacturing value-added at constant prices fell at an average rate of 8%
p.a. during the three years 1975-1977.  Since then, however, increased efforts
have been made to expand the capacity of alternative trading routes while
progress was being made towards a Zimbabwe settlement, and copper prices have
increased substantially (para. 1.15).
1.11      Now that these constraints are being relieved, prospects for'a mod-
erate recovery of the manufacturing sector appear reasonably good, particu-,
larly considering: (i) the high growth rate achieved in 1965-74 (para. 1.01);
and, (ii) Zambia's large untapped resources in mineral deposits, arable land
and forests. In 1978, manufacturing value-added was estimated to have in-
creased again by 6%.
Mining
1.12      Contribution to the Economy and Structure.  During the period 1964
to 1974, the mining sector and especially copper accounted for an average of
35% of Zambia's GDP, 45% of Government revenue and 95% of export earnings.
Although the sector's overall contribution to the economy~-declined after the



- 4 -
40% fall in world copper prices, mining retained a dominant place in the
economy through the 1970's. In recent years it still accounted for about 15%
of total GDP and over 90% of Zambia's exports. Apart from copper which is by
far the most important product accounting for over 90% of the sector's export
value, Zambia produces significant quantities of cobalt (20,000 metric tons
In 1978), lead (12,000 tons), zinc (40,100 tons) for export and coal (677,300
tons) for local consumption; and is prospecting for uranium in the southern
province.
1.13      Most of Zambia's mining operations are located in the "copperbelt"
area in the north-central part of the country bordering Zaire. Mining oper-
ations are dominated by two major companies, Nchanga Consolidated Copper
Mines Ltd. (NCCM) and Roan Consolidated Mines Ltd. (RCM). The Zambian Govern-
ment, through its parastatal holding company - Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation (ZIMCO) has, since 1970, held 51% of the shares in each company,
the other major shareholders being the Anglo-American Corporation and Roan
Selection Trust.
1.14      Constraints and Prospects.  In recent years, copper production has
stagnated and remained constantly below the peak of 748,000 tons achieved in
1969. This has been due to several factors, the most important being a lack
of sufficient self-generated funds for new investment programs, a growing
shortage of skilled mine workers due to a high turnover of expatriate personnel
(resulting from a deterioration in benefits and incentives offered by mining
companies), and increasing difficulties in mining the ore from underground
deposits from which as much as 70% of Zambia's copper is obtained. Copper
sales of 582,000 tons in 1978 were not only lower than the year's production
of 657,000 tons but also declined 13% below the 670,000 sales volume achieved
in 1977.
1.15      In addition to the above production difficulties, the decline in the
value of copper sales followed from: (i) slow recovery in copper prices on
the world market, leading to scarcity of foreign exchange. In 1976, copper
prices were K 800/ton as compared to K 1950/ton in 1974. Recently, however,
prices have significantly improved to an average of K 1900/ton during 1979;
(ii) transportation bottlenecks on the country's export routes. As a result
of a breakdown in external routes especially during the second half of 1978,
Zambia accumulated large stocks of copper and failed to take advantage of
firmer prices.
1.16      Prospects for the mining industry for the future appear sound in
view of forecast increases in world copper prices (Bank projections in con-
stant US dollars are US$2,300/ton in 1980, US$2,700/ton in 1982 and US$3,890/
ton in 1985), and greater possibilities of Zambia finding access to adequate
export routes following expected improvements in the Zimbabwe situation.
Small-Scale Enterprises (SSEs)
1.17      Structure of the Sector.  The structure and extent of SSE activity
in Zambia as a whole is not fully known as no comprehensive study of that sec-
tor has been undertaken. Data gathered in the few brief SSE surveys conducted



-5-
in the last five years are extremely sketchy and unreliable. However, a recent
Bank review of the sector indicates that there are three broad categories of
SSE in Zambia. First, there are about 300 small enterprises 1/ servicing the
mining industry particularly in the Copperbelt. The majority of these firms,
initially set up by expatriate technicians and now increasingly being bought
by Zambian entrepreneurs, carry out repairs of mining equipment and produce
a wide range of essential mining goods such as ducting for air vents, steel
balls, steel welded pipes, etc. They vary in size from small, specialized
workshops employing about 25 people to establishments with up to 100 workers.
Capital investment in these firms ranges from K 50,000 to about K 200,000.
1.18      Beyond these, there are about 1500 small enterprises engaged in
retail trade or in the production of miscellaneous goods - window frames,
carts, furniture, clothing, jewelry and providing various services such as
printing, catering, etc. These activities are dominant in the major urban
centers particularly along the line of rail and are largely owned and man-
aged by Asian enterpreneurs. Most of these firms have capital investments
of K 25,000 to K 100,000 and employ 5 to 25 workers each. The proportion of
African owned enterprises in this category has increased in recent years but
is still low - probably no more than 20%.
1.19      The third category comprises an estimated 10,000 much smaller retail
operations and artisan industries in the rural areas. These are exclusively
owned by Africans and range from very small one-man or family establishments
engaged in retail trade, bicycle and radio repairs and production of handi-
crafts, utensils, etc. using basic hand tools to some sizeable retail shops
and workshops producing furniture, tinware, clothing, etc. using power tools
and some machinery. Capital investment in these small artisanal activities
is usually no more than K 10,000.
1.20      Needs of SSEs.  The development of SSEs in Zambia has been con-
strained by two major problems: lack of institutional support and lack of
adequate raw material supplies and spares. At present there is no institu-
tion at the national level responsible for planning and promoting SSEs.
Rural Commercial Properties Ltd. (RUCOM) - established in 1961 to promote the
development of small industries in rural areas by providing premises and
technical assistance to rural entrepreneurs no longer assists SSIs. When the
Government in 1976 issued directives to all parastatal enterprises to be more
profit oriented and less reliant on Government subsidies, RUCOM underwent a
total re-orientation of its previous policies and changed from a subsidized
p,romotional institution to a purely commercial operation. About 10 initially
successful rural industries that RUCOM had helped set up eventually col-
lapsed largely due to lack of continued technical and managerial support.
1/   Defined as enterprises with the following features:  (i) the entrepreneur
is an owner/manager who fulfills most management functions in running
the business without employing specialized managerial staff; (ii) employ-
ment of 5 to 100 workers; and (iii) total capital invested in the enter-
prise does not exceed K 200,000.



-6-
1.21      Another institution, the Village Industries Service (VIS), set up
in April 1978, promotes simple, labor-intensive rural industries with the view
of providing work for school leavers, and thus preventing rural-urban migration.
VIS is not a state organization and is funded with voluntary contributions.
Because of lack of resources (initial budget of K 500,000) its scope and
effectiveness are limited. So far VIS has operations in only one province.
1.22      Although Zambia has a variety of financial institutions, none is
committed to providing working capital finance and term credit particularly to
small Zambian entrepreneurs. The Industrial Finance Corporation established
in 1969 partly to fill this gap went into liquidation in 1977, due to mis-
management and financial difficulties. The only assistance of any magnitude
to small businesses has been by Barclays Bank, through its Zambian Development
Loans Scheme (ZAMDEV) introduced in 1974. As of December 1977, Barclays
had approved 798 loans for a total of K 1.7 million. Performance under the
scheme was disappointing. About 18% of the amount lent out was lost in bad
debts. The main reasons for the failure of the scheme were: (i) poor entre-
preneur selection by Barclay's local branch managers who lent out money
indiscriminately without adequate inquiry into the suitability of the borrowers;
(ii) the maximum loan amount of K5,000 was too small and was often used up
before the enterprises became fully operational; and (iii) profit margins of
most borrowers (retail traders) were very small - no more than 3% as prices
of their commodities were controlled.
1.23      The second major problem confronting SSEs has been a shortage of
adequate raw materials and spares due to: (a) lack of or inadequate produc-
tion in Zambia of essential raw materials and spares hence the need to import
supplies; (b) failure or delays in obtaining foreign exchange allocations and
import licenses; and (c) transport bottlenecks particularly in rural areas.
1.24      Policy Framework.  The Government has recognized the need for a con-
sistent policy on small-scale industry (SSI) development - now designated as
one of the priority objectives in the Third National Development Plan (TNDP).
To facilitate SSI development particularly in rural areas, the Government
has proposed the establishment of a Small Industries Development Corporation
(SIDC) that will provide consultancy, financial, procurement and marketing
services to small entrepreneurs. In its present form, however, with a Managing
Director, two Controllers, six General Managers and nine branch managers, the
proposed SIDC appears too large and complex an organization in relation to the
stage of development and size of the SSI sector about which little is known at
the moment.
1.25      Prospects.  The designation of small rural industry promotion as
a priority objective in the TNDP is a significant step towards SSE development
in Zambia. Nevertheless, prospects for a successful SSE development program
on a national scale appear weak at the moment due to various constraints
(para. 1.23) that seem unlikely to be alleviated in the near future. In the
short term, SSE development efforts would be more appropriate and effective on
a selective, pilot level, that would eventually be used as a basis for a wider
program. During the preparation of this project discussions were held with
the Government and DBZ to envisage such a pilot SSE component to be included



- 7 -
in the line of credit to DBZ. However, the Government was not prepared to
assume the foreign exchange risk on IBRD funds that would have been allocated
for SSE assistance. Hopefully these initial discussions will pave the way
for future IBRD assistance to SSEs in Zambia. DBZ is planning to set up a
special unit to identify, appraise and monitor loans to SSEs (Strategy State-
ment: Annex 2).
Government Industrial Objectives and Policies
1.26      The Third National Development Plan.  One of the Government's main
objectives as defined in the TNDP is to reduce the economy-s dependence on
the copper mining sector and to promote the development of manufacturing.
The strategy essentially aims to promote import substitution and export devel-
opment by establishing industries making maximum use of domestic raw materials,
linked with each other, with agriculture and with the mining industry (back-
ward and forwards linkages). It also gives priority to the establishment of
small industries particularly in the rural areas; to the fullest utilization
of existing industrial capacities and to a more even geographical distribution
of manufacturing activities in the country.
1.27      On the basis of these objectives, a number of priority industries
for public or private investments have been selected for emphasis during the
Plan period (1979-1983). These include agro-industries such as maize milling,
edible oils, sugar, stockfeed, meat processing, fruit and vegetable processing,
leather goods; products of copper and brass, fertilizers, sulphuric acid,
mining equipment, agricultural tools and implements, cement, ceramics and
prefabricated building elements. These sensible policies may be difficult
to implement because they imply basic changes in the structure of the indus-
trial sector (para. 1.04).
1.28      The Industrial Development Act.  The Act, drafted in conjunction
with the TNDP, was enacted in October 1977, well before launching the Plan in
1979. It spells out the intentions of the Government with regard to private
investment by both local entrepreneurs and overseas investors. Its main
objectives are to encourage investment in the country, from all sources
but mainly by the private sector, by providing incentives to enterprises
considered priority on the basis of the objectives of the TNDP for the sector
(para. 1.26). These incentives include preferential import license allocation,
rebates from duties, relief from taxes and the possibility to set off training
expenditures against income taxes. Furthermore, the Act authorizes foreign
investors to remit dividends and profit and assures them fair treatment
in case of nationalization.
1.29      The Act also regulates the granting of manufacturing licenses for
setting up new or expanding existing enterprises. An Industrial Investment
Committee, consisting of the Permanent Secretaries of all major ministries,
advises the Minister responsible for industry on individual applications. The
Act has one shortcoming, namely that the incentives are stipulated in rather
vague wording, and that their granting depends not only on the Ministry of
Industry, Commerce and Foreign Trade but also on the Ministry of Finance,
whilst the rules for co-operation between the two ministries in this respect
have not been clearly spelled out. So far, the impact of the Act on industrial
investment has not been very significant in part due to the weakness mentioned
above and also to the general economic conditions of the country.



1.30      Import Licensing and Foreign Exchange Allocation.  The import
control system, introduced in February 1978, is designed to allocate scarce
foreign exchange according to priorities defined in accordance with the
TNDP by the Import Licensing Committee attached to the Ministry of Industry,
Commerce and Foreign Trade. On the basis of the forecasts of the Bank of
Zambia regarding the prospective available resources of foreign exchange,
import licenses are granted to cover six-month needs of enterprises. However,
an import license does not guarantee foreign exchange as the Bank of Zambia
allocates these resources on the basis of their availability.
1.31      Prices.  Prices in the economy are controlled by the Government,
mainly as an anti-inflationary device. The controls are implemented either
directly, via administrative mechanisms or indirectly via the pricing policies
of Government controlled firms which compete with the private sector. The
result is that few prices acurately reflect demand and supply conditions.
Recent moves by Government suggest an awareness of these pricing problems.
Expansion of the scope of ZIMCO's powers over price setting was a first step.
ZIMCO has subsequently circulated instructions to its subsidiary companies
that prices should be established at levels which more accurately reflect
costs of production and which will allow, eventually, a ten percent financial
return on net assets. The Government's acceptance of an ILO's recommendation
to establish a Prices and Incomes Committee (PIC) to implement economic
pricing is also significant. However, implementation of economic pricing will
depend significantly on how economic prices are defined and on the extent to
which sufficient expertise and administrative capacity will be made available
to calculate and revise prices in a timely fashion.
Bank Experience and Strategy in the Sector
1.32      The World Bank assistance to the industrial sector has been mainly
through DBZ which has received a Bank loan (No. 1210-ZA) of US$15 million and
in which IFC made an investment of about US$544,000 (No. 324-ZA). In addition,
IFC has made three investments in the following manufacturing firms in Zambia:
Century Packages, Bata Shoe Company and Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines.
1.33      To assist DBZ's clients that were experiencing difficulties in
obtaining imported raw material and spare parts because of the country's lack
of foreign exchange, the Bank agreed, on an emergency basis, that some of its
first loan to DBZ be used to finance such items (para. 2.27).
1.34      The major new emphasis in industrialization strategy proposed in the
Third National Development Plan (TNDP) is to reduce the economy's dependence
on the copper mining sector and to promote industries making maximum use of
domestic raw materials. It also gives priority to the establishment of small
industries, particularly in the rural areas and to the fullest utilization of
existing industrial capacities. The policy measures proposed to implement the
strategy will take effect only gradually, because of the present structure of
the Zambian industry and existing macroeconomic constraints. However, they
deserve the Bank's support and the proposed loan to DBZ will contribute to
their implementation.



- 9-
B.   Agriculture and Agro-Industry
1.35      Agriculture.  The agricultural sector in Zambia is markedly dual-
istic. On the one hand, there is a relatively small modern sector of about
800'heavily-capitalized farmers (mainly, but steadily decreasing, of European
origin) contributing about half of marketed production and a small number of
state farms and ranches, mainly under the Rural Development Corporation (RDC),
a parastatal. On the other hand, there are about 600,000 farm families on
land held under traditional tenure, the majority of whom cultivate less than
2 ha using hand- or ox-cultivation and are oriented towards subsistence
production. This extreme dualism has been modified In recent years by two
developments.  Firstly, a number of medium-scale Zambian farmers ("emergent
farmers"), mainly along the line of rail, have developed mechanized farms
geared to the commercial market. Secondly, an increasing number of small
farmers, particularly in the Southern, Central and Eastern Provinces have
begun to produce crop surpluses for market.
1.36      Although agriculture provides a livelihood for about 60% of Zambia's
population, it accounted for only 16% of GNP in 1978. In real terms, agricul-
tural output has grown only at an average annual rate of 3% over the period
1970-78, somewhat less than the rate of population growth, and since 1976
overall agricultural production has stagnated. The development of agricul-
tural exports has historically been very limited. Tobacco and confectionary
groundnuts are the only regular exports, but they account for less than 1% of
total exports. In some years of surplus production, limited quantities of
maize have been exported to neighboring countries. Imports of agricultural
commodities have shown an increasing trend during the 1970's, reaching K 48
milllon (about 9% of total imports) in 1978. The major items imported have
been vegetable oils and oilseed cakes (32% of 1978 agricultural imports),
cereals (22%), and dairy products (9%).
1.37      Agriculture Development Objectives and Strategy.  The Government of
the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) has, in its statements of development objectives,
consistently given priority to rural development in general and to increased
agricultural production in particular, emphasizing the achievement of higher
levels of self-sufficiency in staple foods, the provision of raw materials
for domestic agro-processing industries, the exploitation of export potential
where this exists, and hence an increase in rural incomes and levels of living
and a reduction in the high urban-rural disparity.
1.38      The priority accorded to agriculture and rural development has been
reflected, particularly in recent years, in the proportion of the GRZ develop-
ment budget allocated to agriculture which, after declining from 20% in 1970
to only 11% in 1974, has since risen to over 30% in 1978 and 1979. The re-
sources have been invested in parastatal production enterprises (which have
proved to be inefficient) and in a number of highly subsidized smallholder
development schemes (mainly involving resettlement) which have benefitted a
few farmers at a high cost and which have produced only small returns in terms
of increased production. GRZ now fully recognizes the importance of improving
the efficiency and output of the smallholder sub-sector, and is according
priority to investment in much broader-based regional agricultural and rural
development projects, of which the Eastern Province Agricultural Development



- 10 -
Project to be financed by IDA is the first. Similar projects are currently
being prepared, for external donor financing, in the Southern, Western,
North-Western and Northern Provinces of Zambia.
1.39      The agricultural sector has not, however, been allocated recurrent
budgetary resources commensurate with its stated importance. The Ministry of
Agriculture and Water Development (MAWD) receives only about 3% of the recur-
rent GRZ budget to finance its support services to the agricultural sector.
These allocations have during the 1970's failed to keep pace with inflation.
Furthermore, an increasing proportion of these funds have been earmarked for
salaries, and the sums available to meet other operating costs have become
increasingly less adequate to enable MAWD staff to perform their duties effec-
tively. In the context of its current review of the sector, the Bank intends
to assist GRZ to rationalize its overall allocation of recurrent budgetary
resources.
1.40      Agro-Industry.  Agro-industry plays a significant role in the
Zambian manufacturing sector where it accounts for 38% of value added and 33%
of employment. There are 147 agro-industrial establishments, i.e. 20% of all
the total number of enterprises in the formal manufacturing sector.
1.41      Main Characteristics.  The subsector is largely controlled by para-
statal companies under INDECO, in dairy, beer, sugar, tea, coffee, ricde, animal
feed, oilseed crushing, and cashew processing. The private sector plays a
more important role in the processing of fruit, fish, maize, cattle, pigs and
poultry, confectionary and bakery products. As most manufacturing activities,
agro-industrial enterprises are heavily concentrated along the line-of-rail in
the Central, Copper Belt and Southern Provinces although raw material supplies
are found in various parts of the country (para. 1.04).
1.42      Furthermore, agro-industrial production is often concentrated in
a limited number of large factories.  For instance, dairy processing and sugar
manufacturing are each centered in one large plant; animal feed processing,
cotton ginning, oilseed crushing and cattle slaughtering capacity are centered
in two or three large plants. There are however small-scale operations pri-
marily in rice milling, bakery products, pig slaughtering, confectionary
products, beverages, grain milling and brewing.
1.43      At present, very little of Zambia's agro-industry is export oriented:
tobacco, maize, confectionary groundnuts. As mentioned earlier, some agro-
industrial activities depend on imports of raw materials for their operations.
Furthermore, other agro-industrial potential remains unexploited while. the
country-s needs are met by imports: vegetable oil, soybean meal, wheat, rice,
coffee, fruit juices, honey, yeast for animal feed, bags for maize, vegetable
seeds.
1.44      Constraints and Opportunities.  One of the main constraints to
the development of agro-industry is the difficulty in starting new operations
off the line-of-rail while raw materials come from outlying areas and products
from line-of-rail operations need to be distributed in these areas as well.
This results from difficulties in finding good management and skilled labor
outside the line-of-rail and also from the lack of adequate transportation
and communications facilities within outlying areas and between outlying
regions and the line-of-rail.



- 11 -
1.45      Another major problem affecting the growth of agro-industry is the
insufficient volume of production of agricultural products for processing
although the potential exists.  As a result, some agro-industrial activities
depend upon imports for their critical raw material requirements, especially
dairy and animal feed processing.
1.46      Opportunities exist in the following activities:  vegetable oil pro-
duction from maize germ and soya beans, fodder yeast and alcohol production
from molasses, fruit and vegetable processing, fish processing, freezing and
distribution, kenaf fiber production and processing, cashewnut production and
processing.
C.   The Financial Sector
Financial Institutions
1.47      Zambia has a fairly well developed financial system which, in addi-
tion to the Central Bank, includes four commercial banks, and six specialized
financial institutions. The latter have played a major role ii meeting a
sizeable proportion of the country's total domestic demand for credit as their
combined financial assets equal about 40% of the total assets of commercial
banks.
1.48      The Bank of Zambia (BOZ).  The Central Bank regulates commercial
banks and establishes and administers national monetary and credit policies
through the use of the discount rate, reserve requirements and direct controls
such as ceiling on lending rates. BOZ also manages Zambia's international
reserves and is in charge of the country-s foreign exchange control system,
which it administers in cooperation with the commercial banks.
1.49      The Commercial Banks.  There are four commercial banks with 100
branches throughout the country. The state-owned Zambia National Commercial
Bank (ZNCB), established in 1969, handles the bulk of commercial banking busi-
ness of parastatal organizations and other Government agencies.  Its assets
exceeded K 320 million as of September 30, 1979. The three private banks are
subsidiaries of Barclays, Standard and Grindlays. As of September 30, 1979,
Barclays had assets of over K 410 million, Standard K 390 million and Grindlays
K 104 million. The commercial banks play an important role in mobilizing
deposits from the public through their large network of branches. As of
September 30, 1979, total commercial bank deposits amounted to over K 685
million of which both Barclays and Standard held 33% each, ZNCB 27% and
Grindlays 7%.
1.50      The commercial banks provide short- and medium-term (up to 5 years)
credit, leaving long-term credit to specialized institutions. During 1978,
about 30% of commercial bank lending went to agriculture; 25% to manufacturing;
and 20% to commerce. Mining, transport and construction each received about
5%. About 60% of lending by the private commercial banks goes to the private
sector. The bulk of ZNCB lending is directed to the public sector and parastatal
organizations. Lending to the private sector accounts for only about 20% of
its loan portfolio.



- 12 -
1.51      Specialized Institutions.  The five specialized institutions other
than DBZ are: the Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF), the Zambia State
Insurance Corporation (ZSIC), the Zambia National Building Society (ZNBS),
the Agriculture Finance Company (AFC) and the National Savings and Credit
Bank (NSCB). They fall under the control of the Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation (ZIMCO) -- the apex holding company for all state-controlled
enterprises. Three of these specialized institutions - ZNPF, ZSIC and ZNBS -
hold shares in DBZ.
1.52      Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF) is a Government-owned body
which administers a mandatory retirement savings scheme for non-civil service
Zambian employees. The funds are subsequently channelled into productive
investments mainly through credit to the public sector. As of December 31,
1978, the Fund held members contributions of K 208 million of which K 99.5
million were invested in direct loans to the Government, Government stock and
treasury bills. Lending to parastatals and local Government authorities and
municipalities amounted to K 100 million during 1978. ZNPF has no appraisal
capacity and has shown interest in financing large projects jointly with DBZ.
It has made two loans to DBZ amounting to K1.8 million at an interest rate of
7-1/2% p.a.
1.53      Zambia State Insurance Corporation (ZSIC) was formed in 1971 after
the merger of all existing insurance companies. As of December 31, 1978 the
Corporation-s resources totalled K 127 million of which about 80% were invested
in Government bonds, loans (including mortgages) and in various industrial
and commercial investments. In 1976, ZSIC set up a revolving fund of K 3.3
million for loan investments in agriculture. At the end of 1978, 90 farmers
had been granted loans from the fund. The scheme has not been successful
mainly because of a very low recovery rate (40% of the payments due).
1.54      Zambia National Building Society (ZNBS) was formed after the national-
ization of three private societies in 1971. It obtains funds through savings
shares and deposits from the general public and institutions. As of March 30,
1979 its resources totalled K 112 million, of which 83% were invested in mort-
gage loans mainly for residential properties. ZNBS has lent K 70,000 to DBZ
at an interest of 8-1/2% for 14 years.
1.55      Agriculture Finance Company (AFC) was established in 1970 as a sub-
sidiary of the Rural Development Corporation, a parastatal holding company
under the Ministry of Rural Development. Since its formation, AFC has lent
about K 100 million, 70% of which has been for seasonal loans. The remainder
of its loan portfolio consisted of medium-term agriculture financing and real
estate loans, the latter for the purchase of farms. AFC charges an interest
rate of 9% on most of its loans. AFC has had various problems including a
very high rate of default on its loans. As of December 31, 1978 about K 31
million of the K 100 million lent out since 1970 was overdue. It is expected
that AFC will be liquidated soon.
1.56      In April 1979, Parliament passed an Act establishing the Zambia
Agriculture Development Bank (ZADB). This new institution is expected to take
over the activities of AFC but will operate under a new charter and management.



- 13 -
ZADB will have an authorized capital of K 75 million and will provide finan-
cing for agricultural and fishing projects. The Government has not spelled
out the relationship between ZADB and DBZ with regard to financing agriculture.
There are indications, however, that the two institutions would be expected to
play complementary roles in promoting agricultural development.
1.57      National Savings and Credit Bank (NSCB), known as the Post Office
Savings Bank until 1973, is the most widespread financial institution in Zambia
with over 150 agencies.  The bank caters for the smallest saver especially in
the rural areas where no other banking facilities exist. NSCB pays 4.25% on
deposits. At the end of 1978, its total assets amounted to K 25 million, half
of which constituted long-term loans to the Government and parastatals.  The
remainder was held in form of deposits with the Building Society and Zambia
National Commercial Bank.
1.58      Overall, the structure of Zambia's financial sector is adequate.
Except for their lack of commitment to assisting SSEs, the various financial
institutions have played an important role in mobilizing savings and allo-
cating resources. While the institutions have well defined primary roles,
most operate freely with substantial flexibility, particularly with regard to
medium and long term lending.
Domestic Credit
1.59      Domestic credit in Zambia over the last two years has been signifi-
cantly affected by the stand-by arrangement agreed between the IMF and the
Zambian Government in March 1978. This arrangement, which expired on April 25,
1980 was designed to support a comprehensive stabilization program of which
the main objectives were to diminish gradually the overall balance of pay-
ments deficit, reduce inflationary pressures, ensure resumption of economic
growth, and set the basis for the diversification of the economy through a
more efficient allocation of resources. A tight monetary policy, adopted in
1978 and so far strictly adhered to, aims at restricting deficit financing of
the Government budget and commercial bank lending.
1.60      Performance under the stabilization program has been satisfactory.
Inflation tapered off (para. 1.61) and the financial position of the Government
showed a considerable improvement, with the overall deficit financing declining
from the equivalent of 11% of GDP in 1977 to 3% in 1979. Total commercial
bank lending which had increased by 40% in 1976/77 declined by 49% to K 438.9
million in 1978 while lending to the Government decreased 73.2% during 1978.
During 1979 and much of 1980, the liquidity of commercial banks increased due
to lack of outlets for surplus funds.
Inflation
1.61      During the years 1976, 1977 and 1978 inflation rates in Zambia
were respectively 19%, 20% and 17% p.a. The high rates of inflation in these
years resulted from several factors including rapid expansion of domestic
credit, the depreciation of the Kwacha by 20% in 1976 and 10% in 1978, and
increases in direct taxation and a reduction in consumer subsidies. As a
result of the stabilization program (para. 1.59) the rate of inflation



- 14 -
declined to 11% in 1979. Bank projections Indicate that, if the restrictive
monetary and credit controls are maintained, Inflation will be about 12%
during 1981 and 1982 and decline to about 10% in 1983.
Interest Rates
1.62      The present structure of interest rates In Zambia, presented in
Annex 1, is part of the IMF Stand-by Agreement with Zambia and has been in
effect since May 1, 1978.  Commercial bank lending Interest rates range from
9.5% for seasonal agricultural loans to 11% paid by most borrowers; while
their deposit rates vary from 4-1/2% on short-term deposits to 9% on long-term
deposits of three years and above.  ZNBS pays Interest rates varying from 4%
to 9% on deposits depending on their term and charges 12% on its mortgage
loans for commercial and industrial properties and 9% for housing. ZNPF's
loans whose maturities range from 10 to 20 years carry interest rates between
8% and 12%. Up to March 31, 1980, DBZ charged 11-1/2% to 12% p.a. on long-term
funds, plus a 1.5% commitment fee on all loans at commitment dates and undis-
bursed balances at anniversary dates. Recently its Board approved an increase
in DBZ's interest rates to 12.5% and an increase in commitment fees to 3% on
foreign currency loans and 2% on Kwacha loans at commitment dates and on
undisbursed balances at anniversary dates. These increases, effective on
April 1, 1980, will improve DBZ's forecast financial performance. DBZ also
passes on to its borrowers the foreign exchange risk on the foreign currency
component of their loans. There is no interest rate differentiation on the
basis of size of borrowers. The maximum lending rate for all financial
Institutions (apart from DBZ) is 12%.
1.63      The prevailing interest rates appear appropriate as far as DBZ's
foreign exchange lending is concerned but may be on the low side for Kwacha
loans given the inflation rate estimated at 12% in 1980. The possibility
of raising interest rates was discussed during the mission. Both the Ministry
of Finance and the Bank of Zambia, however, consider existing rates adequate
for resource allocation and, in light of future inflation expectations, see
no need for increasing interest rates. The lending institutions have felt no
need for higher rates as the existing structure has enabled them to maintain
sufficient margins on their loan portfolios. This is further discussed in
paragraphs 2.12 and 2.13.
II. THE INSTITUTION
A.   Institutional Aspects
Background and Role
2.01      The Development Bank of Zambia, established as a statutory corpora-
tion by an Act of Parliament in 1972, started operations in 1974. Its main
objectives are to provide medium and long-term loans and equity financing
for projects in industry, agro-industry, engineering, construction, transport,
power, tourism, mining and large-scale agriculture. DBZ is also authorized to



- 15 -
provide technical assistance and advisory services and to administer Special
Funds (para. 2.11). Within its first six years of operations, DBZ has become
the major source of term financing for productive investments inZambia and,
despite the country's economic difficulties, it has remained a sound institution.
Furthermore, a significant Government participation in its share capital has
not prevented DBZ from maintaining a large degree of autonomy in its investment
decisions and the management of its operations.
2.02      The World Bank Group assisted the Government in establishing DBZ
by participating in a study that led to its creation and by granting a US$15
million loan to DBZ in 1975 (paras 2.24-2.27). Furthermore, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) was instrumental in attracting foreign shareholders
and made an equity investment in the institution (para. 2.03).
Ownership
2.03      Initially DBZ had an authorized share capital of KIO million con-
sisting of 600 "Class A" shares and 400 "Class B" shares of K10,000 each.
In April 1979, Parliament authorized DBZ to increase its share capital by
issuing a new class of non-voting preference interest bearing shares, desig-
nated "Class C" shares. DBZ's Board of Directors has put a ceiling of K1O
million on these shares. The "Class A" shares are reserved for the Government
and its agencies and the "Class B" shares are reserved for private local and
international institutions while there are no limitations on the "Class C"
shares. The list of DBZ's shareholders is presented in the Basic Data at
the beginning of the report. As of September 15, 1980, DBZ's paid-in share
capital amounted to K15.4 million of which K350,000 had been subscribed by
the IFC (1.75% of total authorized share capital).
Board of Directors
2.04      DBZ's Board consists of ten members, one of whom is the Managing
Director of the institution. The Government appoints six Directors, inicluding
the Chairman while the "Class B" shareholders appoint four Directors. The
Government has appointed the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance
and Technical Cooperation, DBZ's Managing Director, the Special Assistant to
the President on Economic Affairs, the Governor of the Bank of Zambia, the
Director of the Zambia National Provident Fund and a private businessman.
The "Class B" shareholders have appointed only three representatives: IFC-s
Regional Representative for Eastern Africa 1/, the General Manager of Barclays
Bank of Zambia Ltd, and a manager of DEG. Board members do not have alternates.
The Board which meets four times a year approves all loans and investments that
DBZ makes. Overall, DBZ's Board has played its role in an acceptable manner.
Management
2.05      DBZ's present Managing Director joined the institution .in 1977 as
General Manager and took over his present position toward the middle of 1978.
Previously he had been Managing Director of the Zambia National Commercial
1/   IFC and ADB have a one-year rotation arrangement for representation on
DBZ's Board.



- 16 -
Bank and has also occupied a managerial position at the Central Bank.
The General Manager is an expatriate who has been recruited recently. This
position had not been officially filled since mid-1978 but an expatriate
manager who had been several years with DBZ de facto acted as General Manager
until his departure from DBZ in April 1979.
2.06      In contrast to the situation which prevailed when DBZ was appraised
for a first loan in 1975, most managerial positions at DBZ are now occupied
by Zambians. Although they are still learning their managerial functions, the
results obtained so far are quite satisfactory. DBZ's management is competent.
Organization and Staff                                                                        A
2.07      DBZ s organization structure comprises eight departments responsible
respectively for planning and promotion, industrial projects, agricultural
projects, project supervision, finance, legal, personnel, secretarial and
administration. The structure is well designed and quite suited to DBZ's
work and objectives.
2.08      DBZ presently employs a total staff of 95 persons of whom 8 are
in managerial, 29 in professional and 58 in secretarial and general services
position. Two of the managers and 7 of the professionals are expatriates.
To pursue the expansion of its operations, DBZ intends to recruit 3 additional
Zambian professionals. In addition 7 expatriates provided under bilateral
assistance from Germany, Canada, Britain and the European Economic Community
have been recuited and are expected to join DBZ soon. They include a chief
Economist and Training Coordinator, a Senior Agricultural Economist, the
Finance Manager, a Senior Engineer and two Senior Projects Officers. When the
new recruits join DBZ, its managerial staff will total 10, of whom 3 expatriates,
and the professional staff will total 34 of whom 14 expatriates. This staffing
is adequate for the level of operations expected during the next 2 to 3
years.
2.09      The Zambian staff is dedicated but still generally inexperienced.
DBZ has made efforts to develop its staff by sending for training abroad the
most promising members. It also had some in-house seminars on topics related
to its activities. However, this needs to be improved and systematized.
One of the main tasks of the newly recruited Training Coordinator will be to
design and implement a comprehensive and sustained training program. In terms
of specializations, the number of staff is well balanced among the various
disciplines required, although there is a certain weakness regarding the
engineering function which will be remedied when the two expatriate engineers
join DBZ.
2.10      A major problem affecting DBZ had been its salary structure which
was in accordance with the regulations designed to limit the salaries of
parastatal employees. The structure was inadequate as it did not properly
differentiate between the levels of responsibility and was out of line with
the salaries paid by other financial institutions. This had affected nega-
tively staff morale, caused DBZ to lose one of its most qualified Zambian
staff and was not conducive to attracting experienced Zambians. Recently



- 17 -
however, DBZ obtained its board and Government's approval for a general salary
increase, ranging from 20% to 50% effective as of June 1980. The new salary
structure is considered adequate at least for the next two years.
Operating Policies
2.11      DBZ's operating policies are defined by its Establishment Act of
1972, and a Policy Statement adopted by its Board in 1975 after consultation
with the Bank. They were satisfactory, subject to two qualifications:
(i)  The policy statement placed no limit on DBZ's
exposure in any individual project. It has been
agreed that DBZ will not normally finance more
than 75% of any single project's total capital
costs including permanent working capital.
Exceptions to this rule would be determined by the
particular nature and merits of a project. DBZ's
policy statement has been amended accordingly.
(ii)  the Act allows DBZ, apart from its normal business,
to administer any Special Fund creating "no charge
or lien upon DBZ's funds". DBZ has two Special
funds under bilateral grants: K3.8 million for
small low-interest loans to high-risk Zambian-
owned rural projects, and K650,000 for consulting
services in project preparation. Special Funds
could in principle allow DBZ to engage in many
activities outside the scope of its agreed Policy
Statement with the risk of complicating administra-
tion and diverting staff capabilities. DBZ has
therefore agreed to include in its policy statement,
a provision, acceptable to the Bank, specifying the
conditions under which new Special Funds will be
administered (para 4.02 (c) (l).
Interest Rates
2.12      In March 1980, DBZ's Board increased DBZ's maximum interest rate
and commitment fees, in order to improve DBZ's profitability (para. 1.62).
DBZ now charges interest rates of 12.5% on all loans 1/; plus a "commitment"
fee of 3% on foreign currency loans and of 2% on kwacha loans at commitment
dates and on undisbursed portions at anniversary dates. By comparison, the
Bank estimates local price inflation at 12% p.a. in 1981-82 and at about 10%
in 1983, and international inflation at 9.5% in 1980 and 7.6% in 1981-85.
Thus regarding loans whose repayment obligation is expressed in foreign
currency - including subloans financed under the proposed line of credit -
DBZ's interest rates will be positive in real terms, since DBZ passes on the
foreign exchange risk to its borrowers.
1/ DBZ can, at its discretion, charge 11.5% on agricultural loans.



- 18 -
2.13      Regarding loans in local currency, DBZ's current interest rates
would appear marginally positive in real terms but current inflation projec-
tions for Zambia are particularly uncertain at this time. DBZ has agreed to
review annually its interest rate structure and to take all measures necessary
to maintain positive interest rates in real terms.
Procedures
2.14      Appraisal.  DBZ's project appraisal is adequate.  After manage-
ment's clearance of a project brief, detailed appraisal is undertaken, and
the appraisal report is reviewed before Board presentation by a Loan Committee
grouping department heads and management. DBZ uses check-lists for data
collection and has just issued in consultation with the Bank an improved
appraisal manual for its staff. Earlier deficiencies in the appraisal of
project management and technical aspects have been gradually corrected with
the building-up of DBZ's staff experience and technical capabilities.
Some recent appraisals lacked a calculation of the economic rate of return.
DBZ has agreed in principle to make this calculation for all its project
financing above K200,000.
2.15      Project Supervision.  DBZ had focussed on project appraisal in its
early years, and started developing its project supervision only recently.
It began to generalize supervision visits in 1977, created a separate Super-
vision Department in 1978, and sent its first reporting form to clients in
1979. First efforts have been rightly directed to those projects plagued
with serious arrears or management problems. There has been lack of emphasis
on supervision planning and on preventive supervision techniques. In order to
formalize and improve its system of supervision procedures, DBZ has recently
prepared a comprehensive supervision plan and procedure manual which have been
reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.
2.16      Procurement and disbursement procedures are appropriate.  DBZ asks
its private enterprise clients to obtain quotations from at least three
suppliers among whom one is selected in consultation with DBZ. DBZ-s client
public enterprises broadly follow the Government Central Tender and Supply
Board's procurement procedures and these normally satisfy DBZ's requirements.
For supplies of goods not exceeding $1.25 million only local bidding, widely
advertised in the local press is required. For procurements above $1.25
million, however, public enterprises normally advertise invitations to bid in
Zambian papers and among various embassies/trade missions resident in Zambia.
The latter, in turn notify potential suppliers in their respective countries.
In all cases, a minimum of three quotations is required for each procurement.
For the INDECO group of companies, the ultimate supplier is selected by
a centralized procurement committee; for other public enterprises, suppliers
are selected by individual enterprises. DBZ makes disbursements against
evidence of payment, invoice, or architect certificate for local construction.
Strategy
2.17      DBZ strategy for coming years is defined in a statement, presented
as Annex 2. This statement which is in line with the TNDP specifies that:
(1) DBZ will concentrate its project financing in a few key sectors and
subsectors such as agriculture, agro-industry, transport and engineering
industry; (2) within these priority sectors and subsectors, DBZ will put



- 19 -
the emphasis on projects which utilize mainly local raw materials and
develop linkages within the manufacturing sector and with agriculture and the
mining industry; (3) DBZ will give priority to export oriented enterprises and
to projects that are likely to contribute significantly to employment creation
and will, to the extent possible, assist its clients in selecting technologies
that are labor intensive; and (4) DBZ will create a special unit to identify,
appraise and monitor loans to small-scale entrepreneurs. DBZ's pipeline of
projects is consistent with its strategy. The strategy statement which was
discussed with DBZ management, was reviewed and formally agreed upon during
negotiations and has been approved by DBZ-s Board of Directors.
Promotional Activities
2.18      DBZ's promotional activities are carried out by the Planning and
Promotion Department (PPD) which is presently staffed with one manager and
four professionals. The approach mostly used by PPD is to find project ideas
and prepare investment opportunity studies for those that seem to be promising.
Such studies were conducted for a steel re-rolling mill, collapsable tubes and
the manufacture of zinc oxide in Zambia. A Planning and Promotion Committee
has been created under PPD to review prefeasibility studies and the terms of
reference of feasibility studies and to decide whether the studies should be
submitted for financing under the Special Fund for Technical Assistance which
PPD manages. The Special Fund for Technical Assistance has received bilateral
funding of K650,000 equivalent from Norway, Germany, and Sweden. Until now
four project feasibility studies (pork processing, ceramic, wooden furniture)
have been commissioned.  DBZ-s promotional effort is satisfactory and con-
sistent with the institution's strategy.
Auditors
2.19      DBZ has appointed Coopers and Lybrand as its auditors.  Their
reports are comprehensive and adequate.
B.   Operations
2.20      DBZ's operations as of March 31, 1980 are summarized in Annex 3.
DBZ's loan approvals averaged about K7 million/year in the period 1975/78
before growing rapidly to over K10 million during FY79 and FY80. In real
terms, they grew at a low average rate of about 6% due to extensive economic
and financial crises that have prevailed in Zambia over this period. While
DBZ's commitments have kept pace with approvals, its loan disbursements have
lagged behind because of long delays in its project implementation. As of
March 31, 1980 undisbursed commitments amounted to K20.4 million.
2.21      Slow disbursements result from delays in finalizing collateral
arrangements, from difficulties in obtaining clients' contributions and
from shortages of working capital financing. DBZ has taken measures to
resolve these problems. A Legal Department has now been created to pursue
and finalize security arrangements before project approval and to expedite
pending legal matters. In addition, DBZ now requires its clients to: (i)
deposit their contribution in a blocked account; and, (ii) obtain commercial
bank assurances for financing of working capital requirements before the
project is approved. As a result, the disbursement rate has substantially
increased since the beginning of FY81. DBZ expects that about 80% of present
undisbursed commitments would be disbursed by November 1980.



- 20 -
2.22      As of March 31, 1980 DBZ had approved a total of 139 loans for
K57.0 million and also had equity investments of K439,500 in seven companies.
The total investment cost of projects approved by DBZ exceeded K310 million.
Most of the loans, 79 in number but only 16% in value were for amounts less
than K250,000. While large loans over Kl million were only 12% of the total
number, they accounted for 49% of loan approvals by amount. The average loan
size was K410,000. About 54% of the loan amount carried an interest rate of
11% and above. Over 95% of the loans by both number and amount had maturities
between 5 and 12 years. DBZ operations are spread over a variety of sectors,
with manufacturing accounting for 65% of loan amounts, agriculture and forestry
20%, distribution 4%, tourism 3%, transportation and mining each 3%.
2.23      Of the 139 loans, 52 were for new projects, 67 and 8 respectively
for expansion and modernization of existing projects. In terms of location,
DBZ's projects, like other industrial, commercial and agricultural activities
in Zambia, are concentrated along the line of rail. Over 75% of DBZ's invest-
ments by number (80% by amount) were in Lusaka, the Copperbelt and southern
provinces. The economic rate of return of DBZ financed projects varied
between an estimated 6% on an INDECO project and 50% on several projects. The
average rate of return was at a satisfactory 28%. The average investment cost
per job for new projects was about US$26,298, which compares favorably with
the overall average of US$28,600 for other dfcs in Eastern Africa. A large
proportion (57%) of DBZ's loans (by amount) went to the private sector. The
proportion of DBZ's approvals for the private sector increased significantly
in FY80 when it reached 76% of total approvals.
2.24      The First World Bank Loan To DBZ.  The first Bank loan to DBZ, of
US$15 million, took much longer to commit than was expected at appraisal, as
DBZ's approvals increased at a slow annual rate of 10% p.a. versus a projected
rate of 25% p.a. The discrepancy was essentially due to the economic situation
in Zambia. The loan has now been almost entirely committed and is about 60%
disbursed.
2.25      DBZ used the Bank loan to finance 40 projects in the following
five sectors:
% of total
Number of       financing
projects        (amount)
Manufacturing                                  21               62
Agriculture                                    15               25
Transportation                                  2                9
Distribution                                    1                3
Tourism                                         1                1
TOTAL                                      40              100
A large proportion of projects financed under the first loan were for the
creation of enterprises (61% in value), followed by expansion (34%) and
modernization (5%). These projects had a total investment cost of K26.4
million and created about 1,200 jobs at a cost of US$28,500, which is close



- 21 -
to the average in the Eastern Africa Region. The cost per job on World
Bank-financed project was somewhat higher than the average cost per job for
the total portfolio (para. 2.23). This was due to fact that DBZ submitted
for financing the larger projects which were also somewhat more capital-
intensive.
2.26      In general, the projects submitted to Bank financing were well
conceived and worthwhile supporting. Their economic rate of return ranged
from 11% (farming) to 45% (packaging) and the average rate was at a satisfac-
tory 27%. It is expected that, when the projects are fully in operation the
annual value of their output will be about K40 million and that they will
contribute to net annual foreign exchange savings of about K9 million.
2.27      To alleviate the needs of DBZ's priority clients that were facing
the danger of serious financial difficulties because they were unable to
obtain foreign exchange from the Bank of Zambia to import raw materials and
spare parts, IBRD agreed to finance, on an emergency basis, part of their
requirements. This financing was limited to assisting the enterprises to
increase their capacity utilization at cash break-even level plus a 10%
margin. A total of US$2.1 million has been lent for that purpose. The
possiblity of including in the proposed-second loan a compnent for financing
working capital had also been considered in detail. Since end-1979 however,
the availability of foreign exchange for working capital has improved, follow-
ing the copper price increase and a national effort in foreign resources
mobilization. In a March 1980 survey, DBZ found that all the enterprises
importing raw materials in its portfolio were operating profitably. The
proposed component was thus cancelled at DBZ s request.
C.   Financial Condition
2.28      Portfolio.  As of March 31, 1980, DBZ held a portfolio of K21.5
million, with 98% in loans and 2% in equity investments. The share of
the portfolio in subsidiaries of INDECO was 47%, but should decrease rapidly
given the lower proportion of Government projects in recent approvals and in
the pipeline (para. 2.23).
2.29      The loan portfolio is of acceptable quality, but it has suffered
from: (i) national economic difficulties; (ii) DBZ-s limited project super-
vision (para. 2.15); and (iii) earlier deficiencies in DBZ's project appraisal
(para. 2.14). As of August 3, 1980, loan arrears of more than three months
totalled K 449,431 and affected 22 projects. The arrears affected portfolio
accounted for 15% of total outstanding portfolio. Eighty percent of these
arrears were due to two larger state projects:  (i) a producer of ballast
and limestone found to lack critical equipment after project appraisal, and
expected to resume repayments in 1982; and, (ii) a battery producer which
just had its faulty machinery replaced by suppliers, and should resume rapid
repayments by end-1980. Both companies have encountered implementation delays
beyond their control, possibly justifying loan rescheduling. Other arrears
come mostly from small farms with inexperienced management, for which legal
action is being taken.



- 22 -
2.30      With the projected supervision efforts (para. 2.15) and appropriate
loan reschedulings, the rate of arrears is expected to improve rapidly. Losses
on loans are very unlikely because DBZ has kept a high security coverage, most
often exceeding 200% of the loans, and subject to a standard minimum of 125%.
Thus DBZ's auditors have advised to make no specific provisions for losses on
loans aside from its general reserve (para. 2.32), which is justified. DBZ's
recent equity portfolio seems to have low prospects for rapid dividends, but
it is too small (K 439,500) to affect DBZ's overall profitability.
2.31      Resources.  As of March 31, 1980, DBZ had mobilized long-term
resources totalling: (i) K 20.9 million in local currency including K 12.8
million in its A and B shares and reserves, K 2.7 million in loans at 6-8%
interest mostly from ZNPF and Government, and non-voting preference "C" shares
subscribed in 1979 by Bank of Zambia for K 4.4 million at 7% interest and by
ZNIC for K 1 million at 8.5%; and, (ii) K 16.6 million equivalent in foreign
currency consisting of loans committed by ADB in 1973 (K 1.9 million at 6%),
IBRD in 1976 (K 12.1 million at 8.5%), and EIB in 1978 (K 2.6 million at
5.45%). At that date DBZ's resources' position (Basic Data, page iii) showed
gaps of K 8.4 million in local currency and of K 1.4 million in foreign
currency. This position had resulted from an unexpected reduction in Bank of
Zambia's proposed C share subscription (K 10 million) and the sudden accelera-
tion in DBZ's operations in 1979 and 1980. As a result of a strong resource
mobilization effort, DBZ's resource situation has improved. ZNPF has agreed
to invest K 1.5 million in Class 'C shares. Local commercial banks have
committed themselves to taking up DBZ-s promissory notes for a total of K 11
million. These promissory notes which will be guaranteed by the Government
will be issued as need for the funds arises.
2.32      Financial Position.  DBZ's financial statements and ratios for
FY74-80 are presented in Annexes 4, 5 and 12. DBZ's total assets have
increased at an average rate of 27% per year since FY74 to K 29 million in
FY80. DBZ has constantly kept a strong financial position, mostly due to its
large equity funding and sound financial management. According to the audited
accounts of March 31, 1980, DBZ had a low long-term debt to equity ratio of
0.5:1 and a high debt service coverage ratio of 3.6:1, indicating a large
potential for further borrowings. Its liquidity position was satisfactory
with a current ratio of 3.3:1. Although losses on the portfolio are unlikely
(para. 2.30), DBZ had built-up its non-distributable legal reserve to March
31, 1980 K 823,000, which represented 3.8% of portfolio. Audited accounts as
of March 31, 1980 show a strong financial position (Annex 5).
2.33      Financial Results.  DBZ-s profit is exempt from tax by its Act and
has been increasing rapidly to reach K 1.37 million in FY80.  However, the
return on equity (7.5%) was only moderate when compared to current local in-
flation. This moderate return resulted mostly from: (i) DBZ's low leverage;
(ii) the present lag in DBZ-s disbursements (para. 2.21); and, (iii) a modest
average spread of 3% between its portfolio income and its costs of debt. As a
percentage of total assets however, DBZ's gross income in FY80 was 12.4% and
its profit was 5.5%, which is acceptable and DBZ management has proposed a
K 466,000 dividend.

D.   Prospects
Forecast Operations
2.34      DBZ's project pipeline is presented as Annex 6.  It includes forty-
nine projects: 25 in manufacturing, 19 in agriculture, 2 in tourism, 2 in
transport, 1 in public utilities. Within agriculture and manufacturing, the
projects are well diversified: mixed farming, dairy farms, ranching, crop
cultivation, fishing, pharmaceuticals, plastics, chemicals, milling, plastic
containers, textiles. The total investment cost of these projects is expected
to amount to about K 65 million (US$81.2 million) of which K 36 million (or
55%) for local purchases and K 29 million (45%) for imported materials. DBZ
expects to provide total financing of K 33 million, i.e., about 51% of total
project costs, of which K 12 million for local purchases (36% of total DBZ
financing) and K 21 million for imported materials (64% of total DBZ financing).
2.35      In agriculture, individual project cost is expected to vary between
K 65,000 and K 2.5 million, the average project cost being K 664,000, while
in manufacturing, average project cost will amount to K 1.8 million. DBZ's
average size of loans will be K 451,000 in agriculture and K 815,000 in
manufacturing. However, about 41% of all loans will be less than K 350,000.
The majority of projects to be financed are privately owned:  86% of the
number of projects and 64% of DBZ-s total project financing.
2.36      DBZ-s forecast of approvals, commitments and disbursements is
presented in Annex 7. Approvals are projected to increase in current terms
from K 21.9 million in FY81 to K 37.6 million in FY84, i.e. at an average
annual rate of 20% in current terms. In real terms the growth is likely to
be about half that rate. Such expected growth is reasonable considering DBZ-s
large project pipeline and the evolution of its activities in FY79 and FY80.
Resource Requirements
2.37      DBZ-s commitments during the period March 31, 1980 - March 31, 1982
are expected to amount to K 25.3 million in foreign exchange and K 16.8 million
in local currency. Furthermore, at the end of 1980 DBZ had a shortage of funds
for commitments totalling K 8.4 million in local currency and K 1.4 million in
foreign currency.
2.38      DBZ-s resource needs over the period can be expected to evolve as
follows (in K  -000):

2.39      DBZ's total resource requirements during the period are expected
to amount to K 51.9 million (US$64.9 million) of which K 26.7 million (US$33.4
million) in foreign exchange. A World Bank loan of US$15.0 million would
represent 23% of DBZ-s total resource needs during the period and about 45% of
its foreign exchange requirements. DBZ has mobilized adequate local resources
to finance its opeations. The K 4.0 million foreign currency gap is expected
to be covered by borrowing from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Negotia-
tions for the second EIB Loan are expected to take place in April 1981.
Projected Financial Condition and Performance
2.40      The forecasts of DBZ's financial results for the period 1981 and
the assumptions underlying them are shown in Annexes 8 through 12. DBZ's
earnings are expected to grow steadily as a result of a loan portfolio expan-
sion. Loan income is projected to increase from 12.0% to 12.5% of average
total assets over the forecast period. As DBZ increases borrowings, its



- 25 -
financial expenses as a percentage of average total assets increase from
3.1% in FY80 to 6.7% in FY84. Administrative expenses do not exceed 2.9% of
average total assets throughout the four-year period. In spite of a small
spread on its loan portfolio, DBZ's profitability is projected to increase as
a result of a higher level of operations (para. 2.36) expected improvements in
the volume of disbursements (para. 2.21) and a higher leverage of debt/equity
(para. 2.41). Profit as a percentage of average equity increases from 8.5% in
FY81 to 14.6% in FY84.
2.41      DBZ's long-term to debt-equity ratio which was around 0.5:1 in FY80
is projected to increase to 2.7:1 by FY84 due to a large increase in borrow-
ings but little change in the equity base. This will be below the ceiling of
4:1 agreed with IBRD under the first loan and to be maintained (para. 3.03(f)).
DBZ's debt service coverage remains very satisfactory throughout the period
improving from 3.6 times in FY80 to 5 in FY84. In view of its high security
coverage on most loans (para. 2.30) DBZ has made no provisions against specific
doubtful debts; however it does have a general provision for losses.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
3.01      The main objective of the proposed project would be to assist in
the development of the industrial, agro-industrial and agricultural sectors
in Zambia, by providing resources for the expansion of existing enterprises
and the creation of new ventures in these sectors. In line with the objec-
tives of the Third National Development Plan, the emphasis will be on assisting
enterprises that are priority either because they contribute significantly to
employment creation or because they use mostly local raw materials and are
likely to be foreign exchange savers. In addition, by continuing a close
working relationship with DBZ, the Bank will contribute to strengthening the
institution.
B.   Description of the Proposed Loan to DBZ
3.02      The proposed US$15 million Bank Loan to DBZ would finance the
foreign exchange component of the fixed capital investment of medium and
large-scale subprojects approved by DBZ in the industrial, agro-industrial,
and agricultural sectors. This would represent about 23% of DBZ's projected
resource needs to finance these sectors during the period March 1980 to March
1982 (end of the fiscal year), and about 45% of its foreign exchange needs
during the period.
3.03      Terms and Conditions.  The proposed second line of credit to DBZ
would carry the following terms and conditions:



- 26 -
(a) Onlending Rate by DBZ and Foreign Exchange Risk. DBZ will
onlend to subborrowers at a minimum of 12%. This rate will
be reviewed periodically in light of prevailing inflation
to ensure that it remains positive in real terms. DBZ
will pass on the foreign exchange risk to all subborrowers.
(b) Free Limit. Under the first line of credit to DBZ the
free limit was US$250,000 and the aggregate free limit US$3
million. In recognition of the quality of DBZ's appraisals
the free limit will be raised to US$400,000 and the aggregate
free limit to US$5 million. This will still permit the Bank
to review about 60% of projects financed by the Bank loan,
which is adequate.
(c) Amortization Schedule. The proposed loan to DBZ would
have a flexible amortization schedule conforming to
the aggregate amortization schedules of DBZ's subloans,
none of which should, in principle, exceed a maximum
period of 15 years.
(d) Commitment Fees. As a change from the first IBRD loan for
which DBZ had concessionary treatment, standard commitment
fees would be charged on the proposed loan.
(e) Guarantee Fee on the World Bank Loan. It is now Government,
policy to charge a 2% commission on loans it guarantees for
parastatals. Considering that DBZ's spread of 3% is already
low, the Government has agreed to waive the guarantee fee.
(f) Debt/Equity Ratio. As under the first Bank loan the ceiling
would be retained at 4:1.
3.04      Project Cost Financing.  The total cost of projects that DBZ is
likely to finance from March 31, 1980 to March 31, 1982 is expected to total
about K 77.7 million. DBZ's contribution to these projects would amount to
K 51.9 million of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at K 26.7
million.
3.05      DBZ's financing plan for the period March 1980 to March 1982 is as
follows:



- 27 -
Financing Plan March 1980 - March 1982
(K million)
Local     Foreign     Total
Total commitments                                   16.8       25.3        4-2.1
Resources available for
commitments as of 11/15/79                        (8.4)       1.4        (9.8)
Total resource needs                           25.2       26.7        51.9
To be financed by:
Local currency
Cash generation                                  9.0          -         9.0
Borrowings from local institutions              16.2          -        16.2
Foreign exchange
DEG                                                -        2.5         2.5
African Development Bank                           -        8.2         8.2
European Investment Bank 1/                        -        4.0         4.0
World Bank                                         -       12.0        12.0
Total                                         25.2        26.7       51.9
The Bank would, therefore, provide about 45% of DBZ's foreign exchange require-
ments and about 23% of its total resource requirements between March 1980 and
March 1982.
C.   Project Implementation
3.06      Reporting Requirements.  As under the first line of credit DBZ would
be required to submit quarterly reports which would include financial state-
ments, resource position, statement of arrears and notes on subprojects
encountering serious operational difficulties. DBZ will also continue to
submit audited annual accounts prepared by qualified accountants along with
DBZ's annual report.
3.07      Procurement.  Procurement for the subprojects refinanced under the
loan will be in accordance with DBZ's procurement practices (para.'-2.16).
3.08      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the proposed line of credit would
be disbursed on DBZ's subloans as follows:
1/   The EIB loan, which has not yet been appraised, is projected to be only
partly committed by March 1982.



- 28 -
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods or services
into Zambia;
(b)  75% of the local cost of goods previously imported
into Zambia through normal trade channels;
(c) 60% of the local cost of equipment produced in Zambia
substantially from previously imported components or
raw materials;
(d) 40% of the cost in local currency of construction
works included in subprojects.
3.09      The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1987.
D.   Benefits and Risks
3.10      By providing foreign exchange resources that are in critically short
supply in Zambia the project will assist in maintaining and expanding the
productive capacity of the country in manufacturing, in agro-industry and in
agriculture. Of particular importance-will be the development of agricultural
and agro-industrial firms that will help the country toward self-sufficiency
In food production. The proposed loan will directly contribute to total
investments of about US$48 million and create about 1,800 new jobs at an
estimated average cost of about US$27,000 per job while under the previous
line of credit, the average cost per job created was US$28,500. This results
from DBZ's increasing activities in labor-intensive enterprises. Furthermore,
the project will assist in strengthening DBZ as an institution.
3.11      The risks associated with the project are mainly related to the
general economic conditions of the country. A deepening of the economic
crisis could result into a considerable slowdown of investments in the sectors
concerned by the project; in which case commitments and disbursements under
the loan and credit could be considerably delayed.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
4.01      This report recommends a Bank loan of US$15 million on the terms
and conditions specified in para. 3.03.
4.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) With Government and DBZ, that DBZ will onlend to subborrowers
at a minimum of 12%.  This rate will be reviewed periodically
to keep it positive in real terms. DBZ's subborrowers will
assume the full foreign exchange risk.



- 29 -
(b) With Government that:
(i)   it will exempt DBZ from the 2% guarantee fee on the
Bank loan (para. 3.03(e)).
(c) With DBZ, that:
(i) it shall, no later than January 31, 1981 include
in its Policy Statement, a provision acceptable to
the Bank, specifying the condition under which it
will administer new Special Funds (para. 2.11(ii);
(ii) appraisal reports of projects for which DBZ's
financing will exceed K 200,000 will include the
calculation of an economic rate of return (para.

ANNEX 2
THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA
STRATEGY STATEMENT
The following principles will serve as a guide for DBZ's activities, during
coming years. They constitute DBZ's strategy to provide maximum assistance
to the economic development of Zambia and supplement DBZ's general objec-
tives as expressed in its Statutes and Operations Policies. After its
approval by the Board of Directors, this strategy will be widely publicized
within the institution so that staff are fully aware of it and become fully
committed to its implementation. It will be reviewed from time to time in
the light of developments occurring in Zambia's economy.
1.        In line with the objectives of the Third National Development Plan,
DBZ will concentrate its projects financing in the following prior-
ity sectors; agriculture, agro-industries, transport and engineer-
ing, construction and export oriented enterprises. Areas for financ-
ing will primarily include dairy and cattle farming, mixed farming,
maize milling, edible oils and fats, stockfeed, meat processing,
fruit and vegetable processing, manufacture of agricultural machines,
implements and tools, textiles and clothing utilizing loca-lly
produced cotton. DBZ promotion efforts will be concentrated in
identifying investment opportunities within these areas through
sectoral studies and contacts with possible investors.
2.        Within the key sectors selected, DBZ will place emphasis on the
identification and financing of projects which will utilize mainly
local raw materials and develop linkages within the manufacturing
sectors.
3.        DBZ will also pay particular attention to financing projects
which are labor-intensive and, therefore, likely to result in
large employment. As a guideline, project investment costs per
job created up to a level of K 16,000 to K 20,000 (about US$20,000
to US25,000 equivalent) would be considered as acceptable range. To
be eligible for financing by DBZ, projects with investment costs per
job exceeding K 24,000 (about US$31,000 equivalent) would have to be
justified on the basis of very large other other economic benefits.
To the extent possible, DBZ will assist its clients in selecting
technologies that are labor-intensive.
4.        During coming years, DBZ will make a special effort to assist
worthwhile Zambian entrepreneurs in manufacturing, agriculture
and possibly trade. This is considered a very effective way of
creating employment and developing in the long run, the industrial
base of the country. To that effect, a special unit will be
created within DBZ to identify, appraise and monitor the loans
to small-scale entrepreneurs. As the loan amounts are



- 32 -
ANNEX 2
likely to be below the present minimum of K 25,000 authorized
for DBZ loans, financing of small-scale enterprises will
necessitate an amendment to DBZ's Act allowing the Bank to
extend loans below that level within the framework of special
programs. DBZ will develop special appraisal, accounting
and supervision procedures for lending to small-scale enterprises.

THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.   APPROVALS
Loans. The basic assumption is that approvals will rise at an average
rate of 20% between 1981-84 as shown below:
(K 000)
1981                      21,000
1982                      25,920
1983                      31,104
1984                      37,325
The ratio of foreign to local currency approvals is assumed at 55:45.
Equity Investments of K 300,000 p.a. are projected for 1981 and there-
after through 1984.
2.   COMMITMENTS
75% of loans approved during the year will be committed in the same
year; 25% in the following year. Equity investments are all committed
in the year of approval.
3.   DISBURSEMENTS
Local Currency: 50% of loans committed during the year will be dis-
bursed in the same year, the balance in the following year.
Foreign Currency:  disbursements will be as follows:
(i)  20% of amount committed in the year of commitment;
(ii)  40% of amount committed in the following year;
(iii)  40% of amount committed in the next following year.
Equity investments will be in local currency and disbursed in the
year of approval.



- 4Q 
ANNEX 8
Page 2
4.   REPAYMENTS
(i) Forecast of repayment of loans already approved is based on
the present repayment schedules.
(ii) Repayment of loans to be approved in the future are assumed
to be over a period of eight years, beginning two years after
date of approval.
5.   INCOME
Loan Portfolio. Interest on loans is calculated at 12% p.a. on
the average loan outstanding during the year. Two types of com-
mitment fees are charged: 3% on foreign currency loans and 2%
on Kwacha loans on signing of contract and on undisbursed amounts
on the anniversary of contract signing.
Short-term Investments. Income from short-term investments is
assumed to be 7% p.a. on the average investments during the
period.
Equity Investments. Dividends from these investments are expected
to be minimal and are not included in the forecast.
6.   COST OF FUNDS
Foreign Currency Borrowings
(i) Interest on borrowings is calculated at 8% p.a. on the average
amount outstanding during the year.
(ii) Commitment charges are calculated at 0.75% of the amount com-
mitted but undisbursed during the year.
(iii) It is assumed that repayment of the World Bank loan will be
matched with recovery from sub-borrowers of the funds.
Local Currency Borrowings
(i)  Interest is calculated at 9% on disbursed and outstanding
loans.
(ii)  No commitment fees are payable on local borrowings.
7.   EXPENSES
Taxes. Development Bank of Zambia is exempt from income taxes for
an indefinite period.



_41_
ANNEX 8
Page 3
Administrative Expenses. Rent of office building is expected to
remain constant throughout the period. All other administrative
expenses except salaries are assumed to increase by 15% annually.
Salaries. K 456,000 is budgeted for 1981. Thereafter, K 20,000
p.a. is added for replacement of staff presently paid with bilateral
funds and possible new recruitment. An additional provision of 5%
per year is made for salary increments.
Dividends. Dividends on Class 'A' and 'B' shares are, assumed at
3% p.a., and at 8% p.a. on Class 'C' shares.
8.   PROVISION FOR LOSSES
No provision is made against bad loans as the Special Reserve is
meant for that purpose.
9.   FIXED ASSETS
Are assumed to increase by K 15,000 per annum net of depreciation.
10. RESERVES
DBZ is obliged to retain a statutory reserve equal to 25% of net
profit.
11.  SHARE CAPITAL
To meet future local currency requirements, it is assumed that Class
"C" preference shares up to a limit of K 10 million will be issued
and thereafter any requirements will be raised by means of bonds.
