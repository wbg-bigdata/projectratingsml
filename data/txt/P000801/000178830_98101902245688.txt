INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR AN
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Republic of The Gambia for the equivalent of US$4.0 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance an infrastructure and tourism project. The Federal
Republic of Germany, through the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the
African Development Bank (ADB) would make loans equivalent to US$5.2 million
for the same project. The ADB loan of US$2.1 million equivalent would be at
a 6 percent interest rate with a 1 percent commission on the amount disbursed
and repayable over 12 years following 5 years of grace and the KfW loan of
US$3.1 million equivalent would be at an interest rate of 2 percent and re-
payable over 20 years following 10 years of grace. Part of the IDA credit,
up to US$ 1.2   million, is to be onlent to the Gamlia Utilities Corporation
(GUC).
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of The Gambia" (907-GM) dated December
12, 1975 is being circulated to the Executive Directors. Its conclusions are
reflected in the following analysis. Country data sheets appear as Annex I.
3.        The Gambia is a small but densely populated country with 500,000
inhabitants occupying a narrow strip along both sides of The Gambia River and
forming an enclave of 10,400 Km2 inside Senegal. The population growth rate
is estimated at about 2.5 percent for the country as a whole but, due to the
urban drift, at 5 percent in the capital area. The population is predominantly
illiterate (90 percent). Economic growth is slow in real terms, about 2.6
percent p.a., i.e. about equal to the population growth rate. In 1974 per
capita GDP was estimated to be US$200.
4.        The economy consists mostly of traditional small holder rural
activities; agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 60 percent of
the country's total GDP and employ about 85 percent of the active population.
Agriculture is mostly rainfed, characterized by a short production period
limited to the six months of the rainy season, and dominated by groundnuts,
which are almost the only cash crop of The Gambia. Groundnuts are the main
source of foreign exchange, and constitute the basis for the country's major
industrial activity, groundnut oil milling. Income per capita of the 98,000
urban population, estimated at US$470 i.s 3.6 times higher than the average per
capita income of the 400,000 rural population, estimated at US$130.



- 2 -
5.        Economic activity in The Gambia reflects its structural weaknesses:
(a) low productivity of the rural sector; (b) wide seasonal fluctuations in
output and employment; there is full employment at the height of the agri-
cultural season but this is followed by six months of sharply reduced
activity in most economic sectors, including trade, transport and industry,
all linked to groundnuts; and (c) extreme vulnerability to variations in
groundnut prices and production levels (the latter essentially a function of
rainfall).
Recent Developments
6.        The Government has undertake;a both to diversify the Gambian economy
in order to reduce its dependence on groundnuts, and to increase the produc-
tivity of the rural sector, as shown by the shift in capital expenditures
between the 1967/68-1970/71 and the 1971/72-1973/74 Development Programs to
emphasize rural development. Under the latter program, the Government has
successfully undertaken action aimed al. diversifying agriculture by developing
irrigated rice along The Gambia River, cotton in the East, and vegetables
around the urban areas. Irrigation has allowed year-round rice production
and the IDA financed Irrigated Rice Project (333-GM) is estimated to have
provided 1,500 families with additional production of 5,000 tons of rice p.a.
(i.e.  about 12 percent of t'he ngtional, consumption requirements of rice).
The Government also requested the U.K. to conduct a Land Resource Survey on
which to base a comprehensive rural devrelopment strategy. This survey was
completed in February 1975 and is now being reviewed by Government. In
November 1975, an IDA mission appraised a project focusing on the develop-
ment of The Gambia's major crops ancl of' livestock, a hitherto largely
neglected subsector.
7.        The Government has also actively promoted establishment of hotels
and modern fish processing pLants, mostly with private financing, by ensuring
provision of infrastructure facilities, participating in the equity of some of
these enterprises, and granting tax holidays and other incentives. These
activities have had a beneficial impact on the balance of payments and have
resulted in the creation of about 2,500 jobs (i.e. about 20 percent of employ-
ment in the modern sector). Although the employmenl: generated by tourism is
largely seasonal, it comes at: a time when employment in the agricultural
sector is at a low ebb. In order to spur small-scale industrial and services
development, mobilize local savings and channel them together with foreign
financing to local entrepreneurs, the Government established in 1972 The
Gambia Commercial and Development Bank.
8.        The foregoing measures have already had some impact on The Gambia's
economy but performance conti.nues to be dominated by developments in the
groundnut sector. Thus, the doubling of groundnut prices was the major
determinant in the marked upt:urn of the Gambian economy in 1973/74. Combined
with an increase in the volume of produ,ztion, the price increases resulted
in a near doubling of farmers' income; a jump in public and semi-public (The
Gambia Produce Marketing Board) sector .;avings which rose to a record high of



- 3 -
about US$20 million (i.e. about the equivalent of two years of Central Govern-
ment tax revenues); an improvement in the current account of the balance of
payments from minus US$4 million in 1972/1973 to plus US$10 million in 1973/
1974; and an increase in foreign exchange reserves to US$35 million (equiva-
lent to over 10 months of imports) by the end of 1974. This dramatic price
increase more than compensated for the increased petroleum bill and the effects
of world wide inflation and contributed to an improvement in The Gambia's
terms of trade.
Development Prospects and Constraints
9.        This favorable situation is not expected to last.   Projected
decreases in groundnut prices together with increases in the prices of imports
are expected to cause a substantial deterioration in The Gambia's terms of
trade from 120 in 1973/74 (base 1967/63 = 100) to only 67 in 1979/80. Express-
ing these changes in terms of the real purchasing power of the economy, in
1973/74 gross domestic income was 8 percent higher than GDP, while in 1979/80
it is expected to be 13 percent lower.
10.       The Government is working on its first Five-Year Development Plan
which will cover the 1975-80 period. This Plan is expected to continue empha-
sis on the productive sectors: agricuLture, livestock, fisheries, tourism,
and possibly a small mining project (exploitation of rutile and kaolin depo-
sits). The Plan is further expected to include urban and transport infra-
structure and to stress the development of skilled manpower.
11.       Lack of skilled manpower is one of the major bottlenecks hindering
economic development and has slowed down the preparation and execution of
development projects in the past. The Plan will include a human resources
development program which will aim at creating in the shortest possible time
a stock of trained manpower at all levels. The Agricultural Development
Project recently appraised and the proposed Infrastructure and Tourism Project
will both have substantial training components, but improvement is needed in
the education/training system to make it more responsive to the needs of the
labor market; there is an oversupply of secondary school graduates coupled
with a lack of persons with specialized skills.
12.       Gross public investment undeir the Five-Year Development Plan
is estimated at US$67 million in current prices. This corresponds to annual
expenditures of about 11 percent of GD]', a sharp increase over the past, when
total public investment averaged only i-6 percent of GDP.
Financial Prospects and Foreign Aid
13.       The financing needed to implement the Development Plan is expected
to come from a combination of foreign aid, depletion of existing reserves, and
public savings generated during the Plan period. In recent years the Govern-
ment has managed to generate small budgetary surpluses as a result of its
efforts to improve tax collection and restrain the growth of recurrent



- 4 --
expenditures. However, these surpluses will disappear by 1979-80 because of
the implementation of agricultural and public works programs which will
require larger recurrent expenditures and because of the need to compensate
for inadequate material and maintenance expenditures in the past. Assuming
that groundnut prices decline as forecast, the Gambia Produce Marketing Board
will be unable to generate significant surpluses over the Plan period. Con-
sequently, total public savings, which reached a high of US$17 million after
debt service in 1973/74 are expected to total only US$1 million for the
period 1975 to 1980.
14.       With respect to foreign aid, IDA, the U.K., the Federal Republic of
Germany, the People's Republic of China, the ADB, and the European Common
Market countries are expected to providle about US$50 million in assistance
(at current prices) during the Plan pe:riod. The balance (about US$15 million)
of the necessary financing to implemenz the Plan would be provided from the
presently high reserves of the public sector and would require that foreign
exchange reserves be reduced from the equivalent of 10 months of imports to
4 months of imports over the period 1975 to 1980.
15.       In summary, our projections show that the Government will be able
to finance approximately 20 percent of its Five-Year Development Plan, princi-
pally from reserves. However, these pr-ojections are particularly sensitive
to the groundnut situation. A single bad crop, a slower rate of growth in
groundnut output, a drop in groundnut prices beyond forecasts or a combination
of these factors could seriously affect: realization of the Plan's objectives
and cause a sharp drawdown of the country's reserves.
16.       Borrowing from abroad will be mostly on concessionary terms; there-
fore the external debt servic:e ratio should remain relatively low, not
exceeding 5 percent by 1985. Similarly, debt service will not impose an
unduly heavy burden on budgetary receipts. Because of the diversification
of foreign aid donors, the exposure of IDA is expected to decrease from 40
percent of total outstanding debt in 1973/74 to 20 percent in 1985.
PART II:  BANK GROTP OPERATIONS IN THE GAMBIA
17.       To date, the Bank Group has approved two IDA credits to The Gambia.
One credit, of US$2.1 million in FY70 (187-GM), was for rehabilitation of
the port of Banjul, essential for a country so vitally dependent on foreign
trade. Due to a sharp increase in construction costs following appraisal, a
US$2.4 million supplementary credit was added in FY74. The second operation
was a US$1.3 million credit (333-GM) fcr the irrigation of 3500 ha under
rice cultivation and for the preparation of a follow-up project. Annex II
contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of November 30, 1975 and
notes on the execution of these two projects. The present project focuses
on the development of the tourism sector, in which The Gambia has some com-
parative advantages. It also aims at improving public utilities to better
serve the needs of both the Banjul urban community and tourism areas.



18.       We will continue to support Government in its efforts to increase
rural productivity and to diversify the economy. The next project, just
appraised, is the follow-up to the first agricultural project. It will pro-
vide a package consisting of extension services, training of farmers, trans-
port and marketing infrastructure, and agricultural credit and will be aimed
at increasing the yields of The Gambia's main rainfed crops (groundnuts,
millet, rice and vegetables) and the quality of the livestock herds. Beyond
this, efforts will be directed toward improving the education
and training facilities of the country through a Bank identification mission
which visited The Gambia this fall to determine possible operations in the
education sector.
19.       Due to the shortage of IDA fujnds and the relatively high cost of
projects in The Gambia, the Associatioli is actively promoting co-financing
with other donors. The present projecl; is co-financed, as will be the second
agricultural development project.
PART III: TOURISM SECTOR AND PUB116IC UTILITIES IN THE GAMBIA
I.   Tourism Sector
20.       Introduction:   The Gambia has natural advantages for the development
of tourism. It offers attractive and sjafe beaches, summer-like weather during
the European winter, and a location reasonably close to Europe. Having no
airline of its own nor any financial ir,terest in a regional air company, it
supports an "open skies" policy that facilitates charter operations. Moreover,
the climate for private investments is favorable: Government has adopted a
liberal policy for repatriation of capital and dividends and has exempted the
hotels from customs duties on imports of equipment and construction materials,
and from income tax for up to 7 years after the start of operations. Finally,
prices in The Gambia compare favorably with other West African tourist desti-
nations. Major drawbacks, vis-a-vis other destinations, are the lack of
trained staff and the almost total absence of long term financing for hotel
construction. Investors in The Gambia have had to resort to short-term loans
from overseas banks, and high interest rates on the international capital
market have restrained investments in The Gambia. In addition, the limita-
tions of The Gambia's international airport preclude the use of large jets,
resulting in increased air travel costs.
21.       Past Development:   Tourism development in The Gambia has been mostly
supported by private foreign initiative, starting in 1966/67 with the estab-
lishment of inclusive charter tours operated from Sweden by a private tour
company which also undertook the construction of hotels. The Government
concluded an agreement with that company, granting it a monopoly on charter
flights to The Gambia for five years and committing it to increase the
number of visitors by 30 percent per annum. This contract was revised in
1971, and since then both British and Danish firms have also operated in
The Gambia.



22.       The tourists going to The Gambia are mostly sun seekers and beach
based tourists; they are usually middle aged, middle income couples spending
some 12 days in the country on packaged tours costing about $400 per person.
Faithfulness to The Gambia is particularly high for a new destination, with a
15 percent repeat rate. The total number of visitors rose rapidly from about
500 in 1966/67 to nearly 25,000 in 1973/74, although a small decline (about
4 percent) was experienced during the 1974/75 season due to economic diffi-
culties in Europe. Hotel accommodations have also increased quickly, from
about 170 beds in 1966/67 to 1,880 in 1973/74. The hotels, mostly foreign
owned, were constructed on a modest basis at an average cost of US$5,000 per
bed.
23.       Tourism has two major advantages for the economy of The Gambia.     It
brings foreign exchange, which can be spent to expand other sectors of the
economy, and it creates employment during a period of the year when agricul-
tural activities are at a low point. The hotel industry is estimated to
directly employ about 1,100 people, mostly local, while indirect employment
in restaurants, shops, tour agencies, handicrafts, transportation and other
services is estimated at 1,000 jobs.   This represents about 15 percent of the
total employment in the modern sector (although on a seasonal basis only).
Gross foreign exchange earnings generated by tourism investment amounted to
about US$5 million in 1973/74, or some 15 percent of commodity exports.     Net
earnings amounted to about half of this amount, because of both the foreign
owned and managed character of the hotel industry, which results in substantial
transfers abroad, and the large import content of the hotels' consumption.
Because of production, marketing and storage problems, foodstuffs locally
produced are not up to hotel standards; presently about 85 percent of the
foodstuffs consumed in the hotels are imported.
24.       Prospects:   Although tourism will continue to largely rely on private
initiative and management, The Gambia is expected to capture progressively
larger benefits from tourism activities with the increasing Gambianization of
middle management, the expiration of the tax holiday period, and an expected
increase in consumption of locally produced foodstuffs. By the early 1980's,
tourism is expected to generate US$25 million gross foreign exchange per
annum, i.e. about 40 percent of the country's projected commodity exports.
Assuming a ratio of 0.6 emplcoyees per bed, the employment in the hotel indus-
try is expected to increase from 2,000 to 3,500 by 1985. The value added by
tourism is expected to increase by 6 percent per annum in real terms and to
account for 10 percent of GDF by 1985. In view of the very few industrial or
commercial opportunities in The Gambia, tourism is presently the only poten-
tially high growth element in the economy outside the rural sector.
25.       Market:   Projections are based on the assumption that the number of
tourists will increase from its present 25,000 to 45,000 by 1985/86. This is
a reasonable assumption in the context of the probable evolution of the
European long distance travel market and the likely parallel growth of visitor
traffic to Africa. A market survey assessing tour operators' interest in The
Gambia has concluded that Germany could become an important source of tourists,



- 7 -
provided the Yundum Airport runway is improved. An expansion of tourism
originating in Scandinavia, The Netherlands, Great Britain and Switzerland is
also expected.   The expected increase in the number of tourists would require
construction of about 250 beds per year within the next decade (from 1,800 beds
in 1975 to 4,500 in 1986), for which the tourism component of the proposed
project would provide the necessary infrastructure.
26.       Government's Participation i*a Tourism Development:  Up tot date,
development of tourism has cost the Government relatively little. Now, how-
ever, the situation is changing. It would be difficult to expand tourism
without the provision by the Government of new infrastructure, incLuding the
improvement of the Yundum Airport, long term capital for hotel con;truction,
and training facilities. The tourism zomponent of the proposed project pro-
vides for the infrastructure and training needed over the next five years.
Government has undertaken to finance the improvement and the extension of the
Yundum runway, in time for the 1978 tourist season, as well as to insure the
provision of a line of credit for hotel construction (Sections 4.08 and 4.04
of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The necessary funds will come
either from Government's own resources or through external borrowing.
27.       Social Implications:   The development of tourism in The Gambia is
having beneficial and detrimental effe,zts: the benefits are the tangible
extra income and the intangible stimulus provided by contacts with foreigners
of different cultural, social and economic background. These contacts, however,
create new needs and aspirations for the local population which they cannot
immediately satisfy because of their low level of income. Proper planning
and educational measures can, however, considerably alleviate these problems
and increase the value of tourism as a positive developmental factor for the
country. The Government has planned a labor support area adjacent to the
tourism area, which will be provided with basic infrastructure (financed under
the proposed project), educational and health facilities, and where tourism
employees will be able to keep their traditional patterns of family housing.
To ease cultural adjustments the Ministry of Education began in 1974 a tourism
information program for school children. The socio-economic study financed
under the project is aimed at formulating further recommendations and advice
in this field.
II. Public Utilities
28.       Public utilities in The Gambia are concentrated in the capital area.
Power facilities consist of the Half Die generating station supplying the
Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area and some small generating capacity supplying six
secondary centers. Water supply facilities are largely limited to the Banjul/
Kombo St. Mary area, where out of the nearly 100,000 people living in the
area more than 60,000 are on or near water lines; some 40,000 being served
by public standpipes, and another 20,000 by 2,700 private connections. There
is no public sewerage system in The Gamv'bia. However, studies for such a
system for Banjul are presently being ixndertaken.



- 8 -
29.       The Banjul power plant serves the capital and the present and pros-
pective tourist centers. Some parts c!f the generating station are 20 years
old, spare parts are lacking, and the main transmission and distribution net-
works are overloaded and subject to heavy losses and frequent breakdowns. The
present project aims at improving and expanding the Banjul power plant so
as to satisfy future demand, which is expected to increase by 11 percent per
annum under the impulse of expanding industrial, commercial and tourism activi-
ties in the Banjul area.
30.       The Banjul water system alsc, has weaknesses; a number of the bore-
holes are not in good working order and break down frequently; the consequent
overpumping of the remaining working boreholes sometimes leads to further
breakdowns. Also, distribution networks rely on very old pipes. The present
project aims at improving the existing water system and expanding it to both
the tourism and labor support areas.
31.       The Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC), which was created in 1972
from a department of the Ministry of Works and Communications, has nationwide
responsibility for the supply of electricity and water. It has, since its
establishment, incurred losses due to the inadequacy of its inherited tariff
structure, inexperienced management, and poor collection of bills and control
of both water and electricity losses. In an effort to improve the weak finan-
cial position, tariffs were raised in August 1974 and again in December 1975.
GUC has undertaken (Section 4.03 (b) of the draft Project Agreement) to take
all necessary steps (includin-g further increases in its tariffs) to produce
an annual rate of return of not less than 3 percent in 1978 and 1979 and
4.5 percent in 1980 on the value of its net fixed assets in operation. Speci-
fic to its electricity services, GUC has agreed to produce an annual rate of
return in 1981 and thereafter of 8 percent on its net fixed assets. With
respect to water services, it has agreed to an annual rate of return in 1985
and thereafter of not less than 3 perc,ont. An improved financial position
together with the proposed project invwstments, technical assistance, training
of personnel and improved administration are expected to result in a streng-
thening of GUC.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       In 1972 a Bank mission and Government officials identified a coastal
area west of Banjul suitable for tourism development. In the following two
years the Government, with assistance from UNDP and consultants, prepared
physical planning and engineetring studies for a tourism investment program.
While these studies were being prepared it was decided to extend the public
utilities component of the project to improve the whole of the public utili-
ties system of the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area.   As a consequence, the proposed
project now has two major comlponents: tourism infrastructure and public utili-
ties development. The proposed project, covers the initial 5-year phases of
the Government's 15-year program for tourism development and its 10-year
expansion program for electricity and water supply. In November 1974 the



- 9 -
project was appraised by an IDA mission. Negotiations took place on September
9 and 10, 1975. The Gambian delegation was led by Dr. Langley, Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development.
Project Description
33.       The components of the project primarily related to tourism infrastruc-
ture are:
(a) extension of an access road to the tourism area and construction
of secondary roads and paths between the resort sites and within
the adjacent villages;
(b) extension of telecommunications facilities to the resort sites and
adjacent villages;
(c)  construction of a sewerage system to serve the resort sites
consisting of a collection system, pumping station and stabilization
ponds;
(d) construction of public facilities and market stands for the sale
of local handicrafts, fruit, and other goods at the resort sites;
(e) establishment of a hotel training school and facilities including
the construction of classrooms, equipment, and the provision of
funds for technical assistance;
(f) establishment of a food storage and marketing program to increase
the amount of locally produced food purchased by hotels;
(g)  funds for the project managenent unit, a program of tourism
investment promotion, and two studies, one on the social,
economic and fiscal impact of the anticipated tourism develop-
ment and one on the possibility of using groundnut shells as an
alternative to imported oil for generating electric power.
34.       The components of the projecL primarily related to public utilities
development are:
(a) expansion and improvement of the electric power and water supply
systems in the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area including the resort
sites and adjacent villages;
(b) equipment for converting existing electricity generators to use
heavy fuel oil and construction of a fuel storage reservoir and
facilities to pump heavy fuel from the reservoir to GUC's generators;
(c)  consulting services and technical assistance to strengthen GUC.

Costs and Financing
35.       The total cost of the project (net of taxes) is estimated at US$11.3
million with a foreign exchznge component estimated at US$8.8 million (78 per-
cent). These costs reflect the conclusions of an updating mission which visited
The Gambia in November 1975.
36.       It is proposed that the entire foreign exchange component as well as
a small portion of local costs be financed from foreign sources. The project
would be co-financed with the African Development Bank (ADB) and the German
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) which would, respectively, finance the
expansion and improvement of the electricity and the water supply systems.
The IDA credit will be directed primarily to the tourism infrastructure compo-
nents of the project. The proposed financing plan is the following:

/1   Including heavy fuel conversion equipment and technical assistance for GUC.
37.       Part of the IDA credit, US$0.5 million, is to be onlent t:o GUC under
a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Association betweert Government
and GUC (Section 3.01 (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement)to finance
the sewerage component of the project. In the event that satisfactory arrange-
ments are reached concerning the supply of heavy fuel oil to GUC, an additional
US$ 0.7    million would be onlent to finance the heavy fuel oil component of
the project. The subsidiary loan would be at an interest rate of 8 percent
repayable over 17 years after four and a half years of grace, during which time
interest payments would be financed by Government.
38.       Since the Government had to assume substantial costs for project
preparation in close cooperation with IDA, it is proposed that part of the
expenditures for consultants' services, studies, and the project management
unit be financed retroactively. This retroactive financing would cover expendi-
tures incurred after February 1, 1975, up to a maximtm of US$150,000.



Procurement
39.       The procurement of equipmen; financed under the proposed credit,
with the exception of those items whii,h cannot be combined into contracts of
US$50,000 and over, would be through international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. Civil works contracts for roads and sewerage
which can be combined into contracts pf US$100,000 and over would be let on
the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, and awarded in accord-
ance with local procedures which are s!atisfactory to the Association. Civil
works contracts could be tendered either individually or combined into bidding
groups, at the bidder's option. Foreign firms would be eligible to bid, and
it is expected that firms established in Senegal would actively compete. GUC
or the Public Works Department (PWD) would undertake other civil works on force
account or contract for them locally.
40.       KfW financed items would be procured under its own regulations,which
are basically similar to IDA guidelines and involve international competitive
bidding. ADB financed items, under th,e terms of a line of credit to ADB from
Sweden, would be procured in Sweden.
Disbursement
41.       Disbursements would cover 1ao percent of the value of directly
imported equipment and materials, and 75 percent of the value of such equip-
ment and materials when procured locally, 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of professional services and 65 percent (representing the estimated
foreign exchange component) of the cost of civil works. The latter percentage
would be adjusted if necessary during the implementation period of the project
in order that withdrawals from the credit would continue prorata with remain-
ing expenditures. Disbursement on the items needed for conversion of the
generator power plant to heavy fuel oil would only be made if Government had
reached agreements satisfactory to the Association with regard to the delivery
of heavy fuel oil (Schedule 1, para 4(b) of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment).
Project Execution
42.       The project would be carried out by various agencies of the Govern-
ment: the Public Works Department for construction of roads; the Post and
Telecommunications Department for tele:ommunications facilities; the Ministry
of Information and Tourism for the hotel training school, shopping areas,
and beach facilities; the Department of Agriculture for the food storage and
marketing facilities; and the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial
Development for the various studies and the program for the promotion of
tourism investment (Sections 3.01(a) anid 1.01(g) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). The GUC would carry out the water, electricity, and
sewerage components of the project (Section 2.01 of the draft Project Agree-
ment). The overall execution of the project would be coordinated by the
Tourism Liaison Board (TLB), an interministerial body established in 1972
under the Town and Country Planning Act. A project management unit, headed



- 12 -
by a Project Manager financed under the Credit, would be located within the
TLB and would be responsible for day-to-day operations. The TLB would be
reorganized and would operate under t1le chairmanship of the Deputy Secretary
General in the Office of the President: (Section 3.03 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). Approval by the Association of the terms of reference for
the project management unit and appoir,,tment of a Project Manager acceptable to
the Association would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit.
Economic Justification
43.       The project provides infrastructure and services that will improve
public utilities facilities in Banjul and promote the development \f tourism.
It will also increase the share of the Government and Gambian natip,nals in
the benefits of the tourism industry, improve living conditions in the labor
support areas, provide hotel training facilities, and help promote sales of
local products to hotels and visitors. For purposes of the econom:c analysis,
the project has been split into two components, the public utilities works
and the tourism works.
44.       Tourism;   The rate of return of this component of the project,
including the capital cost of the hotels and the water and power investments
attributable to tourism but excluding the improvement of the airport, is
estimated at 15.4 percent. Including the cost of the airport, the rate of
return is 12.1 percent. A sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return
of the tourism works of the project--including the airport--would vary between
9.5 percent, with a 20 percent decrease in gross operating profits, and 13.3
percent, with a 10 percent increase in those profits. An increase of 20 percent
in investment costs would yield a rate of return of 10.7 percent.
45.       Public Utilities:   Using expected revenues for water sales as a
proxy for project benefits the internal rate of return on the water supply
component is 2.3 percent. The assumed level of rates for hotels and industrial
users is higher than economic cost and will result in cross-subsidization of
domestic and stand-pipe consumers, who will be charged at tariffs below econo-
mic cost because of their limited ability to pay. Nevertheless, the imbalance
between the amounts of water consumed by the different categories (domestic
and stand-pipe consumers account for 66 percent of total water consumption
compared to only 21 percent for hotel and industrial consumption) will act to
limit the rate of return. However, this rate is undoubtedly a conservative
estimate of the net benefits of the component because it does not reflect the
consumer surplus or the health and social benefits accruing to the population.
With respect to the electricity component of the project,the tariffs which will be
introduced ove the next few years are expected to ensure an internal rate of
return of 7 percent, again taking expected revenues as a proxy for project
benefits. As in the case of the water supply component this rate underestimates
the net economic benefits, particularly those of consumer surplus and from new
consumers.
46.       Distribution of Benefits:   In addition to the rate of return calcu-
lations reflecting the benefits of the tourism related works to the Gambian



- 13 -
economy, an assessment of the distribution of benefits between the hotels,
other operators of tourist facilities (taxis, handicrafts, and recreation)
who are mostly Gambian, and the Government has been carried out. This assess-
ment shows that Government receives a fair share of the benefits of the
project (in the form of incremental taxes) with a 10.9 percent rate of return
on its investment. The rate of return for hotel operations (9.6 percent) is
considered satisfactory in view of the fact that it is an after-tax figure
and does not include expected capital gains on subsequent disposal of property.
Assuming a debt/equity ratio of 70/30 and borrowing at 8.5 percent repayable
over 15 years, the return on equity would be 12.5 percent. The Government
has undertaken to provide funds for a program of long-term lending to hotel
operators. The main beneficiaries are the operators of tourist facilities
(other than hotels) since, with negligible investments, they receive about
18 percent of the project total gross operating profit.
47.       The rate of return on national investment outlays confirms that
the Gambian economy is the major beneficiary of the development of tourism.
Computed on the basis of the Government's investment in infrastructure and
local investment in hotel facilities (about 1/4 of total investments in hotel
facilities), and the revenues from the project accruing to the national economy
(earnings of residents and taxes) the rate of return on national investments
amounts to 13.0 percent; it is slightly higher than the overall project rate
of return (12.1 percent) and substantially higher than the rate of return
of hotel operations (9.6 percent). The benefits taken into account in the
economic analysis do not include economic and social benefits that will
result from better living conditions in the labor support areas, increased
participation of Gambian nationals in the tourism industry through training
and improved marketing of local products. Finally, the development of the
tourism industry and the charging of appropriate tariffs for water and elec-
tricity to that industry will assist in providing low cost public utilities
services to the poorest segments of the urban population.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of The
Gambia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the Gambia Utilities Corporation, the recommendation of the Committee

CR. No. 187    Banjul (formerly Bathurst) Port Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of May 26, 1970; Effective Date: August 14, 1970;
Fully disbursed
Supplementary Credit of US$2.4 Million of April 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project consists mainly of construction of the replacement of
an old berth and the repair of an existing wharf. It also provides for
purchase of a dredger and other equipment, and for engineering and consulting
services.
The project experienced a cost overrun on civil works, explained
by the fact that (a) appraisal was based on preliminary engineering; in the
course of completing final engineering, quantities needed had to be increased;
and (b) there was a sharp increase in the cost of building material between
the times of appraisal and tenders.
On March 26, 1974, the Board approved a supplementary IDA Credit of
US$2.4 million to finance the cost overrun. Total project cost has increased
from US$2.4 million to US$5.3 million; correspondingly, IDA financing has
increased from US$2.1 million to US$4.5 million.
The Project is now progressing satisfactorily and nearing completion.
CR. No. 333    Agricultural Development Project; US$1.3 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: April 20, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Agriculture is the principal economic activity in The Gambia, pro-
viding about 85 percent of total employment and accounting for about 60 percent
of GDP and 90 percent of the country's exports. This project supports Govern-
ment's efforts to diversify output, reduce dependence on groundnuts, and
increase productivity in the rural sector. The project has developed irrigated
rice production along The Gambia River. It is making satisfactory progress
and is estimated to have provided 1,500 families with an additional 5,000 tons
of rice p.a. (about 12 percent of the national consumption requirements). A
follow-up integrated agricultural development project has been prepared and
was appraised in November 1975.

Procurement Arrangements:
The procurement of equipment financed under the proposed credit,
with the exception of those items which cannot be combined into contracts of
US$50,000 and over, would be through international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. Civil works contracts for roads and sewerage
which can be combined into contracts of US$100,000 and over would be let on
the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, and awarded in accord-
ance with local procedures which are satisfactory to the Association. Civil
works contracts could be tendered either individually or combined into
bidding groups, at the bidder's option, Foreign firms would be eligible to
bid and it is expected that firms established in Senegal would actively
compete. GUC or the Public Works Department (PWD) would undertake other civil
works on force account or contract for them locally.
Consultants:
Total consultants' services would amount to 350 man-months.
