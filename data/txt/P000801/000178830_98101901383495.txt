THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
SUMKARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which would expand public utilities
(electricity and water) to meet domestic demand in the Banjul area, as well
as provide infrastructure for existing and proposed tourism development on
the Atlantic coast of The Gambia. The infrastructure facilities will open
three new tourism resort sites and improve an adjacent labor support area.
The African Development Bank and the Government of Germany would participate
in the financing of the project.
ii.       The project would provide water supply, electric power, telecommuni-
cations, sewerage, roads, public beach improvements, hotel training facilities,
and a food storage and marketing program. Additional funds would be included
for project management, investment promotion, technical assistance and studies.
Project execution would be coordinated by a management unit reporting to the
Tourism Liaison Board. Though not part of the project, the improvement of the
runway at Yundum Airport is necessary for further tourism development; the
Government expects to have this work completed by the beginning of the tourist
season in 1978.
iii.      The Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC), established in 1972, has
nationwide responsibility for supplying water and electricity. Rapidly
increasing population and hotel development require an expansion of GUC's
facilities in the Banjul area. The project would take care of the first
five years of a ten-year investment program prepared by GUC with the help
of consultants.
iv.       The Gambia, one of the smallest countries in Africa, depends on
agriculture (mainly groundnuts) for over 90% of its exports. Aside from its
agricultural potential and extensive beaches, it has few other exploitable
natural resources. The beaches, together with the country's pleasant winter
climate and relative proximity to the European tourism-generating market,
provide a favorable setting for tourism development. In the 1967-74 period
the number of charter tourists, mostly from Scandinavia, rose from 500 to
20,000 per year. Hotel accommodation increased during the same period from
170 to 1,880 beds. The project, which covers the first phase of a 15-year
tourism development plan, would provide the infrastructure for constructing
2,300 beds by 1986.
v.        Tourist arrivals in Africa account for less than 2% of world tourist
arrivals; they increased at a rate of 12% per year from 1963 to 1973. Two
major motivations of visitors to Africa are interest in African culture and
wildlife and search for seaside holidays. The Gambia attracts mostly beach-
oriented, middle-income European visitors. Thirty percent of the accommodation



- ii -
planned for the resort sites would be in vacation villages, 55% in bungalow
hotels, and 15% in hotels. The number of charter tourists to The Gambia is
projected at 45,000 by 1986.
vi.       The project is estimated to cost about US$11.3 million including
contingencies. Of this total an estimated US$4 million would be for tourism-
related infrastructure and the remainder for investments in public utilities
to meet the needs of the local population. The foreign exchange component is
about US$8.8 million. It is proposed that the foreign exchange component and
US$0.4 million of local costs, in total 81% of project cost, would be financed
from abroad. The African Development Bank would finance the electricity com-
ponent of the project (US$2.1 million); the German Government, through the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the water-supply component (US$3.1 million).
The local funds required to finance the project kand any cost overruns would
be provided by the Government. Of the proceeds of the three external loans,
the Government would onlend an amount of about US$6.4 million to GUC.
vii.      With the exception of those items that cannot be combined into
contracts of US$50,000 and over, equipment for the IDA-financed components
of the project would be procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Associations procedures. Civil works which can be
combined into contracts of US$100,000 and over would be awarded on the
basis of locally advertised competitive bidding. Small civil works would
be undertaken on force account or contracted locally.
viii.     GUC's financial objectives to recover the investment in its facili-
ties and to generate sufficient cash to service its debt, provide working
capital, and contribute to future investments would be achieved by improved
management (collection of bills, control of losses, and improved maintenance),
by gradually increasing electricity and water rates, and by immediately
charging hotels the full rate for utilities. Financial projections indicate
that these measures would result in an 8% return on net fixed electricity
assets by 1981, a 3% return on net fixed water assets by 1985, and an 8%
return on gross fixed sewerage assets by 1981.
ix.       It is expected that the tourism-related works and the investment
climate in The Gambia would be attractive for hotel investors and that the
new facilities would combine with the country's natural assets in attracting
tourists. Visitors' expenditures would result in incremental net foreign ex-
change earnings of about US$1.3 million in 1978 building up to about US$8.1
million per year after 1986. The G-overnment's incremental tax revenues from
tourist traffic would amount to US$0.2 million in 1978, increasing to US$1.0
million in 1986. When fully operational in 1986, the project is expected to
employ about 1,800 workers in hotels and other tourism facilities. An addi-
tional 900 jobs would be generated in handicrafts, agriculture, transporta-
tion, and construction.
x.        The economic rate of return on the tourism-related investments includ-
ing the runway improvement is estimated at 12%. The economic rates of return



- iii -
on the electricity and water-supply components of the project are estimated
at 7% and 2% respectively,
xi.       In the absence of other alternatives for economic development,
the Government feels that the economic benefits of tourism clearly outweigh
its possible adverse cultural and social effects, providing these effects
are minimized by proper planning and educational measures. Considerable
care was therefore taken in planning the labor support area to maintain the
traditional patterns of family housing and local government. Furthermore
a tourism information program for school children in the project area, the
establishment of a hotel training school, the inclusion of a food storage
and marketing program in the project, and the steps to be taken on the
recommendations of a study of the socioeconomic consequences of tourism are
expected to help alleviate any social problems that may arise. Strict
zoning regulations and building codes would ensure protection of the
environment.
xii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.0 million.






THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1972 a Bank mission and Gambian Government officials identified
a coastal area west of Banjul for priority tourism development. In the fol-
lowing two years the Government with assistance from UNDP and consultants
prepared physical planning and engineering studies for a tourism investment
program. While these studies were being prepared it was decided to extend
the public utilities component of the tourism development to meet the growing
needs of the-population of the Banjul area. Subsequent Bank missions agreed
with the Government that a first project should cover the initial 5-year
phase of the 15-year program for tourism development and of a 10-year expan-
sion program for electricity and water supply. This project was proposed
for IDA financing in August 1974.
1.02      In November 1974 the project was appraised by a mission consisting
of Messrs. van Gent, Bauer, Biancarelli, Renkewitz, and Thiam, and up-dated
in November 1975. Messrs. Jacob, Onslow and M4otte assisted in evaluating the
public utilities component and Messrs. Vera and Brizzi advised on the physical
planning. In view of the limited availability of IDA funds, members of the
appraisal mission discussed the possibility of African Development Bank and
German Government participation in financing the infrastructure and tourism
project.
1.03      Subsequent to the appraisal, the Association had further discussions
with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the German Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) during which it was agreed in principle that the AfDB
would finance the electricity component and the KfW the water-supply
component of the project. Although the electricity and water supply
components will not be financed by IDA, this report deals with the project
as a whole.
1.04      This would be the first IDA credit for tourism development in
The Gambia.
II. THE ECONOMY, THE TOURISM SECTOR, AND PUBLIC UTILITIES
A.  The Economy
2.01      An analysis of The Gambia's economy appeared in the report entitled,
"The Economic Development of The Gambia" (43-GM), dated March 29, 1973. An
updating economic memorandum is being prepared.



-2-
2.02      The Gambia is virtually a one-crop economy with 95% of its commodity
export earnings derived from groundnuts. The value of marketed groundnuts
is the most important economic factor in The Gambia inasmuch as it determines
the country's income and fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments developments.
As a result of buoyant export earnings, per capita GDP grew at an annual rate
of 4.4% between 1967/68 and 1972/73 to reach US$140.
2.03      Since there are few exploitable natural resources The Gambia has
little prospect of diminishing its dependence on agriculture, which accounts
for 50% of GDP, almost all exports, and 80% of employment.  The Government's
recent decision to encourage fisheries resulted in the establishment of two
fish-processing plants in 1973.  Fish produce accounted for 3% of exports in
1973.
2.04      Tourism at present offers the only significant alternative to
agriculture as a source of foreign exchange and employment in the country.
B.   The Tourism Sector
2.05      The Gambia's major tourism assets are its extensive palm-fringed
beaches, its pleasant climate during the European and North American winter,
and its relative proximity to the European tourism-generating countries.
The visitor is attracted by the lively and colorful marketplaces, the rich
bird life, and the majesty of the Gambia River. These assets, combined
with the country's stability, the widespread knowledge of English, and the
friendliness of its people, provide a favorable setting for the development
of tourism despite some drawbacks, such as limited sport and entertainment
facilities and the lack of infrastructure upriver which reduces the scope
of excursions.
2.06      Beach-based tourism traffic to The Gambia started in 1966/67 with
the establishment of charter-inclusive tours operated from Stockholm by
Vingresor. In 1968 the Government granted this company a monopoly of charter
flights to Banjul for five years, retaining an option to review the contract
after three years. Vingresor undertook to increase the number of visitors
by 30% every year. The Government revised the contract in 1971 in order to
allow British and Danish tour operators to serve The Gambia.
2.07      The total number of foreign visitors rose from 528 in 1966/67 to
24,800 in 1973/74 (Annex I, Table 1). Of these, 20,400 were charter tourists,
some 90% of them from Scandinavia, particularly Sweden (Annex I, Table 2).
Some 3,000 excursionists on cruises from the Canary Islands called at Banjul
but did not stay in hotels. Visitors to The Gambia are typically middle-aged,
middle-income couples, spending some 12 days in the country. "Faithfulness"
to Thle'Gambia is relatively widespread among them. The rate of repeat visits
is 15%, which can be considered high for a new destination (Annex I, Tables
3 and 4).
2.08      Hotel accommodation increased from 167 beds in 1966/67 to 1,880 in
1973/74 of which 1,650 are suitable for charter tourists. Gambian nationals
or residents own six hotels with a capacity of 400 beds located primarily in



Banjul (Annex I, Table 5). The remaining 1,480 beds are in four hotels
entirely owned and managed by foreigners and in a 400-bed hotel owned
jointly by the Government, Commonwealth Development Corporation, and
Vingresor. These larger hotels, catering almost exclusively to charter
tourism traffic, are located on the Atlantic beach west of Banjul in the
area selected by the Government for priority tourism development.
Construction costs have averaged less than US$5,000 per bed. Equity
financing for the hotels tends to be low (10-15% of total hotel costs); due
to the scarcity of local financial resources, debt capital had to be
obtained from overseas banks in the form of loans with short maturities
(3-5 years) and high interest rates (10 to 14%). Three travel agencies -
the most important one owned jointly by the Government and Vingresor -
arrange excursions by coach, boat, and even airplane for tourists wishing
to visit the interior of The Gambia and Senegal.
2.09      The tourist season has gradually extended and now begins in October
and ends in late April (Annex I, Table 6). It appears difficult to stretch
the season beyond May when destinations much closer to Europe offer more
attractive and cheaper beach holidays than The Gambia. Hotels experience
occupancy rates of 85% from December to March and about 45% during the re-
mainder of the season (Annex I, Table 7). Hotel operations are generally
profitable; some hotels, however, have difficulty in meeting their debt
service due to the short maturity of their loans.
2.10      A Ministry of State for Information, Broadcasting and Tourism set
up in 1970 in the President's office was replaced in 1974 by an independent
Ministry of Information and Tourism. The Ministry's responsibilities are
limited to hotel training and supervision of the industry. The Tourism Board
of The Gambia, chaired by the Minister of Tourism, is a forum for representatives
of public and private entities concerned with the hotel industry. Investment
promotion is carried out by the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial
Development (MEEPID). The Ministry for Local Government, Lands and Mines is
responsible for physical planning and for leasing land. Recognizing the need
to control tourism development, 1/ the Government created the Gambia Tourism
Liaison Board (TLB) 2/ in October 1972 under the Town and Country Planning Act.
2.11      Hotels may benefit from the incentives described in the Development
Act, namely, exemption of customs taxes on imports of equipment and construc-
tion materials, income tax holiday for up to seven years, and repatriation
of capital and dividends. These incentives, which apply to other sectors as
well, are moderate compared to those offered by competitors. Tourism promotion
1/   Tourism development includes hotels, motels, guesthouses, apartments,
nightclubs, etc.
2/   Present membership of the TLB includes the Permanent Secretary, Ministry
for Local Government, Lands and Mines (Chairman); the Deputy Secretary
General; the Tourism Officer; the Physical Planning Officer; the Lands
Officer; the Chief Economist; the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of
Agriculture.

is carried out primarily by tour operators. 1/ Hotel training is done largely
on the job. A UNDP/ILO hotel-training scheme, terminated in 1974, met with
limited success in training hotel staff but provided adequate training abroad
to four instructors. German authorities are considering a hotel-training
scheme under which Germany would provide the services of three instructors for
a period of two years.
2.12      In 1973/74 gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism amounted
to about D 9 million (US$5.5 million) representing some 15% of commodity
exports and 7% of GDP.  Net foreign exchange earnings are estimated at 45%
of gross earnings and amount to about D 4 million (US$2.4 million). 2/
During the season the hotel industry employs directly about 1,100 people.
Indirect employment in restaurants, shops, tour agencies, and in construction,
handicrafts, agriculture, transportation and other services is estimated at
1,000 jobs.
2.13      The Government is committed to the continued expansion of the tourism
industry. The development for the sector calls for the construction of 7,500
additional beds to be located in the Kotu and Brufut sites (Map 1). The first
phase of development would comprise the construction of 2,300 additional beds
in the Kotu site by 1986.
C.   Public Utilities
2.14      The Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC), a Government-owned company,
has nationwide resnonsibility for supplying electricity and water. Within
the Banjul area (the project area) electricity and water supply each consti-
tute an integrated system. Since hotels account for only between 8 and 14%
of the water and power consumed in the project area, it is primarily the future
demand of the increase in economic activity and population in the Banjul area
which determines the expansion requirements of GUC.
2.15      Established in 1972 under the Gambia Utilities Corporation Act,
GUC is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the Managing Director,
one director representing domestic users, and five directors with experience
in public utilities, industrial and financial matters, as well as administra-
tion and labor relations. All GUC staff, with the exception of the Managing
Director and one engineer, are Gambians. Several key officers are now in
training abroad.
2.16      GUC's permanent staff totals 402 employees.  In the Electricity
Division, 70% of the permanent staff is illiterate  in the Water Division,
82,.  WNork is therefore done largely by rote.  Since GUC was created from a
ministry department, it also faces tle manvagerial problem of converting the
mentality and habits of former goverament employees to the standards of a

modern public utility corporation. This situation should improve, however,
with technical assistance by consultants (para. 7.02) and the implementation
of an ILO program providing training at various levels to GUC staff in The
Gambia and abroad which is expected to begin in 1976.
2.17      GUC's Banjul power plant, the Half Die diesel generating station,
has a capacity of 10 MVA of which 2 MVA is almost 20 years old. The station
is difficult to operate because spare parts are lacking. The main transmis-
sion and distribution network of the Banjul area is overloaded and subject
to heavy losses and frequent breakdowns. Expansion of overloaded water
facilities that suffer from losses and breakdowns is also urgently needed.
The present groundwater sources are tapped to capacity and new well fields
will have to be developed.
2.18      In a first effort to improve GUC's weak financial position tariffs
for electricity and water were raised in August 1974. This boosted electri-
city revenues about 30% per Kwh. The minor increase in water rates did not
change revenues noticeably. In order to achieve a reasonable rate of return
on its fixed assets in operation and generate an appropriate amount of working
capital - one of the objectives set forth in the GUC Act - GUC will have to
improve its efficiency and further increase its tariffs.
2.19      In 1973 GUC commissioned a study 1/ of its investment requirements
to provide adequate public utilities to the urban and periurban population
in the project area, The study proposed a two-phase investment program cover-
ing investment in generating capacity, transmission lines and distribution
networks for water and power. The first phase of the construction program
would be completed by 1980.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Area
3.01      The project area is located on the west coast of The Gambia, south of
the Gambia River (see maps). It includes the city of Banjul, Kombo St. Mary
and Kombo North. In this region the Government has selected for priority
tourism development a coastal belt, four kilometers long, some six kilometers
south of the Gambia River. The tourism area extends over a plateau covered
by woods featuring mangos, baobab and palm trees, sloping gently towards the
sea. With the exception of a few spots affected by erosion, the beaches are
fairly stable. They are usually large and made up of fine sand. Unlike most
other beaches in West Africa The Gambia's are relatively safe for swimming;
the sea floor declines gradually and the waves' impact is greatly reduced by
an offshore sandbar. To the interior from the beach area are Gambian villages

with Howard Humphreys and Crown Agents (UK).

surrounded by farmland and forest. During the winter months the weather is
dry and daytime temperatures are between 20 and 25°C. During the summer
rainy season, the weather is humid and uncomfortably hot.
3.02      Approximately 15 km southeast of the tourism area is Yundum Airport.
At present it can safely receive onLy Boeing 720s, partially loaded DC-8s,
BAC llls, and smaller aircraft. The Government is committed to improve the
runway to allow unrestricted landing and takeoff by most types of long-haul
aircraft. The AfDB has retained consultants to carry out the final engineer-
ing study. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government
will complete the extension of the airport runway by the beginning of the
tourist season in 1978. The existing road system offers easy access to the
main urban centers and to the airport. Besides the power and water needs
noted above (para. 2.17), public sewerage is nonexistent. The tele-
communications network, on the other hand, is adequate and can easily be
extended to the tourism area.
3.03      The land in the northern part of the tourism area is owned by the
State and can be leased by the Ministry for Local Government, Lands and Mines.
The land in the southern part of the tourism area is vested in the District
Authority which administers it on behalf of the local population. An 800-
meter-wide strip of land along the seashore has been leased by the District
Authority for 99 years to the "jMinister in Charge of Lands on Behalf of the
Government of the Republic," who has the authority to lease it to third
parties with the consent of the District Authority. The leases for hotel
sites are for a 30-year period with land rent revision every seven years.
The leases for condominium and urban sites are for 40 and 50 years respec-
tively. The lease for hotel sites has two components: a yearly land rent,
payable in advance, and a premium, in the form of a competitive offer by in-
vestors, payable with the first land rent
B.   Planning and Environmental Aspects
3.04      Until now construction of new hotels in The Gambia was regulated
only by building codes without benefit of any master plan. The basic concept
of the Government's recently completed physical plans 1/ is to provide
tourism infrastructure and development for the project area within the
context of stringent regulations for land-use buildings, and environmental
protection. These plans define two distinct but interrelated zones, the
tourism areas near the coast and the labor support areas inland, with the
1/   The study was prepared by the Physical Planning Office (PPO) with the
assistance of a Physical Planning Mission of UNDP and of international
consultants, in particular the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO). The
Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development (MEPID)
coordinated the preparation of the project. Further technical studies
were made by Coopers & Lybrand Associates, Ltd. in association with
Crown Agents, Howard Humphreys & Sons and G. Maunsel & Partners.

Badala Parkway as a landscaped boundary between them. Selected for the first
phase of development is the Kotu tourism area containing three resort sites -
Kotu Beach, Kotu Point, Kotu Strand - and a labor support area, Kotu Town.
The resort sites are separated by nature reserves; the forest along the Badala
Parkway will also be spared. The general layout of the three resort sites
is similar. In the center of the resort areas, where the access roads from
the Badala Parkway end, a focal point of activity is planned to include a
parking area, shops, and recreational and sports facilities.
3.05      The site of Kotu Strand, already under development, 1/ is planned
to accommodate two hotels with a total of 565 beds and a recommended density
of 150 beds/hectare. Kotu Point and Kotu Beach could ultimately accommodate
1,500 beds each with a)9 average respective density of 130 and 100 beds/hec-
tare. The planning studies also propose the creation of apartments and
villas (25% of total hotel capacity) along a secondary coastal road connect-
ing the hotel sites. Since these will not be built until the second phase,
the project does not provide detailed infrastructure for them. The labor
support area of Kotu Town is planned to improve and extend two existing vil-
lages, Manjai Kunda and Kololi, with a combined present population of about
1,500. The entire area would be divided into four neighborhoods (kundas),
with an average density of 60 persons/hectare, and a town center providing
public services.
3.06      Both tourism and labor support areas appear properly planned to
prevent environmental deterioration. The landscape is enhanced by large
reserves between the tourism and the labor support areas. The Physical
Planning Office (PPO), under the Ministry for Local Government, Lands and
Mines, has a set of detailed land-use and infrastructure maps which will
serve to regulate development in the areas. A new Planning Act enabling PPO
to exercise the necessary land-use control is under discussion and is ex-
pected to be passed shortly. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that within one year of the signing of the credit: (i) the Government will
enact building and planning laws which would permit the PPO to exercise
adequate control over land use and would assign to the PPO full responsibility
for the issuance of building permits; and (ii) the PPO will establish
architectural and landscaping standards and regulations for the tourism and
labor support areas, satisfactory to the Association.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project would consist of:
(a) expansion of the present water-supply and electric power systems
serving the Banjul, Kombo St. Mary and Kombo North areas, and
their extension into the tourism and labor support areas;
1/   Hotel Bungalow Beach (225 beds) opened in November 1973; another 340-bed
hotel, the Kombo Beach, is under construction.



(b) conversion of the power-generating plant in Banjul to heavy fuel
oil;
(c)  extension of the telecommunications facilities to the tourism
and labor support areas;
(d) sewerage and solid waste disposal for the tourism area;
(e) extension of an access road to the tourism area and construction
of secondary roads and paths between the resort sites and within
the labor support area;
(f) public beach facilities and shopping areas for the resort sites;
(g) hotel-training facilities for about 50 trainees, including the
construction and equipment of classrooms and funds for technical
assistance;
(h) a food storage and marketing program aimed at increasing the pro-
portion of locally produced food consumed by tourists in order to
reduce imports;
(i) funds for the project management unit, investment promotion,
studies and technical assistance to strengthen GUC.
4.02      Since Banjul and its surroundings are inadequately supplied with
water by aquifers already tapped, additional water for the integrated system
serving the project area would come from groundwater sources near Yundum
Airport. A few boreholes presently tapping these aquifers indicate that water
of good quality is available. Six producer boreholes and 8 km-transmission
mains from the Yundum well field are required to meet the demand of both
tourists and the local population. The water component of the project would
also include storage and distribution facilities for the tourism and labor
support areas, distribution pipelines for limited extensions and renewal of
mains in the town of Banjul and its suburbs, plus vehicles and workshop
facilities. The water-supply component is reviewed in more detail in Annex
VI.
4.03      The electricity component of the project, although providing the
infrastructure necessary to supply the tourism area, serves primarily to
reinforce GUC's installations in the Banjul area. It includes:
(a) expanding the capacity of the Half Die power station with a diesel
generator of about 3MW;
(b) equipping three new 33/11 kV substations in order to upgrade the
33 kV line now under construction, and constructing and equipping
four 11/0.4 kV substations;
(c) constructing a 33 kV transmission line between Yundum and Brikama;



(d) constructing 11 kV transmission lines and 400/230-volt distribu-
tion lines, both overhead and underground, in the tourism and
labor support areas; and
(e) supplying tools, instruments, and vehicles.
The electricity component is reviewed in more detail in Annex V.
4.04      The light fuel oil that GUC now consumes in its Power Station is
expensive and a shift to cheaper heavy fuel oil is recommended. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained that the Government will use its best
efforts to make arrangements for the supply of heavy fuel oil to Banjul from
abroad. Subject to the conclusion of such arrangements the following
equipment would also be provided under the project:
(a) facilities to pump the heavy fuel oil from the jetty at Banjul to
GUC's power station
(b)  a 1,000 m3 fuel oil storage reservoir;
(c) equipment necessary to adapt the existing Half Die diesel
generators to hleavy fuel oil.
4.05      The Post and Telecommunications Department (P&T) will provide the
three resort sites in Kotu and the labor support area with telephone service
from its Sarakunda exchange by means of a 150-pair trunk line. This will
permit each hotel to have three outside lines and install switchboards for
internal service. In addition, each of the three resort sites will be served
by a telex connection.
4.06      The Badala Parkway, a 7.3 m-wide road projected along the Atlantic
coast, of which about 2 km have already been constructed, will be extended
for another 2.7 km to provide access to the tourism area in Kotu. From this
parkway two roads 6.7 m wide a2d 0.5 km long will provide access to the re-
sort sites, where some 5,500 m of common areas will be paved. A 2.5-m-wide
and 3.5-km-long, lighted, foot and bicycle path will connect the three resort
sites. Some 4.6 km of 6.7 m-wide roads will run from the existing villages
through the labor support area to the resort sites. The roads and paved areas
will have a 15-cm-thick compacted laterite base and a surface sealed with
bitumen and dressed with crushed shells.
4.07      The project will include a sewerage systemi serving the three resort
sites at Kotu (Annex VII). Considering the proximity of the sites, avail-
ability of land, and climatic conditions, stabilization ponds are an effec-
tive and inexpensive way to treat sewage. Two sites for the ponds have
been found which meet the needs of the projected tourism development and
offer the possibility of reusing the effluent for irrigation. The choice of
the pond site will be made during the final stage of the project design.

4.08      Under the project a tractor, trailer, and bulldozer would be pro-
vided to collect, transport, and dispose of solid waste in sanitary fills
at a site south of the labor support area. The same equipment would be used
for cleaning the beaches.
4.09      Public beach facilities, mainly for the local population, would
be constructed on or near the beaches between the resort sites. They would
consist of dressing rooms, showers, and sanitary facilities. The beaches
would be cleaned and, where necessary, graded: access paths and nearby
parking facilities would be provided African-style market stands for the
sale of local handicrafts and fruits would also be erected. They would be
rented to local merchants and would help eliminate undesirable sales
activities on the beaches.
4.10      The hotel-training facilities would consist of two classrooms, a
language laboratory, and workshops (for kitchen, restaurant/bar, front
office, and housekeeping training). The facilities would be adequate to
give basic training to 50 students annually and upgrade another 50 already
employed in the industry. The basic course would extend from October to
June with practical training in a rented beach hotel in July and August.
The upgrading courses would be run full time during July and August in the
"training" facilities. Middle-management personnel would be trained abroad.
Two man years of technical asistance complementing that provided by Germany
(para. 2.11) are included in the project to help prepare the detailed
curricula and open the facilities. The instructors trained by the ILO/UNDP
project in 1972-74 would staff the hotel school.
4.11      About 85% of the foodstuffs consumed by tourists is now imported,
partly because of the absence of proper marketing channels and storage facil-
ities. A food marketing and storage program has therefore been included in
the project as the fastest way to increase tourist consumption of locally
produced food (Annex IX). This prcgram would provide a storage complex,
including a reception and grading area, dry storage, cold storage, and a
deep-freeze plant to supply fresh food regularly during the tourist season.
The services of an experienced marketing manager (for three years) and an
engineer for plant maintenance (for one year) would also be financed under
the project. The food storage and marketing program would serve as a pilot
for a larger horticultural storage and marketing project which the Government
is preparing and which would later incorporate this program.
4.12      During negotiations it was agreed that
(a)  the terms of reference and proposed timing for the technical
assistance personnel to be emnloyed in the hotel-training school
and the food marketing and storage program will be submitted for
the Association's approval within si. months of credit signing;
(b) hiring and replacement of the technical assistance personnel will
take place in consultation with the Association.

4.13      The project also provides funds for a small project management unit
to coordinate execution of the project, an investment promotion program, two
studies and technical assistance to GUC. The costs of the project management
unit, essentially consisting of an expatriate project manager and a secretariat,
would be met for a period of five years. The investment promotion program
would provide for expert services, promotional materials, and an advertising
campaign to attract hotel investors to The Gambia. This program would also
prepare the establishment in The Gambia of a line of credit for hotel cons-
truction (para. 6.10). A socio-economic study would:
(i)  assess the likely social impact of tourism development on the local
population and make specific recommendations to counter possible
adverse effects;
(ii)  assess the economic impact of tourism development and examine means
of ind4easing the return from the tourism industry to the Gambian
economy;
(iii)  assess the appropriateness of current legislation (land lease, zoning
regulations, taxation and incentives) affecting tourism development
and recommend improvements.
The other study would investigate the possibility of burning groundnut shells
as an alternate to imported oil for generating electric power. During negotia-
tions the Government agreed that it would, within three months of signing of
the credit, submit terms of reference for the socioeconomic and alternative
fuel studies to the Association for approval and complete the socioeconomic
studies within two years, and the alternative fuel study within one year of
signing of the credit,
B.   Cost Estimates
4,14      The detailed cost estimates, the foreign exchange components, and
the contingency allocations for the various project components are given in
Annex II and are summarized in Table I.
4.15      An average of 11% of base line costs (1975 prices) has been allowed
for physical contingencies. To account for the impact of worldwide inflation
on the costs of labor, material and equipment a 10 to 16% price increase per
year is provided for civil works and 7 to 12% for equipment, resulting in a
price contingency of 31% of base line costs plus physical contingencies. The
overall contingency provision amounts to 42% of base line costs. The cost
estimates are net of taxes.
4.16      Professional services for the project are estimated at D 4.1 million
(US$2.3 million) or 21% of project cost. This would represent about 350 man
months of consultants' services.
4.17      Practically all construction materials and equipment for the project
have to be imported. The foreign exchange component is therefore estimated
at 78% (US$8.8 million) of total project cost (US$11.3 million).

C.        Amount of Credit and Lending Arrangements
4.18      It is proposed that the estimated foreign exchange cost of the
project (D 15.9 million, US$8.8 million) be financed from foreign sources.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) would provide a loan for the electricity
component of the project (exclusive of the heavy fuel adaptation) estimated
at US$2.1 million. The German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) would
finance, on concessionary terms, the water-supply component of the project
for an estimated amount of US$3.1 million. The Association would provide a
credit of US$4.0 million to finance all the remaining project components.
The signing of the financial agreements between AfDB and the Gambian Govern-
ment for the electricity component and between KfW and the Gambian Government
for the water-supply component would be conditions of effectiveness of the
IDA credit. The Gambian Government and the GUC would contribute 19% of project
cost (US$2.1 million) through budget allocations and internal cash generation.
The Government would also meet any cost overruns. The financing plan is given
in Table II.

14 -
4.19      Since the Government has had to assume considerable costs for project
preparation, it is proposed that part of the expenditures for professional
services be financed retroactively. This retroactive financing by IDA would
cover only expenditures incurred after February 1, 1975, up to a total of
US$150,000 or 1.3% of total project cost.
4.20      The proposed financing from IDA, AfDB, and KfW would be made to
the Gambian Government. An amount of US$6.4 million covering 86% of the
estimated cost of the electricity, water-supply, and sewerage components of
the project would be onlent to GUC. The conclusion of a subsidiary credit
agreement satisfactory to the Association, between the Government and GUC,
including the re relending of funds provided by the Association for the
sewerage component of the project (US$0.5 million) to GUC, would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the credit.
D.   Procurement and Disbursement under the IDA Credit
4.21      With the exception of those items which cannot be combined into
contracts of US$50,000 and over, equipment would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Civil works
contracts for roads, and sewerage which can be combined into contracts of
US$100,000 and over would be let on the basis of competitive bidding,
advertised locally, and awarded in accordance with local procedures which
are satisfactory to the Association., Civil works contracts could be
tendered either individually or combined into bidding groups, at the bidder's
option. Foreign firms would be eligible to bid, and it is expected that
firms established in Senegal would actively compete. GUC or the Public
Works Department (PWD) would undertake other civil works on force account
or contract for them locally.
4.22      The proposed IDA credit of US$4.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange component of the project except electricity and water-supply. Disburse-
ments would cover 100% of the CIF value of imported equipment and materials,
100% of the foreign exchange cost of professional services and 65% (representing
the estimated foreign exchange component) of the cost of civil works. The latter
percentage would be adjusted if necessary during the implementation period of
the project in order that withdrawals from the credit would continue prorata
with remaining expenditures. Disbursements on the items needed for the switch
from light to heavy fuel oil (para. 4.04) would only be made if the Government
had reached agreements, satisfactory to the Association, with regard to the
delivery of heavy fuel oil. Any furnds remaining in the credit account upon
completioi. of the project would be used at the discretion of IDA for other
project-related expenses. A schedule of IDA disbursement is given in Annex III,
Table 2.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Project Execution
5.01      The execution of the project would be coordinated by the Tourism
Liaison Board (TLB). To ensure efficient coordination the membership of the
TLB would be modified, with the Deputy Secretary General (President's
Office) becoming its chairman, the Physical Planning Officer its secretary,
and its membership including the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries
of Finance and Trade, Economic Planning and Industrial Development and
Information and Tourism; the Managing Director, GUC; the Director of Public
Works; and the Project Manager. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the composition of the Tourism Liaison Board will be modified
as indicated above within three months of credit signing.
5.02      The TLB, through the Project Management Unit, would:
(i) prepare time schedules for execution of the various project
components;
(ii) coordinate the work of the various agencies involved in project
implementation;
(iii)  approve agreements with consultants, contractors and suppliers
made by these agencies;
(iv) approve the agencies' authorizations for payments under the project;
(v) install and maintain an accounting system for all project components
not dealt with by GUC;
(vi) insure that the Association's requirements concerning the project
are adhered to.
Approval by the Association of the terms of reference for the project manage-
ment unit and appointment of a Project Manager acceptable to the Association
would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit.
5.03      Each specialized agency (GUC for water, electricity, and sewerage;
PWD for roads, the Tourism Division of the Ministry of Information and
Tourism for the training school, the shopping areas, and beach facilities;
the Department of Agriculture for the food storage and marketing facilities)
would be responsible for the design and implementation of the individual
components under its jurisdiction. During negotiations GUC agreed to retain
consultants acceptable to the Association who would be responsible for the
final design of public utility works and would supervise their implementation.
During negotiations it was further agreed that the Association would be con-
sulted before the event if GUC's Managing Director should be replaced.



- 16 -
B.   Organization for Operation
5.04      The Mtinistry of Works and Communications would be responsible for
maintaining roads and foot and bicycle paths (through PWD), and it would
also operate and maintain the telecommunications system (through its P&T
Department). GUC would own, operate, and maintain the facilities for
electricity, water supply, and sewerage. The Tourism Division which runs
the Craftsmen's Market in Banjul, a major tourist attraction, would
administer the shopping areas. The Tourism Division would also operate
the hotel training school. The Public Health Department of the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Social Welfare would arrange for the collection and
disposal of solid waste in the tourism area by either the Kanifing Urban
District Council or a private contractor. Beaches would be cleaned in the
same way. Environmental sanitation, including the control of mosquitos and
other insects in the tourism and labor support areas, would be provided by
the Public Health Department as part of its regular tasks. The Department
of Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture would operate the food storage
and marketing program. The TLB would assure coordination among these
agencies. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government
will assign the above responsibilities to the agencies concerned.
5.05      The Government has agreed to provide, for the lifetime of each pro-
ject component, adequate funds to the Ministry of Works and Communications for
maintaining the roads, to the Ministry of Information and Tourism for maintain-
ing the shopping areas and for maintaining and operating the hotel training
school, and to the Ministry of Agriculture as an initial operation advance for
the food storage operating and marketing program which is expected to generate
sufficient funds to cover its operating and maintenance expenditures. The
operating and maintenance costs of waste disposal and beach cleaning would be
covered by payments from hotels.
5.06      The agencies responsible for maintenance and operation of the vari-
ous components of the project have all been appraised and are considered able
to perform their tasks. Their responsibilities and the sources of maintenance
funds are shown in Table III.

VI.  MARKET DEMAND AND ACCOMMODATION DEVELOPMENT
A.   Mlarket Demand
6.01      Although tourist arrivals in Africa account for less than 2% of
world tourist arrivals, they increased at an annual compound rate of 12%
from 1963 to 1973 while world tourist arrivals increased only 8% (Annex X,
Table 1). The two major interests that attract visitors to Africa are
African culture and wildlife and seaside holidays on uncrowded beaches.
The first motivation is reflected in the traditional African market of
higher-income persons visiting Black Africa on multiple stopovers originating
in North America or Europe. To cater to this traffic, luxurious and
expensive hotels have been built in most African destinations. By contrast,
beach-oriented traffic consists primarily of middle-income European visitors
spending their vacation at a single destination in cheaper vacation-village-
type accommodations. Such beach-motivated traffic accounts for the
remarkable development of tourism in such destinations as the Canaries,
Morocco, and Tunisia during the '60s and is now spreading to West Africa.
Whereas most North African destinations are primarily summer destinations,
West Africa attracts beach-based tourism in the winter.



- 18 -
6.02      Among West African winter destinations for sun and beach-based
tourism, The Gambia has an advantageous position. Like Senegal it offers
attractive and safe beaches and truly pleasant weather during the winter;
it enjoys considerably lower humidity and much clearer skies than the Ivory
Coast, Togo, Cameroon, and the Canaries, and no rain during the tourist
season. These climatic assets combined with the widespread use of the
English language enable it to attract visitors from the major North European
tourist-generating countries (such as Scandinavia, Germany, England, the
Netherlands). Furthermore, since The Gambia - unlike its competitors - has
neither an airline of its own nor participation in a regional airline, it
maintains an "open skies" policy which greatly facilitates air-charter
operations.
6.03      The proposed hotels would be marketed through tour operators.
The marketing strategy proposed for the Kotu development will focus on the
market segment already attracted to The Gambia: middle-income, sun-seeking
visitors during the winter season. Suggested package prices for Kotu would
include one-, two-, and three-week vacations. At the proposed vacation
village of Kotu Point a typical two-week package on full board has been
costed at US$580 (at 1975 prices), including air fare, which compares
favorably with packages in competing West African destinations (Annex X,
Table 2).
6.04      A survey of major European tour operators has concluded that by
1978/79, when Yundum Airport is improved, The Gambia will be able not only
to increase its share of the Scandinavian and British markets, but also to
tap new markets such as the German, Dutch, and Swiss (Table IV).
Table IV
Market Prospects for Charter Tourism
Weekly Flights       Available Seats      Beds Required  Visitors
1975/76         5                  765                 1,600         20,000
1980/81         8                1,300                 2,800         30,000
1985/86        11                1,900                 4,200         45,000
The projected number of charter tourists to The Gambia, 45,000 in 1986, is
reasonable in the context of likely growth of visitors to Africa and the
probable expansion of the European long-distance travel market.
6.05      If the demand for African travel triples by 1985/86 from its 1973
figure of 3.8 million arrivals, (equivalent to a growth rate of 9%, lower
than the rate of growth of African arrivals over the 1963-73 period),
projected arrivals to The Gambia would represent only 0.4% of total African
arrivals.  This figure compares with 0.5% registered in 1973/74.



- 19 -
6.06      By 1985 about 10.2 million Europeans are expected to spend more
than US$550 per capita (at 1975 prices) on vacations, or about the cost of
a package to The Gambia. Of these- about 3.5 million are expected to go on
long-distance winter vacations. Total estimated arrivals to The Gambia in
1985/86 would then represent 1.3% of the potential European long-distance
winter market.  The market demand is reviewed in more detail in Annex X.
13.  Accommodation Development
6.07      To cater to the potential increase in demand. the following
accommodation buildun has been scheduled (Table V):

/c   400-bed vacation village and three bungalow hotels of 250 beds each
6.08      Despite investors' interest in Kotu  as evidenced by the completion
of the Bungalow Beach hotel and the initiated construction of the Kombo Beach
hotel, potential developers are restrained by the lack of hotel credit at
reasonable terms and high land leases.
6.09      Whereas in most comDeting tourism destinations hotel investors can
obtain a substantial portion of their long-term financing within the country,
investors in The Gambia have had to resort to short-term, high-interest loans
from overseas banks, backed by personal guarantees (para. 2.08). With high
short-term interest rates in international capital markets, this situation
has become even more difficult.



- 20 -
6.10      Assuming a 70/30 debt-equity structure, a total /of D 24 million in
1975 prices (or about D 35 million in current prices) in loans would be needed
to finance the 2,300 additional beds planned. To sustain investors' interest
in Kotu, it would be desirable that the Government provide half of the long-
term debt funds (D 17.5 million) at reasonable terms. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Government will arrange for the provision
of one million Dalasi within one year, an additional two million Dalasi
within two years and a further two million Dalasi within three years of
credit signing, to cover half of the long-term debt capital needed until
1980. If necessary this financing will be increased to D 17.5 million by
1986. The necessary funds would have to be secured by the Government either
from its own resources or through external borrowing. 1/ The Gambia
Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) which has already extended some hotel
loans, would be an appropriate channel for this financing.
6.11      Holders of land leases in the resort sites are required at present
to pay a rent of D 200 per bed per year according to terms set in July 1972,
while hotels outside the resort sites pay considerably less. The former are
also required to pay rent during construction (para. 3.03), an additional
heavy financial burden. This has resulted in investors requesting and obtain-
ing a reduction in their land rent in some cases and delaying payment in
others.
6.12      A study of the financial accounts of the hotels and the plans for
accommodation expansion and the associated infrastructure costs indicates
that an annual per bed land rent of D 180 (in 1975 prices), beginning with
the opening of the facility, would be appropriate (Annex X). During
negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that the land rent
will be set at a rate satisfactory to the Association, be collected only
after completion of construction, and, in order to prevent an erosion of
land rent over time, that the rate would be reviewed every two years to
reflect changes in business and economic conditions affecting hotel business
at the resort sites.
6.13      Funds are included in the project to finance a program primarily
to advertise opportunities for investment in the project area among inter-
national investors. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
within six months of the signing of the credit the Government will submit
for the Association's approval a timetable of measures to implement the
proposed tourism investment promotion program.
1/   It may be desirable for the Association to consider a second credit
which would help provide financing to upgrade existing facilities and
construct new hotels in The Gambia. The Gambia is a member of the
Lome convention and thus will have access to EEC financial institutions
such as the European Development Fund and the European Investment Bank,
which have indicated to the Gambian authorities that they would in
principle consider participating in financing tourism superstructure.
Bilateral (e.g., Arab) development funds might also become available
for this purpose.



- 21 -
6.14      The proposed improvements to the investment climate in The Gambia
together with the country's physical assets and political stability should
attract hotel investors. The risk remains, however, that hotel investment
might not be forthcoming from the private sector after the infrastructure
investment has been made. During negotiations the Government agreed to take
such action as would be required to ensure the construction of the necessary
number of hotel rooms at the resort sites by December 1986 in order to make the
project economically viable, provided that the Government and the Association
agree on the existence of a potential market. Preliminary indications are
that The Gambia could find external funds to fulfill this commitment.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A.   GUC's Financial Situation and Objectives
7.01      GUC was incorporated on July 1, 1972 when its assets were taken
over from a department of the Ministry of Works and Communications and
vested into GUC as Government equity. Due to the inadequacy of its inherited
tariff structure, and a considerable increase in the cost of fuel and
lubricants which was not passed on to the consumers, its financial position
has deteriorated considerably. GUC's financial operations are characterized
by a high portion of accounts receivable, high write-offs for bad debts,
a large accumulated loss, equivalent to 28% of the Government's equity
contribution, and a bank overdraft of D 0.5 million.
7.02      Immediate action needs to be taken to rescue GUC from its present
difficult financial situation. In addition to a tariff increase this action
should concentrate on improving:
-    meter reading, billing, and collecting
-    control of losses in both water and electricity
-    system maintenance standards
-    accounting and inventory management
-    training of staff
-    collection of overdue payments, particularly for electricity.
In order to carry out the above actions the Government agreed to employ con-
sultants within three months of credit signing, on terms and conditions accep-
table to the Association. These consultants would assist GUC in improving
its technical and accounting efficiency.



- 22 -
7.03      Although the efforts to reduce accounts receivable to a normal
standard will generate additional cash, GUC would still have to rely heavily
on bank overdrafts. To alleviate this situation and to finance ongoing work,
the Government agreed during negotiations to make an equity contribution to
GUC of up to D 500,000 in 1976 and to cover GUC's operating deficit incurred
during 1976.
7.04      GUC is not currently achieving its financial objectives which are
to meet cash operating expenses; provide adequate working capital; and make
a contribution towards future investment. As a step toward these objectives,
Government has agreed to an immediate increase of 15-30% in electricity
tariffs and 20-50% in water tariffs. Additionally, GUC's tariffs should be
structured so that they more closely reflect the economic cost of providing
service to various consumer categories. Water tariffs for lower-income
groups, however, should be set at a lower level than that warranted by
economic considerations in order to provide this vital service to persons
who could not otherwise afford it. Thus the increase in tariffs for water
supplied at standpipes would be modest in comparison with other tariffs such
as those for hotels. Government has agreed to the immediate employment of
consultants to carry out a tariff study on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association.
B.   Financial Forecasts for GUC
7.05      GUC's financing plan, aimed at attaining the above objectives,
has been based on revenues reflecting tariff increases which the Association
considers reasonable (para. 7.06). During negotiations assurances were
obtained that GUC will review, on the basis of the consultants' recommendations,
its tariff structure and start to implement new tariffs by July 1, 1976 which
should enable it to cover its operating expenses, including depreciation,
during 1977 and provide an overall return on net plant 1/ in operation of 3.0%,
3.0% and 4.5% in 1978, 1979 and 1980 respectively. From 1981 onwards GUC
should set its tariffs so as to earn 8% on its net fixed electricity assets in
operation and 8% on its gross fixed sewerage assets in operation; and 3% on
its net fixed water assets 1/ in operation from 1985 (Annex VIII, Table 8).
7.06      The financial forecasts appearing in Annex VIII show that GUC should
be able to achieve these targets and become a financially viable entity under
the following assumptions:
Power: (a) total consumption will increase at the rate of about 11%
per annum; (b) average revenue per kWh will increase from the present D 0.17
to D 0.21 in 1976; to D 0.23 in 1977 and to D 0.30 in 1985 (current prices);
and (c) fuel costs will decrease as a result of switching to cheaper heavy
fuel oil in 1979.
1/   All assets have been revalued to reflect an annual inflation rate of 10%.



- 23 -
Water: (a) consumption will increase by about 10% per year through
house connections and by about 6.6% through standpipes; (b) the Government
will allow GUC gradually to increase its water tariffs to enable it to cover
its cash operating expenses by 1980; and (c) hotels will be charged the full
cost of water supply immediately while rates to other consumers will be
adjusted over a period of time according to their ability to absorb increases.
GUC's rate structure should balance its interest in improving its financial
position against the community's defficulty in adjusting to higher costs for
water.
Sewerage: (a) sewage volume would be 80% of water consumption of
the hotels in the tourism area; (b) rates for treatment of sewage would
increase from D 4.50 per 1,000 gallons in 1979 to D 8.75 (current prices)
by 1985; and (c) rates for the sale of treated sewage for irrigation would
be set at D 0.20 per 1,000 gallons for 1979 increasing to D 0.30 (current
prices) by 1984.
C.   Financing of GUC's Operations
7.07      Annex VIII, Table 7 gives a forecast of the sources and application
of GUC's funds. The following table shows GUC's estimated fund requirements
for the project during the period of construction (1976-1980) and the sources
from which they will be met.

7.08      An amount of D 11.6 million (US$6.4 million) would be provided by
the AfDB, the German Government, and IDA to finance approximately 86% of
project cost for the power, water, and sewerage components. This amount
would be onlent by the Government to GUC. For the IDA and KfW loans, interest
during construction, at 8%, would be financed until completion of the project
and onlending would be at an interest rate of 8%, repayable over 17 years after
a grace period of four and a half years. The AfDB loan would be at 6% interest
plus 1% commission on the disbursed amount of the loan, plus a commitment fee
of 3/4% on the undisbursed balance. Amortization would be in 24 equal semi-
annual amounts, after a 6 year grace period. The contribution from the Gambian
Government would be provided to GUC as equity.
7.09      In order to maintain a sound financial structure in the future,
GUC, during negotiations, agreed not to incur any long-term debt unless its
current adjusted revenues are at least equal to 1.6 times its future maximum
debt service.

D.   Financial Forecast for the Tourism Component
7.10      Average construction costs of hotels have been estimated at D 14,850
(US$8,250) per bed. 1/ Hotels have been assumed to operate only during the
October-April months and to reach bed occupancy rates of 85% during the
December-March period and 45% during the rest of the season, after three years
of operation. These occupancy assumptions are consistent with experience in
the country and are reasonable in light of the proposed marketing strategy.
On the basis of these assumptions, projected bed rents, capital costs, and
operating ratios, the internal rate of return on overall investment in hotels
is 9.6% (Annex X).
7.11      Assuming a debt/equity ratio of 70/30 and borrowing at 8.5% repayable
over 15 years, the return on equity would be 12.5%.
E.   Accounts and Audit
7.12      The GUC Act requires GUC to keep proper accounts and prepare a balance
sheet and statement of income and expenditures for each fiscal year and have
them audited annually by independent auditors. The 1974 audit was performed
by the Banjul branch of the international firm of chartered accountants,
Pannel Fitzpatrick & Co.
7.13      It has been agreed that the project management unit will install,
within six months of signing of the credit, an accounting system acceptable
to the Association for all the project components for which GUC is not res-
ponsible.
7.14      During negotiations it was also agreed that independent auditors,
acceptable to the Association will continue to audit the accounts of GUC,
that the Government Audit Department will audit those relating to the other
project components, and that audit reports will be submitted to the Association
no later than four months after the closing of the fiscal year.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
8.01      For the purpose of the economic analysis the project is split into
two components which are justified separately: the public utilities works
1/   The breakdown of this cost is as follows:
D per bed
Site development                                 1,200
Construction (incl2ding common
facilities, 25 m  at D280)                     8,500
Equipment, furniture, and furnishings            5,150
Total                                 14 ?850



- 26 -
and the tourism-related works (including the water and power investment
directly attributable to tourism as well as improvements to the airport
runway, though the latter is not part of the project). Costs and benefits
are estimated in 1975 prices.
A.   Justification of the Public Utilities Works
8.02      The proposed water and power works have been determined to be the
least cost solution to meet the projected demand in the project area. The
assumed level of water rates for hotels would ensure that the hotels - and
the tourists - pay fully for the service provided (para. 7.04); for domestic
consumption, however, water charges to lower income groups do not cover the
full economic cost in view of the limited capacity to pay of this category
of consumers. In the case of electric power, use is more strongly correlated
with the ability to pay, and accordingly the assumed average power rate
should reflect the full economic cost to the various consumer categories.
8.03      Assuming a 25-year economic life of the water-supply component its
rate of return would be 2.3%. With a 20-year economic life of the electricity
component the rate of return would be 6.9%. The rate of return on water
supply is based on benefits as meastured by expected revenues and does not
reflect all the economic benefits, particularly the consumer surplus as well
as health and social benefits, accruing to the lower income local population.
As in the case of water supply, the 6.9% rate of return on electricity
underestimates the unquantifiable consumer surplus.
B.   Justification of the Tourism-Related Works
Rate of Return Computation
8.04      The gross benefits to the economy from the tourism-related works
would be the expenditures of the tourists attracted to the Kotu area.
Because the project is expected to draw tour operators who have not previously
served The Gambia, visitors to Kotu would represent previously untapped
demand. The relevant costs are the capital and operating costs of the
tourism-related infrastructure provided under the proposed project and those
of the hotels and related superstructure facilities to be built in the
project area. The cost of the airport runway improvement has been fully
taken into account.
8.05      If the public utilities were not upgraded and if the Yundum runway
were not improved, it is expected that tourism traffic to the existing hotels
would decrease about 20% from its 1973/74 level.  1/  Implementation of the
project and improvement of the runway, however, are assumed to maintain the
1973/74 level of traffic for the existing hotels after 1977/1978.
1/   These 20% represent closing of the oldest beach hotel.



- 27 -
8.06      Total capital costs associated with the tourism component of the
project amount to about D 53.4 million - i.e., investments in infrastructure
(D 6.8 million), improvement of the runway (D 9 million), and hotels and
other superstructure facilities (D 37.6 million).
8.07      Revenue has been estimated on the basis of a daily expenditure per
visitor to Kotu of about D 66, including full board accommodation (D 34),
additional expenses for food and beverage (D 14), miscellaneous sales from
hotels (D 6), excursions (D 4), local transportation (D 2), souvenirs and
entertainment (D 6). Gross operating profits of hotels and other superstruc-
ture facilities have been estimated on the basis of similar facilities now
in operation in The Gambia. The portion of GUC's gross operating profit
attributable to the hotels has been included as well as revenues from land
rents and bed and airport taxes. The operating costs of the hotel school
and the road maintenance costs have also been taken into account. The food
storage scheme is assumed to generate sufficient funds to cover operating
and maintenance costs. The operating and maintenance costs of the airport
are assumed to be covered by landing and parking fees.
8.08      With an estimated economic life of the project of 30 years, the
economic rate of return on the investment in the tourism-related works in
the Kotu development would be 12.1% without shadow pricing of labor or
foreign exchange. Given the extent of unemployment and underemployment in
The Gambia, the opportunity cost of labor in the construction industry and
in the hotels is likely to be appreciably lower than the wages received by
employees in the project area. The economic cost of labor has therefore
been assumed equal to 50% of its monetary cost in one sensitivity test.
In other sensitivity tests foreign exchange has been shadow priced by 20%
and the cost of the runway improvement has been eliminated.
8.09      The sensitivity of the rate of return to changes in key variables
is listed in Table VII.

20% shadow pricing of foreign exchange                          13.6
Excluding the cost of the runway improvement                    15.4
/1   This alternative covers the possibility of a considerable increase in
the cost of runway improvement.
/2   Changes in GOP projection reflect variations in occupany rates, average
daily expenditures, and operating costs. While the likelihood of a 25%
lower GOP cannot be excluded, the probability of its occurrence is
regarded as low.



- 28 -
8.10      Assuming that about three-quarters of the equity and debt capital
for hotel investment would come from abroad there would be a 13.0% rate of
return on the national investment outlays for the tourism-related works (in-
cluding the external public funds, but excluding both foreign private invest-
ment and net repayment and other returns accruing to foreigners). This rate
is higher than the overall return because foreign hotel investors would not
benefit from tourist expenditures outside the hotels and would receive an
after-tax return somewhat lower than the project's overall rate of return.
Since the return on both the overall tourism component and the Gambian funds
in it (including the external public funds) are satisfactory, this component
is acceptable under any reasonable assumption about its impact on foreign
capital inflow into the economy.
Balance of Payments Effect
8.11      Gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism were D 9 million in
1973. Incremental receipts attributed to the project would amount to about
D 4.8 million in 1978 and to about D 24 million per year after 1986 when all
planned accommodation becomes operational. Foreign exchange outflow result-
ing from the project (the import component of operating cost, debt service
on foreign hotel loans, dividend payments to hotel investors, and debt serv-
ice on the external public funds) is estimated to amount to D 2.4 million
in 1978 rising to D 9.6 million in 1986. This calculation does not take into
account the incremental imports likely to ensue from increased wages for
labor employed on the project. The net incremental foreign exchange earnings
generated by the tourism component of the project would amount to about D 2.4
million in 1978 and about D 14.4 million annually from 1986 on.
Employment Effect
8.12      Assuming a ratio of 0.6 employees per bed, the new hotels in Kotu
would generate 1,600 new jobs by 1986. Additional jobs created in restau-
rants, shops, tour agencies, entertainment and recreation facilities would
amount to about 200. Indirect employment generated in construction, handi-
crafts, agriculture, transportation, and services is likely to amount to 900
additional jobs. A large portion of these jobs would be available only dur-
ing the winter when agricultural activities are at a low point.
Budgetary Position
8.13      The Government's current budgetary expenditures for the tourism
component would include the operating cost of the hotel school and the cost
of the maintenance of the roads and beach facilities. These expenditures
would increase from D 60,000 in 1978 to D 150,000 by 1985. Budgetary receipts
deriving from the project would comprise the incremental import duties on
goods consumed by tourists, land rent, the proceeds from bed, entertainment,
and airport taxes, and income tax on wages and profits. Income tax returns
would increase from D 0.1 million in 1978 to D 0.25 million in 1986 and to
D 1.3 million in 1993 when the hotels stop benefiting from the incentives.



- 29 -
Other receipts would increase from D 0.4 million in 1978 to D 1.6 million in
1986. In 1978 the project would involve net budgetary receipts of D 0.4 mil-
lion. These receipts would increase to D 1.8 million in 1986 and to D 3
million in 1993.
Distribution of Benefits
8.14      Table VIII illustrates the distribution of benefits which will be
directly generated by the tourism component of the proposed project.
Table VIII
Distribution of Benefits

Public Sector         29                     24                   10.9
Hotel Operations        71                     58                    9.6
8.15      The remaining share of gross operating profit (18%) is associated
with voluntary tips and with operations outside the resort area which will
be established or expanded to meet visitor demand for handicrafts, taxi serv-
ices, and recreation (e.g., restaurants, bars, dancehalls). These operations
require relatively small investments, will benefit mainly local people, and
are likely to be highly remunerative. The economic rate of return on the
overall tourism component is the result of the comparatively low rates of re-
turn on infrastructure and hotel investments and the high rate of return on
other than hotel operations.
IX. SOCIAL IMPACT
9.01      The development of tourism in The Gambia has suddenly confronted the
village population near the tourism area with foreigners of different cultural,
social, and economic backgrounds. Although any modern development, agricultural
or industrial, would affect the traditional pattern of life, the tourism indus-
try with its important human element is likely to have a particular impact that
is both beneficial and detrimental.
9.02      The resort sites are uninhabited and are not used for agriculture
and fishing. Since the land is common property, leased on behalf of the
owners by the District Authority to the Government and re-leased to hotel
owners, there is no feeling that traditionally-held property or rights are
being encroached.



- 30 -
9.03      Tourism creates considerable employment in the area, but of
a seasonal nature. Only 25% of hotel employees work year round; the
remainder for about seven months. Whereas as it will be difficult to
provide employment in the off-season for all employees who have recently
moved and have no agricultural base in the area the food storage and
marketing program will result in some new agricultural jobs in the off-
season,
9.04      The Gambian Government is aware of the social problems that may
result from the tourism industry. It feels, however, that the economic
benefits of tourism clearly outweigh its possible adverse social effects if
these affects can be curtailed by proper planning and educational measures.
During the preparation of the project considerable care was taken in planning
the labor support area to maintain the traditional patterns of family housing
(in compounds providing space for home gardens) and local government. The
project would also provide infrastructure (water, electricity, telephone,
roads) to the labor support area and the Government has committed itself to
provide the essential educational, health, and security facilities. To
promote cultural adjustments the Ministry of Education began in 1974 a
tourism information program for school children in the project area.
Finally, the training of Gambian hotel personnel under a UNDP project has
succeeded in reducing the number of expatriates to some 10% of total hotel
manpower. This training program will be continued in an expanded form under
the present project.
9.05      Since little was known about the social and cultural consequences
of tourism development, in 1973 the Government asked the Department of Social
Anthropology at the University of Stockholm for advice. A brief study under-
taken in 1974 concluded that steps should be taken to spread the benefits of
tourism and particularly to strengthen the agricultural sector. Further data
regarding the impact of tourism on the social and cultural patterns of the
local population are being gathered. These data will serve as an input for
the socioeconomic study which is proposed under the project (para. 4.13).
X. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
DURING NEGOTIATIONS
10.01          During negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a) complete the extension of the airport runway by the end of
October 1978 (para. 3.02);
(b) enact building and planning laws within one year of credit
signing, to give the PPO control over building permits
(para. 3.06);
(c) establish, within one year a credit signing, architectural
and landscaping standards and regulations satisfactory to
the Association, for the tourism and labor support areas
(para. 3.06);



- 31 -
(d) use its best efforts to make arrangements for the supply
of heavy fuel oil to Banjul from abroad (para. 4.04);
(e) submit within six months of credit signing terms of reference
and propose timing for recruitment of the technical assistance
personnel to be employed in the hotel training and food
marketing and storage programs (para. 4.12);
(f) submit within three months of credit signing terms of
reference for the socioeconomic and alternative fuel
studies (para. 4.13);

components to the agencies concerned (para. 5.04);
(j) provide such funds as shall be required for the lifetime
of each project component to the appropriate autorities
(para. 5.05);
(k) arrange for the provision of one million Dalasi within one
year, an additional two million Dalasi within two years and
a further two million Dalasi within three years of credit
signing to cover half of the long-term debt capital needed
for hotel construction until 1980 (para. 6.10);
(1) collect land rent only after completion of construction and
set it at a rate satisfactory to the Association, to be
reviewed every two years (para. 6.10);
(m)  submit a tourism investment promotion program and timetable
for the Association's approval within six months of credit
signing (para. 6.13);
(n) take steps to ensure that sufficient beds to make the project
economically viable are in operation by December 1986, pro-
vided that the Government and the Association agree on the
existence of a potential tourist market (para. 6.14);
(o) retain consultants, on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association, within three months of credit signing, to
assist GUC in improving its technical and accounting effi-
ciency (para. 7.02);



- 32 -
(p)  provide during 1967 an equity contribution of up to D 500,000
to GUC and sums adequate to cover GUC's operating deficit in-
curred during 1976 (para. 7.03);
(q)  permit GUC to change higher tariffs for electricity and water
supply and to establish a new tariff for sewerage (para. 7.05);
(r)  install within six months of credit signing, an accounting
system acceptable to the Association for all the project
components for which GUC is not responsible to be maintained
by the Project Management Unit (para. 7.13); and
(s)  have the accounts of GUC audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, those of the Project Unit
by the Government Auit Department, and submit the audit
reports to the Association no later than four months after
the closing of the fiscal year (para. 7.14).
10.02     Assurances were also obtained during negotiations from GUC that
it will:
(a)  retain consultants, acceptable to the Association, who would be
responsible for the final design of public utilities works and
would supervise their implementation (para. 5.03);
(b)  immediatelv increase the tariffs for electricity by 15-30% and
for water supply by 20-50% (para. 7.04);
(c)  review, on the basis of consultants' recommendations, its tariff
structure and start to implement tariffs by July 1, 1976 which
should enable it to earn agreed rates of return (para. 7.05): and
(d)  agree not to borrow additional funds unless it can meet a debt
service test (para. 7.09).
10.03     The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit:
(a)  signing of a financing agreement for the electricity component
between the AfDB and the Gambian Government (para. 4.18);
(b)  signing of a financing agreement for the water-supply component
between KfW and the Gambian Government (para. 4.18); and
(c)  conclusion of a subsidiary credit agreement satisfactory to the
Association between the Government and GUC, including the relending
of funds provided by the Association to GUC for the sewerage
component (para. 4.20);
(d)  submission for approval to the Association of the terms of reference
for the Project Management Unit and appointment of a Project Manager
acceptable to the Association (para. 5.02).



- 33 -
10,04     With the above agreements the project is suitable for an IDA credit
of US$4.0 million equivalent.

THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
The Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC)
1.        GUC was established by the Gambia Utilities Corporation Act of
July 1, 1972, with the following objectives:
- "the generation, transmission, supply and distribution of
electricity in The Gambia for public, domestic and
industrial purposes";
- "the provision, distribution and conservation of the
supply of water for public, domestic and industrial
purposes."
2.        GUC is governed by a Board of Directors made up of eight members:
the chairman is a former Gambian High Commissioner in London, the Managing
Director is an English engineer employed under contract financed by the
United Kingdom, a traditional chief represents the domestic consumers, two
directors are experienced in administration and labor relations, and three
directors have experience in private and public corporation management.
3.        The organization of GUC is satisfactorily designed and well
suited to the small size of the corporation (see GUC Organization Chart
hereunder). The present Managing Director will oe succeeced in January 1976
by a Gambian, a former civil servant with a degree in economics who recently
returned from management training in the USA; he would be assisted by a
technical advisor whose services would be financed under the project.

4.        The Manager of the Electricity Division has an English Certificate
and is currently in training program with the South Wales Electricity Board
(UK); the Manager of the Water Division is a qualified civil engineer also
being trained in the UK. The Chief Accountant is very devoted to his job
but needs to improve his efficiency and increase his knowledge of modern public
utilities corporation management. Experts in public utilities corporation
management from the International Executive Corporation (US) have assisted
the two managers modernize their day-to-day work and make it more efficient.
5.        Before the creation of GUC a department of the Ministry of Works
and Communications managed the electric and water utilities. The main
managerial problem of GUC is therefore to convert its staff from the mental
outlook and work habits of civil servants to those of a modern public utility
corporation in order "to conduct its affairs on sound commercial lines" and
"ensure that its revenues are sufficient to produce on the fair value of its
assets a reasonable rate of return."

6.        GUCTs permanent staff totals 402 (see Table 1).  During the
appraisal mission, however, the total was 472, including daily rated employees,
although the only works which could have justified such a high number - the
erection of the second phase of the 33 kV line from Mile 2 substation to
Old Cape Road substation - was slowed down by a lack of equipment. Other
staff problems include a high level of illiteracy (70% of the Electricity
Division's permanent staff is illiterate and 82% of the Water Division's)
and a relatively high age level (27% of the permanent staff of the Elec-
tricity Division and 23% of the Water Division are more than 40 years old).

7.        Both in the Electricity and Water Divisions and in other sections
of the Corporation operating conditions are far from satisfactory; work
is done predominantly by rote, with a resulting waste of money and human re-
sources. Fortunately ILO will undertake a Human Resources Development Pro-
gram in The Gambia with UNDP financing and possibly with that of UNESCO.
Such a program would especially benefit GUC, remedying the high level of
illiteracy and the almost total lack of middle-level foremen and technicians.
(see Table 1). All staff levels of GUC would be affected: managers, middle-
level foremen and technicians, skilled craftsmen, as well as accountants and
storekeepers. In addition to providing apprenticeships, literacy courses,
and specialized training for accountants and storekeepers in The Gambia, the
program would also establish fellowships for training elsewhere in Africa and,
for some superintendents and decision makers in industrialized countries.

8.        GUC would also employ consultants to assist it in improving its
technical and accounting efficiency. The consultants would have to pay
particular attention to:
(a) system maintenance standards;
(b) system losses;
(c) meter reading, billing and collection;
(d) general accounting systems;
(e) inventory control;
(f) budgeting and control;
(g) insurance policies;
(h) asset valuation;
(i) tariff structures; and
(j) staff utilization and training.

A. The Existing Facilities
1.        The existing facilities of GUC consist of seven noninterconnected
grids, the most important of which supplies Banjul/Kombo St. Mary where the
tourism area is located; the others supply the small towns of Brikama,
Georgetown, Bansang, Basse, Farafeni, and Mansakonkc, each with a generating
capacity of two sets of 116 kW each except for Mansakonkon which has two sets
of 76 kW each. All these provincial stations have only minor engineering and
financial problems for GUC compared to the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area.
2.        The Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area is supplied by the Half Die diesel
generating station with an installed capacity of 10,180 kVA. Commissioned
in 1955 the station is of steel frame construction and well designed. The
improved size/output ratio of diesel sets since 1955 permitted installation
of a larger capacity set on the same foundation, replacing one of the original
sets, and the other two sets could be similarly replaced when necessary.
Details of the Half Die station are given in Table 1. The units now supply
the transmission lines at 11 kV without any upgrading transformer; they burn
an expensive light fuel oil.

3.        Operation of the station is rather routine and there is no
preventive maintenance. There are sufficient mechanical spare
parts but a shortage of electrical ones. Failures are frequent, particularly
on the old 965 kVA units.
4.        The existing 11 kV transmission system in the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary
area is rudimentary. Some five miles of 30-year-old underground cable supply
mainly the Banjul area with ten indoor-type substations, and about 18 miles
of copper conductor overhead line supply the Kombo St. Mary area and terminate
at Yundum Airport. Total failures occur frequently on these transmission lines,
particularly during the wet season. In the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area there
are about 30 miles of 400/230 V copper and aluminum overhead lines with vir-
tually no underground cables. With few exceptions, all these distribution
lines are seriously underconductored; many sections are in poor condition
and require extensive reinforcement.
B. The UK Investments
5.        To help relieve GUC's difficulties the UK Government provided a
loan to finance the following facilities:
(a)  the extension of the Half Die power station with a 2,750 kVA
diesel generating set which was commissioned in January 1974;
(b) the construction in four stages of a 33 kV transmission system
to overlay and reinforce the existing, overloaded 11 kV system:
Stage I, consisting of a double circuit line from Half Die power
station to Mile 2 substation, was commissioned in April 1974 and
is operating temporarily at 11 kV; Stage II, from Mile 2 to Old
Cape Road substation, is now under construction; Stage III, from
Old Cape Road to Jeswang substation, and Stage IV, from Old Cape
Road to Kotu (the tourism area) will be built immediately after
completion of Stage III. These two last stages will consist of a
single circuit line; like the other stages they will have aluminum
conductors and their design has been largely influenced by the
desire to use as much locaL material as possible, such as wooden
cross-arms and locally-manufactured prestressed concrete poles.
The UK loan does not provide for any distribution works.
C. Forecast of Load and Energy Demand
6.        It has been difficult to determine any consistent rate of growth
from which to extrapolate future demand. Statistics on load and energy
demand are unreliable because of (i) the small size of the electricity system,
(ii) the organization of GUC and that of the former Ministry Department which
GUC replaced in July 1972, and (iii) various abnormal circumstances which have
distorted the pattern, such as variation in the groundnut crop, shortages and
breakdowns of the generating plant, almost chronically low supply of voltage,
restriction of new connections, and load-shedding. During the last few years
annual variation in maximum demand iranged from -12.8% to +23.8%, although the



ANNEX V
Page 3
annual production of energy did not show any such variation; but as might
be expected load factors have been distorted in accordance with load output.
7.        The above facts have been taken into account to forecast load and
energy demand based on a reasonable annual increase in energy demand from
several categories of consumers and on a load factor of 60% until 1978/79
and 63% from 1978/79 to 1983/84. The annual energy growth rates forecast
for each category of consumer are as follows:
- Government departments         10% per year
- GUC water supply             5-12% per year
- Street lighting                 5% per year
- Domestic consumers             10% per year
- Commercial and industrial    12% per year
- For the hotels 1,000 kWh per year and per bed has been
assumed, based on the electricity consumption records
of the existing hotels.
8.        Over 31% of the total energy generated in the project area is
lost, an extremely hiRh figure since normal losses should not exceed 12-17%.
Only a reasonable 2.5% of the total is lost in generation but about 29% of the
energy generated is lost between leaving the Half Die plant and reaching
the consumers. The energy losses are attributed to the following:
- Generation                       2.5%
- Transmission and distribution 12%
- Frauds and unmetered              18%
9.        Accordingly, in the energy forecast two assumptions have been
made:  (i) that "frauds and unmetered" will fall by 1% per year until 1983/84,
and (ii) that the transmission and distribution losses will decrease by 1%
every two years, from 12% at present to 10% in 1979. These assumptions
are reasonable, and GUC can meet the targets by firmer management, upgrading
the transmission tension from 11 kV to 33 kV and reinforcing the distribution
lines.
10.       Table 2 shows the energy forecasts.  In Table 3 load demand has
been based on the assumption that the firm capacity of Half Die will be 90% of
total installed capacity minus the greatest unit capacity until 1980/81 and
100% of total installed capacity minus the greatest unit capacity after
1980/81, following the scrApping of unit 3, which is rather old and unreliable.

D.  Project Description
11.       The project under consideration would:
(a) construct buildings to help improve GUC's management efficiency;
(b) expand the generating capacity of the Half Die power station by
installing a diesel engine of about 3 MW-medium speed, 11 kV, 50
Hertz, and a 12-panel 11 kV switchboard to replace an old board;
(c) install transformers and circuit breakers in three new 33 kV/11 kV
substations at Half Die, Mile 2 and Jeswang in order to upgrade the
overhead lines built with the UK loan; and construct four 11 kV/0.4 kV
substations which would supply electricity to the tourism and labor
support areas;
(d) construct 10.06 km of 33 kV line (to operate initially at 11 kV)
between Yundum and Brikarna;
(e) construct 3.9 km of 11 kVT overhead transmission lines and 0.8 km
of 11 kV underground transmission cables. These transmission
facilities would link the 11 kV/0.4 kV substations for the tourism
and the labor support areas to the 33 kV/ll kV (operating at 11 kV)
substation of Kotu Point:
(f) construct 4.5 km of 400/230 volt overhead distribution lines in the
labor support area;
(g) supply tools and vehicles;
(h)  assist GUC to shift to heavy fuel oil.  The light fuel oil that GUC
now burns in its generators is so expensive that a shift to heavy
fuel (1500 sec Redwood) is highly recommended. Depending on the
conclusion of agreements with the Senegalese Government and a Mauri-
tanian corporation to ship heavy fuel from the Dakar refinery to Ban-
jul, the project would finance:
- facilities to pump the heavy fuel oil from the jetty at
Banjul to GUC's generating installations
- a 1,000 m3 storage reservoir for a two-month supply of
fuel at the present rate of consumption
- the machinery needed to adapt the existing Half Die diesel
engines to burn heavy fuel oil.
(i)  finance a feasibility study for a steam power plant fired by groundnut
shells. The Gambia produces about 125,000 tons of groundnuts annually,
which yield an average of 40,000 tons of shells, now largely burned as
refuse. With appropriate shell-fired engines - such as those at
the Gambia Produce Marketing Board's Denton Bridge factories - these
waste shells could generate about 50 million kWh, the electricity
needed in the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area in 1984/85 according to the
forecast in Table 2.

E. Cost Estimates and Project Execution
12.       The costs of the electricity component of the project detailed in
Annex II, Table 6, have been estimated on the basis of supplies quotations
gathered in April 1974 by GUC's consultant (Crown Agents) and updated to
September 1975 price levels. Capital costs attributable to tourism infra-
structure are estimated to be at most 12% of the total estimate for elec-
tricity.
13.       The project will be carried out under the general administration
of GUC's Electricity Division with the assistance of Crown Agents, a British
consulting firm with long experience in The Gambia which conducted the
original feasibility study for this project component.  Since the 3 MW
diesel engine at Half Die must be in operation by September 1978, which will
take at least 24 months from the time it is ordered, the order should be
placed by August 1976.

THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
Water Supply
A. Project Background
The Existing Facilities
1.        GUC's Water Division manages all water supply systems in The Gambia,
but 90% of its activities are concentrated in the Banjul area.
2.        The present water supply for Banjul and its vicinity is entirely
dependent on groundwater from 14 boreholes tapping shallow aquifers in Fajara,
Sarakunda and Sukuta; a borehole located in the center of Banjul penetrates
a deeper aquifer and also supplies Banjul, but due to its mineral content,
the water from this source is not acceptable unless mixed with that from
the other sources. The bulk of the raw water is collected from the various
boreholes and transmitted through a main to the reservoir in Fajara, where
aeration, and physical and bacteriological treatment (pH adjustment and
chlorination) take place. All the pipes transporting the rather corrosive raw
water are made of PVC or asbestos concrete (AC).
3.        From the Fajara reservoirs water is delivered either by gravity to
neighboring areas, or by booster pumps to other elevated storage reservoirs,
which feed the distribution system for more remote areas by gravity. The
distribution network includes pipes up to 60 years old, made of cast iron,
AC or PVC. With time a number of interconnections have been added to permit
changing individual mains from one function (raw water pipe, feeder) to
another (distribution or rising mains). Although these interconnections offer
flexibility, their complex patterns make it difficult to locate water losses.
4.        Although water mains extend to serve 75% of the population of about
89,000, numerous hand-dug wells still supply some 29,000 people in the area
(34% of the population). Of the remaining 60,000 people who use public water
supply, 39,000 are served by about 110 public standpipes and 21,000 by some
2,750 private connections (yard tap or full plumbing).
Operations
5.        The infrastructure has been installed at different times to meet
slowly increasing demand.  While quality of water supplied is usually
adequate, the system does not reliably provide the amount of water required
to meet the demand. GUC at present works only 12 boreholes out of the 14
necessary for meeting the demand. These facilities operate at their maximum
capacity. Over-pumping in fine sand aquifers and corrosion of well screens
have caused boreholes to collapse and sand to deposit in transmission mains;
no standby boreholes are presently available. Furthermore frequent power
and pump failures curb production, and inadequate control systems require
an attendant to travel from well to well when they have to be restarted,
so that it takes at least 12 hours to restore the whole field to full
production. Before the present project is implemented, GUC intends to
drill two more boreholes with its own percussion rigs (para. 19). Replacement
of the collapsed boreholes by new ones is preferable to renovating the
existing ones that have become inoperative.



ANNEX VI
Page 2
6.        At the beginning of the 1975 peak season, the balancing reservoirs
were invariably very low. The existing treatment facilities and the electrical
and mechanical equipment are fairly well maintained, but will need to be
reinforced to cope with increasing discharges; this will be done through GUC's
ongoing construction program and the proposed project.
7.        The distribution network, about 65 kilometers in length, covers
Banjul and the immediate suburbs of Fajara, Bakau and Sarakunda. The density
appears appropriate. However, many pipes are very old and, probably leaky.
Due to inadequate stocks, GUC cannot extend distribution mains or meet requests
for new connections. Little monitoring has yet been done to account for the
high losses of water, estimated at 34% of total water produced, although GUC
is fully aware of the financial significance of such high losses. During the
last two years it has made strenuous efforts to staff and
implement a waste detection and rectification program; and it eventually has
arranged for two middle-level members of its staff to attend overseas courses
in waste and leakage detection. GUC has started to implement its waste de-
tection program executed by an expatriate expert. Equipment for it is on
order.
B. Water Consumption Forecasts
8.        The UK consultants, Howard Humphreys and Sons, have executed the
water feasibility study. The consultants' analysis of past consumption
data and their forecast of unit demand projections for the next ten years
have been found, on the whole, to be satisfactory and have been used as the
basis for the consumption forecast. Some adjustments have, however, been
made in the consultants' proposals in respect to population projections,
global water demand forecasts and timing of installation following a down-
ward adjustment of tourism development made after the consultants' assessment.
In this respect, the consultants' estimate of the influx of people to
Kotu township and neighboring suburbs has been revised downwards. The
distribution main coverage in these areas has also been reduced in accordance
with the revised population estimates and service standards comparable to
those existing in the city of Banjul.
9.        Lack of historical data did not permit reference to existing growth
rates: the only available statistics are for the year 1974/75. GUC did not
complete universal metering until 1974. Table 1 shows the expected increases
in population served and water consumption over a ten-year period. Annex VIII,
Table 4 shows the expected consumption of water through 1980.

10.      The proportion of the population served from mains will increase
from 85 to 92% and those obtaining water from private connections in the
area served will increase from 35 to 39% between 1973/74 and 1983/84, primarily
because of tne labor support area of Kotu. In addition, "accounted for"
water is expected to increase more rapidly (133%) than the population served
(99%) and water production (86%), indicating efforts to meet expanding demand,
increase service in the area and reduce the present high losses.
11.      Domestic consumption comprises standpipe and private connection
users. Present demand for standpipe users varies between 7 gcd (32 liters/
day) for densely populated areas such as Banjul, and 4.4 ged (20 liters/
day) in the less populated suburbs (Sarakunda, Lamin, Fajikunda) where
hand-dug wells provide part of the supply (para. 4). For the future a
reasonable maximum consumption of 7.25 gcd (33 liters/day) has been allowed
in the water forecasts.
12.      Private connections include yard tap and full plumbing.  The present
statistics do not provide distinct figures for these two types and show a
wide range of consumption according to the respective proportion of each
category: above 30 gcd in Sarakunda and Fajara-Bakau, the residential areas
of the city; around 17 gcd in Banjul; and 20 gcd in Fajikunda and Abuko.
These consumptions, with slight increases to take into account modification
in the yard tap/full plumbing ratio, have been used in the demand forecasts.
13.      At present the percentage of the population which is connected also
varies according to the area: 38% in Banjul, 36% in Fajara, 11% in Sarakunda.
In less populated areas further away from Banjul, the percentages are lower,
as the population still relies heavily on its own wells. It is expected
that in the next ten years (i) the proportion of the population using private
wells will decrease in the areas to be supplied by the distribution network,
and (ii) the population served by private connections will increase slightly
from its present 35% to 39% of total population.  In this category, some
domestic consumers are also likely to transfer from yard taps to full plumbing.
The above criteria will result in an overall per capita demand of 28 gcd (127
liters/day) for people with private- connections, which is slightly higher than
the present figure (24 gcd).
14.      The present per bed consumption for major hotels ranges from 133
gallons (600 liters) per peak day to 85 gallons (385 liters) per average day.
As comfort and luxury standards for new hotels are to be upgraded to comply
with tourism requirements, the above water demand would increase by about 20%.
15.      Water sold to Government includes all usage in Government offices,
schools and establishments such as prisons, barracks and hospitals, and GUC's
own needs. Present consumption accounts for about 30% of the "accounted for"
water. It is estimated that in the future, demand growth will correspond to the
population growth rate of 6%, reflecting among others the necessity to construct
new Government facilities in the suburban areas.



ANNEX VI
Page 5
16.      Commercial and industrial consumption, excluding major hotels,
accounts for about 10% of the present "accounted for" water. This low
percentage reflects lack of industry and limited trade and commercial
activity. The projected increase in GDP is likely to be associated with
higher industrial and commercial needs, in particular for food processing
projects and for ancillary facilities for tourism development. These
requirements have been estimated to reach approximately 20% of domestic
needs in the next ten years.
17.      The waste detection and rectification program (para. 7) coupled
with the fact that in the next ten years a good part of the network will be
newly laid is expected to result in a reduction of 'unaccounted for" water
from 34% of total produced water to 18%.
C. Description of the Project
18.      The proposed project would meet the increased need for water in
both the tourism area and the labor support area of Kotu and would also
seek to improve the water system of the city of Banjul and the suburbs
presently served.
19.      The existing borehole fields at Fajara and Sarakunda are presently
operated at near safe yield and can be developed only a little further with-
out the occurrence of saline intrusion which would cause deterioration of
water quality. Furthermore the necessary pumping capacity is reduced by
borehole collapse and equipment breakdowns. To the existing capacity of 0.94 mgd
an extra 0.5 mgd will be added to produce an average figure of 0.40 mgd above
present yield by equipping four additional boreholes, one acting as a "spare."
GUC has the staff and drilling material sufficient for drilling two of these
boreholes and will undertake their construction during 1976 as part of its
ongoing program. Most of the equipment for these two boreholes is already
available to GUC. The remaining two boreholes will be included in the project.
20.      Other extensive resources will be tapped from new boreholes to be located
five kilometers southeast of Sarakunda, close to Yundum Airport and 20 km south-
west of Brufut. It can be safely inferred from available hydrological information
on the Yundum area and in particular from pumping tests on existing wells that
the aquifer in this area is likely to yield important quantities of water able
to supply the Banjul area for the next 15-years. The subsequent development of
water resources should take place in Brufut. Any development based on surface
water use would be more expensive than the above solution. Furthermore because
of the long distance between source and distribution, and since some existing
transmission mains can be used, this solution, which integrates water distrib-
ution for the tourist area and its labor support area as well as for the city of
Banjul, is more economical than building two independent water systems for each
of these areas.  Therefore it is considered that developing the Yundum borehold fielc
is the least costly solution for the next expansion of GUC's water production
capacity.
21.       Since the raw water is unusually corrosive, pipes should be of PVC
and AC. Such pipes also appear to be less costly than ductile iron or steel;
moreover, GUC is already using pipes of these materials and its operating
personnel is familiar with laying and tapping such pipes.



ANNEX VI
Page 6
22.       After completion of the ongoing program (para. 19), an adequate
water supply to all parts of the area will be ensured by the implementation
of the proposed project which would include the following:
(a) drilling and test pumping of six small exploratory holes and six
observational holes to assess the hydrogeology of the entire Yundum area
to a more accurate degree than presently known;
(b) drilling and equipping four new producer boreholes in the Yundum
west field, including one spare, for 2,520 m3 (0.56 mgd) average
daily output and drilling of two producer boreholes in the Fajara
area;
(c) extension of an 11 kV electric line to provide power to the
well field;
(d) construction of a 5-km transmission main 300 mm in diameter together
with connecting pipes;
(e) installation of partial treatment facilities such as line injection
for pH adjustment and chlorination at the end of this new transmission
line in Sarakunda;
(f) installation of six booster pumps in Sarakunda to transmit all
production from Yundum and Sarakunda borehole fields through existing
mains;
(g) installation of a control station which will record and distribute
flows either toward Banjul through a combination of existing mains
and a new 3.2-km main, or to Fajara on the coast through existing
mains;
(h) extension of some 5 km of transmission facilities toward the tourist
area with a booster pump at Fajara, supply and laying; to augment
the delivery to the Fajara elevated tank which is being expanded by
GUC as part of its ongoing works from 570 m to 1,570 mi3;
(i) construction of additional pipelines to replace old, leaky pipes
in the city and improve the distribution in Fajara and Sarakunda
and of a small elevated reservoir (500 m3) in Latrikunda;
(j) provision of distribution mains to serve Kotu Point and Kotu Beach
resorts plus the first stage of development of Kotu township; and
(k) various operational provisions such as meter testing workshops and
trucks.
Items (i) and (k) are intended to improve GUC's operation and maintenance.
The project will also include fees for consultants' services for project
preparation and supervision.
Cost Estimates
23.      The estimated costs of the water supply component which amount to
D 633 million (US$3.5 million) and are detailid in Annex II, are based on



ANNEX VI
Page 7
preliminary designs prepared by the UK consulting engineers, Howard Humphreys
& Sons, employed by GUC. These costs reflect early 1974 contractor bids for
similar work and have been adjusted to the September 1975 level. Physical
and price 1/ contingencies amount fo 45% of the base costs.
24.      A crude attempt to allocate costs attributable to infrastructure
for hotels and the city of Banjul has been done on the prorata of utilized
resources: the component of the project directly related to tourism would
amount to approximately 30% of the above total costs.
Procurement and Project Implementation
25.      Procurement for equipment contracts (pipe supply, electric and
mechanical equipment) would be in accordance with the requirements of KfW.
The civil works required for the implementation of water supply are scattered,
both in time and location. Apart from the erection of machinery and
groundwater drilling, civil works are unlikely to attract major inter-
national contractors. It is therefore likely that much of the civil work
will be carried out by GUC on force account or by negotiated contracts
with small contractors. This is reasonable since GUC's Water Division
includes personnel with substantial experience and competence in laying
pipe and erecting elevated steel tanks. The consultants responsible for
final design would also provide the supervisory staff. GUC should
appoint consultants acceptable to IDA and KfW both for design and super-
-Jision pnases.
26.     Most of the program will be carried out in 1976-79.  Early
exploration of groundwater sources expected to take one year is a pre-
requisite if all new production and transmission works proposed for 1976/77
are to be on schedule. In the meantime, GUC is expected to continue with
its ongoing works (drilling and equipping two boreholes, renewal of the Fajara
pumping and partial treatment equipment and a waste detection campaign).
Extensions of the distribution network and improvement of operating conditions
will take place during 1977-79,
/ 12%, 10% and 8%o for 1975, 1976 3nd 1977-79 on equipment; 16%, 14% and
12% for the same periods on civil works.

THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
Sewerage
A. Background
1.        There is at present no public sewerage system in The Gambia.  UNDP
has financed a study, currently underway, of a sewerage system for the city
of Banjul (excluding the tourism area). The tourist hotels on the beach have
their own mechanical treatment plants, but these are less than satisfactory.
It has therefore been decided that the new resort sites should be provided
with an integrated sewerage system.
2.        In the labor support area, however, it has been estimated that no
more than 70% of the houses would be connected to the water system and only
about 20% would have plumbing installations. Since a low population density
has been projected whereby each family will have a large compound for a
vegetable garden, individual septic tanks will be feasible and more economical
than a general sewerage system here.
3.        Since no sewerage system now exists in The Gambia no one has been
assigned responsibility in this field. After discussions with the Government
it was decided that GUC should assume full responsibility during the con-
struction phase and then become owner of the system with responsibility for
its operation and maintenance. Furthermore, because the sewerage system will
be limited, relatively simple, and technically similar to the water-supply
system, the existing staff of GUC can assume this responsibility without
curtailing its other operations.
B. Project Description
4.        The consultants proposed using septic tanks, each with a 250-bed
capacity, and seepage fields, which would require only short sewer lines.
The disadvantages of this solution are the fluctuating level of the ground-
water, the clay soil which in some places would not permit the necessary
seepage, and the proximity of the seepage fields to the beaches which might
create health hazards.
5.        An alternative solution at the same cost has been adopted which
would use stabilization ponds. Such a sewerage system would consist of:
(a) a collection system at each tourist site (Kotu Beach, Point,
Strand);
(b) a pumping station in each site to boost sewage water;
(c) stabilization ponds operating under natural aeration.
6.        Two sites have been found appropriate for the stabilization ponds,
one along Kotu Stream, about 1.5 km from Kotu Strand, the second closer to



ANNEX VII
Page 2
Kotu Beach on the south side of the labor support area (see map). Westerly
winds prevail in both locations so th,at odors would not permeate the tourist
areas, and furthermore the ponds couldl be screened by a curtain of palm
trees. After maturation of the effluent the pond water could be used without
any danger to sprinkle lawns at nearby hotels, to breed fish or to irrigate crops. Sale
of this water would compensate for the extra cost of pumping and conveying it
from the ponds to consumers. Provisions for making irrigation water avail-
able to the tourist area have been included in the project.
C.  Cost Estimates and Project Execution
7.          The estimated costs of sewerage, updated to September 1975,
are given in Annex II, Table 8, and are based on designs prepared by the
consulting engineers, Howard Humphreys & Sons.  The total cost of the
program amounts to D 1,181,000 (US$656,000) of which D 811,000 (US$450,000)
would be in foreign exchange.
8.          Because only small amounts of money are involved in both civil
works and equipment for sewerage, it would be preferable to combine contracts
for water supply and sewerage equipment for international bidding, and to
tender civil works contracts for construction of stabilization ponds
locally.

THE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
GUC's Financial Position and Tariffs
A. Historical Background
1.       The initial assets of GUC in the Banjul area were assigned to GUC
from the Government at a valuation representing historical cost. The re-
sultant value was shown as Government equity in GUC. The public utilities
assets in the provinces) which are valued on the same basis, have been cap-
italized in GUC books with a credit to a capital reserve.
2.       From its start GUC has been incurring net losses  the main reason
for this being an inherited tariff structure which did not adquately reflect
costs. In fiscal 1974/75 accumulated losses reached 28% of equity. Cash
operating expenses were only met by 92%. The rapid escalation in the prices
of fuel oil and lubricants has not been passed on to the consumers by way of
increased charges, which accounts for part of the deficit.
3.       Although GUC's accounting and billing procedures have somewhat
improved over the three years of operation much is still to be desired.
The reserve for bad debts amounts to 26% of debtors and the Banjul
municipality owes D 278,000 out of a total receivables of D 1,202,000.
4.       GUC's liquid position is also giving concern.  As of June 30, 1975
a bank overdraft of D 483,000 was outstanding. This, together with the fact
that cash operating expenses are not met by revenues indicates that GUC would
also in the future have to rely heavily on short-term credits unless tariffs
are substantially increased.
5.       To remedy this situation GUC would not only have to make every effort
to collect overdue accounts receivable and upgrade its operation as far as
billings, meter readings, collection, inventory management, detection of
losses are concerned but also to receive from the Government an equity
contribution of up to D 500,000 to finance ongoing works. Apart from these
short-term objectives GUC would have to implement a new tariff structure which
first would generate revenues to meet cash operating expenses then to increase
working capital and to contribute to financing of the expansion of services.
B. Tariffs
6.       New tariffs for GUC services were decreed by the Minister of Works
and Communications on July 30, 1974. These, however, did not improve GUC's
financial position due to the increase in fuel cost. The average revenue
per kWh in 1975 increased to D 0.15, and domestic water rates rose by 10%
to D 1.00 per 1,000 Imp. gallons. Although the GUC Act stipulates that the
Minister of Works and Communications shall determine "the reasonable rate of



ANNEX VITI
Page 2
return to be achieved on GUC's fixed assets in operation plus an appropriate
allowance for its working capital,' this has not yet been done. The Govern-
ment should therefore now give priority to adopt such a tariff structure
which would not only meet reasonable financial objectives for GUC but also
reflect the economic cost to the higher income groups, in particular tourists.
Tariffs for electricity for all consumer categories would, in general. have
to be based on economic cost. Tariffs for water supply, however, would have
to take into consideration, for the lower income group, the ability to pay
and the necessity to provide such a vital service.
7.       The Government has agreed to increase tariffs effective December 1, 1975
For hotels and commercial users water tariffs would increase by 50% and for
electricity by 30%. For all other consumers water would increase by an average
20% and electricity by an average 15%. The Government has also agreed to a
tariff study being undertaken, the results of which would be put into operation
no later than July 1, 1976.
8.       Although the increase in tariffs appears to be on the high side it
is warranted by the fact that the present tariff structure is wholly unsatis-
factory. The unsatisfactory financial position of GUC is widely known and
understood by both the Government and the public. Furthermore, with the
implementation of the project, consumers should enjoy better service without
disruption in both water and electricity supply.
C. Future Financial Results
9.       By the above stated objectives, improvement of existing operations
and tariff increases, GUC should be in a position to improve its financial
position over the next year. Cash operating expenses should be met by
1976. This, though desirable for all operations, might not be achievable
for the water operations. The power operations would thus have to cover the
deficit of the water operations until 1980 when the latter are expected to
meet cash operating expenses. Power operations should by that time almost
generate a 4.5% return on net fixed assets in operation and 8% by 1981.
Water operations are assumed to achieve from 1985 onwards a 3% return on net
fixed assets in operation. Sewerage service to hotels will from the beginning
achieve a reasonable rate of return. In the long run the rate of return on
gross fixed 1/ assets would be at 8%.
D. Assumptions for Financial Tables
Income Statements - Electricity
10.      Consultants' estimates  adjusted by IDA staff  predict that the
consumption of electricity will increase at a more or less constant annual
average of 11%. This estimate appears justified by recent experience in
The Gambia and expected developments in the hotel, industrial, and domestic
1/ Since sewerage is a self-contained component, gross rather than net
assets are used in the calculations so that lack of reinvestment does
not dilute the base.

sectors. Hotel consumption is relatively low because of limited air-
conditioning and other electrical facilities otherwise coumon in inter-
national resorts.
11.      Based on 1974 electricity tariffs the average revenue per kWh in
1975 was D 0.15. Increases in this average revenue have been assumed to
be as follows:
Average Tariff in Dalasi per kWh
Year             Current Price
1974                0.10
1975                0.15
1976                0.17
1977                0.23
1978                0.23
1979                0.22
1980                0.23
12.      In view of the questionable reliability of the data on past operat-
ing costs for GUC, rather broad assumptions have been made regarding main
cost elements.
- Labor costs are assumed to increase by 11% annually, following
a substantial increase effective April 1975.
- Fuel costs at Half Die assumed for 1976 reflect a present unit
price of D 1.115 per gallon of fuel oil; with 12.5 kWh generated
per gallon the cost equals about D 0.072 per kWh generated. From
1978 on fuel cost per kWh generated of D 0.047 (1975 prices) has
been assumed due to the switch to heavy fuel.
- Other fuel costs have been assumed at D 1.215 per gallon with an
average 9 kWh generated per gallon - an average fuel cost of
D 0.135 per gallon.
- Present maintenance costs are assumed to increase at 10% p.a. plus
1% of new plant in service. Administrative and other expenses are
assumed to decrease from 60% of labor costs for 1976 as a result
of better cost control in later years.
- Depreciation has been calculated at 7.5% for generators, 5% for
transformers, and 3% for distribution lines, averaging at 6%.
- Bad debts have been assumed to remain at a constant D 28,000.

14.      The assumed average cost per 1,000 gallons sold is given in Annex VIII,
Table 3. The cost has been gradually increased in order to meet cash operating
expenses by 1980 and a return on net fixed assets of 3% by 1985.
15.      - Increases in operating costs for water supply have been estimated
as for electricity.
- Depreciation has been calculated at 7% for pumps and at 3% for
distribution lines averaging at 4.5%.
- Bad debts have been assumed to be at a constant D 5,000.
Income Statement - Sewerage
16.      Sewerage service has been calculated by assuming a sewage volume of
80% of water consumption (i.e., 128 Imp. gallon/bednight) for new hotels in
operation as follows:
1977         340 beds
1978         500 beds
1979         840 beds
1980       1,240 beds



ANNEX VIII
Page 5
17.      Revenue has been derived from two sources of income, treatment of
used water and sales of treated water for irrigation purposes. Charges for
treatment of water and tariffs for treated water have been established to
cover the economic cost to provide this service. The resulting financial
target is 8% on gross fixed assets. Tariffs for treatment of water have
been set at D 4.50 per 1,000 Imp. gallons for l93 increasing to D 8.75 for
1985. Revenues from the sale of water for irrigation purposes have been
set at D 0.20 for 1979 increasing to D 0.30 for 1985.
18.      Operating costs have been established according to requirements for
labor, power and maintenance. Depreciation has been assumed at 2.5%.
Funds Flow Statement
19.      Borrowings:
Loans totaling D 11.6 million, excluding interest financed during
construction of D 3.74 million, to cover 86% of the construction cost of the
proposed project.
20.      Contributions:
- Equity contribution of D 1.5 million in 1975/76.
- Equity contribution of D 0.7 million to provide for the balance
of GUC's requirements, net of internal cash generation.
- Contributions from consumers are assumed to total D 250,000
by 1980.
Balance Sheet
21.      Fixed Assets:
Fixed assets are revalued at 10% per annum.
22.      Net current assets:
Net current assets have been assumed to increase annually by
10%.  In 1979 and 1980 there is an additional cash surplus of D 707,000
and D 862,000, although this may well be reduced when GUC's capital
expansion program for those years is better defined.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM PROJECT
Food Marketing and Storage Program
A. Introduction
1.        At present the hotels in The Gambia import about 85% of their
foodstuffs because the availability, quantity, and quality of local produce
are too uncertain for hotel operators to purchase on the local market.
These uncertainties are caused in part by the absence of proper marketing
channels and storage facilities.
2.        The Government has included in a land resource survey special studies
on horticultural production for the tourism industry and plans to implement
production schemes. However, in order to promote an increase in hotel con-
sumption of local foodstuffs it is necessary to improve marketing and storage
facilities. Such a limited marketing and storage component in the infra-
structure and tourism project would also be suitable as a pilot operation in
a broader horticultural storage and marketing project which the Ministry of
Agriculture is preparing with FAO assistance.
B. Project Description
3.        The food marketing and storage program would establish a small
marketing organization to buy the farmers' products and sell them to the
hotels under delivery contracts. The project would provide a storage com-
plex to regulate the flow of produce. The complex would contain a reception
and grading center, air-conditioned dry storage (e.g., for onions, potatoes,
and peppers), cold storage with a 10-ton capacity (e.g., for tomatoes, lettuce,
peas, and fruits), and a deep-freeze plant with a 10-ton capacity for holding
fresh produce (e.g., green beans) over a longer period. In addition an access
road, office space, and two trucks would be provided. A site for the storage
complex has been allocated by the Government in the industrial area of
Kanifing some 4 km from the tourism area.
C. Organization
4.        The food marketing and storage program would operate as a pilot
program under the Ministry of Agriculture for the first few years. The daily



ANNEX IX
page 2
operation of the program would be handled by a commercially experienced
manager who would be provided under the project for three years. In
addition an engineering assistant would be provided for one year to operate
the plant.
5.        The Government has already obtained the services of an FAO marketing
economist for its horticultural st:orage and marketing project. He will
assist in the preparation of that project, conduct a continuing market survey,
keep statistics, and advise on thE. establishment of modern distribution
channels and outlets. This expert would also advise on the implementation
of the food storage and marketing program.
D. Costs and Benefits
6.        Detailed cost estimates of the program, updated to September 1975,
are given in Annex II, Table 11. The total cost of the program amounts to
D 1,305,000 (US$725,000), of which D 966,000 (US$536,000) would be in
foreign exchange.
7.        As a pilot operation the food marketing and storage program is
expected to earn only enougi. revenue to cover its cost. An initial operating
advance, estimated at D 75,000 (US$41,700), would be provided by the Ministry
of Agriculture, which would also cover any operating deficits that might
occur.
8.        The program would:
(a)  keep a larger share of tourism-related benefits in The Gambia;
(b)  increase the foreign exchange earnings from tourism;
(c) increase farm production and farmers' revenues;
(d) insure adequate supplies of foodstuffs to the hotels at reasonable
cost by reducing transportation costs and import duties.
In addition the program would provide valuable experience in food marketing
and storage which could benefit the Government's proposed horticultural
storage and marketing project.

Market Demand and Accommodation Development
A. Market Demand
African Travel
1.        Although tourist arrivals to Africa account for less than 2% of
world tourist arrivals, they increased at an annual compounded rate of 12%
in 1963-73 while world tourist arrivals increased at a compounded rate of
only 8%.

1968      1,700              9.7             141,661              8.9
1973      3,800             17.5             215,000              8.7
2.        Traditionally Africa has been identified as a destination limited
to well-to-do travelers.  In the 1960s, thanks to the development of inclusive
tours (I.T.), tourism to Africa expanded progressively to include middle-
income vacationers as well, mainly from Europe. These visitors are motivated
in two ways. First, interest in wildlife and African culture directs many
people toward black African countries on multiple-stop tours originating
from North America or Europe. Sharing this same motivation are higher-income
tourists on single destination tours or individual visits to specific countries
(e.g., for 2-3 week safaris in eastern African countries). Second, the search
for seaside holidays on uncrowded beaches motivates primarily middle-income
European visitors who spend their entire vacation at a single destination in
vacation villages. This beach-oriented traffic is largely responsible for the
rapid growth of tourism to Africa in the last five years.
3.        Destinations like Morocco, the Canary Islands, and Tunisia based
their remarkable tourism development during the last decade on beach-motivated
traffic, but with the exception of the Canaries, and to a lesser extent
southern Morocco, such tourism to North Africa is limited to the summer season.
In recent years winter beach-based tourism has developed in some West African
countries like The Gambia, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. In the Ivory Coast
and to some extent in Senegal beach accommodations have remained rather
luxurious and expensive since they are located near administrative centers
and therefore cater to business-motivated traffic too. The Gambia, however,
provides cheaper accommodations suited for middle-income groups.



ANNEX X
Page 2
Past Trends in Tourism Traffic to The Gambia
4.        Tourism demand to The Gambia has been created by Vingresor, a tour
operating subsidiary of SAS. In Lhe late '60s Vingresor acquired the monopoly
rights that a Swedish travel agent had gotten from the Gambian Government
to initiate and promote tourism in the country. Vingresor, through its hotel
investment and management branch, Sunwing, entered into a joint venture with
the Government to build suitable accommodations for tourists who were to
be carried by Scanair, an air charter company owned by SAS.
5.        After three years the Government exercised its option to review
the contract with Vingresor and, as of December 1971, allowed other companies
to serve The Gambia: Wings, Ltd. and Far Horizon (UK) and Spies (Denmark)
started operating tours in 1971; Bang Raffels/Unisol (Denmark) in 1972.
6.        The total number of foreign visitors jumped from 528 in 1966/67
to 24,800 in 1973/74. Of these, 20,400 were charter tourists, some 90%
of them from Scandinavia, particuLarly Sweden (57%). Tourists to The Gambia
tend to be middle-income families with a median age of 40 and those 14 and
under accounting for more than 5% of total hotel clientele (Annex I, Table 3).
They spend an average of D 25 (US$15) per day on an average two-week stay
in the country in addition to the prepaid package which averages about
US$380 on half-board arrangements. They appear faithful to The Gambia since
the rate of repeat visits is 15%, quite high for a new destination.
7.        The tourist season has gradually been extended and now begins in
mid-October and ends in late Apri:L.  From 1966 to 1969 the tourism flow was
concentrated in the period from December to March when 100% of the visitors
to The Gambia were recorded. In L971/72 the tourism flow during the same
four months accounted for 75% of ihe overall annual flow and in 1973/74 for
70%. Due to climatic conditions, however, the possibility of extending the
season beyond October and May is limited.
Market Projections
8.        The Gambia is a typical destination for sun and beach-based winter
tourism. Its main competitors are the Canaries and the other West African
countries such as Senegal, the Ivory Coast, and also Togo and Cameroon. In
comparison to these countries The Gambia's position appears privileged. Like
Senegal it offers attractive and safe beaches and truly "summerlike" weather
during the winter; it enjoys considerably lower humidity and much clearer
skies than the Ivory Coast, Togo, Cameroon, and the Canaries, and no rain
during the tourist season. These climatic assets combined with the wide-
spread use of the English language make it a preferred destination for the
major northern European tourist-generating countries (such as Scandinavia,
Germany, England, and the Netherlands). Furthermore, since The Gambia -
unlike its competitors - has no airline of its own nor financial interest
in a regional air company, it fos:ers an "open-skies" policy that facilitates
charter operations.
9.        The marketing strategy proposed for the Kotu development will focus
on the market segment already attracted to The Gambia: sun-seeking visitors



ANNEX X
Page 3
brought by charter flights during the winter season. The proposed hotels
will be marketed through tour operators. A market survey assessing tour
operators' interest in The Gambia has concluded that Germany, the Nether-
lands, and Switzerland are the most promising markets for The Gambia.
Some expansion of the Scandinavian and British demand is also expected.
10.       Provided the airport is improved by the 1978 tourism season,
projections are that German tour operators would then start flying weekly
to The Gambia with Boeing 720 or DC-8 type aircraft. Dutch and Swiss tour
operators would each schedule a bimonthly flight with a Boeing 720 and a
Caravelle respectively by 1980. Scandinavian tour operators would add one weekly
flight of 170 seats to their present operations. By the 1985/86 tourism
season German tour operators would triple their flying capacity, Dutch and
Swiss tour operators would each have a weekly flight, and British tour
operators would add one bimonthly flight to their present schedule. The
number of seats available weekly would then amount to 1,900.
11.       Assuming an average length of stay of about 13 nights and a
hotel occupancy rate of 85% during December-March and 45%-0 duritng October,
Noveinbe-, and April, the 1,900 seats per week would bring about 45,000
charter tourists annually and create a need for 4,200 beds (Table 1).
12.       Suggested package prices for Kotu would include one-, two-,
and three-week vacations. At the vacation village of Kotu Point a typical
two-week package on full-board arrangement has been costed at US$580 (at)
1975 prices) including US$320for accommodation and US$260 1/ for air
transportation. These figures compare favorably with those for other
West African destinations served by North European tour operators (Table 2).
So far Scandinavian tour operators in this region concentrate on The Gambia
and the Canaries; German tour operators have only limited operations in Senegal,
Ivory Coast, Togo, and Cameroon. British tour operators sell package tours
mainly to Eastern Africa, and Swiss and Dutch tour operators sell tours to
the Canaries and circuits on a limited scale to Senegal and Ivory Coast.
13.       The 45,000 figure for annual tourists to The Gambia expected after project
completion in 1985/86 is reasonable in the context of the probable evolution
of the European long-distance travel market and the likely growth of visitor
traffic to Africa.
14.       Future traffic to Africa and thus The Gambia is expected to be de-
termined primarily by the evolution of the European travel market. In recent
years long-haul travel originating in Europe has been particularly buoyant.
The contributing share of Europe to world tourism (excluding travel in Europe)
increased from 16°Z in 1965 to 20% in 1973. This dynamic growth was largely
induced by the remarkable economic performance of Europe. Though the present
economic difficulties are apparently inhibiting the growth of world tourism
in general, in the long run the share of Europe as a long-haul tourist-
generating market is expected to increase even more. 2/

15.       Among factors affecting this increase, the growth of the
population, its changes in age distribution, and increasing urbanization
are of prime importance. Population in northwestern European countries 1/
has been estimated to reach 176 million in 1985 from 161 million in 1970.
Other factors are the wider diffusion of higher education and the influence
of modern communication media which will continue to stimulate curiosity
and the desire to travel - especially to discover new countries. Another
factor that will undoubtedly favor the growth of winter travel is the
lengthening of paid vacations and the spreading custom of semiannual vaca-
tions among Europeans. According to various surveys, indications are that
about two-thirds of the semiannual vacations would be taken during the
winter season in the 1980s.
16.       This anticipated evolution of the European travel market will
also be affected by substantial changes in income levels. According to
research by the National Planning Association of Washington, D. C., the
percentages of northwestern European families with an annual income
equivalent to US$22,000 or more (in US$ of 1975 will move from 6.3% in
1970 to 21.9% in 1985.
17.       The potential European market for long-haul vacations in 1985
has been estimated on the basis of population growth as well as future
income levels. These factors have, then been related to the travel propensity
of each income group and the average cost of a vacation trip to West Africa
(Table 3). It is estimated that by 1985 about 10.2 million Europeans will
spend more than US$550 (at 1975 prices) on vacations, or about the cost of
a package (at the same 1975 prices) to The Gambia. Inasmuch as the majority
of holidays would be taken in the summer and winter vacations would largely
be spent within the vacationer's country, the potential market for long-
haul winter vacations has been estimated at about 3.5 million persons. Total
arrivals to The Gambia in 1985/86 would represent 1.3% of the potential European
market.
18.       The recorded 12% annual growth rate of tourism during the last
decade indicated Africa's growing appeal. In this context the market
projections for The Gambia appear to be attainable goals. If African
arrivals triple by 1985/86 from the 1973 figure of 3.8 million (equivalent
to a growth rate of 9%, lower tharn that for the 1963/73 period), arrivals
to the Gambia would represent only 0.4% of total African arrivals. This
figure compares to 0.5% registered. in 1973/74.
B. Accommodation Development
19.       From 1966 to 1974 hotel accommodations increased from 167 to
1,883 beds of which 1,650 appear suitable for charter tourists. Since there
are no significant private savings in The Gambia to be channeled toward
hotel investment, tour operators themselves started building new hotel
accommodations or entered into jo:.nt ventures with private companies, both
national and foreign. Of 1,883 beds now in operation, 1,800 belong to four

likely to provide visitors to The Gambia in the future (Denmark, Finland,
West Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).

hotels owned and managed by foreign companies. Another 400-bed h'tel was
financed jointly by Government, the Commonwealth Development Corpor tion,
and Sunwing (Vingresor's subsidiary) which also manages the hotel. The
construction of a 340-bed hotel in Kotu Strand has been stopped because
of temporary financial difficulties.
20.       Since the expected demand would consist of air-charter tourists,
accommodation buildup will depend on tour operators' intentions to open
The Gambia as a tourism destination. Indications are that tour operators -
mostly from northern European countries - would be willing to direct a
fragment of demand for wintertime long-haul vacations toward The Gambia, once
the runway at Yundum Airport has been extended for long-range aircraft.
Under this assumption, the hotel implementation in The Gambia and especially
in the Kotu area has been projected as follows:

After the project is completed the Kotu area will have 2,865 beds: two hotels
with a total capacity of 565 beds in Kotu Strand, a 400-bed vacation village
and 750 beds in three bungalow hotels in Kotu Point; three 250-bed bungalow
hotels and a 400-bed vacation village in Kotu Beach. Projections of the devel-
opment beyond 1985/86 appear at the moment to be premature as market kattern
may have changed at that time. Furthermore the planned expansion of the public
utilities would then be at its capacity and new additions would be warranted.
21.        The projected hotel investment cost would amount to about US$19.0
million (at 1975 prices) assuming a construction cost of D 14,850 (US$8,250)
per bed, which is somewhat higher in constant terms than in the past. This
increase results from upgrading accommodation standards to meet the expecta-
tions of the non-Scandinavian demand whose market share is expected to increase
in the future.



A,NEX X

22.       Despite investors' interest in Kotu, as evidenced by the
construction of the Bungalow Beach and Kombo Beach hotels, potential
developers are restrained by the lack of local hotel credit and the
stringent terms of land rents. For these reasons agreements for develop-
ment of a site at Kotu Point failed to materialize even though the land
premium and first-year land rent were already paid.
23.       Whereas in most competing tourism destinations hotel investors
can count on obtaining a substantial portion of their long-term financing
from public or private sources within the country, in The Gambia they have
been able to obtain only short-term (three to five years), high-interest
loans (10 to 14%) from overseas banks, backed by personal guarantees. With
rising short-term interest rates overseas financing has become difficult
to obtain.
24.       To sustain investors' interest in Kotu the Government will have
to provide appropriate hotel credit. If the hotel credit covers 70% of
the investment cost for the 2,300 additional beds planned, about D 35 million
(US$19.4 million) would be required. It is suggested that within two years
of IDA credit signing the Government set up with a well-established
banking institution a hotel line of credit sufficient to cover half of at
least the long-term debt capital needed until 1980 (about D 5 million).
The Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB), which has already made
loans to small hotels, would be the appropriate channel for this financing.
The project would provide funds to finance a promotion campaign aimed primarily
at international investors and publicizing opportunities in the project area.
25.       The policy on setting rates for land rents for tourism super-
structure (hotels, vacation villages) has changed substantially over the
years. In the late sixties the rates were set at a very low level because no
additional infrastructure investment had to be made. With the first develop-
ment of the Kotu Strand site the Government adopted a new policy administered
through PPO. Land rates were then set at D 200 per bed/year, payable at
base signature and subject to negotiation every three years. Since at
that time a number of foreign inves:ors had shown interest in developing
resort facilities in The Gambia, the PPO established a system of competitive
bidding for land leases. Potential investors had to offer premiums in
addition to the land rent. The investor who submitted the highest premium
received the lease.
26.       So far only three sites have been leased on this basis.  One
project has been implemented, another experienced considerable delays in
construction. For the third projeci: payment of the premium and first rent
is all that has been done. Because the high short-term debt financing
imposes a heavy financial burden on hotel investors, difficulties have arisen
in collecting rent payments primarily in the initial years. The Government,
therefore, agreed to renegotiate the land rent and granted a reduction of up
to 50%.
27.       Although a land rent of D 200 per bed is difficult to collect,
a reasonable return on the infrastructure investments and sufficient revenue
to cover maintenance expenses are needed.  An annual land rent of D 180 per



ANNEX X
Page 7
bed in 1975 prices has therefore been calculated. This is based on a
return of 10% on the infrastructure investment, an annual 4% provision ror maintenance,
and a basic land rent of D 200 per hectare. (The latter is ten times
higher than the rent paid by the central Government for land owned by
local councils and used for commercial purposes.)
28.       In order to encourage foreign investors and alleviate their
financial burdens it is recommended that payment of land rents start
only after completion of the tourism superstructure and that the payment
of premiums be abandoned. Furthermore the potential investor, particularly
his financial resources, should be assessed in depth in order to ascertain
that the implementation of the envisaged project is secure before a lease
agreement is entered into.
C. Financial Analysis of Hotel and Resort Facilities Operations
29.       The forecast of income and expenses is based on the assumptions
detailed below and reflects both the experience of existing hotels in
The Gambia as well as identifiable trends in consumer patterns.
Occupancy
30.       Occupancy rates -are calculated according to beds rather than
rooms. Since the hotels would cater exclusively to charter tourists, double
occupancy of rooms would be the norm though a number of single-bed rooms
would accommodate those traveling alone.
31.       Occupancy for the transitional months of October, November, and
April is assumed to be 45% in a typical year. Occupancy in the high season
will average 85% during December, January, February, and March. On a yearly
basis the occupancy rate is 39.4%, equivalent to 142 days, clearly reflecting
the marked seasonality of the demand.
32.       For the first two years a somewhat lower annual bed-occupancy
rate has been assumed: 33.6%, equivalent to 123 days,for the first year
and 36.5%, equivalent to 133 days, for the second year.
Revenues
33.       The tourist facilities will cater to European tourists
who, except for the Scandinavians, prefer full-board arrangement. Revenue
has therefore been based on full-board tariffs. Tour operators, who will
account for practically all business, normally set prices according to
seasonal patterns once an average price has been negotiated with the hotel
or vacation village. Average full-board rates per guestnight have been
assumed at D 34 at 1975 prices.   This includes the so-called bed tax of
2.5% which amounts to D 0.42 per bednight. Additional revenues have been
estimated on a guestnight basis at D 10 for beverage sales, D 4 for extra
food sales, and D 6 for other items (handicrafts, newspapers, laundry, etc.).



ANNEX X
Page 8
Operating Expenses
34.       Cost of sales for foodstufi- in the full-board arrangement has
been estimated at D 7.2 per guestnight. Cost of sales for additional
revenues has been assumed at 50% for beverage and food sales and 60% for
other items. These rates reflect the cost structure presently found in
The Gambia.
35.       Payroll and related expenses were established in accordance with
present wages and salaries in The Gambia. Adequate provision has been
made for fringe benefits and other personnel-related costs which are likely
to increase with the buildup of the tourism sector.
36.       Other expenses include supplies other than food and beverages,
replacement of operating equipment, maintenance, general and administrative
expenses as well as the cost of water, sewerage, electricity, gas, and teleDhone.
Expenses were calculated in accordance with prevailing ratios, except for
utilities charges which have been established according to quantities used
and tariffs as given in Annex VIII.
37.       Land rents of D 180 per bed per year (para. 27) correspond to
3.8% of the total revenue of a 400-bed unit in a typical year of operation.
38.       Tour operators have recent:Ly shown increasing concern about the
standards of accommodation and service. To achieve higher occupancy levels
and higher revenue,hotels and vacation villages must be properly managed.
It has therefore been assumed that the first hotels/vacation villages to
be built would have   foreign management.  It has further been assumed that
500 beds would be under a foreign management company which would receive
7% of total sales.
Financial Rate of Return on Investment in Hotels and Vacation Villages
39.       The overall financial rate of return has been determined based on
an average "turnkey" cost of D 14,850 (US$8,250) per bed in 1975 prices.
Depending on the mix between hotel and vacation villages (which tend to
have lower construction costs and a shorter economic life), the internal
financial rate of return varies between 8.5 and 10&5%, averaging 9.6%.  Since
the calculations were based on 1975 price levels and there is good reason to
believe that future increases in hotel tariffs will outweigh future increases
in construction costs an even higher financial rate of return might result.
40.        Assuming a debt/equity ratio of 70/30 and borrowing at 8.5% over a
period of 15 years, the return on equity would average 12.5%.

TIE GAMBIA
INFRASTRUCTU:1.E AND TOURISM PROJECT
Computation of the Rate of Return on the Tourism Component
1.         Although the tourism works will provide infrastructure in the Kotu
area, the proposed tourism compone:at is part of a development program which
includes hotels and vacation villages. Hence its economic evaluation&has been
made in terms of this larger program.
Revenue Assumptions
2.         The gross revenues resulting from the project would be the expen-
ditures of tourists attracted to tie Kotu area.  Because the project is expected
to draw tour operators who have not previously served The Gambia, it can be
assumed that the visitors to Kotu would represent previously untapped demand.
These revenues are therefore incremental to The Gambia and do not represent
a diversification of traffic from existing accommodations in the country.
Since it is difficult to quantify the benefits derived from developing Kotu
in a way that avoids environmental deterioration, these are not included in
the rates of return.
3.         Some of the services would be paid for directly by the tourists,
while others would be compensated for only indirectly. Accordingly, the
costs and revenues must be carefully analyzed so as to avoid double counting.
4.         The expenditures of visitors to the Kotu site have been estimated
on the basis of tourist expenditures at similar facilities in The Gambia
and competing destinations. The average daily expenditure per visitor has
been estimated at about D 66 which includes full-board accommodation (D 34),
additional expenses for food and beverage (D 14), miscellaneous sales from
hotels (D 6), excursions (D 3), local transportation (D 2), souvenirs (D 4),
and entertainment (D 3). Hotel revenues assume an average length of stay
of 14 days and bed-occupancy rates of 85% from December to March and 45% in
October-November and April-May. Revenues from land rents and bed and air-
port taxes have been included.
5.         It has also been assumed that if the public utilities were not up-
graded and if the Yundum runway were not improved, tourist traffic to the
existing hotels would decrease from the 1973/74 level. Implementation of the
project and improvement of the runway are assumed to save some 20% of the
1973/74 traffic after 1977/78. In addition, completion of the Kombo Beach
hotel has been attributed to the project.
Cost Assumptions
6.         The relevant costs are the capital and operating costs of the
infrastructure provided under the proposed project and of the hotel and
related superstructure facilities to be built in the project areas, plus
the estimated capital and operating costs of producing the goods and
services consumed by the visitors outside the project area.



ANNEX XI
Page 2
7.       Investment costs cover the capital cost of constructing the
tourism-related works in Kotu, the hotel school, the food storage facility,
and the imp-rovement to the runway at Yundum Airport. In addition the cost
of constructing hotels and other superstructure facilities has been taken
into account. Hotel investment costs are assumed to average US$8,250 per
bed.
8.       Economic costs of superstructure operation are derived from the
projected financial accounts of hotels, restaurants and other facilities,
which in turn are based on actual accounts of similar establishments else-
where in The Gambia. With regard to revenue-earning utilities, the gross
revenues have been projected on the basis of expected consumption by hotels
and other superstructure facilities. The projection of utilities charges
in the operating costs of the superstructure facilities has been carefully
matched with the projected gross revenues of the utilities. The gross
operating profit of the utilities has then been counted as a benefit in
justifying the related investments. The operating cost of the hotel
school has been taken into account as well as the cost of road maintenance.
The food storage scheme is assumed to generate sufficient funds to cover
operating and maintenance costs. Investment costs, operating costs, and
gross revenues are all calculated at 1975 prices.
Gross Operating Profits
9.       The gross operating profits projected for the main categories of
visitor expenditures are shown below for the year 1986, when all the hotels
will be in operation.

Shadow Price Consideration
10.      Project accounts were further examined to determine the true economic
values of foreign exchange and labor. The Gambian currency was revalued by
25% i? early 1973 and at present is traded only at the official exchange
rate . This may not be realistic for the life of the project, however.
Accordingly, the rate of return calculations ignored shadow pricing for
foreign exchange except for illustrative purposes (para. 14). In view
1/ The Dalasi is tied to the British pound (4 to 1).

of unemployment and underdevelopment in The Gambia, the opportunity cost
of unskilled labor is likely to be lower than wages received. Hence,
while actual wage levels have been used in calculating the economic
returns, an additional rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
wages 50% below actual levels to test the project's sensitivity to shadow
wages for unskilled labor in the construction and hotel industries (para. 14).

3/  1986 represents the "typical year" for the project when all hotels
are operational.
Internal Rate of Return
12.      Each project facility and piece of equipment will have a differ-
ent economic life, but taken as a whole the project is estimated to have
an economic life of about 30 years. The modest provision for some replace-
ment expenditures during this period is considered to be offset by the life
of the main assets beyond 30 years. On the above assumptions, the internal
economic rate of return on the project would be 12.1%. The sensitivity of
the rate of return to alternative assumptions regarding costs and benefits
is tested below.
13.      Assuming that about three-quarters of the equity and debt capital
for hotel investment would corne from abroad there would be a 13.0% rate of
return on the national investrnent outlays (including the IDA credit and

official financing for the infrastructure, but excluding both the foreign
private investment and the net repayments and other returns accruing to
foreigners). This is higher than the overall return because foreign hotel
investors would not benefit from tourist expenditures outside the hotels
and would receive an after-tax return on their investment somewhat lower
than the project's overall rate of return. This raises the share of
domestic capital (including the externally-financed portion of the infra-
structure) and the rate of return accruing to it. If the expected foreign
private investment were available only for this tourism project and had no
impact whatsoever on the amount and terms of foreign capital available to
the rest of the economy, then the return on domestic investment (including
the external funds) would be the relevant consideration. If, however, the
private foreign investment in tourism were pooled with all foreign capital
available to the whole Gambian economy and fully determined in respect to
its size and terms, then clearly the relevant consideration would be the
return of the overall investment. The foreign share would then be part of
the overall resource pool under Gambian command, over which it must maxi-
mize returns. Presumably the true situation lies between these two extremes;
some of the private foreign investment in tourism may not be available for
other projects, but it does influence the amount of other capital inflows
and its terms. However, as the returns are satisfactory for both the over-
all project and the Gambian funds invested in it (including external funds),
the project is acceptable under any reasonable assumption about its impact
on capital inflows to the Gambian economy.
Sensitivity Analysis
14.      The rate of return would be sensitive to change in investment
costs, gross operating profits 1/, the timing of hotel development, and
the assumed shadow rates for wages and foreign exchange. The rates of
return resulting from alternative assumptions for each of these variables
are shown in the table below:
Resulting Rate of Return %
Best estimate                                    12.1
Investment costs + 20%                           10.7
Gross operating profits:
(a)  + 10%                                 13.3
(b)  - 20%                                  9.5
(c)  - 10%                                10.8
Two years' delay in opening of hotels            10.9
50% shadow rate for unskilled labor              12.3
20% shadow rate for foreign exchange             13.6
Excluding the cost of the runway improvement   15.4
1/ Changes in GOP projections reflect potential variation in occupancy
rates, average daily expenditures, and operating costs.
