IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3469-KO)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Vocational Schools
Development Project in Korea, for which Loan 3469-KO in the amount of US$30 million
equivalent was approved on May 12, 1992, signed on June 19, 1992 and made effective
on September 9, 1992.
The loan was closed on schedule on December 31, 1997. Final disbursement took
place on December 3, 1997, and a balance of US$963,372.69 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Robert McGough, assisted by Mss. Carol Ball and
Ompom Regel. The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Alan Ruby, Manager, EASED and Mr.
Sri-Ram Aiyer, Country Director, EACKO. The Borrower's contribution to the ICR is
included in Annex B of the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's last supervision/completion
mission in September 28 - October 18, 1997. The mission visited the Ministry of Finance
and Economy, Ministry of Education (MOE), Supply Administration, Republic of Korea
(SAROK), and two technical high schools (Yongsan Technical High School and Seoul
Information Industrial High School). This information in this report is based on materials
in the Project Implementation Index File, Divisional Black Books, a submission of
requested data from the Borrower dated January 26, 1998, and information collected
during the completion mission. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR
by: (a) providing additional data upon request; and (b) submitting its own evaluation
report of the project (Annex B).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3469-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
(i)   The objectives of the project were fully achieved. The project: (a) upgraded the
skill training and provided equipment in selected vocational high schools (VHSs) to ensure
the continued employability of VHS graduates and to allow more effective adjustments in
training to support the technologies in the workplace; and (b) strengthened the linkages
between schools and employers, thus allowing for more effective planning, improved
staffmg arrangements in the schools and more efficient operation of joint practice facilities.
The impact of the project was positive in all project institutions (para. 6).
Implementation Experience
(ii)   Overall, the implementation of the project was highly satisfactory. The project was
closed on schedule and with no cost overruns. Counterpart funds were adequately provided
throughout the life of the project. The actual disbursements were US$29,036,627.3-1
million or about 96.8% of the loan amount. Over 95% of the specialized equipment was
procured under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.  Disbursements
conformed to all Bank's procedures including the use of Special Accounts. During the
initial stage of implementation, there were some delays in: (a) the commencement of two
studies; and (b) disbursements. However, both of these concerns were quickly and
effectively addressed and did not become significant. These early delays did not adversely
affect the completion schedule or the outputs of the project. There are no overdue audit
reports, and there was full compliance with all other covenants of the Loan Agreement.
Results
(iii)  Schools are now better equipped with new and more specialized equipment. The
provision rate of experimental and practical training equipment in the whole VHS system
has increased from 45.7% in 1993 to 59.9% in 1997, of which about 3.2% may be attributed
to inputs from the Loan. As a result, students are now more able to complete the
experimental activities and skills training required for employment in the labor market with
its rapidly changing technologies. The average employment rate of the graduates from the
participating VHSs is now about 85%, and in some schools it has reached almost 100%.
(iv)   With major inputs of project-financed equipment, the Joint Practice Centers (JPCs)
have been able to increase annually their equipment utilization rate. This was an important
achievement as it resulted in better program efficiency (internal). The current average
equipment utilization rate is estimated to be about 67% as compared to 1996 (58%) and



4
1993 (less than 40%). The JPCs have also seen a steady increase in enrollments. When
compared to the base year (1993), the enrollments have increased by 3% in 1994, 33% in
1995, and 64% in 1996. The total student hours allotted for experimental and practice
training has also increased significantly. When compared to the base year (1993) they
increased by 11% in 1994, 24% in 1995 and 51% in 1996. These figures provide strong
evidence that the project has improved the quality of services provided by the centers and
has enhanced their flexibility and relevance to support changing labor market demands.
(v)   All five project-financed  studies were successfully completed and their
recommendations were implemented as scheduled. Their findings and recommendations
led to significant policy reforms that are still underway. The recommendations also led to
better planning for the delivery of vocational education services, vocational education
facilities expansion, and program resource allocation. They also supported enhanced
linkages between schools and employers, improved quality and supply of teachers, and
more efficient operation of the joint practice facilities.
(vi)  The implementation of the Sixth (VI) Curriculum Reform was also successful, and
this effort led to improved curricula and the revision of the standard equipment list for the
VHSs. The new standard equipment list has been expanded and is now more relevant to the
expected outputs of the VHS programs.
Sustainability
(vii)  The policy paper produced under Loan 3693-KO titled " Policy and Actions
Program" outlined a number of innovative and far-reaching policy reforms which support
the Government's efforts to sustain the gains that were derived from the project. Through
project-financed studies, the Government has been able to identify clearly and begin to
address the major issues in the subsector. Associated with this effort, it has also clearly
identified the needs in the VHS system. Through its support-all policy, which includes both
private or public schools, there is now a strong commitment of resources to enhance the
capacity of the VHSs to meet the growing needs of the labor market. Throughout the life of
the project, the Government has provided adequate counterpart funds including those
required for consumables and operations and maintenance (O&M). Furthermore, for the
most part, VHS equipment has been effectively utilized. There is reason to assume that
these policies and strongly institutionalized practices will continue and that the potential for
sustainability is strong.
Bank Group Performance
(viii) Bank performance was generally satisfactory in the preparation of this project.
Previous Bank-financed projects in the technical and vocational education gave a clear
understanding of sector-related policy issues, and therefore, reduced the number of staff
weeks required for project design, processing and implementation.



5
(ix)   Bank supervision totaled about 21.5 staff weeks. This amount of time commitment
is relatively low by Bank standards. The low coefficient was due to a Bank decision to
field single missions to supervise all of the education projects at the same time (about 5
projects). This allowed for significant efficiency gains over the 'single mission - single
project' approach. These gains, in turn, brought forth significant cost savings and low
supervision coefficients. It is also noteworthy to mention that the supervision effort for one
of the projects (Loan 3694-KO) in this grouping was audited by Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) and was rated as highly satisfactory. It was also selected for the Bank's 1998
Award for Supervision Excellence. This award is directly relevant as both projects (Loans
3694-KO and 3469-KO) were supervised in the same way and with the same mission tearn.
Borrower Performance
(x)   Borrower performance during project preparation was also highly satisfactory. The
efficient coordination by MOE of the 15 Offices of Education was commendable. Also, the
smooth processing of procurement by the experienced officers at SAROK, the national
procurement agency, led to the less than average processing time and low Bank staff input.
Counterpart funds for both investment and recurrent expenditures for the project were
generously provided by the participating vocational schools and the Govermnent. There
was no shortage of funds during the life of the project.
(xi)   The early delay in the initiation of the two studies was primarily due to the change
of government. When problems became apparent, MOE quickly addressed the issue and a
revised schedule vvas agreed upon with the Bank. Better procurement planning was also
achieved through the decentralization of the annual procurement plan. The decentralization
process began in the previous project, the Vocational Education Project (Loan 3314-KO).
The transfer of responsibility from central to local governments has been smooth and
without any substantial difficulties. Procurement processes have been highly successful.
This was due, in large part, to the highly experienced procurement division of the SAROK.
With the exception of the initial delays discussed above (para. ii), no major difficulties were
encountered during the project years.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
(xii). Although the project was rated highly satisfactory, it should be noted that this
project did not have an appropriate set of monitorable performance indicators. I/ The
project design was straight forward, including only policy work (five studies) and the
provision of equipment to the VHSs. The two project components (studies and
equipment provision) were combined to encourage and support major reforrms in a wide
variety of areas including: curricula, teacher training, instructional methods, introduction
of new technologies and course offerings, and better linkages with industry and enhanced
student placement (better trained graduates and more relevant job placements). The
I / This project was prepared before monitorable indicators were mandated by Bank policy.

project may be characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. With perhaps this single
exception, there were no major lessons to be learned from this project.
(xiii). Korea graduated from borrower status in June 1995. In 1998, due to the financial
crisis in the region, the Government asked for some additional Bank investment for
structural adjustment.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3469-KO)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    Over the past decade, there has been a rapid introduction of new technologies in
almost all of the industrial sectors in the country. The Ministry of Education, in the early
1990s, recognized this trend and began to consider ways to make improvements in the
internal/external efficiency of vocational training, and to upgrade the program offerings of
vocational training institutes to better reflect the emerging technologies sought by the
various industrial sectors. This project was designed to support these initiatives.
2.    The project has two major objectives: (a) to assist in upgrading the skill training
provided in selected vocational high schools (VHSs) to ensure the continued employability
of their graduates and to equip the VHSs to adjust more effectively to the changing
technologies in the workplace; and (b) to strengthen the VHS system through introducing
improvements in the linkages between schools and employers, more effective planning,
improved staffing arrangements in the schools and a more efficient operation of joint
practice facilities.
Sectoral Development Objectives
3.    The competitiveness and industrial growth of any nation is always coupled to the
effective and sustained development of human resources, in particular, skilled workers.
GOK fully understands this reality and has placed a high priority on the development of its
capacity to produce large quantities of skilled workers for employment in industries with
rapidly changing technologies. In particular, the MOE has used this project to support its
efforts to strengthen the VHSs, its primary service provider for vocational education and
training. Similar efforts are also being made by other training service providers at all levels,
both public and private. There is also a major effort underway to strengthen and increase
enrollments in science and technology programs in the universities, especially at the
graduate level.
Policy Issues
4.    The Government has made a number of policy decisions to maximize the
employment of graduates, as well as responding to the rapidly changing technology of the
workplace. The findings of the five studies financed by the Government under this project
are being implemented to strengthen the development of the VHS system (see Table 7), and
to increase the relevance of the vocational training programs to the workplace.



8
Evaluation of Objectives
5.    A review of the outputs from the project suggests that, without exception, all of the
project's objectives were met or exceeded. The Government continues to support its overall
economic and industrialization policies through complementary human resource
development strategies that include major efforts to raise the quality and effectiveness of
public and private vocational education and training. The previous project (Vocational
Education Project (Loan 3314-KO)), focused on initial inputs to improve the subsector's
internal efficiency. This project was designed to implement more advanced strategies
which included major policy changes and the decentralization of VHSs.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    The project met its overall objectives and its main achievements include:
(a)   The provision rate of experimental and practical training equipment in the whole
vocational high schools in 1993 was only 45.7%. Policy reforms and project financing
allowed this rate to increase to 59.9% in 1997. Of this about 3.2% was covered by
investments from the Loan. Schools were better equipped with up-to-date specialized
equipment that are relevant to the changing technology in the workplace. As a result, the
average employment rate of the graduates from the participating VHSs during the project
years has reached an average of about 85%, and in some schools, such as communication
and graphic designing schools, almost 100%.
(b)   Procurement management was decentralized from MOE to the local Offices of
Education. This has resulted in better procurement planning and relevance to employers
and individual training needs, as well as raising the quality of instruction. With the help of
the experienced procurement division of SAROK, equipment procurement processing has
been efficient and on schedule, although the procurement lead time remains too long. This
characteristic is found in other Bank-financed projects in Korea.
(c)   The establishment of the Joint Practice Centers (JPC) under the Loan 3468-KO has
been recognized as successful. The up-to-date equipment provided by this Loan has
allowed for a continued increase in the annual equipment utilization rate. The growth in the
equipment utilization rate is as follows: 11% in 1994; 29% in 1995; and 58% in 1996 as
compared to the base year of 1993. Progress review missions have noted that the JPCs,
almost uniformly, have an impressive system of management and equipment maintenance.
It was also noted that, throughout the system, there were no budget shortages for
consumables and operational costs during the life of the project. The enrollments in the
joint practice centers have increased steadily over the project years: 3% in 1994; 33% in
1995; and 64% in 1996. The amount of time programmed for experimental and practice
training has also been increasing on an annual basis: 11% in 1994; 24% in 1995; and 51%
in 1996. From an internal efficiency perspective, the above figures represent indicators of
improvement.



9
(d)   Due to the change of government, two of the five studies were delayed and
conducted on a revised schedule agreed upon with the Bank. All five studies were fmanced
by the Government and were successfully completed before the Closing Date of the project.
Their findings and recommendations have been utilized to improve planning and operations
of the VHSs and the JPCSs. Policy reform has also been used to support improvements in:
the inventory and replacement of old equipment; expansion of facilities; curriculum reform;
raising the quality of vocational course teachers; better resource allocation mechanism for
consumables and O&M; better linkages between schools and local employers; and the
relevance of vocational education to labor market needs.
(e)   The implementation of the VI Curriculum Reform for the VHSs has led to the
revision of the standard equipment list. This process has supported the replacement of
obsolete equipment with up-to-date, new equipment and was linked with the objectives of
the project.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
Implementation Record
7.    The implementation progress was highly satisfactory. The overall responsibility
for project implementation was under the management of MOE. The three National
Technical High Schools were directly selected by the MOE. The provincial Offices of
Education (OE) had the direct responsibility of selecting participating schools according
to agreed upon criteria.2!
8.    For the most part, the management of procurement was also the responsibility of
the OEs. They sent their equipment procurement requests (types and quantities of
equipment) directly to the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK), later renamed
the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK). SAROK is the Government's
Central Procurement Agency and is both experienced and efficient. SAROK sought
permits from the appropriate authorities for the importation of the various equipment
items and initiated the procurement process. All procurement procedures were in
compliance with Bank procurement guidelines. Over 95% of the specialized equipment
was procured through ICB.
9.    As mentioned earlier, there were two difficulties during the first project year. In
the first, there was a delay of two of the five studies to be implemented by the project. In
the second, during the first year of the project, there was slow disbursement. This was
due to the Government's pressure to use the previous project (Ln. 3314-KO) funds first.
However, both of these difficulties proved to be minor and did not adversely affect the
2 / With the approval of the Bank, some funds were transferred to support other selected VHSs when several
agricultural high schools were closed at the beginning of the project year.



10
overall implementation of the project. There were no time or cost overruns. The actual
disbursement was US$ 29,036,627.31 million or about 96.8% of the loan amount.
10.   Audit reports were submitted on schedule throughout the implementation period.
All three legal covenants were in full compliance.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
11.   There were no major problems affecting the project.
Consulting Services
12.   Local consultants were employed to carry out the five studies and were funded
from  the national budget.  Their performance was highly satisfactory, and their
recommendations were considered relevant. Significant efforts are continuing to ensure
the effective utilization of the findings of the studies which aim to improve both
education management and the quality of the VHS system.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
13.   Throughout the project years the Government made adequate provision for both
investment and recurrent costs, such as consumables and O&M expenditures in addition to
equipment transportation and installation costs. Out of the increased training equipment
provision rate of 59.9% in 1997, only 3.2% was provided by the Loan, the Government
contribution was quite substantial. GOK not only remains focused and attentive to the
overall development needs of the VHS system, GOK has a clear understanding of the
current issues and needs in the VHS system. One of the five studies under this project
concentrated on developing an effective resource allocation mechanism for consumables
and O&M costs. In addition, there is a strong sign of the Government's commitment to the
VHS system through its "support-all" policy to private as well as public schools. The
policy paper "Policy and Action Program" of the Science and Technical Education Project
(Loan 3693-KO) outlined a number of innovative and far-reaching policy reforms that were
the direct result of the five studies financed by the Government under this project. All of
the above indications from the GOK strongly suggest that the development objectives of the
project will be sustained for years to come.



11
E. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
14.   Bank performance was satisfactory throughout the project. The project design is
straight forward and the development objectives were designed to serve as a continuation
of the efforts during the previous project (Vocational Education Project (Ln. 3314-KO)).
They remained focused on the policy issues and VHS needs, therefore Bank staff time
spent on preparation and processing to the Board were at a minimum. Annual
procurement plans were submitted by the OEs and were agreed upon quickly and on time.
Bank supervision work was thorough, including visits to all 15 OEs and sample visits to
several VHSs, checking all required reviews of procurement and disbursement
documents. Because of the efficiency gains from the mission being able to review
several projects during each visit to the country, the supervision costs were kept at a
minimum by Bank standards (21.5 weeks). Bank-Borrower relations remained highly
satisfactory throughout the implementation period of the project.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
15.   The Borrower performance during project preparation was highly satisfactory.
The Borrower had ample experience preparing similar projects (such as the Vocational
Education Project (Ln. 3314-KO)).
16.   The Borrower performance during the implementation stage was also highly
satisfactory, despite the earlier delay of the two studies and the slow disbursements at the
beginning (para.9).  The decentralization process which included the shifting of
implementation responsibilities from the central level to the provincial level was smooth
and effective. The Provincial Offices of Education (OEs) were also efficient in selecting
vocational schools for participation in the project.  They also handled well their
respective responsibilities for procurement.  With the help of the experienced
procurement agency, SAROK, every project-related equipment procurement activity was
carried out according to agreed upon schedules. The slight delay of the two studies and
the slow disbursement at the earlier stage did not adversely affect the project
development objectives.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
17.   The development objectives of the project were successfully achieved. These
objectives were extended objectives of Loan 3314-KO, upgrading the quality of skill
training in selected VHSs and strengthening the VHS system. With the achievement
mentioned in the above para. 6, there is every reason to regard that the project's outcomes
as positive and that future Government commitments towards the VHS system will be
continued.



12
H. FUTURE OPERATION
18.   After Korea's graduation from the borrower status in June 1995, there was no
expectation of any future Bank operations in Korea. However, due to the recent financial
crisis in the East Asia Region, the Government has asked for some structural adjustment
loans.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
19.   The project design was straight forward, and given the efficient performance of the
project implementation agencies, there was no major lesson to be learned.

ANNEX A
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3469-KO)
IBRD Progress Review Mission and Project Completion Mission
SeDtember 28 - October 18. 1997
Aide Memoire I
1.      The I3RD mission2 visited Korea from September 28, 1997 to October 18,
1997 to review the implementation progress of three World Bank financed projects
under Loans 3468-KO, 3469-KO and 3694-KO, and also to reach agreements with the
Ministry of Education (MOE) on preparing the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) for Loans 3468-KO and 3469-KO, of which the Closing Dates are December
31, 1997 for both projects. This Aide Memoire is for Loan 3469-KO only. There are
separate Aide Memoires for the other two projects.
2.       For Loan 3469-KO, the mission visited the Ministry of Finance and
Economy (MOFE), MOE, the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK),
and two vocational high schools at Seoul. Their kind assistance, cooperation and
hospitality is deeply appreciated.
Progress Review
3        Procurement and Disbursement (Annex 1).  The current stants of
procurement and disbursements is generally satisfactory.  Annex 1 sunmaries the
updated procurement and disbursements status for all four MOE projects still under
implementation. Disbursements reached S28 8 million or 96% of the loan amount. By
Closinr  Date, December 31, 1997, this may reach $29.4 million or more (98%o or
h,_,her) An amount of about $0.6 million may be canceled. Procurement reached
S29 z million or 97% of the loan amount.3 The rnission advised MOE to utilize the
shopping procurement procedure, where appropriate, to reduce the procurement lead
time (as compared to the use of the ICB procedure). The mission also advised MOE
to make use of the direct payment to suppliers disbursement procedure instead of the
other two, replenishment of the special account and special commitment. The use
of the special commitment procedure takes a much longer time and there may be less
than adequate finds remaining in the special account due to the ongoing Bank
recovery procedure which occurs during the last few months of the loan period. These
procedures (shopping procurement procedure and direct payment to supplier
disbursement procedure) should be particularly useful if MOE is planning to fully
disburse the $30.0 million loan proceeds.  Also, at this final stage of project
This Aide Memoire is subject to review and modification by Bank management.
The mission was comprised of Messrs./Ms. Robert L. McGough, Task Leader. Carol Ball.
Operations Analvst, EASED. and Sing Zak Sung. Consultant.
3   This figure is 1% higher than the 96% for disbursements. This is the reason that payments have
not vet been made for some signed contracts.



implementation, there should be some degree of fungibility between funds in different
categories in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement, as it would be undesirable to amend
the Loan Agreement for minor deviations in Schedule I at a time near the Closing
Date.
4.       Project Related Documentation. The Special Account for this project is
well managed. A sample review of the supporting vouchers for about 25% of the line
entries into the Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) during the review period (May to
October, 1997) revealed no irregularities. A review of the bid evaluation reports at
SAROK for 100% of the 18 contracts awarded during this review period also revealed
no irregularities.
5.       Covenant Compliance. All covenants are in full compliance including the
submission to the Bank of the audit report for Korea FY1996 together with a separate
opinion on SOEs before June 30, 1997.  The mission reminded MOE that the
submission to the Bank of the audit report for Korea FY1997 together with a separate
opinion on SOEs would be necessary before June 30, 1998 as there are disbursements
from this loan in 1997.
Project Completion and ICR4 Preparation
6.       Project Closing Date. The mission and MOE agreed that this loan will be
closed on December 31, 1997 as stipulated in the Loan Agreement. Any unused
balance of the loan proceeds would be canceled after the closing of the loan account.
The Bank- would inforrn the Ministry of Finance and Economy of the amount of
cancellation. An extension of the Closing Date is unnecessary, given the timely and
satisfactory implementation of the project. There is no time overrun.
(Grace Period. A four month grace period for disbursements of eligible
e;inenditures after the Closing Date has been requested by MOE.  The mission
supports this request and wvill recommend that the Bank agree to the request. The
missIon explained that expenditures for goods and services delivered after the Closing
Date could not be counted as eligible expenditures.
S        Recovery of Funds in the Special Account. The Special Account should
have a zero balance after the full recovery of funds in the Special Account.
9        Data Collection for ICR Preparation (Annex 2) and Time Schedule
(A.nnex 3). The mission and MOE reached agreement on the data to be collected from
the nine provinces and six municipalities in which the Vocational High Schools are
operating. Annex 2 gives the details. MOE would consolidate the inforniation and
pass it to the Bank. Agreed steps and timing are in Annex 3.
1 0     MIOE also agreed to send to the Bank the following:
ICR  Implemcntation Completion Report. The previous name was PCR. Project Ccmpletion
Rcport. Annex B. 'The Borrowcr's Evaluation Summarv", now in the ICR replaces Fr U.

(vi) A plan for future operations and future policies which may ensure project
sustainability.
The time schedule for the preparation of the ICR is outlined in Annex 3.
11.     ,Major Findings of the Project Completion Mission. The Government's
decentralization policy (by delegating to the nine provinces and six municipalities the
responsibility over Vocational High Schools (VHS) under their jurisdiction)
succeeded.
*  Implementation of the VI Curriculum Reform for VHSs was completed;
*  Calculation of provisional rates on equipment became difficult after the above
said reform, because the reform included the abolition of standard equipment
flsts, the denominator of the provisional rate calculation;
*  Utilization rates in VHSs are satisfactory;
v  Graduates from VHSs can find employment in the industry, and their starting
salary is reasonable (additional data will be provided by the Government, see
Annex 2 and 3); and
*  Additional findings will be provided by the Government (Annex 2 and 3).

B. Other Recommended Tables (or sentences in Annex 2)
(1)   Table on improvement in number of practical work/exercises that could be carried
out in the vHS system in 1993, before signing of this Loan, as a percentag,e of the number
of expected practical work/exercises according to the VHS curriculum, compared with
that in 1997, the year of project completion. The comparison should yield the figure for
the "Change" column in Table I and perhaps also the figure for the next column "Due to
Loan"



(2)    Table on "Utilization Rate". If change is insignificant, the table should be replaced
by a sentence(s) in the Annex 2 text.

(3)    Tables on:
(i)    Enrollment increases, staff increases, and student/teacher ratios;
(ii)   Internal efficiency changes, if any, as reflected by promotion ratios; and
(iii)   External productivity changes, if any, as reflected by percentages of
students that obtained jobs, say in 6 months after graduation. Note last
sentence in paragraph 2 above.
Note: abbve tables are optional (to be included, if affecting, or affected by the project).
C. Five Studies:
This is a key component of the Project, although the Loan is focused on the
improvement of the equipment provision rate within the respective institutions. The
present status of the implementation of the recommendations from the five studies should
be clearly outlined in Annex 2:
(i)    Either in the format of a table with columns showing the objectives or
purposes of each study; start and completion dates; major recommendations; and present
status of implementation. Conmnents on the design of the study, its usefulness, execution
of the study, strength and weaknesses of the recommendation, problems or issues on the
implementation of the recommendations, and needed future actions to be taklen by the
MOE,/Provinces/Municipalities would be useful contributions to the VHS system.
(ii)    Or, in the format of a written text in Annex 2 for each of the five studies.
Annex 2 is a Borrower's submission to the Bank as the Borrower s contribution to the
lmplcmentition Completion Report (ICR), to be included in the ICR. unedited if less than 10 pages
or summarized b% the Bank if more than 10 pages.

Project Implementation Completion Report
(Loan No. 3469-KO)
1. Summary of the Project
The general purpose of the project is to upgrade technical training of the
vocational high schools in the technical, commercial and agricultural fields so that
their graduates, when employed, can meet skills required in work sites of the above
industries, and to help them adapt themselves to their productive and changing
technical jobs.
The Loan Agreemenmt for the Vocational Education Project was signed on
June 31, 1992 and the project was completed on December 31, 1997.
To appraise achieved purposes of the project, IBRD missions and the related
staff of the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea visited the project schools and
checked project papers and found that there was no particular problem in completing
the project and the Loan, No. 3469-KO.
There are limitations in presenting objective figures on how much the
technical education of the vocational high schools was upgraded during the project
period, which would be an evidence of the development of technical education in
vocational high schools of the project. We would try, however, to review achievement
of the project by presenting numerical data to the possible extent.
2. Introduction of the Loan
In 1960s when the labor-incentive light industries such as spinning.
shoes-making, etc. was the economic base for the industrial development, demand for
higher skilled workers was rather weak, and the main need at that time was the
basic training of the labor force and development of skills.  But, comming into the
1970s, the heavy-industries began to develop, and the general industries changed and
oriented toward export-expanding ones. Along this trends, demand for skilled workers
increased and much concern was gathered on vocational education.
In  1980s,  along  the  development  of  industries  into  increasingly
technology-incentive production and large quantity export ones, technical factors of
them developed more and more complicated, and their changes faster, upgrading of
the technical education was more and more emphasized.
For levelling up the quality of training facilities in the selected vocational
schools by provision of specialized equipment and complementary investment for their
graduates to cope with the increasingly complicated functional demand in the
manufacturing, commercial and agricultural fields of the industry, the Korean
Government got appropriate agreement from the National Assembly and signed on the
related agreement with the World Bank on the loan of USD 30 million on June 19,
. . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 1



1992 for the expansion cost of experimental and practice training equipment in the
selected vocational high schools.
3. Selection of Participating school and Allocation of the Loan Fund
The Ministry of Education organized adhoc deliberative groups of related
experts for selection of participating schools and equipment items, and made overall
allocation of the loan fund among the Offices of Education in the municipal cities and
provinces. Final decisions on participating schools and equipment items for investment
were made by the Supervisor of each Office of Education.
The allocations of the loan fund by field are shown in <Table 3.1>.

4. Provision status of the experimental and practice equipment
The participating organizations of the project under the loan, No. 3469-KO for
expansion of experimental and practice training equipment in vocational high schools
are 15 municipal cities and provinces, and three national technical high schools. Their
objectives for participation in the project are to upgrade the quality of their graduates.
The provision rate of the equipment in the whole vocatioval high schools as
of December 31, '93 was only 45.7%, but their rate improved very much to 59.9% in
cost through implementation of the project. The provision rate of the equipment
supplied under the loan covers 3.2% of the total cost of equipment in the whole
vocatioval high schools. <Table 4.1>
The project has contributed very much to levelling up the technical education
by providing high-cost and advanced equipment under this loan, and it also performed
a part in providing large quantity of computers, etc. for education.

6-2. Hours for experiments and practice training
To estimate how much quality of technical education in experimental and
practice training has been upgraded after provision of the equipment from the loan in
the participating vocational high schools will take quite a long time for observation,
and it would also be verv difficult.
But, the equipment imported from the loan is being utilized very well for
experimental and practice training in the vocational high schools of the project and
hours for experimental and practice training in the project schools from 1993 to 1996
is in the <Table 6.2>

7. Placement of graduates
The status of graduates from the participating schools of the project is in
Table 7.1. Their average rate of employment for 1994 to 1996 was more than 85.06%.
Such a high rate might have come from the effective technical training in the project
schools. Such training is prerogative for adapting themselves to the productive and
changing technical jobs for the graduates to meet.
The good  results are judged  to  have come from  the good use  of the
experimental and practice training items of equipment supplied and installed during the

9. Benefits of the Prjectl
ln 1980s, industries required more and more technologv-incentive production,
increased exportation, and their technical factors demanded more complicated and fast
changes.
To upgrde quality of technical education for students of vocational high
schools, the Korean Government has introduced the IBRD loan of USD 30 million for
financing expansion of experimental and practice training equipment for vocational high
schools.
The Government financed domestic fund of 1.6 million Won(Service fee for
purchase of equipment, Service costs for equipment importation &- transportation,
Taxes and public charges, Miscellaneous) to the loan amount, and provided  10,647
items of eqaipment in total for 5 years from 1991 to 1995 to 18 institutions such as
municipal and provincial Offices of Education and national technical high schools for'
their utilization. The provision of equipment by the project has raised provision rates
of educational equipment and contributced very much to grading up the quality of
experimental and practice training education in Korea.
The loan and the relevant vocational education project have contributed very
much to the technical education in vocational high schools in Korea. lt could be
summarized as follows
(; The provision rate of experimemtal and practice training equipment in
vocational high schools was raised from 45.7% on December 31, '93, to 59.9% as of
January 1, '97.

(Z) Operation of joint practice centers has improved, and the -number of
trainees increased from 22,400 in 1993 to 36,739 in 1996, showing annual increases.
(3) Rate of experimental and practice training also increased from 100('93;
Base Year) to 150.6('96), contributing to raising quality of technical education.
(9) Operational trainings were provided to teacher trainees along importation of
the high-cost and advanced equipment and computer-related equipment. Their number
of trainees, for 1993 to 1996, was 9,967 including 8,982 trainees for programs of 60
hours or less.
The IBRD loan, No. 3469-KO and its relevant educational project for
vocational training are recognized to have contributed much to the development of
sciences and technology in Korea in addition to the benelits above-cited.
