MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TH" REPUBgLI OF KQRE FOR A VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent
of US$30 million to help finance a project fot- vocat'tn al schools development.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        BAgkgrud. Vocational training in Korea is provided in a variety
of institutions in the public and private sectors. Vocational training
centers (VTCs) under government control (mainly the Ministry of Labor) produce
about 25,000 skilled craftsmen per year while centers controlled by the
private sector have annual outputs of around 50,000. The major producer of
craftsmen is the vocational high school (VHS) system under the Ministry of
Education (MOE) with an output of 274,000 craftsmen in 1990. The vocational
training centers provide move narrowly-based skill training in courses of one
to three years' duration in the public sector and up to twelve months in the
private sector. The vocational high schools offer a mix of academic subjects
(mathematics, science, languagss and social studies) and skill training in
three-year programs at upper secondary level, grades 10 through 12. In view
of the broader education provided in the VHSs, their graduates are regarded as
more trainable and more adaptable to changes in the workplace than their
counterparts from the VTCs.
3.        In 1990, around 811,000 students were enrolled in the VHS system of
which 428,000 or nearly 531 were females, concentrated mainly in secretarial,
accounting, clerical, and information processing courses. By type of
sponsorship, the system consists of 311 public, 273 private and 3 national
vocational high schools. In general, the VHS system is well-managed with the
Ministry of Education setting overall policies and standards and the local
boards of education having operational responsibility for the schools within
this framework. Curricula are generally satisfactory and are updated
regularly, every 5-7 years. Standard equipment lists are also updated in line
with curricular revisions. Employment rates upon graduation are high--of the
1990 VHS graduates whose status was known (91 of total), 9X went on to
further education, 841 were employed, and the remainder went either into
military service or were unemployed.
4.        In order to meet the increasing demand for craftsmen, Government
plans call for an expansion of VHS enrollment capacity by about 251 to a level
of around one million by year 2000. To reinforce this expansion a number of
improvements will be necessary to strengthen the VHS system and these will be
supported under the proposed project. Firgt, a more effective mechanism is
needed to plan the expansion of vocational education to ensure that the system
remains relevant to labor market needs and flexible enough to respond to rapid
changes in skill needs. Secon, there is a growing concern that teaching
equipment in school workshops is not being modernized at a sufficient rate to
keep up with changing technology. As the pace of technological change
accelerates, the sophistication of industrial equipment has outpaced the
availability of comparable equipment for training purposes in the vocational
high schools. Consequently, there is a need to upgrade equipment so that the



- 2 -
VHSs can continue to train workers to the level required by industry. To
ensure that equipment is utilized effectively, adequate supplies of
consumables and funding for 0&M are essential. The standards of provision of
these items vary considerably among schools. It is, therefore, necessary to
define appropriate standards and to develop procedures to ensure adequate
financing of consumables and 06K. Third, in order to ensure that the schools
continue to provide relevant training in circumstaaces of rapidly changing
technology, there needs to be a closer link between employers and the schools
in terms of curriculum review and feedback on local employment opportunities,
the quality of graduates, etc.
5.        Fourth, the adequacy of staffing arrangements in the VHSs needs to
be reviewed, especially in terms of the availability of teachers of vocational
subjects. Although the overall student/teacher ratio is a relatively generous
23:1, the endowmen' of teachers for vocational courses is much less
satisfactory, averaging around 50:1. Fifth, the Government plans to expand
from 7 to 24 the network of joint practice centers within the VHS system.
These represent z. potentially cost-effective way to share the uae of expensive
equipment items between schools. However, the operational effectiveness of
the centers is low at present especially in relation to the allocation of
student time within the centers. The effectiveness of the centers will need
to be improved before expansion of the network takes place.
6.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project has two major objectives:
(a) to assist in upgrading the skill training provided in selected vocational
high schools to ensure the continued employability of their graduates and to
equip them to adjust more effectively to changing technology in the workplace;
and (b) to strengthen the VHS system through introducing improvements in the
link between schools and employers, more effective planning, improved staffing
arrangements in the schools and more efficient operation of joint practice
centers.
7.        Proiect Descrigtion.  The proposed project would finance up-to-date
equipment for selected public and private VHSs more comparable to that
utilized in industry, commerce and agriculture. The project would finance
complementary inputs (US$11.6 million excluding covtingencies) related to
making the equipment operational and maintaining it thereafter namely, local
transportation and installation costs, consumable materials and O&M. The
project would also finance studies (US$0.2 million, excluding contingencies)
which would address problem areas in vocational education and make appropriate
recommendations for their solution.  The studies would be carried out by
working groups organized by MOE comprising officials of MOE and local
education boards assisted by local consultants. Each study would include
recommendations for improvements in problem areas and these recommendations
would be implemented according to an agreed action plan. The proposed loan of
US$30 million, to be disbursed over five and a half years, would be allocated
to finance equipment among the various types of VHSs as follows: technical
high schools, US$16.3 million; agricultural high schools, US$8.4 million; and
comercial high schools, US$5.3 million. Loan funds would be made available
to participating public and private schools as budget transfers from MOE. The
loan would finance about 841 of the foreign exchange cost of the project, or
about 62X of total project costs net of duties and taxes. The Government



-3-
would finance the complementary inputs and the studies. In the interests of
equity, public and private sebools would be treated equally in the application
of selection criteria for participation in the project. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown In Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10189-KO, dated March
20, 1992, is being distributed separately.
8.        Project Implementation.  Overall responsibility for project
implementation would lie with the Ministry of Education with its Education
Facilities Bureau (EFB) handling the detailed activities. Education inputs
would be provided by the Vocational Education Division (VED), which would also
be responsible for implementing the studies. Equipment procurement would be
undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea in conjunction with MOE.
The project would be implemented over a period of five years.
9.        Project Sustainabilit.  In order to ensure that the equipment to be
financed under the loan is utilized effectively on a sustained basis, project
design specifies the requirements for consumable materials and O&M to be
financed by the Government. The use of an action plan will ensure a
systematic approach to the formulation and implementation of institutional
improvements in vocational education. The clear commitment of the Government
to these improvements would ensure that they are sustained in the long term.
10.       Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement.  The major lessons of
relevance to the design of the project are that: (a) careful scheduling of
consultants and a clear definition of their tasks are vital to effective
performance. This would be achieved through an action plan which sets out the
timing of tasks and detailed terms of reference which define the tasks; and
(b) a stable and well-qualified project management staff is essential for
successful implementation. A sound core of project management exists in EFB
and this will be reinforced by technical inputs from VED.
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The rapid change in technology in
the workplace in Korea requires a training system that must adapt continuously
to the rising demand for more advanced skills. An important part of this
process is the regular updating of equipmenc in the VHSs to ensure that the
training of craftsmen continues to be attuned to the increasingly complex
technology being used in industry, commerce and agriculture.  The proposed
project would continue support for equipment modernization included under the
Vocational Education Project (Ln. 3314-KO). In addition to this modernization
process, the institutional weaknesses outlined above (paras. 4 and 5) need to
be addressed in order to improve the effectiveness of vocational education and
to ensure that the full benefit of the supply of new equipment would be
gained. The project provides the opportunity to review these issues, propose
appropriate remedies and ensure that the necessary actions are taken in a
timely manner. The project would thus combine a direct contribution to
raising the quality of vocational education, through the supply of up-to-date
equipment, with institutional improvements aimed at strengthening the
operational effectiveness of the VHS system.



-4-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4
12.       Agred Actions.  The Government has agreed that:  (a) schools would
be selected to participate in the project according to criteria (degree of
equipment shortage, requirements for new courses etc.) acceptable to the Bank;
and (b) institutional studies would be carried out and their recommendations
implemented according to an agreed action plan.
13.       Benefits.  The project would assist in raising the quality of skill
training in the vocational high schools. The project would help to ensure
that trainees are trained on modern equipment more attuned to the high
technology equipment utilized in the industrial, commercial and agricultural
sectors. The improved training would enhance the value of VHS graduates to
prospective employers by increasing their usefulness immediately upon
graduation. Thus the continued employability of VHS graduates would be
assured, and the productivity of the sectors in which they would be employed
would be enhanced. The Institutional improvements, which would be identified
and implemented under the project, would improve the relevance and
effectiveness of vocational education. To the extent that vocational
education tends to serve lower income groups, improvements in the system would
benefit these groups.
14.      Riaks.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
15.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
