INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENiDATION OF TEE PRESDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR
AN OIL PALM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ghana for the equivalent of US$13.6 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance an oil palm project. US$9.L4 million
of the credit would be onlent to the Ghana Oil Palm Development Corporation
(GOPD) in approximately the following amounts: US$3.8 million for plantation
development at 12 percent for 23 years, including 8 years of grace;
US$4.6 million for the oil mill at 15 percent for 15 years, including 5 years
of grace; and US$1 million for loans to outgrowers at 8 percent for up to
21 years, including 9 years of grace. About US$3.8 million of the credit
would be made available to GOPD as part of the Government's equity con-
tribution. The remaining US$0.4 million would be retained by Government for
road construction and technical assistance to ADB.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economic report entitled "Current Econmic Situation and
Prospects of Ghana" (R72-223) dated March 9, 1972 was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 3, 1972. A report on Ghanars industrial
sector (465a-GH) dated October 25, 1974, has also been distributed to the
Executive Directors, and an updating economic report, the draft of which was
discussed with the Government in December, 1974, is in preparation. A
summary of basic data on the economy is presented in Annex I.
3.        Ghana's GDP in real terms grew by an average annual rate of 2.7
percent during 1966-1972; the rate increased considerably in 1970 and 1971,
but there was virtually no growth in 1972. During the same period, population
increased by between 2 1/2 and 3 percent annually. GNP per capita was estimated
at US$300 in 1972. Information on production in 1973 and 1974 is fragmentary;
however, it appears that both agricultural and industrial production have risen
significantly during the past two years. The economy in recent years has been
strongly oriented towards consumption, and the rate of investment has been
low - not more than 12 percent of GNP per annum over the period 1966-72.
4.        Since independence in 1957 and through the 1960's, the main objective
of economic development policy in Ghana was to create extensive infrastructure,
capital-intensive import-processing industries and heavily mechanized farming
operations. Except for traditional export sectors like cocoa, timber and
mining, very few export industries were created. A large number of medium
and large-scale manufacturing units were established behind high protection



- 2 -
from foreign competition; small-scale enterprises in industry and agri-
culture received little attention. The manufacturing sector had low domestic
value added at international prices, a limited employment potential and few
linkages with other sectors. Inefficient State enterprises have become a
serious drag on the economy, and the present Government has taken a number
of steps to improve their efficiency and reduce their losses. Its aim is to
increase and diversify agricultural output - food and industrial raw materials -
and to discourage excessive capital/labor substitution in manufacturing by
levying duties on imported machinery and by granting employment tax credits.
In addition, the Government is formulating plans and policies for the develop-
ment and efficient use of the country's human resources. Important changes
have been made in the direction of economic policy, with increased emphasis
placed on agriculture and greater concern for industrial efficiency, but the
progress made in implementing the new policies is still quite limited. Guide-
lines have just been issued for a five-year development plan to cover the
period 1975-1980, with a target rate of growth in GNP of 5 1/2 percent a year,
and work is proceeding on the preparation of sectoral programs and projects
to fill out the macro-economic framework. At the same time the Government
has acknowledged the importance of mobilizing larger domestic resources to
finance the planned increase in investment.
5.        After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports are
gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of some of these minerals
has not increased substantially for a number of years, partly because of
depletion of ore reserves. Gold production stabilized at about 800,000 fine
troy ounces annually during 1968-1973 with a potential for limited expansion,
while production of manganese declined by about 25 percent during the same
period. Annual extraction of diamonds averaged about 2.5 million carats a
year in the last six years, while that of bauxite increased by 80 percent;
there is a proposal to process bauxite in the country. The country has
potential to accelerate its growth and development through export promotion.
The Government recognizes this and is determined to expand and diversify
exports.
6.        Ghana imports its entire oil requirements, mainly in the form of
crude which is refined domestically. Oil is used chiefly as a source of fuel
for the transport industry. Oil exploration is being carried out offshore
and in the Volta Basin, but no commercially viable reserves have yet been
discovered. Ghana obtains most of its energy requirements from hydro-electric
power.
7.        Despite the poor performance of the economy, Ghana has a fairly
advanced infrastructure. The education system is well established; elementary
education has been free and universal since 1962. Health facilities are
moderately extensive, and further expansion favors rural areas. It is the
declared policy of the Government to achieve a more equitable income distribu-
tion by increasing productive investments in rural areas and by expanding low
cost rural housing and water supply and improving feeder roads.



-3-
Public Finance
8.        There have been growing imbalances in public finances due to rapia
growth in current expenditures and slow growth in budgetary revenues; this
has depressed government development expenditures to inadequate levels.
Recently, the Government succeeded in expanding the growth of current non-
cocoa revenues by improving tax collection. However, most of the incremental
gains were largely offset by rapid increases in current expenditures. With
negligible external capital inflow, the Government has had to borrow extensively
from the Central Bank in order to finance development expenditures; this has
been a persistent source of inflation, the rate of which increased from about
10 percent in 1972 to 18 percent in 1973 and is likely to exceed 20 percent
in 1974.
9.        The 1974/75 budget anticipates an increase of about 18 percent in
current revenues, while current expenditures are projected to increase by
30 percent above the 1973/74 actuals. About one-third of the anticipated
increase in current expenditure is accounted for by the long overdue salary
adjustment granted in 1974. The budget provides about US$245 million for
development expenditure, representing an increase of about US$200 million
o-er that realized in 1973/74, which seems overly optimistic.  Even, however,
if actual development expenditures fall considerably below the budgeted level,
a large increase in domestic savings will be needed if inflation is to be
contained. Public savings at present are negligible, and a vigorous effort
is required to contain goverment current expenditures, to reduce the losses
of government enterprises, to increase charges for public utilities and other
services and to mobilize additional tax revenues.
Balance of Payments and External Debt
10.       The economy continues to be characterized by major structural
imbalances on external account. Due to favorable price developments for
Ghana's traditional exports (cocoa, gold, timber) and to the retrenchment of
imports in 1972, the balance of payments situation improved from a current
account deficit of US$175 million in 1971 to a surplus of about US$122
million per annum in 1972 and 1973. Net foreign exchange reserves increased
from about US$20 million at the beginning of 1972 to about US$200 million at
the end of 1973.
11.       While prospects for continued high world prices for major exports
seem good, the recent increases in petroleum prices are estimated to have
increased Ghana's petroleum import bill by about US$120 million in 1974.
Petroleum imports are estimated to account for about 22 percent of imports
in 1974-1976, compared to less tlhn one-tenth in 1973.  Increased oil and
other commodity prices, combined with an unusually large increase in the
volume of imports, are expected to result in a substantial current account
deficit in 1974. It is estimated that food imports in 1973 amounted to aoout
US$100 million and may have been US$120-125 million in 1974.  The increase
in imports was the result of a much more liberal import licensing policy and
extended over a wide range of goods. Foreign exchange reserves declined
by about US$135 million during the first three quarters of 1974. Towards
the end of the year some of the outstanding import licenses were cancelled,
and a much tighter foreign exchange oudget was decided on for 1975.



-4-
12.       The current balance of payments situation and the medium-ternm
projections indicate that, even with continued favorable price prospects for
major exports, the external resource constraint, which has hampered Ghana's
past development, will remain severe. The Government should be able to draw
on the IMF's oil facility, and some program assistance is available from
bilateral sources, particularly the United States and Canada. In addition,
there are good prospects for the commitment of substantial amounts of project
assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources over the next two years.
Most of the bilateral aid is being offered on concessionary terms. However,
this aid cannot be effectively utilized to finance public investment unless
the Government is able to provide the funds required to supplement external
assistance, and a major increase in public savings is a necessary condition
for a sustained development effort. Faced with a difficult problem of re-
adjustment at a time when rising food and oil prices have put fresh strains
on the economy, the Government needs time to bring about the necessary shifts
in patterns of taxation and expenditure. In these circumstances, and in the
case of high priority projects aimed at reducing the growing balance of pay-
ments problem of the country, it would appear appropriate for external lenders
to cover some portion of local currency expenditure.
13.       Daring the last two years, Ghana had made considerable progress in
repayment of outstanding trade credits. However, there were still an estimated
US$80 million of arrears outstanding in October 1974. A substantial part of
these arrears will have to be repaid before Ghana can regain access to normal
trade credits. Other potential obligations include outstanding applications
for remittance of profits and dividends estimated at about US$90 million in
October 1974, and the Government has also undertaken to pay compensation for
the increased equity it has acquired in several foreign private investments,
particularly in the field of extractive industries. The Government is
currenitly negotiating compensation arrangements with the affected parties;
some settlements have already been reached.
14.       An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was concluded at a meeting in Rome March 11-13, 1974. Under
this agreement, all payments due after February 1, 1 972, in respect of pre-
1966 debt obligations will be paid over a period of 28 years, including .
grace period of 10 years, with an interest rate of 2 1/2 percent per annum.
This agreement was the culmination of more than two years of negotiations
between Ghana and the creditor countries in which the good offices of the
Bank were provided. Good progress is being made, in the second phase of the
agreement, which calls for bilateral negotiations after Ghana's review of the
validity of the contraQts underli.ig the xDbtS in 'uesticali, and a1 fir±al settie-
ment has now been reached with the United Kingdom, which was the largest
creditor.
15.       On the basis of the understanding reached at the Rome meeting,
and on the assumption that a substantial part of Ghana's external borrowing
requirements will be covered by aid on concessionary terms, it is estimated
that Ghana's external debt service ratio will average about 5-6 percent in
1974-1976 and rise to 10-12 percent by the end of this decade. Because of
the large overhang of external debt service inherited from the early 1560's,
Bank Group lending to Ghana since 1969 has been exclusively on IDA terms.
The agreement to reschedule service of most of the medium-term suppliers'
credits will open up possibilities for Ghana to borrow from the Bank, and
with IDA lending now largely restricted to the lowest income countries, most
of the Bank Group operations envisaged for the next three years will have



-5-
to be financed on Bank terms. So long as Ghana is able to provide the
necessary counterpart funds without imposing excessive strains on the
economy, Bank lending of the order of US$4O million a year is a possibility
for the next two or three years. The Bank Group's share of Ghana's total
external debt is currently about 12 percent and is expected to rise to 14
percent over the next several years. Similarly, the Bank Group's proportion
of Ghana's debt service in this period is estimated to average 9-11 percent
of its external debt service payments, but this proportion will rise towards
the end of the decade as IDA financing is progressively replaced by lending
on Bank terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
16.       For a country of its size, Ghana has received relatively little
support from the Bank Group in the past. The Bank has made two loans for
the Volta dam and associated infrastructure works for electricity generation
for a total of US$53 million and IDA has extended 10 credits totalling
US$72.7 million for agriculture, power, highways, water supply and sewerage.
Annex II contains a summary statement of loans and credits as of December 31,
1974. There are no serious problems in the execution of these projects
except for the fisheries project (Credit 163-GH).
17.       Ghana is currently engaged in restructuring its economy, with the
principal objective of reducing dependency on imports generally and achieving
greater self-sufficiency in agricultural products, particularly food. The
main thrust of the Bank Group's operations in Ghana is to assist the Government
in achieving this objective, with emphasis on increasing the productivity of
small farmers, as well as on institution-building and training of Ghanaian
nationals for project preparation and improved implementation. In addition
to the proposed oil palm project, a cocoa project and a rural develop-
ment project are in preparation, and these are expected to be submitted
for consideration by Executive Directors during the next 12-15 months. A
mission will also be visiting Ghana shortly to explore the possibilities of
the Bank assisting the National Investment Bank, which is a government-owned
institution engaged in the financing of industry, including the processing
of agricultural and forest products.
18.       The Bank Group's operations will continue to assist the Government
in improving the transport and communications infrastructure and in streng-
thening the power sector, which is based on the development of Ghana's hydro-
electric potential. To this end, the Bank Group has appraised a telecommunica-
tions project and a highway maintenance and feeder road improvement project,
which includes provision for strengthening the domestic construction industry.
A power distribution project is under consideration for FY76, and this may
be followed by further investments in the Volta River generating system
that are currently under study by Canadian consultants. If the Bank
participates in financing the expansion of the system, it will have to
be on the basis of co-financing with other lending agencies.



PART III - THE AGRICULTlURE SECTOR IN GHANA
19.      Agriculture accounts for about 40 percent of GDP and more than
70 percent of foreign exchange earnings; it employs close to 60 percent
of the labor force. About 80 percent of the land is held under a "cnmlunal"
or tribal system, and production is characterized primarily by a large
namber of individual smallholders; most farmers participate in the cash
economy. Current farm population is estimated at about 5 million, or
more than half of the total population. There has been significant net
rural-urban migration.
20.       Of the total land area of 56 million acres, an estimated 6
million acres are used for crops and another 6 million acres are under
forest and woodlands; a further 20 million acres could be brought under
economic production. The climate is suitable for a variety of crops.
The natural pasture of the savannah areas, covering nearly 70 percent of
the country and particularly suitable for cattle grazing, could support a
much larger nlmber of animals than at present.
21.      Agricultural productivity is low; value added in agriculture
is estimated at 0420 per worker, compared with an average of 0855 elsewhere
in the economy.  Production  methods are mostly traditional using primitive
implements. Except for perennial crops, shifting cultivation is practiced.
Land is cultivated extensively except in the densely populated parts of the
country where continuous cropping is applied.
22.       The establishment of large-scale mechanized farms in the 1960's,
neglect of small traditional farms and unfavorable prices for agricultural
products caused output to lag behind demand, resulting in large and growing
food imports. Realizing this, the Government launched the "Operation Feed
Yourself" program in February 1972 to make Ghana self-sufficient in basic
foods such as maize and rice. Other objectives include increased produc-
tion of agricultural raw materials such as cotton, tobacco and oil palm
for domestic use. The Governent is encouraging production by subsidizing
agricultural credit and farm inputs, guaranteeing minimum producer prices
and granting a five-year tax holiday to farmers and agricultural enterprises.
23.       Ghana is the world's largest cocoa producing and exporting
country. Cocoa, which is produced on many smallholdings averaging about
five acres, accounts for about one-third of government current revenues.
Average annual cocoa production declined from about 450,000 tons during
1960/61-1964/65 to about 400,000 tons during 1965/66-1972/73 and is expected
to be around 350,000 tons in 1973/74. The decline in production is due
partly to inadequate price incentives and partly to unfavorable climatic
conditions. Ghana's share of world cocoa production dropped from 36 percent
in the first half of the 1960's to about 29 percent in the early 1970's.
The Government has created a National Cocoa Production Committee to examine
ways of arresting the declining trend in production and retrieving some
of the lost share in the world market. In an effort to stimulate production



- 7 -
producer   prices for cocoa have recently been raised from 0448 to 0560
per ton, and the Goverrnment has embarked on an expanded program of cocoa
rehabilitation as well as new plantings.
Oil Palm
24.       Oil palm is grown mainly in the southern part of Ghana. In
1970, there were about 36,000 acres of oil palm planted on parastatal
plantations and private estates, 8,000 acres in mixed crop farming systems
and 230,000 acres of wild palms on traditional small holdings. Estimated
total palm oil production was about 20,300 tons, about 19,000 tons of which
was consumed by Ghanaian households.
25.       Palm oil production has tended to lag behind demand because of
a decline in acreage and because of the practice of felling palms to
produce palm wine. The result is a considerable increase in the volume of
imports of fats and oils which amounted to 25,000 tons valued at around
US$7 million in 1973.
26.       Output of palm oil is projected to increase from about 26,000
tons in 1980 to about 45,000 tons in 1990 (including output of the proposed
project) and domestic demand frum about 61,000 tons to about 80,000 tons
during the same period. It is estimated that, without projected output
from the proposed project, palm oil imports would increase from about 35,000
tons in 1980 to about 54I,00 tons in 1990.
27.       The Government is encouraging oil palm farmers by subsidizing
agricultural inputs and also by funding the Oil Palm Research Center.  The
Oil Palm Research Center has its main research station near the project
area and emphasizes applied research, including breeding, seed production,
fertilizer trials and moisture conservation. It is expected to be an
important source of improved planting material for the project. Ghana's
Agricultural Development Bank is already lending to private farmers for
establishing oil palm plantings; the bank is not, however, active in the
proposed project area.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       The proposed project was prepared by the Institut de Recherche
pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO); its report was submitted to the
Government in July 1972. It was appraised by a Bank mission in October/
November 1972, but further processing was delayed by the then prevailing
economic uncertainties in Ghana. Negotiations were held in Washington
in May 1974 with a Ghanaian delegation led by Mr. Basoah, Director of
Economic Planning. It was agreed during negotiations that the credit would
not be finalized until the Government had completed a soil map of the
nucleus plantation area and had established the project entity - Ghana Oil
Development Corporation (GOPD); these actions have now been taken. A



- 8 -
report entitled "Appraisal of the Oil Palm Project: Ghana" (No. 173a-GH),
dated February 3, 1975, is being distributed separately, and a Credit and
Project Summary is presented in Annex III.
Project Description
29.       The project would be the first phase of a 25,000-acre integrated
oil palm development program based on the concept of a nucleus plantation
with outgrower holdings. It would involve planting 13,000 acres of oil
palm about 90 miles northeast of Accra and 20 miles north of Kade in the Tafo
District of the Eastern Region (see attached map). The project would include:
(a) establishment and operation of a 10,000-acre nucleus
plantation;
(b) provision of technical services and credit facilities
to develop 3,000 acres of outgrower plantings adjacent
to motorable roads leading to the plantation;
(o) construction and operation of a 10-ton/hour palm oil
mill and establishment of a fruit collection system
for outgrowers;
(d) training of personnel;
(e)  carrying out field trials with oil palm;
(f) construction of 10 miles of road in the vicinity of
the nucleus plantation; and
(g) provision of technical assistance to the Agricultural
Development Bank (ADB).
Project Execution
30.       The proposed project would be implemented by the Ghana Oil Palm
Development Corporation (GOPD), a statutory corporation recently established
by the Government. The Corporation would operate as a commercial entity
and would be responsible for developing and operating the nucleus plantation,
constructing and operating the palm oil mill, appraising, supervising,
providing credit services and organizing a fruit collection and credit repay-
ment scheme for outgrowers. The board of GOPD would formulate policy and
approve operational programs, delegating responsibility for their execution
to the Managing Director. However the Commissioner for Agriculture has the
right to review GOPD's annual budget and amend or recommend changes. He
may also give general directions in writing on matters of policy in respect
to the long-term development of the agricultural sector, and in cases of
gross mismanagement, he may intervene with written instructions.
31.       Staff forGOPD's senior posts would be provided under contract with
an internationally recognized firm experienced in oil palm planting and
management. It is estimated that four expatriates would be required during
the planting period and two thereafter. A plant breeding consultant would



- 9 -
be employed during the planting period, and consultant engineers would
draw up specifications and tender documents for the oil mill and oversee
its construction. The project would provide for training of Ghanaians to
take over from the expatriates on a schedule to be agreed between GOPD and
the Association, (Project Agreement Section 2.03). Road construction out-
side the nucleus plantation would be carried out by contractors to be
engaged by the Government. Technical assistance to ADB would provide for
the extension of consultancy services originally financed under Credit 354-GH
(Sugar Rehabilitation Project).
32.       The nucleus plantation would be located in the Kwae area near
Kade. A soil survey of the plantation, satisfactory to IDA, has already
been done. The acquisition by the Government and transfer to GOPD of land
required for the first two years of the nucleus plantation planting program
(3,000 acres) would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit (Credit
Agreement Section 5.01(c)).
33.       Only farmers with land suitable for oil palm growing located near
a motorable road leading to the nucleus plantation and within 15 miles
of the plantation would qualify under the outgrower program. Credit would
be limited to a total of 20 acres per outgrower family unit except where
the family has at least 20 dependent members, when the total acreage would
be limited to 30 acres per outgrower family unit. A holding of 20 acres
is considered to be the size of holding manageable by an average farmer with
his own family and some seasonally hired labor. Outgrowers would be sup-
plied with credit in kind by GOPD in the form of fertilizer, planting
material and other non-labor inputs and also cash to cover up to 80 percent
of estimated labor requirements. They would be required to sell their
fruit to GOPD for processing at the central mill; recovery of loans to out-
growers would be made from the proceeds of the fruit sales.
34.       For the purpose of establishing a formula for determining the
price to be paid by GOPD for outgrowers' palm fruit, a committee would be
established. The formula used for determining such prices would be
acceptable to the Association. The Committee would also advise the Board
of GOPD on the proportion of GOPD's profits to be paid as bonus to out-
growers. The level of such profits at which bonuses would become payable
and the proportion of the excess profits which would be paid as bonuses
would be acceptable to Association (Credit Agreement Section 3.05 and
Project Agreement Section 3.07(a) and (b)).
Project Costs
35.       Total project cost is estimated at US$22.5 million, including
duties and taxes amounting to US$0.4 million, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$10.6 million, or about 47 percent of total cost.  The estimated
project cost includes a 5 percent physical contingency for housing, vehicles,
equipment, field establishment, maintenance and harvesting; and for the oil
mill a physical contingency of 5 percent on equipment and 12 percent on civil
works. In addition, price contingencies of US$8.8 million have been included.



Project Finaneing
36.       The proposed US$13.6 million IDA credit would finance 61 percent
of total project cost, net of duties and taxes and would cover the entire
foreign exchange component and US$3.0 million (25 percent) of local costs.
The remaining costs would be covered by the Government, except that out-
growers would contribute about 20 percent of farm labor requirements which
would be equivalent to US$120,000 or 1 percent of total project cost. This
division of costs is considered reasonable in view of the country's dif-
ficult financial situation and the high priority attached to import saving
investment in agriculture where the direct foreign exchange component
tends to be relatively low. The following table contains a summary of
project financing arrangements.

37.       The proceeds of the IDA credit, except those allocated to road
construction and technical assistance for ADB, together with the Government's
own contribution, would be muace available to GOPPD in the form of equity and
three separate loans - for plantation development, for the oil mill and for
credit to outgrowers respectively - on terms set out in paragraph 1 above.
About one-third of GOPD's capital would be in the form of equity which would
be paid in before loans. These terms hav. been agreed with the Government
and would be reflected in a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered into
between the Government and GOPD (Credit Agreement Section 3.01(c)). The con-
clusion of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of effectiveness
of the credit (Credit Agreement Section 5.01(b)).



Benefits and Justification
38.       At full development, the project would generate an annual produc-
tion of 14,000 tons of palm oil and 3,000 tons of palm kernels. The project
would sustain and develop an industry generating a gross income of US$17
million annually in a poor and relatively undeveloped region of Ghana.
Project-induced oil production would substitute for imports, and kernels
would be exported, resulting in a net annual foreign exchange saving of
about Us$5 million at full production.
39.       The nucleus plantation would provide employment for 600 staff
and laborers and the outgrower program would benefit about 250 farmers who
would serve as a base on which to expand the outgrower program in the second
phase of the project. At full development, outgrower farmers would earn
net annual incmes of about US$450 per 12-acre holding (a typical land
holding in the area) after paying for all inputs, debt service and labor
costs, or around US$625 if all labor requirements are provided by the
family. These incomes would increase to US$1,100 and US$1,265 respectively
af ter debt service. In addition, the nucleus plantation is expected to
have a beneficial demonstration effect on the standard of husbandry in the
outgrower fanma. The project's econcmic rate of return is estimated at
almost 17 percent.
Disbursements
40.       IDA credit disbursements would cover 58 percent of total expendi-
ture on civil works and housing; 100 percent of foreign expenditure on
vehicles, equipment, agricultural inputs and technical assistance for ADB;
53 percent of total expenditure on seedlings, cover crop, GOPD's recurrent
expenses and local salaries; 100 percent and 73 percent of foreign and
local expenditures respectively on GOPD expatriate salaries and expenses;
and 100 percent and 50 percent of foreign and local expenditure respectively
on technical assistance to GOPD and training. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that retroactive financing amounting to an estimated US$200,000
equivalent for technical assistance to ADB and about US$600,000 equivalent
for expenditures on nucleus plantation development would be recommended as
part of the credit. However, it now appears that only an insignificant
amount will be required under the second item. A schedule of estimated
disbursements covering the project period is presented in Annex III.
Procurement
41.       International canpetitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines would be used for fertilizer and insecticides (US$1.6 million),
vehicles (US$1.4 million), oil mill equipment and construction (US$7.7
million) and any contract above US$20,000 equivalent. Technical assistance
to ADB (US$0.2 million) is the prolongation of a contract for the con-
sultants who provided their services under the on-going sugar rehabilita-
tion project. Technical assistance and consulting services to GOPD
(US$0.9 million) would be provided by consultants selected in accordance
with normal IDA procedures. Contracts for the construction of non-plantation



- 12 -
roads (US$0.3 million) would be small and would be awarded under locally
advertised competitive bidding. Contracts for land clearing (US$1.1 million)
would be awarded to contractors through competitive bidding locally adver-
tised; part of the work may be carried out on a piece work bais. A large
part of project costs, an estimated US$9.3 million, would be for labor,
vehicle maintenance and operations, administration expenses, and as such
would be unsuitable for competitive bidding. Goods manufactured in Ghana
would enjoy a 15 percent preference margin or the applicable level of tariff
protection, whichever is lower, for bid evaluation purposes.
PART V - LEaAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       A draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Ghana and the
Association, a draft Project Agreement between the Association and Ghana Oil
Palm Development Corporation, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d), of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed Credit are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
43.       Conditions of credit effectiveness, other than those already referred
to above (paragraphs 32 and 37), would be as follows:
(a) execution and delivery of the Project Agreement;
(b) conclusion of a contract by GOPD with a plant
breeding consultant (Project Agreement Section 2.02(c));
(c) conclusion of a contract by GOPD with a firm of oil
palm planting and management consultants (Project
Agreement Section 2.02 (b));
(d) approval by the Association of a form of loan agreement
to be concluded between GOPD and outgrowers;
(e) conclusion of an agreement acceptable to the
Association between the Borrower and GOPD covering
the provision to GOPD of the Borrower's own funds for
the project; and
(f) appointment of the Managing Director of GOPD and
assumption of his duties.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

B.   PROJECTS IN E;DCUTION
Cr. No. 163-GE - Fisheries Project; US$1.3 million
Credit of 3eptember ?5R, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
1.        This project originally provided for:  (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies; and (d) the improve-
ment of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division.
Following protracted problems over design and price, the number of boats
was reduced from the original 40 to 10, the procurement of equipment is now
virtually concluded, and delivery of the boats is expected to be completed
soon. Delays have also been encountered in the execution of the harbor
studies. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972 was extended first
to December 31, 1973 and then to June 30, 1975.
Cr. No. 205-GH - Cocoa `{ehabilitation i'roject; US$8.5 million
Credit of June 76, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 197y
2.        The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of 51,000
acres and replanting of 36,000 acres, is behind schedule mainly because of
drought damage ini 1973, the limited availability of labor, and the Goverment's
Free Mass Spraying Program. The drought caused a high mortality rate amongst
young planted seedlings, creating a large demand for replacement seed, and
hampering production of seedlings at the same time. The planting of young
cocoa seedlings coincides with soil preparation and planting of food crops
which farmers give preference to, thus limiting the labor availability for
cocoa. The Government spraying program caused a delay of two years in the
project's rehabilitation program. Increased costs, due to higher salaries
and wages and higher than expected prices for construction material, equipment
and vehicles, might necessitate additional funding unless the replanting and
rehabilitation programs are reduced.
°r,   . 351L-GH - Sugar RchaYilitation iroject; ULS$15.6 millicn
Credit of January 29, 1973:
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
3.        The project experienced difficulties in the 1973-1974 milling
season and only 8,200 tons of sugar were produced cmNpared with 10,800 tons
estimated in the appraisal report. The main problems were factory breakdowns,
irregularcane supplies from outgrowers and a lower than expected sugar
recovery rate. Management is good and excellent progress has been made with
the rehabilitation of estates and factories. An increase in producer and
domestic sugar prices was recently approved which will strengthen the project's
financial viability.
i/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in
particular to report any problems which are being encounteredy
and the action being taken to remedy them T,hey should be read
in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 438GH-First Highway Project; US$13 million
Credit of November 21, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
4.    In spite of initial delays, project execution is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants have been appointed. Contracts for the
first three road sections to be rehabilitated have been awarcLed to a
domestic construction firm, following international competitive bidding.
The Maintenance Task Force and a Government research institute have
completed studies on road maintenance (including feeder roads), and a
program based on their recommendations is being prepared. The Government
has taken steps to strengthen the highway administration by creating
a Highway Authority to be responsible for all public roads.
Cr. No. 499-GH - Second Water Supply Project; US$10.4 million
Credit of July 26, 1974; Closing Date: Junei 30, 1980
5.    This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an
earth dam at Weija; e dension of the distribution system in the Accra/
Tema area; extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and technical
assistance and training. The Credit became effective in January 1975,
the delay being due mainly to the delayed conclusion of a loam agreement
between the Government and CIDA which is co-finacncing the project.
(The other co-financier is the African Development Bank). However,
construction of the Weija dam is well under way.
Cr. No. 500-GH - Livestock Development Project; US$2.0 million
Credit of July 26, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
6.    The project consists of (a) development of three breeding/fattening
ranches; (b) improvement of about 50 privately owned herds in the
vicinity of the breeding/fattening ranches; (c) training of Ghanaian
ranch managers and (d) feasibility studies for the identification of
a second phase project. The Credit is not yet effective mainly because
of the difficulty of finding suitable candidates for appointnient as
Managing Director for Ghana Livestock Company. Hence, the terminal
date of Credit effectiveness, originally October 25, 1974, has been
postponed to May 31, 1975.
