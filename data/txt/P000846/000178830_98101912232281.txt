GHANA
OIL PALM PROJECT
Summary and CoDnclusions
(i)       The Government of Ghana has requested IDA assistance to finance
an oil palm project in the Kade area of the Eastern region. The project was
prepared by Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux. This report
is based on the findings of an appraisal mission that visited Ghana in
October/November 1972. Costs have been updated to December 31, 1974.
(ii)      Performance in the agricultural sector since 1960 has been unsatis-
factory. In the early 1960s Government intervened in production activities
by investing heavily in large capital intensive State farms but gave little
emphasis to the smallholder sector. The State farming strategy was largely
abandoned in 1966, and the investments made have not achieved the anticipated
impact on agricultural production. In the meanwhile, apart from extensive
publicity campaigns, few effective programs have been established to help
smallholders increase production. Consequently, agricultural production
has not kept pace with the demand for food, and Ghana imports many food and
agricultural commodities that it could produce. Recently Government has
given higher priority to increasing agricultural output with the objectives
of reducing dependence on agricultural imports, raising farm incomes and
slowing the drift of people to the towns.
(iii)     At present internal demand for palm oil is estimated at about 45,000
tons, satisfied by internal production of some 20,000 tons and imports of
25,000 tons. Internal demand for palm oil is projected to increase to about
69,000 tons, and 80,000 tons in 1985 and 1990 respectively. This is well
in excess of estimated internal production of around 41,000 tons in 1985
and 45,000 tons in 1990, which amounts include 12,600 tons and 13,800 tons
of oil respectively from the Oil Palm Project described in this report.
Even with the project there would be a shortfall in domestic palm oil produc-
tion amounting to about 29,000 tons and 35,000 tons in 1985 and 1990 respec-
tively.
(iv)      The project area is centered around the proposed nucleus plantation
site, about 90 miles northeast of Accra and 20 miles north of Kade in the
Eastern region.
(v)       The project would comprise the first phase of an oil palm develop-
ment program which would utilize the nucleus plantation with outgrowers
approach. The linking of a nucleus plantation with outgrowers offers advan-
tages in the spheres of employment, extension and large scale central
processing. The project would include establishing and operating a 10,000
acre nucleus plantation, providing technical services and credit facilities



- ii -
to develop 3,000 acres of outgrower plantings, building 10 miles of road,
constructing and operating a 10 ton/hour palm oil mill, establishing a fruit
collection system for outgrowers, and strengthening the operations of the
Agricultural Development Bank through technical assistance. Project develop-
ment would occur over an eight year period.
(vi)      The project would be implemented by Ghana Oil Palm Development
Corporation (GOPD), a Government owned statutory corporation operating as a
commercial entity. The corporation has a Board composed of representatives
of Government agencies, the Kade District Council and a representative of
the outgrowers. As there is a limited number of experienced Ghanaians in
oil palm cultivation, key personnel required by GOPD would be provided under
contract with an internationally recognized firm in the field of oil palm
cultivation.
(vii)     Project costs are estimated at US$22.5 million, including duties
and taxes of US$0.4 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at US$10.6 million or 47% of total costs. Principal components are: field
establishment US$5.0 million; oil mills US$4.2 million; staff salaries and
recurrent expenses US$1.3 million; vehicles and equipment US$0.9 million;
land compensation US$0.5 million; housing US$0.3 million; operating losses
prior to depreciation US$0.3 million; oil mill working capital US$0.4 million;
technical assistance to ADB US$0.2 million and contingencies US$9.4 million.
The proposed IDA credit of US$13.6 million would finance 61% of project costs
net of duties and taxes and would cover all foreign exchange requirements and
25% of local costs. Government would provide US$8.8 million or 39% of
project cost, and outgrowers US$0.1 million (1% of project cost). IDA and
Government funds would be partly invested in equity j! and partly onlent to
GOPD.
(viii)    Procurement of fertilizers and insecticides, vehicles, oil mill
equipment and construction having a value of more than US$20,000 equivalent
would be through international competitive bidding and would have an esti-
mated value of US$10.7 million (fertilizers and insecticides: US$1.6 million,
vehicles US$1.4 million, oil mill equipment and construction US$7.7 million).
Technical assistance to ADB (US$0.2 million) is the prolongation of a contract
for the consultants who provided their services under the ongoing Sugar Re-
habilitation project, Credit Number '354-GH. Technical assistance and con-
sultant services to GOPD (US$0.9 million) would be provided by consultants
selected in accordance with normal II)A procedures. Contracts for the con-
struction of non-plantation roads (US$0.3 mnillion) would be small and would
be awarded under locally advertised competitive bidding. Contracts for land
clearing (US$1.1 million) would be awarded through competitive bidding
advertised locally. Portions may be carried out on a piece work basis.
A large part of project costs, an estimated US$9.3 million, would be for
labor, vehicle maintenance and operations, administration expenses and as
such would be unsuitable for competitive bidding.
1/   A statutory corporation under Act 232 does not issue shares for sub-
scription. Government equity in GOPD would therefore take the form of
a grant to GOPD.



- iii -
(ix)      Proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to cover (a) 58% of
the total cost of civil works and housing (US$1,790,000); (b) 100% of the
cif cost of vehicles, equipment and farm inputs; (c) 53% of the total cost
of seedlings, cover crop, and GOPD expenses until 1980 (US$1,590,000);
(d) 100% of the foreign exchange cost and 70% of the local cost of GOPD
expatriate staff until 1980 (US$430,000); (e) 100% of the foreign exchange
cost and 50% of the local cost of technical assistance to GOPD (US$80,000);
(f) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the technical assistance to ADB
(US$200,000); and (g) US$5.7 million to cover unallocated expenses. Expendi-
tures would be evidenced by contracts and certified records of expenditure.
(x)       The principal direct benefits from investment in the project would
be the increase in palm oil and kernels production that it generates, esti-
mated to reach 14,000 tons of palm oil and 2,900 tons of kernels annually
at full maturity. The economic rate of return is estimated at 16.6%.
Project-induced oil production would substitute for imports that otherwise
would be required and kernels would be exported. The net annual foreign
exchange savings would be about US$5 million at full development. The project
would sustain and develop an industry generating a gross income of US$17
million annually in what is now a poor and relatively undeveloped region of
Ghana. At maturity outgrowers' net income from oil palm would average at
t 520 per family for 12 acres holding after paying for all inputs, debt
service and labor costs or t 720 if all labor requirements are provided by
the family. This compares very favorably with the present national per
capita income of 4 300 for the country as a whole. At full maturity the
project would provide employment for about 250 farmers and 600 staff and
laborers.
(xi)      On the basis of the assurances that were obtained during negotia-
tions and set out in Chapter IX, the project is suitable for an IDA credit
of US$13.6 million.






GHANA
OIL PALM PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ghana has requested IDA to help finance an oil
palm project in the Kade area of the Eastern Region. The project was prepared
by IRHO 1/ on behalf of the Government and a preparation report was completed
in July 1972.
1.02      Government attaches high priority to import substitution projects,
especially so if rural incomes can also be improved.  Currently some 25,000
tons of palm oil, and tallow, a substitute for palm oil in soap manufactur-
ing, are imported annually, and such imports are expected to increase to
35,000 tons by 1980, and 50,000 tons by 1990. To increase domestic palm
oil production, Government has proposed the project presented in this report,
and which is concerned with the development of 13,000 ac of oil palm as phase
I of a total program of planting 25,000 ac.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission,
composed of Messrs. F. van Gigch, J. Bevan, G. Losson, J. L. Ropiteau and.
J. J. Romero-Chavez, which visited Ghana in October/November 1972.
1.04      The proposed IDA credit would be the fifth for agriculture in
Ghana. The others are credits for a Fisheries Project (163-GH) in 1969, an
Eastern Region Cocoa Project (205-GH) in 1970, a Sugar Rehabilitation Pro-
ject (354-GH) in 1973, and a Livestock Development Project (500-GH) in 1974.
The Fisheries Project, involving US$1.3 million of IDA funds, was to provide
credit for the construction and sale to fishermen of 40 purse seine vessels
and for fishing port studies. For a variety of reasons, including poor
management, the project has been changed by reducing the number of boats to
10, and Government has agreed to cancel the balance of the credit except for
funds required to complete outstanding procurement and for port studies.
The cocoa project, for which IDA provides US$8.5 million for replanting and
rehabilitating 87,000 ac of cocoa farms, is making satisfactory progress,
although the rehabilitation component was delayed due to Government's wish
to change the cocoa pest control policies agreed at appraisal. Government
has now agreed to implement pest control measures as appraised. The Sugar
Rehabilitation Project, involving an IDA credit of US$15.6 million, which
was approved by the Board in 1972, is making satisfactory progress. The
US$2 million credit for the Livestock Development Project, which was approved
in June 1974, is not yet effective due to difficulties in appointing a suit-
able Managing Director of the Company which is to run the project.

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Ghana has an area of 92,000 sq mi and a population of about 9.1
million (mid-1972) increasing at between 2.6% and 3% per year. Two-thirds
of the population live in the humid southern half of the country, and about
one-third are urban dwellers in centers of more than 5,000 people. GDP was
an average of US$2.28 billion in 1971-72, and increased at the annual rate
of about 2.7% between 1966 and 1972. Per capita GNP, which was about US$300
in 1972, is one of the highest in West Africa.
2.02      The economy is based on the production and export of a limited
number of agricultural and mineral products. Agriculture, forestry and fish-
eries employ about 60% of the population and contribute about 40% of GDP.
Nearly half of the balance is provided by transport and services. Cocoa is
the main export commodity, generating about 62% of export earnings in 1971-73;
consequently, the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in world cocoa prices.
2.03      Ghana's current economic problems are dominated by the need to
reduce the balance of payments deficit and correct the budgetary imbalance.
Government is restricting imports to priority goods, emphasizing import sub-
stitution projects.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.04      Performance in the agricultural sector since 1960 has been unsatis-
factory. In the early 1960's, Government intervened in production activities
by investing heavily in large capital intensive state farms, but gave little
emphasis to the smallholders who produce more than 90% of agricultural produc-
tion. The state farming strategy was almost completely abandoned in 1966,
but it has not been replaced by an effective program to help smallholders
increase production and productivity. Consequently, agricultural production
has failed to keep pace with food demand, and Ghana imports many food and
agricultural commodities that it could produce.
2.05      Recently, Government has given highest priority to increasing
agricultural output, with the objectives of reducing dependence on agricul-
tural imports, raising farm incomes, and slowing the drift of people to the
towns. In pursuit of these objectives Government is allocating a higher pro-
portion of the national budget to agriculture than in the past (5.3% in
1968/69 compared to 6.5% in 1972/73); has granted a five year tax holiday
to farmers and agricultural enterprises; is subsidizing agricultural credit
interest rates and fertilizers; and is guaranteeing minimum producer prices
and protection from imports for some food crops. While evidence of Govern-
ment's commitment to agricultural development, these measures appear to be
having little effect as their introduction has been unplanned.



-3-
2.06      An example of this is Government's "operation feed yourself"
(OFY) launched in 1972. OFY sets output targets for the main foodcrops;
but while Government finances the production and marketing activities of
state corporations, individual farmers benefit from little more than exten-
sive publicity campaigns. If agricultural production is to be increased,
Government must reduce its reliance on exhortation and create the institu-
tions needed to support a viable and forward looking private agriculture.
The project described in this report attempts to meet the needs of the
situation in the Eastern Region through the production of oil palms.
C. Oil Palm Production
2.07      Oil palm grows in most of the equatorial countries of West Africa:
in Ghana, it grows in much of the southern part. In world markets, the
experience of the past two decades indicates that a large increase in palm
oil supplies could be absorbed without any severe pressure on prices. Sta-
tistical analysis indicates that in 1980 demand for palm oil would almost
fully match the anticipated supply. There is little reliable data relating
to acreage and yields, but rough estimates 1/ indicate that in 1970 there
were about 36,000 ac planted on parastatal plantations or private holdings,
8,000 ac in mixed crop fanming systems, and a further 230,000 ac of wild
palms on traditional small-holdings. Estimated total palm oil production in
1970 was about 20,300 tons of which about 19,000 tons was used in Ghana for
direct human consumption. Internal demand for palm oil is projected to
increase to about 69,000 tons and 80,000 tons in 1985 and 1990 respectively
(Annex 1, Table 2). This is well in excess of estimated internal production
of around 41,000 tons in 1985 and 45,000 tons in 1990, which amounts include
12,600 tons and 13,800 tons of oil respectively from Phase 1 of the Oil Palm
Project described in this report. Even with the project, there would be a
shortfall in domestic palm oil production amounting to about 29,000 tons and
35,000 tons in 1985 and 1990 respectively.
D. Institutions
2.08      Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) services to farmers are provided
through eight regional offices, which are now being strengthened to permit
more operational autonomy. MOA is short of experienced senior field officers,
though it is well supplied with junior professional and technical officers.
The universities of Legon and Kumasi have the capacity to produce about 100
agricultural graduates annually, but due to limited demand only about 40 are
graduated. MOA's schools for technical officers have a potential annual
output of about 160.

-4-
2.09      The AMricultural Development Bank_s (ADB) financial and debt re-
covery performance was considered unsatisfactory when the Cocoa Project was
appraised in 1969. Thus, although it handles loans to farmers for the Sugar
Rehabilitation Project, lending conditions have been specified carefully to
ensure that loans are made only for viable farms. In addition, technical
assistance was provided under that project to review ADB's policies, lending
procedures, and system of financial control. These consultants submitted
their recommendations to improve ADB's operations in June 1974. Most of
their recommendations have been accepted by the Board of Directors and ADB
has requested that these consultants implement their recommendations. It
is important that ADB should exercise satisfactory financial control of its
operations and determine its true financial position by preparing up-to-date
financial statements and cash flow projections in line with the recommenda-
tions of the consultants that distinguish between loans given for political
and social reasons and those granted for commercial ventures. Details of
ADB's financial position and operations are in Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2.
2.10      ADB is active in oil palm, making loans to private farmers for
establishing oil palm plantings. Since 1965, 128 loans amounting to f 1.3
million have been approved for planting about 5,500 ac; as of June 1972, the
total amount disbursed was around ¢ 0.5 million. About 90% of the total
loans were for oil palm plantings only, the remainder being for mixed plant-
ings of oil palm, coconut and citrus. Approximately 60% of the ADB financed
plantings are in the Western Region around Pretsea, and in the Eastern Region
around Bunso; in the Kade area in the Eastern Region ADB had made loans for
only 270 ac by the end of 1971. The successful establishment of oil palm
necessitates close technical supervision during a relatively long 4-year
gestation period. ADB does not have sufficient experienced technical staff
capable of supervising lending operations for oil palm development. In view
of this, ADB should not make any new loans for oil palm plantings until it
can demonstrate that it was the technical and organizational capability for
this type of development activity.
2.11      The Cocoa Marketins Board (CMB), in addition to its cocoa marketing
functions, purchases palm kernels through its Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) who
deliver the bulk of the produce to the ports of Tema and Takoradi. It is
exported by the Cocoa Marketing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
CMB. LBA purchase an estimated 30% of the palm kernels produced in Ghana;
the remainder is bought by local women dealers who extract the oil and sell
it for domestic use. The structure and functions of 0MB are described in
Annex 1 of appraisal report no. PA-43a, dated June 1970.
2.12      The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) controls
and coordinates research in Ghana. Its 26 members represent the universities
in Ghana, research institutes, Government Ministries and Departments, and a
number of production and development agencies from both the public and private
sectors.
2.13      The Oil Palm Research Center (OPRC) has responsibility for oil palm
research and is a department of the Crop Research Institute of Kumasi. In

The emphasis of the current research program is on breeding, seed production, 
seed germination, fertilizer trials, ecological conditions and yield patterns,
moisture conservation through improved cultural practices, cultivation of
immature palms, nursery practice and phytosanitary control. OPRC would be
an important source of improved planting material for the project.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      The project area is centered around the proposed nucleus planta-
tion site (see map) about 90 miles northeast of Accra and 20 miles north of
Kade in the administrative district of Tafo in the Eastern Region.
3.02      Climate, Topography and Soils.  Rainfall in the Kade area is well
suited to oil palm, the mean annual water deficit in the area being 180 mm
compared with 258 mm at La Me in the Ivory Coast, where yields of around 6.5
tons of fresh fruit bunch tffb) per ac are obtained. Other climatic factors
such as hours of sunshine, mean temperatures and relative humidity are all
well above the minimal requirements for successful oil palm cultivation. The
area lies between 425 and 850 feet above sea level, and the topography is
gently undulating. However, the area is dissected by numerous small streams
and waterways which may lead to some fragmentation of the nucleus estate.
3.03      Soils in the area can be divided into three broad classes according
to their suitability for oil palm cultivation. Class I soils, consisting of
deep, moderately well-drained and gravel free loams and clays with good mois-
ture retention, account for around 20% of the area. Class II soils, which
are found on about 55% of the area, are well drained clay loams and clays but
contain some gravel patches in the upper layers that could adversely affect
moisture relationships. Class III soils have poor drainage and cannot be
considered suitable for oil palm unless improved by drainage. These soils
account for about 25% of the area. Soils of Classes I and II can be expected
to give an average yield of around 5.2 tons of ffb per ac under well managed
conditions.
3.04      Population.  The total estimated population in the project area is
around 42,000 with an average density of 87/sq mi; this is about half of the
estimated population density for the whole Eastern Region. The number of
males in the project area over the age of 15 years is estimated at 10,000
with agriculture providing the main source of employment.
3.05      Land Use in the Kade Area.  Data are not available on farming pat-
terns in the Kade area, but in three districts of the Eastern Region, in-
cluding Kade, the land distribution under main crops has been estimated 1/
as cocoa 68%, maize 9%, cassava 8%, plantain 8%, and cocoyam 7%.  Some oil
palm has been planted in the area, but details are not available. Some of
1/   Based on Ghana Sample Census of Agriculture 1970, Table XV.II.  (Assumes
65% of land under mixed cropping is used by the predominant crop.)



-6-
the cocoa farms in the Kade area are old and are being abandoned. New
plantings are being made by immigrant farmers, particularly to the west of
the project area.
3.06      Land Tenure.  There does not seem to be any problem in acquiring
the land needed for the nucleus plantation.
3.07      Communications.  A good tarred road connects Accra to Kade and
extends northwards from Kade as an earth road. It passes through the nucleus
plantation site about 20 miles from Kade and is scheduled to link up with the
main Accra-Kumasi road. A branch line connects Kade to the main Takoradi-
Accra-Tema railway. The project area is therefore well served with communi-
cations to the important palm oil consumption centers of Accra and Kumasi,
as well as to the port of Tema.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The proposed project would comprise the first phase of an oil palm
development program which would utilize the nucleus plantation with outgrowers
approach. The linking of a nucleus plantation with outgrower replanting/new
planting offers advantages in the spheres of employment, extension and large-
scale central processing. The employment opportunities on the nucleus planta-
tion would provide a regular source of income for members of the outgrower
community. The technical experience gained by members of the outgrower sector
working in the plantation under well supervised conditions should, through
the process of diffusion, serve as a valuable extension factor in the out-
grower planting sector of the program. A plantation mill with modern pro-
cessing techniques would offer economies of scale. A continuous supply of
fruit is needed for a high level of efficiency: and with a nucleus planta-
tion, the risk of large variations in supply arising from fluctuations in
the output from smallholdings would be considerably reduced. In addition,
a well run plantation mill with an efficient marketing system would be in a
position to offer outgrowers competitive prices and a regular outlet for their
fruit.
4.02      The project would be carried out by Ghana Oil Palm Development
Corporation (GOPD) over eight years (1975-1982) and would involve the planting
of 13,000 acres of oil palm as a Phase I of a total development program in-
volving the planting of 25,000 acres of oil palm. It would comprise:
(a) establishing and operating a 10,000 acre nucleus plantation;
(b) providing the technical services and credit facilities to
develop 3,000 acres of outgrower plantings adjacent to
motorable roads leading to the plantation;



-7-
(c) building ten miles of road in the vicinity of the nucleus
plantation;
(d) constructing and operating a 10 ton/hour palm oil mill and
establishing a fruit collection system for outgrowers;
(e) training personnel; and
(f) carrying out field trials with oil palms.
Planting would be completed during the first five years of the project, and
all plantings would be in production within 9 years. In Phase II, the develop-
ment of outgrower plantings would comprise the major part of the program and
would of necessity include an extensive feeder road component.
4.03      The project would also provide technical assistance to ADB by
extending the contract with the consultants who carried out Part C of the
Sugar Rehabilitation Project. This would give the consultants sufficient
time to help implement their recommendations for improving and strengthening
the operations of ADB.
B. Detailed Features
4.04      Statutory Corporation.  The project would be implemented by a statu-
tory corporation called Ghana Oil Palm Development Corporation (GOPD). GOPD
has the structure of a comercial entity in accordance with the Statutory,
Corporation Act 232. To ensure efficient management, GOPD would recruit key
staff by entering into a contract with an internationally recognized firm
experienced in oil palm estate management (para 6.04).   Further details are
given in Chapter VI and Annex 3.
4.05      The project planting program would be phased as follows:

/1   Establishing nursery and felling and clearing for subsequent planting.
4.06      Nucleus Plantation.  The plantation would be situated in the Kwae
area (see map). In order to ensure that the planting program proceeds as
scheduled, not less than 3,000 ac of land suitable for oil palm planting in



-8-
the Nucleus Plantation Area would be acquired by Government and transferred
to GOPD as a condition of credit effectiveness. Assurances were obtained
that the Government would promptly take all requisite steps for the acqui-
sition and retention by GOPD of the remaining land required to establish a
10,000 ac plantation, prior to June 30, 1976.
4.07      An oil palm plant breeding consultant would be engaged during the
project to advise on seed sources for project plantings. In particular the
consultant would assess the suitability of plant material produced by OPRC
and would monitor OPRC breeding and propagation programs producing seed for
the project. It is anticipated that the bulk of the project's seed require-
ments would be supplied by OPRC at Kusi, IRHO and the Nigerian Institute for
Oil Palm Research (NIFOR). Planting material for both the nucleus plantation
and outgrowers would be provided from a central estate nursery. A condition
of effectiveness is that GOPD has entered into a contract with a plant breed-
ing consultant acceptable to IDA on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
4.08      Land would be cleared manually with local labor and the use of
chain saws. Whenever possible land clearing would be let to local contractors
on a contract or piecework basis. Funds would be provided under the project
for the maintenance of all plantings up to maturity, which is assumed would
be the end of the third year after planting.
4.09      Outgrowers.  Participating outgrower farmers would be limited to
those with land suitable for oil palms that was adjacent to a motorable road
leading to the Nucleus Plantation and within a 15-mile radius of Kwae. Out-
grower applicants would be appraised by project staff for technical and
financial suitability and loans would be approved by a project loan committee
(para 6.05). Credit would be supplied to successful applicants in the form
of (a) planting material, fertilizers and other non-labor elements supplied
in kind, and (b) cash for up to 80% of estimated labor requirements. GOPD
would be responsible for fruit collection and outgrowers would enter into
a loan agreement with GOPD which would include a commitment to sell all fresh
fruit bunches (ffb) 1/ from trees planted with the assistance of the loan to
GOPD for processing at the central mill; loans would be recovered from the
proceeds of such sales.
4.10      In keeping with Government's objectives of raising farm incomes
(para 2.05) the outgrowers' program would be geared to the smaller farmers.
To ensure this, assurances were obtained at negotiations that no credit appli-
cation shall be approved if, as a result, the total oil palm planting of a
single outgrower family aided by funds from GOPD would exceed 20 acres.
This is considered to be the size of holding manageable by the average farmer
with his own family and some seasonally hired labor. In exceptional circum-
stances, where an outgrower family consists of a man and more than one wife
and at least 20 dependents, assurances were obtained that the acreage limita-
tion would be 30 acres (para 6.05). Throughout the development phase, out-
grower planting operations would be supervised by project staff and similar
services would continue at maturity, particularly in the early stages of
harvesting.
1/   Fresh fruit bunch is the produce of the oil palm.  Each ffb is a large
cluster of fruits and each fruit comprises a nut containing the tZlm kernel
which is surrounded by oily flesh from which palm Oil 1S e tract

4.11      Roads.  The crop extraction road network within a radius of 15
mdles of Kwae would be extended by about 10 miles to allow a total planting
along these of about 3,000 ac of outgrowers oil palm. Assuming plantings
would be made within 600 yards of the roads, an average of 60 ac could be
developed for each mile of crop extraction road. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that arrangements that are acceptable to IDA would be made
for the siting, engineering and construction by Government of the new ten
mile stretch of road, and that all roads within a fifteen miles radius of Kwae,
but excluding those in the Nucleus Plantation, would be maintained by Govern-
ment to a standard which will enable a seven-ton lorry to use them at all times.
4.12      The Central Mill would be designed to enable capacity to be extended
to 20 tons in 1985, and to 40 tons of ffb per hour should the project be sub-
sequently developed to 25,000 ac (para 4.02). To process project production
10 tons per hour capacity would be required in 1981 increasing to 20 tons
per hour in 1985. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOPD would
employ consultants to assist in the preparation of the bidding documents and
the supervision and implementation of the works. The consultants and the
terms and conditions of their contract would be acceptable to IDA. The
forecasted income statements for GOPD (see Annex 7) show that the extension
of the mill's capacity to 20 tons of ffb per hour could be financed out of
GOPD's earnings. Assurances were obtained that amounts required for this
expansion would be retained in GOPD and not paid into the Government
Consolidated Fund.
4.13      Collection System for Outgrowers.  Outgrowers ffb would be collected
from roadside harvesting platforms by lorries provided under the project.
Nets would be used at the harvesting platforms to facilitate weighing and
grading by project staff. To maintain quality standards a simple grading
system would be introduced with agreed discounts for overripe and/or badly
bruised fruit.
4.14      Training.  In-service technical training would be provided for field
staff under the project. Training for junior field staff would include short
courses in planting techniques, appraisal and credit supervision methods, and
the organization and control of field operations. In addition, the proposed
working relationships with OPRC at Kusi (para 4.15) should ensure that re-
search staff would be available to assist project in-service training courses.
As project implementation progresses farmer training courses would also be
established. Project and OPRC senior staff would be given more extensive
training involving up to six months (i) at selected research establishments
in neighboring countries where they would study specific subjects considered
to be either of direct benefit to the project or to oil palm research in
Ghana, and (ii) on well-established industrial plantations studying field
management and budgetary and cost control systems. The contract made with
an international firm to supply key staff (para 6.04) would stipulate the
need for project staff training.
4.15      Field Trials.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that in
conducting field trials in selected spheres of applied research, GOPD would



- 10 -
cooperate with OPRC and other research agencies of the Government. Initially
emphasis would be given to nursery and field establishment practices, followed
by harvesting and post maturity maintenance techniques.
4.16      ADB.  Recommendations for improving ADB's credit accounting and
control, for reviewing its financial position, for advising on credit policies
and procedures, and for assisting with staff training are outlined in the
reports furnished by the credit management and credit financial specialists
of the firm of consultants employed under the Sugar Rehabilitation Project.
Under the present project twenty-seven man-months of consultants' time from
the same firm would be made available to assist in the implementation of
their recommendations. Retroactive financing would be made available, so
that there would be the minimum of delay in implementing these recommendations
(para 5.10).
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs
5.01      Project costs over the 8 year project development period (1975-1982)
are estimated at t 26.0 million (US$22.5 million), of which the foreign ex-
change component is estimated at 4 12.2 (US$10.6) million or 47% of total

5.02      The project costs include all costs incurred by GOPD until 1982.
As there would be no project revenues until 1980, operating expenses for the
period 1975-1979 would be capitalized and written-off over 12 years starting
in 1980. Costs do not include import duties on the oil mill as Government
does not now impose duties on agriculture processing plants.
5.03      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Government would
inform IDA of any policy changes in respect of its fertilizer subsidy pro-
gram. Presently the subsidy rate is 40% of farm gate price.
5.04      Estimates for tractors, vehicles and buildings are based on suppliers'
quotations and current building costs. Local staff salaries are comparable to
those paid by commercial firms in Ghana. Expatriate salaries and allowances
include air travel and school fees. Field establishment estimates are based
on experience gained from similar projects in West Africa, and palm oil mill
costs on the feasibility study prepared by IRHO. A 5% physical contingency
has been included for housing, vehicles and equipment, field establishment,
maintenance and harvesting through 1982. A physical contingency for the mill
has been included based on 5% for equipment and 12% for civil works. In
addition price contingencies 1/ have been calculated on the basis of the
central projects staff forecasts for civil works, equipment and inputs.
B.  Proposed Financ1n
5.05      It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$13.6 million be made to
finance 61% of project costs excluding taxes and duties. The credit would
cover the foreign exchange requirements of US$10.6 million and US$3.0 mil-
lion or 25% of local costs. Outgrowers would contribute 20% of farm labor
requirements during establishment (US$120,000 equivalent or 1% of total
project costs). Government would provide the,remaining US$8.8 million
equivalent, or 39% of total project cost. A summary of the financing plan
is shown below and detailed at Annex 7.

5.06      About 50% of the outgrowers labor would be family labor and the
rest would be hired. Credit would be provided for 80% of estimated total
labor requirements (para 6.06).
5.07      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOPD would provide
credit to outgrowers (para 6.06) at an interest rate of at least 8%. Inter-
est would be capitalized during the first 9 years and would be repaid together
with principal over the following 12 years. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that GOPD would obtain IDA approval before any changes were
made in the agreed lending terms and arrangements for outgrowers credit.
5.08      The income statements and cash flow at Annex 7 show that GOPD pro-
fits would be substantial from 1983 onwards and that GOPD should be able to
attract private sector financing. At present foreign owned commercial banks
and companies in Ghana are restricted in the transfer of funds abroad, and
there is believed to be a largely untapped supply of private sector funds
available for equity and medium- and long-term loan investments. This has
been taken into account-in the proposed capital structure of GOPD under which
IDA and Government funds would be partly invested in equity, 1/ the remainder
being onlent for nucleus plantation development, for outgrowers' credit, and
for the oil mill, as three separate loans. The equity would be subscribed
by Government. The proposed loan terms for the oil mill should be attractive
to private investors (see para 5.09).
5.09      The paid-in capital structure would be as follows:
£ million
Equity                         7.3
Nucleus Plantation loan        7.7
Oil Mill loan                 8.9
Total                        23.9
The paid-in equity represents about 30% of the investment in the
nucleus plantation and the oil mill and would be paid in first. Assets would
be revalued yearly, and when the revaluation surplus is added to the original
equity, this would result in a favorable debt/equity ratio indicating a
sound financial position (Annex 7, Table 3). The loan for the nucleus plan-
tation development would be made to GOPD at 12% for 23 years, including 8
years of grace in which interest would be capitalized. The loan for out-
growers' credit would be at 8% for 21 years, including 9 years of grace in
1/   A statutory corporation under Act 232 does not issue shares for sub-
scriptions. Government equity in GOPD would therefore take the form of
a grant to GOPD.



- 15 -
which interest would be capitalized. The loan for the oil mill would be at
15% for 15 years, including 5 years of grace in which interest would be cap-
italized. The lender terms of the oil mill loan which are in line with
prevailing interest rates in Ghana for manufacturing and commercial ventures
reflect the fact that the processing component of the project can be sepa-
rated from the rest of GOPD activities. It is a condition of effectiveness
that financial arrangements satisfactory to IDA to channel Government and
IDA funds to GOPD have been concluded between Government and GOPD. Such
arrangements will cover both equity participation and long-term loans to
GOrD. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that any subsequent
changes in the financial arrangements between the Government and GOPD,
including the participation of private or parastatal organizations, would
be acceptable to IDA.
5.10      To ensure the timely start of land clearing and nursery preparation,
it was agreed at negotiations that IDA would finance retroactively all expenses
incurred by GOPD from June 1, 1974 up to a maximum of US$600,000 corresponding
to about the amount IDA would finance in the first year of GOPD operations.
It was agreed that a further US$200,000 would be available for retroactively
financing the technical assistance to ADB from July 31, 1974 (para 4.16).
It was also agreed that Government would provide GOPD quarterly with funds
required to meet its expenditures for the subsequent 3 months.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.11      Procurement.  International competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA's guidelines would be used for fertilizers and insecticides (US$1.6 mil-
lion), 1/ vehicles (US$1.4 million), oil mill equipment and construction
(US$7.7 million) and any contract above US$20,000 equivalent. Technical
assistance to ADB (US$0.2 million) is the prolongation of a contract for the
consultants who provided their services under the on-going sugar rehabilita-
tion project Credit Number 354-Gli. Technical assistance and consulting
services to GOPD (US$0.9 million) would be provided by consultants selected
in accordance with normal IDA procedures. Contracts for the construction
of non-plantation roads (US$0.3 million) would be small and would be awarded
under locally advertised competitive bidding (para 4.08). Contracts for
land clearing (US$1.1 million) would be awarded through competitive bidding
advertised locally. Portions may be carried out on a piece work basis. A
large part of project costs, an estimated US$9.3 million, would be for
labor, vehicle maintenance and operations, administration expenses and as
such would be unsuitable for competitive bidding. Goods manufactured in
Ghana would enjoy a 15 percent preference margin or the applicable level
of tariff protection, whichever is lower for bid evaluation purposes.
5.12      Disbursement.  IDA would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost
of equipment, expatriate expenses and technical assistance, and Government
would finance 100% of outgrowers' labor, GOPD working capital, land rent and
I/   Including contingencies.



- 16 -
land compensation. US$5.7 million to cover project contingencies would be
unallocated. An estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit
is at Annex 6. Expenditures would be evidenced by contracts and certified
records of expenditure. Any savings on the IDA credit would be subject to
cancellation.   IDA financing would be as follows:
US$ '000
Category I   Civil Works, Housing              1,790  58% of Total Expenditures
Category II  Vehicles, Equipment, Inputs       3,800 100% of Foreign Expenditures
Category III Seedlings, Cover Crop, GOPD
Recurrent Expenses             1,590  53% of Total Expenditures
Category IV  GOPD Expatriate Salaries            430 100% of Foreign and
73% of Local Expenditures
Category V   Technical Assistance to GOPD         80 100% of Foreign and
and Training                           50% of Local Expenditures
Category VI  Technical Assistance to ADB         200  100% of Foreign Expenditures
Category VII Unallocated                       5,710
13,600
D. Accounts and Audit
5.13      GOPD accounts including outgrowers credit accounts would be kept
in accordance with established accounting principles. Financial statements
would be audited by a firm of independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and
submitted together with the auditor's report to IDA within four months of
the closing of the financial year. At negotiations, assurances to these
effects were obtained from Government.
VI.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      The project would be implemented by Ghana Oil Palm Development
Corporation (GOPD) a statutory corporation, operating as a commercial entity
(see Annex 3).



- 17 -
6.02      GOPD has a Board of Directors which would formulate policy in ac-
cordance with its declared commercial objectives. The Board is composed of
representatives of appropriate Government agencies, the Kade District Council
and a representative of the outgrowers. Details of the composition of GOPD
Board and its basic functions are given in Annex 3. The Commissioner respon-
sible for Agriculture has the right to review GOPD's annual budget and amend
or recommend changes.  He may give general directions in writing to GOPD on
matters of policy in respect to the long term development of the agricultural
sector, and in cases of gross mismanagement, he may intercede with written
directions. GOPD would be responsible for developing and operating the
nucleus plantation, constructing and running the palm oil mill, and providing
the advisory, supervision and credit services for outgrowers.
B. Staffing
6.03      GOPD management structure is detailed in the organization chart.
The chief executive would be the Managing Director to whom the Board would
delegate full responsibility to implement the project. A condition of effec-
tiveness is that a person acceptable to IDA has assumed full time the duties
of Managing Director. Assurances were also obtained that if the Managing
Director was changed, his replacement would be a person with qualifications
and experience acceptable to IDA. The Nucleus Plantation Manager and his
Deputy would be responsible for establishing and operating the plantation, the
mill, and for providing outgrowers services. The Finance Manager would be
responsible for all accounting and budgetary control, internal audit, marketing,
and general administration.
6.04      The key personnel required to assure efficient project implemen-
tation would be the Managing Director, the Nucleus Plantation Manager, Finance
Manager, Mill Engineer, and the Senior Assistant Plantation Manager. As it
is doubtful that there are Ghanaians available with sufficient experience (see
Annex 3) to fill these key positions, it would be necessary to contract with
an internationally recognized firm, experienced in oil palm planting and
management, to provide such staff. Government recognize the lack of suitably
qualified Ghanaians and have agreed to this approach. The contract would
include provisions for training Ghanaian staff to replace expatriate staff.
It is a condition of effectiveness that a contract to supply key staff
acceptable to IDA had been signed between GOPD and a suitable firm experienced
in oil palm planting and management. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that GOPD would prepare in consultation with Government a program for the
training of Ghanaian staff within 6 months of credit effectiveness with a
view to replacing non-Ghanaian staff according to a schedule to be reviewed
from time to time in consultation with Government and the Association. The
management structure provides "in-line responsibility" as opposed to counter-
part for key management positions occupied by expatriates. This is expedient
for control and efficiency of operations and would assist in the development
of managerial capacities.



- 18 -
C. The Outgrower Program
6.05      GOPD would be responsible for all aspects of the outgrower pro-
gram including loan appraisal, procurement and delivery of inputs and planting
material, extension services, credit and ffb collection. The outgrower program
would be the responsibility of the Head of the Outgrower Section who would
report to the Nucleus Plantation Manager. Technical appraisal of applicants
would be performed by the group leaders of the Outgrower Section, and financial
appraisal by the accountants in consultation with local commercial banks where
the potential borrower has been a bank client. Assurances were obtained that
credit would be limited to a total of 20 ac per outgrower family unit except
where the family consists of a man and more than one wife and at least 20
dependents, when the total acreage would be limited to 30 ac per outgrower
family unit. Assurances were obtained that outgrowers' loans would be
approved by a loan committee chaired by the Nucleus Plantation Manager, which
would include the Head of the Outgrower Section, the Senior Accountant and
representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and of ADB.
6.06      Outgrowers would be eligible for credit to meet the full cost of
inputs and 80% of labor costs during the establishment period. Borrowers
would enter into a loan agreement with GOPD detailing the amount and terms
of credit, requiring that all production from trees planted with the assist-
ance of the loan be delivered to the GOPD mill, and allowing loan repayments
to be deducted when payments for ffb are made by GOPD. If borrowers' plant-
ings are not managed in a husbandlike manner GOPD would have the option to
take over the management of the plantings or appoint agents to manage them
at the expense of the borrowers until the loans had been repaid (Annex 3,
Appendix 1). It is a condition of effectiveness that IDA has approved the
form of the outgrower loan agreements. To confirm their security of tenure,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that Government would take appro-
priate action to ensure that the proprietary interest of each outgrower in
land to be planted with the assistance of a loan would be duly defined and
recorded with the office of the District Administrative Office, Kade, prior
to the loan being made.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMER BENEFITS,
GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Yield estimates for the nucleus plantation and outgrowers are based
on ecological conditions in the project area. Both nucleus plantation and
outgrowers' palms would begin yielding in the fourth year after planting and
at full maturity are estimated to produce 5.2 tons and 4.0 tons ffb per ac
respectively (Annex 8, Table 1). The lower outgrower yields reflect expected



- 19 -
lower field maintenance standards. These yield estimates are generally in
line with those experienced with equivalent planting material under similar
ecological conditions in West Africa.
7.02      At full development the project would produce annually about 14,000
tons of palm oil and 2,900 tons of palm kernels. The nucleus plantation would
account for about 80% of total project output.
B. Markets and Prices
7.03      In 1970 Ghana's production of palm oil was estimated to be around
20,000 tons per annum of which households consumed 19,000 tons. Demand for
palm oil is expected to increase at about 6% per annum compounded up to 1980
and at 4% per annum compounded thereafter (Annex 1). By 1980 demand is esti-
mated at 61,000 tons per annum rising to about 80,000 tons in 1990. Domestic
production in 1980 is projected at about 26,000 tons and would reach about
45,000 tons in 1990 including the output of the proposed project of some
13,800 tons. On this basis project production would be fully absorbed inter-
nally as there would still be a shortfall in domestically produced palm oil
of about 29,000 tons and 35,000 tons in 1985 and 1990, respectively (see
Annex 1, Table 2).
7.04      The millgate price of palm oil was 0816/ton in mid-1974 and the cor-
responding retail price 4926/ton. The price in 1980 used for GOPD financial
projections is 0539/ton millgate expressed in 1974 constant terms. This is
calculated from the world market price estimated by the Bank Economic Depart-
ment, plus a notional tariff protection of about 50% which is assumed to be
needed to afford adequate protection to domestic industry in the absence of
quantitative import restrictions (see Annex 1 and para 7.06).
7.05      Palm kernels produced by the project would be exported through the
Cocoa Marketing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cocoa Marketing
Board. All project palm oil would be consumed locally and marketed through
established wholesalers and retailers. At present there is no established
Government pricing policy for palm oil, and prices are determined by domestic
supply and demand and import controls. Assurances were obtained at nego-
tiations that GOPD would set the initial millgate price for its palm oil at
a level acceptable to Government and IDA and that it would, from time to
tine, consult with IDA on its palm oil pricing policy.
7.06      In calculating project economic benefits, a value for project pro-
duced palm oil equivalent to its import substitution has been used which is
based on the Bank Economics Department's (BED) projected world price of
US$495 per ton CIF Europe in current terms in 1980. Palm kernels have been
valued at an export parity price based on the BED world price forecast of
US$330 per ton CIF Europe in current terms in 1980. The values expressed
in cedis have been corrected by an adjustment factor equal to approximately
50% of the cost, to reflect the scarcity of foreign exchange as indicated
by the severe quantitative restrictions currently imposed on imports. Details



- 20 -
of palm oil and palm kernel prices used in the economic and financial analyses
are given in Annex 1, Appendices 3, 4 and 5.
C. Farmer Benefits
7.07      A typical farm budget 1/ for a 12 ac oil palm holding developed in
two stages of 6 ac each with both stages in production by Year 7 is given in
Annex 9. Production would begin in the fourth year from planting and a base
price of 4 39.00 per ton of ffb, which is the present producer price paid by
SFC, is assumed. The average net benefits per ac per annum over the life of
the plantings would be 4 53 or f 636 for 12 ac; during the debt servicing
period net benefits per ac would average 0 43 or 0 511 for 12 ac. After
net debt servicing benefit per ac would average 0 106 or 4 1271 for 12 ac.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the price paid to outgrowers
would be based on a formula which would at all times be acceptable to IDA,
and that such formula would be prescribed by a committee established by
Government for such purpose.  Said committee would from time to time review
the price paid to outgrowers, and advise GOPD as to the proportion of profits
to be paid as bonuses to outgrowers (para 7.08). Most outgrowers would
combine oil palm cultivation with other food crops and cocoa. The average
farm family should be able to harvest and maintain 12 ac of oil palm requiring
a total of around 146 mandays per annum from Year 14 onwards.
7.08      In addition to the base price, participating outgrowers would
receive a bonus when GOPD profits exceed a certain level. In the GOPD
financial projections, it has been assumed that a bonus would be paid to
outgrowers when GOPD net profit after taxes has exceeded a sum equal to 13%
of net fixed assets (Annex 7, Table 1). On this basis bonuses would equal
4 10/ton of fruit (in 1974 terms) in 1987 and 4 20/ton in 1988. At 4 tons/ac,
bonuses on a 12 ac farm could amount to about ¢ 500 per annum from 1987
onwards. The GOPD profit levels at which bonuses would be paid and the
proportion of profits in excess of such level which would be paid as bonuses
would be agreed between Government and IDA before outgrower holdings came
into production. Assurances to the foregoing were obtained at negotiations.
D.  Financial Return to Ghana Oil Palm Deve lopmrent Corporation
7.09      GOPD projected income statements indicate that operations would
become very profitable in 1983 following 3 years of initial losses totalling
about 0 7.8 million. These losses would be available as a tax credit under
Ghanaian tax regulations so that corporation taxes would not be paid until
1985. In the financial projections the return on net fixed assets has been
limited at about 13% by assuming the payment of bonuses to outgrowers. The
1/   Expressed in constant 1974 terms.



- 21 -
cash position would be satisfactory with annual self generated funds being
more than double debt service after 1982. Payments to Government Consolidated
Fund could start in 1983. The financial position of GOPD would be sound, as
evidenced by the annual debt/equity ratios at Annex 7, Table 3.
E. Project Returns to Government
7.10      Total Government investment in the project would be 4 10.1 million
through 1982 (Annex 11), which would be recovered by 1985. Government bene-
fits would include taxes paid on GOPD profits, contributions to the Govern-
ment Consolidated Fund, and repayment of GOPD loans for field establishment
and the oil mill. There would be a surplus of nearly 0 1.0 million in 1983
and an average surplus of 4 14 million per annum from 1987 onwards.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The direct benefits from investment in the project would be the
increase in palm oil and kernels production that it generates, estimated to
reach 14,000 tons of palm oil and 2,900 tons of kernels annually at full
maturity.  The economic rate of return from such an investment is estimated
at 16.6%. This estimate takes into account all future costs capital and
recurrent and all future production of the project.
8.02      The assumptions used in calculating the rate of return are in
Annex 11. Project life is taken as 30 years, and the costs, yields and
prices are as described in Chapters V and VII and Annex 1. Unskilled labor
on the nucleus plantation has been costed at a shadow wage rate of 65% of
the estimated financial cost to better represent the opportunity cost of
labor. Outgrower family labor is costed at a shadow wage rate of 75% of
the market rate. For palm oil and palm kernel prices, the values expressed
in cedis have been corrected by an adjustment factor equal to approximately
50 of the cost, to reflect the scarcity of foreign exchange as indicated
by the severe quantitative restrictions currently imposed on imports.
8.03      As is usual where project benefits occur after a long development
period, the rate of return is relatively insensitive to changes in costs and
benefits. Thus even in the event of costs increasing by 20% and benefits
declining by 20% simultaneously, the rate of return is 10.6%.
8.04      Project-induced oil production would substitute for imports that
otherwise would be required, and kernels would be exported. The net annual
foreign exchange savings would be about US$5 million at full development.
8.05      The project would sustain and develop an industry generating a
gross income of US$17.0 million annually in what is now a poor and relatively
undeveloped region of Ghana. At maturity outgrowers net income from oil

palm would average at t 520 per family for 12 ac holding after paying for
all inputs, debt service and labor costs or C 720 if all labor requirements
are provided by the family, increasing to C 1,270 and ¢ 1,460 respectively
after debt repayment. This compares very favorably with the present national
per capita income of C 300 for the country as a whole. At full maturity, the
project would provide employment for about 250 farmers and 600 staff and
laborers at GOPD headquarters and in the plantation.
8.06      The project has many unquantifiable benefits.  In particular it
would demonstrate the feasibility of the nucleus plantation approach to
development by establishing an industrial plantation which would provide
services to small outgrowers, and establish an efficient marketing system
for their palm produce.
IX. ASSURANCES OBTAINED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a) Government would promptly take all requisite steps for the
acquisition and retention by GOPD of all land, required to
establish a 10,000 ac Plantation prior to June 30, 1976.
(para 4.06).
(b) Government would ensure that arrangements acceptable to IDA
were made for (a) the engineering and construction of a road
of about 10 miles length in the vicinity of the Nucleus
Plantation and (b) for the maintenance of all roads within
a 15-mile radius of Kwae, but not in the Nucleus Plantation,
to a standard which would enable a seven-ton lorry to use
them at all times (para 4.11).
(c)  Government would inform IDA of any policy changes in respect
of its fertilizer subsidy program (para 5.03).
(d)  Any changes in the financial arrangements between the Govern-
ment and GOPD would be acceptable to IDA (para. 5.09).
(e) Government would provide GOPD quarterly with such funds as
would be required to meet GOPD's budgeted expenditures for
the subsequent 3-month period (para 5.10).
(f)  The Managing Director shall at all times be a person with
qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA (para 6.03).
(g)  Government would ensure that the proprietary interest of
each outgrower in land planted with the assistance of credit
would be defined and recorded with the District Administrative
Officer prior to the loan being made (para 6.06).



- 23 -
(h) The formula for determining the price to be paid by GOPD to
outgrowers for palm fruit would be prescribed by a Committee
appointed for such purpose. The formula would at all times
be acceptable to IDA (para 7.07).
9.02      Assurances were obtained from Government on behalf of GOPD that:
(a) GOPD would employ engineering consultants acceptable to IDA
upon terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA for preparing
bidding documents for the mill equipment and civil wbrks
and for supervising and implementing the construction of
same; financing of the mill extension to 20 ton/hour would
be through GOPD self generated funds (para 4.12).
(b) GOPD would cooperate with Government agricultural research
agencies in field trials with oil palms (para 4.15).
(c) GOPD would obtain IDA's concurrence prior to making any
changes in its lending policy and other arrangements for
outgrowers' credit (para 5.07).
(d) GOPD would obtain IDA's approval prior to effecting any
change in the financial arrangements between Government and
GOPD (para. 5.07).
,e) GOPD financial statements would be audited by a firm of
independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and submitted
to IDA within four months of the closing of the financial
year (para 5.13).
(f) The schedule for replacing expatriate staff would be
reviewed by GOPD from time to time in consultation with
IDA (para 6.04).
(g)  An outgrower loan committee would be established to approve
loan applications (para 6.05).
(h) Credit to an outgrower family would be limited to 20 acres,
except where the family unit comprises a man with more than
one wife and at least 20 dependents, in which case credit
would be limited to 30 acres (para 6.05).
(i) GOPD would set the initial millgate price for its palm
oil at a level acceptable to IDA and would thereafter
consult with IDA on its palm oil pricing policy from time
to time (para 7.05).
(j) The level of profits at which bonuses would become payable
and the proportion of profits in excess of such level which
would be paid as bonuses would be set before outgrowers
holdings come into production and at levels acceptable to
IDA (para 7.08).



- 24 -
9.03      Retroactive financing would be available for GOPD's expenditures
in the first year of development as from June 1, 1974 for not more than
US$600,000; and for the technical assistance to ADB as from July 31, 1974
for not more than US$200,000.
9.04      It would be a condition of effectiveness that:
(a)  Government had acquired and transferred to GOPD not less
than about 3,000 acres of land suitable for oil palm planting
in the nucleus plantation area (para 4.06).
(b)  GOPD had entered into a contract with a plant breeding
consultant acceptable to IDA on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA (para 4.07).
(c)  Financial arrangements, acceptable to IDA, between
Government and GOPD for providing Government and IDA
funds to GOPD had been concluded (para 5.09).
(d)  A person acceptable to IDA had assumed full time the
duties of Managing Director of GOPD (para 6.03).
(e)  GOPD had entered into a contract with consultants experi-
enced in oil palm planting and management acceptable to
IDA on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (para 6.04).
(f)  The form of the loan agreement for outgrowers had been
approved by IDA (para 6.06).
9.05      With the above assurances the project is suitable for an IDA Credit
of US$13.6 million.

GHANA
OIL PALM PROJECT
MARKETS AND PRICES
A. Prospects for the World Palm Oil Market
1.        The world palm oil economy has experienced two sharply contrasting
phases in the past two decades. In the first phase, from the beginning of the
1950's to 1967-69, growth of world production averaged only 1% a year. World
exports grew hardly at all, the rising trend in Malaysia's exports being
neutralized by falling exports from Nigeria and Zaire as a result of declining
production due to political instability and aging trees. As more than 95% of
the exports went to the developed countries, static exports implied static
consumption in these countries, as a whole.
2.        The second phase, from 1967-69 to 1972, has been characterized by
rapid growth with output rising at more than 10% a year. Malaysia's planting
programs began to bear fruit; Indonesia's output increased considerably; in
Africa, the end of civil strife in Nigeria and Zaire set in motion a recovery
of output and the Ivory Coast and Dahomey emerged as important producers, as a
result of the extensive plantations started in 1965. World exports rose by
15% a year from 1967-69 to 1972, far outstripping the growth of output. The
increase in exports came largely from Malaysia and there was also some increase
from Indonesia and the Ivory Coast. In Nigeria and Zaire, the recovery of out-
put was largely absorbed by rising domestic demand, so that exports showed no
increase. The developed countries absorbed the greater part of the increased
exports. Although the palm oil share of world exports of vegetable oils
increased, the price remained comparativelv stable.
3.        Most of the increase in production in recent years was the result
of investment undertaken in the early 1960's in the producing countries,
particularly Malaysia. The important producing countries currently have
plans to expand future production by new plantings and replantings. As a
result of realized and planned development programs, the rapid rate of growth
in production achieved in recent years is likely to continue over the next
decade.
4.        On the basis of the available data on plantings, yield, etc.,
world output in 1980 is estimated at 4,080 thousand metric tons: composed
of about 2,560 thousand metric tons of output available for international
trade and 1,520 thousand metric tons of locally-consumed production. This
represents an annual growth of 8% for total output and about 12% for commer-
cial output.
5.        A statistical analysis of demand, country by country, indicates a
total world import requirement in 19BO of 2,610 thousand metric tons. This
means that demand for imports would be slightly in excess of the anticipated



ANNEX 1
Page 2
world export supplies in 1980. The developed and socialist countries would
account for about 2,150 thousand metric tons, which is 82% of the world im-
port requirement. The non-producing developing countries would account for
360 thousand tons, representing about 14% of import requirement. The producing
countries (Nigeria) would absorb 100 thousand tons, or 4% of imports. Total
world trade, at 2,610 thousand tons, would represent about 64% of the total
output, as compared with 48.7% in 1967-69.
6.        Palm oil's share of total fats and oils consumption in 1980 would
be fairly high --14-16%-- in UK, Netherlands and Belgium, though still below
the share held in these countries in the early 1950's. The proportion would
be moderate --7-10%-- for West Germany, Japan, Canada and the United States,
and low -- below 7% -- for France, Italy and the rest of Western Europe, though
in all cases they would be higher than ever before.
7.        Prices of palm oil have shown no definite trend in either direction
over the past two decades. The basic reason is that palm oil's share in the
world's total fats and oils economy has been small, and the possibilities of
substitution are large in relation to changes in palm oil supplies. Conse-
quently, there has been no abiding pressure or pull on prices of palm oil.
8.        Palm oil's share in total fats and oils is still small, even
smaller than in the 1950's. In view of the projected growth of demand for
palm oil, it is reasonable to expect that the future increase in palm oil
supplies will be absorbed without severe pressure on prices and the real price
of palm oil in 1980 is expected to hold at a level of about $495 per metric
ton. 1/
B. Market Prospects for Palm Oil in Ghana
9.        There are two different uses for palm oil in Ghana:  household use
in cooking and industrial use in soap and margarine manufacturing. Total
estimated production in 1970 was about 20,000 tons of oil, of which house-
holds consumed about 19,000 tons.
10.       Ghanaians buy both palm oil and palm fruit for making soups and
stews. Much of the fruit comes from wild palm groves or small private
plantings, from which the oil is extracted at home. In addition, State Farms
Corporation (SFC) sells palm oil produced by the Asraku mill which is supplied
with fruit from its own Pretsea estate as well as from individual farmers.
Groundnut oil and coconut oil are the main but less acceptable substitutes
for domestically consumed palm oil.
1/   This is the expected current market price in 1980.  It will have to be
deflated to obtain the price in real terms.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
11.       The industrial market consists of one margarine and two soap
factories. In 1972 Lever Brothers Ghana (LBG) purchased about 3,000 of the
4,000 tons of palm oil produced by SFC as part of its requirements for the
manufacture of margarine and other edibles. LBG's soap factory at Tema
presently uses American tallow (purchased under US aid), which is a perfect
substitute for palm oil in soap manufacture. In 1971, 19,600 long tons of
tallow, costing US$3.8 million CIF, were imported. Oils and Fats Ltd. has a
smaller soap factory at Accra, which uses palm oil imported from neighboring
countries; 1971 imports were 2,700 tons, worth $620,000 CIF,
12.       Palm oil production estimates based on rough assumptions regarding
plantings and yields are as follows. As of 1970, oil palm was planted in
pure stands on 36,000 ac, was the predominant crop on 8,000 ac of mixed crops,
and was a subsidiary crop on a further 230,000 ac, but often only in small
amounts. 1/ Of the pure stands, some 11,000 ac were run by State Farms Corpora-
tion (SFC) and 4,000 ac by other parastatal bodies; but only about half of
these 15,000 ac were in bearing, as compared to some 90% for the private
holdings. 2/ Estimates of production are given in the following Table 1 and
are based on average yield assumptions of 2.6 tons of bunches per ac 3/ for
the parastatal plantations, 2 tons for the other pure or predominately oil
palm stands and 0.3 tons for oil palm as a subsidiary crop (based on about
1.5 tons per ac assuming 20% of the land is under oil palm). The resulting
estimated total of about 134,000 tons of fruit bunches in 1970 is in sharp
contrast to an estimate by the Nathan Consortium, covering 1966-68 of 316,000
tons of fruit bunches per year. Although the 1970 Sample Census of Agricul-
ture was not available to the Nathan investigator, the range of these esti-
mates underlines the uncertainty of the data.

13.       It is presumed that where oil palm is a subsidiary crop, it mostly
grows wild, and the fruit is sold to consumers who extract the oil themselves.
Most of the SFC fruit and some from private plantations is processed for
oil at the SFC's Asraku mill. Of this, about 1,300 tons of oil was sold in
1970 to commercial users, leaving about 19,000 tons for household consumers.
14.       Consumer demand should increase at least as fast as population
growth (about 3% per annum), and given reasonable income elasticity of de-
mand, even a 4% growth rate is probably conservative. In addition, trends
in the world market will have a bearing on local consumption. World palm
oil prices are expected to fall during the 1970's relative to those of its
chief substitutes, and with this project (or with import liberalization) one
could expect a relative price change to occur in Ghana. Household consump-
tion is therefore conservatively projected to grow at 6% p.a. to 1980, and 4%
thereafter.
15.       A reduced price for palm oil should also make it competitive with
tallow for soap manufacture. The industrial users estimate their own future
requirements as follows: LBG estimates that, during the 1980's, their
annual oil requirements will be 16,000 tons for soap, with edible oils ris-
ing from 4,000 to about 6,000 tons. Oils and Fats, Ltd. estimates that
4,500 tons would be needed for soap manufacture.
16.       During recent years price increases in the household palm oil con-
sumption market indicate that the local supply of palm oil is not increasing
with demand. SFC sells palm oil by the drum to local traders. During most
of 1972 the price of palm oil in Accra was ¢ 583 per ton (including 024
excise duty at e0.10 per Imperial gallon); in October 1972 it was raised to
0762 per ton and by mid 1974 it was 0926 per ton. Traders then retail the
oil in 1/7 gallon bottles. In 1973 the mean price of these was 00.70, equiva-
lent to 01194 per ton. Import controls prevent the importation of palm oil
for direct consumption, thus enabling these prices to be maintained.
17.       The supply outlook must take into consideration the general belief
that the natural regeneration of wild oil palm trees is not keeping pace with
the loss of trees through age or tapping for palm wine. SFC forecasts that
this source will be inadequate, and is consequently considering expansion
of its plantations by up to 75,000 acres. Excluding these plans, since they
are not yet firm and are subject to Government approval, SFC and other para-
statal bodies will double their output when their present plantings reach
maturity. Assuming that output from private plantings grows at 4% per annum
while output from wild oil palm as a subsidiary crop declines at 2% per annum,
and including the anticipated output of Phase I of the IDA project, Table 2
below gives very rough predictions of the supply and demand imbalance in
Ghana in 1980, 1985 and 1990.

18.       On these assumptions there will be more than sufficient demand in
Ghana for the palm oil output of the proposed project at Kade.
C. Marketing Arrangements and Price Policy
19.       Marketing Arrangements.  All fruit produced on the nucleus planta-
tion and purchased from outgrowers would be processed at the central mill
and palm oil and palm kernels would be sold on an ex-millgate basis. Palm
oil would be sold in drums or transported to distribution centers in bulk
tankers, with appropriate charges added. Kernels would be exported through
the Cocoa Marketing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cocoa Market-
ing Board. As experience is obtained and production increases, an integrated
palm oil marketing structure may be justified, providing commercial expertise
is available to operate at wholesale and/or retail levels.
20.       Pricing Policy.  The policy would aim at establishing millgate
prices for the locally produced oil which would cover all costs of processing
and allow the mill to pay an attractive price to growers.
21.       For the purpose of this project appraisal the financial and eco-
nomic prices for palm oil and kernels have been calculated using the world
market prices projected for 1980 by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Pro-
jections Department (Appendices 3, 4, and 5).

OIL PALM PROJECT
The Agricultural Development Bank
1.        In April 1964, the Bank of Ghana established a Rural Credit Depart-
ment to study the problems of agricultural credit and to prepare legislation,
plans and procedures for an agricultural credit bank. In April 1965, Par-
liament passed an Act (Act 286) to incorporate the Agricultural Credit and
Cooperative Bank. The new bank started operations in 1965, taking over the
assets and liabilities of the Bank of Ghana's Rural Credit Department. In
April 1967, the initial Act was amended by a Decree of the National Libera-
tion Council (Decree 182), and the bank's name was changed to the Agricultur-
al Development Bank (ADB). In January 1971, the initial Act was further
amended (Act 352) to allow ADB to establish by-laws, with prior approval
of the Ministry of Finance, to regulate its operating policies. These by-
laws have not been formulated.
Functions and Objectives
2.        The ADB has four main objectives:
(a) providing credit facilities for the development and/or
modernization of agriculture and allied industries;
(b) identifying and promoting agricultural enterprises in
Ghana whether singly or jointly with persons or
institutions either local or f,oreign;
(c) initiating or participating in research and training to
promote agriculture; and
(d) mobilizing financial and human resources to meet the
development needs in agriculture.
There are no limits to the size of farms or ventures for which ADB provides
credit. Its activities are strictly confined to the agricultural sector
of the economy and to operations closely related to it, such as processing
and transportation. ADB may mobilize funds by accepting deposits on savings,
current or time accounts and borrowing against the security of its assets.
Capital
3.        ADB's authorized share capital is 030 million.  The paid up capital
at June 30, 1973 was 018.5 million, of which the Bank of Ghana contributed
about 30% and Government about 70%.  Government must have at least 51% of



ANNEX 2
Page 2
the outstanding capital. There is no fixed schedule for the paying-in of
capital and the two shareholders agree each year with ADB the amount to be
paid-in during the following financial year.
Management
4.        A board of seven directors representing the Ministries of Finance
and Agriculture, the Bank of Ghana and the Department of Cooperatives, deter-
mines ADB's operating policies. The Chairman of the Board is also the full-
time managing director and he is assisted by an executive director, also a
board member. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the managing director,
who is appointed by Government for five years. ADB accounts are audited by
Amorin, Agyeman, Ayeh and Company, a private firm of chartered accountants
in Accra.
5.        ADB has four departments:  Commercial, Loans, Finance and Adminis-
tration which, in turn, are split into divisions. Each department is under
a Chief Manager responsible to the managing director.
6.        In addition to the Headquarters in Accra, ADB has nine branches
(Kumasi, Koforidua, Tamale, Hohoe, Sunyani, Takoradi, Bolgatanga, Tema and
Cape Coast), and 12 Farm Credit Service Offices 1/ (FACSO) that have been
established to supervise loans. The ADB has no branches or FACSO in the
Kade area; all operations involving loans for oil palm plantings are handled
by Koforidua Branch.
7.        ADB staff on December 31, 1973 totalled 392.  Although many of the
professionals have graduated in agriculture only a few have adequate prac-
tical experience and consequently the technical appraisal of loan appli-
cations is weak. Staff are being trained in the United States under the
sponsorship of USAID (four in 1970/71) and other staff members have already
received degrees either in Great Britain, USSR, USA or Germany.
Volume of Lending
8.        The level of loans granted during the four-year period (1970-1973)
reflects an irregular lending pattern. During the period 1970-1971 the
number of loans increased by 104% and the volume of loans by 90%. The
average loan was t12.3 in 1970 and t11.5 in 1971. In the 1971-72 period,
however, the number of loans increased by only 78% while the total volume
went up by 237% resulting in an average lean of 021.7 for 1972. In 1973
the volume of loans decreased by 39% although the number of loans increased

accounts are kept by the branch. FACSO does not handle cash and cannot
approve loans.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
by 47%, thus reducing the average loan to 09.0. The average loan for the
period 1970 to 1973 is high indicating preference to cater to the credit
needs of larger farmers. The substantial increase in loans granted in 1972
is a result of the "Operation Feed Yourself (OFY) Program," launched by the
Government in February, 1972 designed to increase food production. By June
1972, ADB had received 05 million in special loans (at 2-1/2% and to be repaid
over 24 months), for financing food crop production under OFY. In 1973 loans
for the Program represented about 30% of total loans granted. (Details of
ADB's lending operation are shown in Table 3.)
9.        The breakdown of oil palm loans as of June 30, 1972 was as follows:
Number of               Amount            Amount
Project                       Loans    Acreage  Approved ()   Disbursed (f)

Oil Palm and Citrus             10         324       112,800        56,767.61
Oil Palm and Coconut             7         233        55,800        38,779.11
Oil Palm and Livestock           1           5        21,000           550.00
128      5,527    1,127,041        532,021.49
Interest Rates
10.       Terms and conditions of ADB loans depend upon the tvpe of activity
financed and vary from 6 months for food crops, to 7 years for livestock, and
up to 15 years for tree crops such as oil palm. Up to February 1972, interest
rates varied between 7% and 9% per annum. Since then, however, Government
has ordered all ADB loans bear an interest rate of 6% per annum. Such a
rate entails a high degree of subsidy in view of existing rates of inflation
and the security of financial resources in Ghana.
Security
11.       Security varies with borrowers but is at times non-existent.
Individuals are required to put up collateral; this can be real estate
property but usually only larger farmers can put up such collateral. Coop-
erative societies need not provide any security, as cooperative unions
authorize and guarantee the loans to societies.
Lending Procedures
12.       ADB lending procedures are satisfactory.  Serious inadequacies have
occurred in lendinR and loan supervision including:
(a) use of farmer budgets that overstate cash requirements;



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b) disbursement of loans for payment of casual labor without
real evidence that such labor has been employed;
(c) over-estimation of yields and returns;
(d) scheduling seasonal credit repayments over two years
permanently indebting the farmer when repayment can be
made within one year; and
(e) non-cancellation of surplus loan funds and permitting such
funds to be used for other purposes.
The two consultants under the Sugar Rehabilitation Project financed by IDA
have submitted recommendations to improve lending procedures of ADB. These
recommendations are presently being implemented.
Collection Procedures
13.       ADB's collection procedures are also deficient.  In March 1972,
only 40% of all principal due had been repaid (Table 4). ADB has been very
lax in enforcing repayment collections. In Tamale for instance, although
payments for paddy delivered to rice mills are made to ADB for the account
of the farmer, ADB has been reluctant to deduct from these payments all
amounts owed by the farmer. This has been especially so when sales of paddy
have been small. Also, though legally entitled to do so, ADB has been
reluctant to seize farmers' properties in case of defaults.
Finances
14.       ADB's true financial position has been masked consistently by
inflows of equity funds from Government and the Bank of Ghana; these amounted
to t18.5 million as of June 30, 1973. Since 1972, Government and Bank of
Ghana contributions to ADB have been mainly in the form of loans. Unless
ADB lending and collection procedures are quickly improved, it will be unable
to repay these loans. To determine its true financial position, ADB should
prepare financial statements distinguishing between past loans given for
political and social purposes, and those granted for commercial ventures,
and prepare realistic cash flow projections.
15.       As shown in the following table, private savings mobilization,
although increasing, is a relatively unimportant factor as a source of ADB
funds:

Projections
16.       ADB has made projections of its lending to the end of 1973/74,
these are summarized below:
Projected Lending for the Periods 1972/73 and 1973/74

These projections assume that funds for on lending will come from Government
on concessionary terms. However, given ADB's operating deficiencies, the
services of its funds, and the terms of its borrowing, ADB's financial posi-
tion remains unclear. It is thus most important that ADB should prepare
realistic forecast cash flows, and new projections of future lending, distin-
guishing between loans made on behalf of Government on soft terms, subsidized
through Government lending at concessionary rates to ADB; and its own future
lending at commercial rates, financed by borrowing at commercial rates.

GHANA
OIL PALI PROJECT
Orsanization and Manag ement
A. General
1.        Responsibility for executing the project would be vested in a
statutory corporation, the Ghana Oil Palm Development Corporation (GOPD).
The corporation is a body corporate operating as a commercial entity with
profit making motives, established under the existing Statutory Corporation
Act 232. In the capital structure of GOP'D IDA and Government funds would be
partly invested in equity, the remainder being on-lent for plantation
development, outgrowers' credit and oil mill investments as three separate
loans. The equity is assumed to be initially subscribed by Government but
private or parastatal organizations could be invited to participate at a
later date if the Corporation were made into a limited liability company.
This would require IDA approval.
2.        The Board of the corporation would consist of representatives of
Government agencies, a representative of the Kade District Council and a
representative of the outgrowers (see para 4). The Commissioner of Agricul-
ture would give written directions to the Board on policy relating to the
long term development of the agricultural sector. He would also have the
right to review GOPD's annual budget and amend or recommend changes. Within
these limits the Board would be free to operate autonomously and to formulate
policy in accordance with the corporation's commercially oriented objectives.
However, should gross mismanagement occur, the Commission of Agriculture
may intercede with written directions.
3.        The corporation would be responsible for developing and operating
the nucleus plantation, constructing and operating the palm oil mill and
appraising, supervising, providing credit services and organizing a fruit
collection and credit repayment scheme for outgrowers.
B. The Board - Its CoMp2osition and Functions
4.        The Board of the GOPD would be comprised of the following seven
members:
(i)  a Chairman appointed by the Commissioner of Agriculture
after consultation with the Commissioner of Finance;
(ii) the Director of Agriculture or his representative;



ANNEX 3
(iii)  the Directors of Economic Planning or his    Page 2
representative;
(iv) a representative of the Attorney - General;
(v) a representative of the Kade District Council;
(vi) a representative of the outgrowers; and
(vii) the Managing Director of GOPD.
Each member would have a vote, but in the event of an equal ballot, the
Chairman would have an additional vote which would be considered as decisive.
The Senior Accountant would serve as secretary.
5.        The principal functions of the Board would be to:
(i) formulate policy in accordance with the corporation's
declared objectives and operations;
(ii) approve the capital structure in accordance with the
terms and limitations of its statutory instrument;
(iii)  approve the appointment of key senior management staff
(except for the Managing Director who would be appointed
by the National Redemption Council on the recommendation
of the Commissioner of Agriculture). In the early stages
of the project these appointments would be made through a
contract agreement with an internationally recognized firm
acceptable to Government and IDA;
(iv) approve the organization structure (see Chart) of the
corporation including terms of'staff employment,
delegating full responsibility for implementation to
the Managing Director;
(v) approve the annual development/operational programs
and budgets, delegating full responsibility for
their execution to the Managing Director; and
(vi) approve the annual report and accounts.
The Board would meet four times a year.
C. Management Structure and Senior Staff
6.        Management Structure.  The management structure is shown in the
chart, the main division of function being:



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(i) the establishment and operation of the nucleus plantation
and the palm oil mill; organization of technical training
for the staff and outgrowers; supervision of field trials;
(ii) the appraisal, supervision and provision of credit services
to outgrowers; the collection of outgrowers fruit and the
operation of a credit repayment scheme;
(iii)  financial control including budget preparation, control
of nucleus plantation and outgrower accounts, management
accounting information, internal audit, marketing of
produce and general administration.
7.        Responsibilities and Qualifications of Senior Staff
Managing Director - the chief executive to whom the Board would
delegate full responsibility for implementing the develop-
ment program, recruiting and controlling staff, preparing
plans, annual estimates and progress reports, for individ-
ual sectors of the program. The person appointed should
have at least 10 years' experience at senior management
level with a recognized commercial plantation organiza-
tion, and not less than 5 years' experience of oil palm
planting.
Nucleus Plantation Manager - responsible for implementing
the plantation planting program, preparing budgets and
progress reports, organizing in-service training and
supervising field trials. He would work closely with
the Head of the Outgrowers Section. This man should
have had a minimum of 5 years' experience of oil palm
planting at a senior management level, preferably con-
trolling 10,000 acres or more in West Africa.
Finance Manager - would be responsible for all project
financial controls and procedures including the super-
vision of outgrowers' credit accounts; he would also
serve as secretary and treasurer to the corporation.
Produce marketing and general administration would be
the responsibility of the Finance Manager who should be
a well qualified accountant with at least 5 years' senior
management experience in an acceptable commercial
organization.
Deputy Plantation Manager - would be concerned with the
general coordination of work in the main operational
divisions of the plantation. In conjunction with the
Plantation Manager he would be responsible for prepar-
ing work schedules and budgets, including the phasing
of the main operations and determining the job specifi-
cations, timing and control system to be used in their



ANNEX 3
Page 4
execution. This position would require a person with
an agricultural qualification - degree or diploma - and
10 years' post-graduate experience, preferably with some
time spent on plantation crops.
Head of Outgrowers Section - responsible for the appraisal,
technical supervision and provision of outgrowers'
credit services. His responsibilities would also include
establishing an outgrowers fruit collection system and
a credit repayment scheme. The person appointed should
have at least 5 years' extension service experience and
a practical knowledge of oil palm planting techniques.
Mill Engineer - directly responsible to the Nucleus Plantation
Manager for operating the mill, organizing fruit collection
for the plantation and liaising with the outgrowers' section
on the collection of outgrowers fruit. This man should
have an internationally recognized steam certificate or
equivalent acceptable qualifications and at least 5 years'
experience of running a modern 20 ton per hour mill.
Senior Assistant Plantation Manager - during the first four
years of the project an experienced Senior Assistant
Manager would be required to supervise field establishment
work. He should have had at least 10 years' experience on
large oil palm plantations and should be capable of handling
up to 4,000 ac of clearing and planting in a single year.
8.        The establishment phase of the project is eight years and the key
personnel required to ensure efficient management would be the Managing Director,
the Nucleus Plantation Manager, Finance Manager, Mill Engineer and the Senior
Assistant Plantation Manager. It is doubtful that there are Ghanaian personnel
available with sufficient experience to fill all these key positions. Given
this situation, Government would have to obtain key staff by entering into a
contract with an internationally recognized firm, experienced in oil palm
planting. This contract should include training provisions aimed at the ulti-
mate replacement of all expatriate staff by Ghanaians. Though broad timing
targets should be set, the replacement of key expatriate staff should not be
tied to a fixed period but be based on the assessment of the capacities of
Ghanaian staff available.
9.        The management structure as outlined in the Chart provides "in-
line responsibility" as opposed to counter-parts for key management positions
occupied by expatriates. The establishment of clear lines of authority which
incorporate decision-making responsibilities are necessary for control and
efficiency of operations and would assist in the development of managerial
capacities.



ANNEX 3

C. Credit Arrangement with Outgrowers
10.       GOPD extension and credit staff would appraise the applicants for
for the outgrowers' scheme for both technical and financial suitability.
The applications would be reviewed and loans approved by a loan committee
composed of the head of the Outgrower Section, the Senior Accountant, a
representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, and a representative of ADB,
and chaired by the Nucleus Plantation Manager.
11.       Successful applicants would record their proprietary interest in
land planted with the proceeds of the loan with the office of the District
Administrative Officer, Kade prior to receiving the loan, and would sign a
loan agreement with GOPD. The loan agreement (Appendix 1) would stipulate
the amount, terms, security and conditions of the loan and would obligate
the outgrower to sell his fresh fruit bunches (ffb) from palms planted with
the aid of the loan to the GOPD oil mill. The loan terms would provide for
a grace period of nine years from initial disbursement during which interest
would be capitalized at a rate not less than 8% per annum.
12.       The credit would cover 100% of non-labor inputs sold at cost to
outgrowers, and 80% of estimated labor requirements (which include payment
for some family labor) during the establishment period Year 1 through Year 5.
The disbursements would be made in kind - seedlings, fertilizers, wire-netting--
and cash to cover labor costs and would be scheduled as shown in Table 1.
Table 1
Year of Establishment                  1     2      3      4      5
Maximum Loan/Ac (¢) /1               100.8  99.8  40.7   42.1   46.6
13.       On the basis of the figures in Table 1, the total credit available
over the Period Year 1 through Year 5 would amount to around 0330 per ac.
The credit ceiling would normally be confined to a maximum of 20 ac for any
individual farm family. For a family with a man and more than one wife and
at least 20 dependents the maximum would be 30 ac. Cash credit payments
would be made at the GOPD headquarters or through an account at the out-
growers' chosen bank such as, the Kade area branch of the Ghana Commercial
Bank or the Post Office Savings Bank which has several branches in the area.
Payments whether in cash or kind would only be made after the area had been
inspected and the progress of work assessed.
14.       Outgrowers would be guaranteed a base price currently estimated
at ¢39/ton of fruit in 1974 terms. After making deductions for monthly loan
repayments the outgrower would be paid the balance either in the form of cash
at the GOPD headquarters or in the form of a check, whichever was more con-
venient to the individual concerned. The farmers would also receive a bonus
/1   In terms of end 1974 prices and allowing 5% for physical contingencies.

at the end of the year if GOPD profits have exceeded a certain level of
profits. In cases of bad management or default on repayment, GOPD would
have the right to take over the planting concerned and operate the unit
until the debt has been recovered (see Appendix 1).

GHANA
OIL PALM PROJECT
Calculation of the Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1.        The annual costs and benefits used in calculating the economic
rate of return to the project are given in Table 1 and a summary of the
sensitivity analysis in Table 2.
(a) Project-life
The life of the project is assumed to be 30 years and no
residual value is attributed after that period.  Planting would be completed
by Year 5 with production commencing in Year 6 and all areas at full maturity
by Year 14.
(b) Costs
The costs (including physical contingencies) used in establish-
ment and operation expenditure estimations are those shown in Annex 6 but
with the following adjustments:
i)   the price contingency provisions for inflation used in
the Financial Analyses are excluded;
ii)   identifiable taxes and duties are excluded;
iii)   unskilled labor on the nucleus plantation has been
costed at a shadow wage rate of 65% of the estimated
financial cost. Employment opportunities are limited
in the Kade area and there is alternative employment
for only the eight months (mid-May - mid-Jan.) on the larger
cocoa and oil palm farms.
iv)   outgrower family labor is costed at a shadow wage rate
of 75% of the market rate. Family labor appears to be
fully employed from end-April, planting crops, to mid-Jan.
Hired labor is not employed for planting. It is estimated
that 50% of outgrower labor will be hired labor. This
gives an average shadow wage of 70% of the market rate.
v)   foreign exchange is shadow priced at 52% above the
official rate because the official exchange rate does
not adequately reflect the balance between prices of
domestic and imported goods;



ANNEX 11
Page 2
vi)   full account is taken of the costs for marketing palm
kernels for export. Project palm oil ex-millgate is
valued at the import substitution price in drums cif
Tema less the estimated transport cost Tema to mill site.
(c) Benefits
(1) Yields and Outputs
Yields and outputs used in the calculations are given
in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 8 and para 7.01 of the text.
(ii) Prices
Returns have been calculated by using palm oil and kernel
values based on prices forecast for these commodities by
the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Department
as given in Annex 1. The economic values ex-millgate
for palm oil and kernels are given in Annex 1, Appen-
dices 3 and 4.
(iii) Foreign Exchange
The value of project palm oil is treated as foreign ex-
change savings and the value of kernels as foreign ex-
change earnings. The net annual foreign exchange
savings would be about US$5 million at full develop-
ment.

120                   80                            10.6
From the analysis it can be seen that a 10% increase in costs
with benefits unchanged reduces the rate of return by about 1.4%.
Even in the event of cost increasing by 20% and benefits declining
by 20% simultaneously, the rate of return is 10.6%.
