PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1267-YAR)
PREFACE
This Le the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Highway
Project in the Yemen Arab Republic, for which Credit 1267-YAR in the amount of
US$18.0 million was approved on June 17, 1982. The Credit was closed on June
30, 1988, three years behind schedule. The total amount disbursed was US$5.9
million and the remaining US$0.3 million was cancelled.   The Project was
cofinanced by the Arab Fund.
The PCR was prepared by the Highway Authority of the Yemen Arab
Republic with an Evaluation S-mmary by the Infrastructura Operations Division,
Country Department III of the Africa Regional Office. It is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and cofinancier on September 22, 1989 for
comments by November 3, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1267-YAR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Background
1.       The attached Fourth Highway Project Completion Report (PCR), Credit
1267-YAR, is the first PCR prepared entirely by the Highway Authority (HA), the
semi-autcnomous road agency which operates under the Ministry of Transport and
Public Works. It is one in a series of five transport-related projects financed
by IDA (four roads; one port).  The Third Highway Project (Credit 794-YAR) had
been devoted almost exclusively to institution building and contained substantial
technt-al assistance and training components.  Its success is reflected in the
high level of competence of HA staff.  The Fourth Highway Project was financed
jointly by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and IDA.
The harmonization of the procurement procedures of the two cofinanciers proved
difficult for the implemnE,ting agency under the prevailing joint financing
arraanwements.  Future projects will thus rely cro parallel financing, which
permits the independent application of different procurement procedures within
the same project (R:R paras. 1.01-1.09).
2.       This Evaluation Summary is accompanied by a PCR which use* the old PCR
format.  OED agreed to this procedure as the PCR was completed in December of
last year. Additional information (covering the period from December 1986 to
March 1989) is included in this summary.
Objectives
3.       The two most important project objectives identified at the time of
appraisal were: (a) the establishment of a gradual road strengthening program;
and (b) the improvement of the management and administration of the transport
sector. At the time of appraisal in 1982, YAR already possessed an important
asphalt main road network (1600 km). This network was designed for an 8-ton axle
load but was subjected to considerable overloading. Following a consultant
report (1979) confirming this overloading and demonstratig that a 13-ton axle
load would minimize total costs of transport, YAR established a legal 13-ton axle
load and embarked an the still ongoing road-strengthening program. While the
first objective, to improve the roads in YAR, was proceeding on schedule, the
administration of the transport sector under the recently established (1981)
Department of Tr-ansport (DOT) was encountering serious difficulties. Different
transport agencies reported to different ministries with little or no
accountability to DOT. The need for reforms which would more clearly define the
role of POT and clarify accountability and lines of communication was evident.



- VI -
The specific project components designed to deal with these issues were (a) an
asphalt overlay and flood protection for the major Taiz-Al Mafraq road (61 km);
and (b) organizational and policy studies, as well as technical assistance, to
implement reforms defining the future role of DOT (PCR paras. 2.01-2.04).
Implementation ExPerience
4.       The IDA credit became effective on August 19, 1983, after a one- year
delay. The delay was causv-d by the different appraisal schedules of the two
financing institutions, 0)A having appraised the Project in January 1982, AFESD
in February 1983, and the ensuing delay in fulfilling the two conditions of IDA
Credit effectiveness, namely approval of a civil works component (Taiz-Al Mafraq
road),  and the appointment of the supervision consultants.   This delay
underscores the importance for cofinanciers to reach an early understanding on
a processing schedule, including the likely timing of effectiveness, before IDA
appraisals take place. Since its experience with the Fourth Highway Project,
IDA has tried to ensure that such an understanding is reached on all its proposed
credits (PCR para. 4.01).
U.       The closing date of the credit was extended three times, each delay
covering one year. These extensions resulted from the one-year delay in crc-._t
effectiveness, as well as from the unexpectedly long time it took to reach a
decision on the reorganization of DOT. The civil works component was completed
on time in February 1986.  The draft study (1935) for the reform of the
administration of the transport sector was aLso on schedule.  This  tudy,
"Review of Structures and Functions of the General Secretariat of Transport
Affairs" (GSTV) proposed the establishment of a new Ministry of Transport, with
all transport-related agencies reporting to it. This proposal was carefully
reviewed by the Borrower through a commission appointed for this purpose; a final
version was agreed to with IDA in October 1986. The Cabinet gave its approval
for the establishment of a new, joint Ministry of Transport and Public Works
(MTPW) in early 1988. The People's Assembly, after a hiatus for parliamentary
elections in May 1988, ratified the establishment of the new MTPW on August 2,
1988 (PCR paras. 4.03-4.07).
6.       Thus, one of the main goals of the project, the improvement of the
management of the transport sector through the establishment of the MTPW, was
accomplished. However, the MTPW was established at the end of the project, when
no further extension to the IDA credit was possible.   Presently, the MTPW
operates quite satisfactorily but without the benefit of the technical assistance
and training included in the project. The MTPW has requested inclusion and
financing of these components under the ongoing Fifth Highway Project (Credit
1413-YAR), and this request is under consideration by IDA (PCR para. 4.09).
DOT was changed to GSTA in 1984.

7.       As a result of the fierce competition among contractors in the Gulf area
caused by a slump in constrs'-tion activity as a result of the drop in the price
of petroleum, the civil       cost less than estimated and led to a savings of
SDR 1.0 million in the credit. HA requested the use of these savings, together
with US$5.0 million still undisbursed under the AFESD loan, to strengthen the
road beyond Mafraq toward Hbdeidah. IDA, unfortunately, could not accede to this
request because these works were not included in the original project. Hbwever,
IDA did accept using these savings to acquire equipment, spares and materials
for the important repairs needed on the Taiz-Al Mafraq road after the floods of
April/May  1987.    Foliowing a  feasibility and design  study  prepared  by
consultants, the FESD financed the strengther.ing of the road from Mafraq to Hays
(106.5 km). On March 31, 1989 the credit was closed (over three and a half years
later than originally anticipated), and a small unused amount of SDR258,538.74
was cancelled. PFESD also cancelled KD388,15t an December 31, 198E (PCR paras.
4.04-4.08).
8.       Mbst major project covenants were complied with.'           Successive
improvements in the HA Maintenance Department and regular budgetary increases
(3%. per year in real terms; YR25.0 million in 1984 against YR6O.0 million in
1989) have ensured a high level of maintenance.   The Borrower provided
satisfactory annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors within six
months after the close of its fiscal year; the final report was completed on June
14, 1988 for the year 1987. The staff time given to project supervision, 42
manweeks, was considered adequate (PCR para. 4.10)
Results
9.       The project objectives were exceeded under the road strengthening
program: 167 km against 61 km, or 275% of the original target. The establis!h,ment
of the MTPW was an important institutional success, and its favorable impact on
the coordination of the transport sector is already visible. The technical
assistance and training programs for al I MTPW departments and agencies were well
defined in the GSTA study, but as mentioned in para. 6 above, could not be
implemented under the project. A decision on the possible financing of MTPW
training and technical assistance under the Fifth Highway Project financed b,
IDA is expected soon.
10.      HA completed the PCR in December 1988, prior to the closing of the
credit account on March 31, 1989. Few changes in the text are needed. The
Borrower may wish to prepare a revised FCR, in which case a copy will be sent
to OED with a covering memo indicating substantive changes, if any.
A  Particularly important was compliance with Section 4.02 of the Credit
Agreement dealing with road maintenance.



- vlSi -
11.      The eccnomic rate of return has been recalculated using the original
estimates of traffic and traffic growth, the original estimates of SAR vehicle
unit operating cost savings, and the actual, lawer civil works costs.  Using
these assumptions, the rate of return is estimated to have increased from 3=/.
to over 4C/., with a first-year rate of return of 2R.. Although traffic data for
the YAR road network are limited, they do indicate that traffic growth rates an
the Taiz-Al Mafraq road have been some 30% lower than estimated at appraisal.
Consequently, the PCR economic reevaluation overstates the case. Sufficient
information is not available to recalculate all the economic indicators.
However, if benefits are adjusted to take account of lower traffic growth; the
flood avoidance benefits are omitted; and if the actual contract price is used,
the cost/benefit ratio becomes about 1.66. This compares with 1.76 at appraisal
and the PCR figure of 2.55.   Although other recalculated indicators would
probably need to be adjusted accordingly, the project would still remain
economically viable. The obvious need to improve data collection, especially
traffic information, is being addressed under the Seventh Highway Project (Credit
1848-YAR) by strengthening the Planning and Traffic Department of the Highway
Authority.   No rate of return was calculated for technical assistance and
training (PCR paras. 7.01-7.02).
Sustainability
12.     The project laid the foundation for an important road maintenance
program, which has evolved into a commendable, major activity -f the HA. About
900 km of road have been overlayed, with the remaining 700 ' } scheduled to be
completed by 1995. Mbreover, through the establishment of the MTPW, the project
has helped promote coordination within the transport sector.  The complete
success of the project will be assured with the implementation of the technical
assistance and training which the MTPW needs.
Lessons
13.      The project confirms lessons learned from previous projects about the
difficulty of developing effective transport institutions. The creation of su h
institutions usually involves substantial risk and serious problems in terms of
time overruns, disbursement delays and partially implemented components.  The
Borrower, IDA and MTPW took that risk and, with their persistent efforts the MTPW
was successfully established.
14.      A one-year delay in Credit effectiveness was primarily due to slowniess
in meeting the cofinancing conditions of cross-effectiveness.  An attempt to
prevent this happening again has resulted in recommendations that (a) conditions
of effectiveness be simplified to the extent possible commensurate with achieving
project objectives; and (b) all conditions of cross-effectiveness, and an action
plan for meeting these conditions, be formally agreed upon between borrower and
lenders prior to appraisal (subject to the approval of their Board of Directors);
this particularly applies to cofinancing arrangements.
15.     Project design and flexibility clearly have an impact on project
implementation. Narrowly defined project components do not allow the latitude



- lx -
necessary to make ecanomically valid modifications in project scope.  It is
therefore recommended that the project compments and credit documents be
designed to support the overall sector strategies of the Borrower and IDA. While
critical policy and institutional covenants may need to be more narrowly defined,
the project compaoent description and regulation of the use of credit proceeds
should provide flexibility. This would permit the Borrower, in agreement with
IDA and other lenders, to more easily meet its changing needs.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1267-YAR)
I   INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01.    Yemen Arab Regublic (YAR) has an area of
about 195,000 km with a population of more than 11 million
people widely dispersed. It is located in the South West
corner of Arabian peninsula and is bordered to the north
and east by Saudi Arabia, to the South by people's
Democratic Republic of Yemen and on the West by the Red Sea.
The Country han undergone rapid and far reaching changes
in its Socio-economic structure and the material welfare
and outlbok of its citizens since 1960. Siune the very
outset, the Government has placed greater emphasis on the
development of the transport system, particularly roads,
in order to achieve polltical integration of the country,
moblize domestic production resources and raise the
standard of living of its peopleo It has implemented
Three year Development Plan 1973-75, First Five Year
Development Plan 1976-80, Second Five Year Development
Plan 1981-85 and is Currently implementing Thlrd Five Years
Plan 1986-90.
1.02.     rn line with Government policy and the objectives of
Five year Development Plan- Fourth Highway Project was
formulated. The Project had two main objectives described
under:
i) to continue support of the selective main road
strengthening program initiated under the Third Highway
Project (CIEDIT 794-YAR) and
ii) to improve- the management and administration of
the transport Sector.
1.03.     With the rapid growth with-.in a very short period,
traffic volumes and loadings increased on existing road
network abnormally requiring road strengthening measures
in order to protect the assets. Besides improvement of
management skill s and administration of the transport
Sector, due to changing circumstances, becosne,still more
crucial



-2-
1.0'. The rational allocation of scarce investment
resources is an issue facing almost all the
Developing Countries and Yemen Arab Republic is no
exception. The Government has been wise in deciding
to spend a sizeable chunk of available funds in
maintaining and strengthening existing roads without
ignoring the requirements of construction of new roads.
1.05.    Development of modern transport infrastructure in
YAR started in the late 1950s and underwent major
growth in the two following decades. The basic network
which was so established was a primary factor in YAR's
devolopment and received further impetu X during the.
formu1ationthe- 1976-1980 Five-Year Development plans
The rapid pace of physical development brought to the
fore a compelling need for the parallel strengthening
of institutions reponsible for planning, management,
maintenance and offective use of the infrastructure.
Meeting this need has been the focu8.. of IDA activity
in transportatioz..
1.06.    IDA supported YAR9s highway system development underthe
first three   highway projects (Credits 315-YAR 558-YAR
and 794-YAR) by assisting in the establishment of an
efficient Highway Authority, improvements in the primary
and secondary road networks serving agriculture and
the main ccumercial centers, and in setting the stage
for improving maintenance capability. The project under
review was IDA*s operation in the YAR; and
the fifth in the country's transport sector, preceded
by three highways and one port project. In addition to
its own comunitmonts, the World bank Group also assumed
an important role through its projects as a catalyst in
securing co-financing from other lenders.
1.07.    This report is based on the:
(a) .tppraisal Report, Credit Agreement and Supplemental
letters;
(b) reports of IDA project supervision missions;
(c) progress reports by the Highway Authority (HA);
(d) the Bank's correspondence files and disbursement
records; and
(e) discussions with YAR officials and IDA staff
involved in the project.
Subsequent to the Fourth Highway Project whlich is the
subject of this completion report, IV^A extended three
more projects to assist YAR's transport sector. All of
these projects were for highways viz Fifth highway Project,
Credit 1413-YAR, FY83; Sixth Hlighway Project,
iarib-Safir Road Project, Credit 1726-YAR, FY87 and
Seventh Highway Ilroject Credit 1848-YAR FY88.

1.08.  'rhese Projects reflect GoverNments concern on
maintaining existing assets including rehabilitation

1.09.    The iroject t:as cofinanced by Arab F&mnd for
Economic and Social Covelopment, liuwait from a loan
of KU 2.10 million particularly for Asphalt Overlay
of Road from Taiz to AlMafraq (61 km) and beyond.
The Arab Fund like IDA was interested in participating
in the road strengthening and rehabilitation works in
Yemen and this Project was the beginning. Later on
Arab Fund participated in either fully financing or
cofinancing the following road strengthening Projects:
i) Sanala Taiz Road Strengthening Project
256 km (cofinanced)
ii) Sana'a Hodeidah Ro&d Rehabilitation Project
231. km Foreign Cost fully financed.
ii4) Zabid Hodeidah Road Rehabilitatlon Project
84 km Foreign Cost fully financed.

II PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL
AND NEGOTIATIONS
A Origin
2.01         The project was an outgrowth of the First, Second and Third
Highway Projects, and a direct link in the sequence of IDA operations
in YAR's Highway and Transport Subsector.   Its main thrust was on
maintaining   and   strengthening   existing   road  assets   and   on
institutional  development  of  the Department  of  transport.   IDA's
involvement was in response to a request for a Fourth Highway Project
expressed by the Minister of Public Works and Chairman, Highway
Authority  and  a   formal   request   by   YAR's   Central   Planning
Organisation. In order to meet the cofinancing requirement a similar
request was made by the Government to the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development.
B Preparation
2.02         Preparation of the Fourth Highway Project was started in March
1980. The IDA identified the following items to be included in the
preparation of the proposed subject:
(a)     asphaltic  overlay and  flood  protection works for Taiz
AlMafraq Road (61 km); and
(b)     technical  assistance  in the  form of  experts  to  fill
positions   in  the  newly  established  Department  of
Transport to enable the Department to play its central
role in the management and administration of the Sector.
on this basis an IDA project identification mission visited YAR
in September, 1979 and outlined a project aimed at road strengthening
and institutional development of the Department of Transport.
2.03         A preappraisal mission by IDA visited YAR in January, 1981 and
project preparation was completed in consultation with concerned
Goverment organisations and departments in September, 1981.
C Appraisal and Negotiations
2.04         The Project was appraised by an IDA mission which visited the
YAR (November 20-December 2, 1981) for this purpose. Similarly the
Arab Fund appraisal mission also visited YAR in February, 1983 to
undertake appraisal of the project. A site visit was also organised
to the road proposed to be strengthened.  In view of the cofinancing
availability it was possible to proceed further on the project.
About US$7 million (SDR6.2 million) was proposed as IDA allocation
and KD2.1 million as Arab Fund contribution. The balance was to come
from YAR local cost contribution.



-5-
2.05     Nogotlations with the Government for the IDA Credit
took place in Washington betwoen 24-25 May 1982. The
Qowernesta of YAR was represented by H.E. Abdullah

2.07      The Credit Agreement 3as signed for an amount of
SDR 6.2 million on 11 Aug 1982 and the closing was set
at 30 June 1985. The date for effectiveness was specified
an 11 Nov 1982with conditions that:

III k'liC'JECT OSSCHIPTION
O. Oblectives
;.01         The Project had two major objectives :
(i) to continue support of the seloctive main
road strengthening program initiated under
the Third Highway Project and
(ii) to improve the management and administration
of the transport sector.
B. Description
3.02          The project comprised of .
(1) asphaltic overlay and flood protection works
for the Taiz -Al Mafrq road (61 Wm);
-and trai ni 
Ui) technical assistance  n the formorf experts to
fill key positions (n the recently-established
Department of Transport at the Ministry of
coumunications and Transport to enable the
Department to play its central role in the
management and administration of the sector.
c.   Road Strensthening
.0.03.        The Taiz-idl l1afraq road (map) located in the
south of the country is a key link in the main road network,
and part of the international route that follows the Red Sea
littoral and leads to the-people's Democratic Republic of Yemen
The roac linking A1 Kafraq to the  iport of Mokha, was recently
completed to paved standirds. The project road was reconstructed
and upgraded from the original gravel/earth road in 1976 under
IDA'S Second Highway Project; the pavement was completed witb.
as double surface treatment under this firstatage of construction
Since then, permissible axle-loading in Yemen has been raised
from 8 to 13 tonnes and pending the completion of weighing
stations, actual loads often exceed the new limit. Mloreover,
traffic flows have increased faster than anticipated at the
time the reconstruction vas designed (1975). In 1981, counts
show two distinct flow levels, km 3-23 (the village of Hajda)
at 3,200 vpd (20% trucks) and km 23-63 (Al Hafraq) at about
2,000 vpd (25% trucks).
3.04.         As a result, the pavement had been subjected to
intensities and frequencies of loading beyond its design its
design, capability. Hence, despite a reasonable maintenaceefforts,
recent deterioration had been rapid and destress was evident
in many locations, particularly in the east-bound lane where
vehicles coming from the ports were more heavily laden.

/ (wearing course)
3.05        The consultani carried out ca deflection survey of
the road at the end of the wet season in mid-July 1981
(when deflections are exP ctd to be greatest), and on the
basis of this survey and  he-forecast traffic, prepared an1
)verlay design callinS fo4 a 10 cm asphaltic concrete carpet
over the road's 7 m widtl ,from hm 3-37, and thereafter, 8 cm
of over).ay from km 37-63. The shoulders of the road (l.oO-l.  m
each)h.Pjuld be raised accordingly with selected material.
D  Flood Protection and River Traginin  Works
3.06        The need for the flood protection and river
drainage works to be constructed resulted from damage inffllzt-00
to the road and its environs by a torrential downpour which
occurred in the catchment area of the Jabal ilabah on April &A,
1980, and was followed by persistent rains in the next few days.
Where the road and river run parallel, and in particular¶, between
km 19 and km 2. from Tai, damase was most severe and was
concentrated in about `3 locations but mostly in the vicinity
of-and including the village of Hajda.Roak7 -filled gabious
protecting the road embankment at bends is the river we"
undermined and subsided leading to partial collaQse of those
embankments. Culverts carrying stormwater from the mountain
catchments were filled with debris and rubble so that storm
flows crossed the road, scouring the shoulders and paVement.
The flood problems in the area wore clearly not fores*ee by the
road's initial designers who planned against a ten-year fLood,
but- wter,_-tamre4-3w-aa almost'total lack of suitable bydrological
and rainfall.data1 Some repairs have been carried outs but thse
main effort of rebuilding and strenSthening the protective
wo.ks uill be undertaken under this project.
B  Techincal Assistance
3.07         The approach to institution-building under the
project replicates the arrangements that evolved under the
earlier highway projects and produced satisfactory results at
acceptable costs, i.e. to use foreign consulting firms to develop
the concepts, programs and working systems and then to follow-up
by providing qualified individuals to fill the positions
essential for their implementation. Accordingly, consultants
study was to make detailed recommendations on: (i) the role
the newly established Department of Transport should play in the
administration and management of the see tor; and
(ii) Crga;mzationixl and policy options to increase the
efficiency of-the road transport industry and to lower road
transport-a*.t.#*          About seven experts were provided
under the project to serve in executive positions for about
18 months and help .iith implementing these recommendationst
including: draftin: any necessary legislation and regulations;
setting up an agreed data collection system to serve as a
basis for forecasting future traffic and to monitor transport
costs and prices; implementing agreed reforms of the. road
transport industry; advising the modal agencies the departments
jurisdiction (,orts,airports, national airline, and road
transport companies), on the evaluation of investments

and operational policy options in accordance with agroed
guidelines; and setting up a systefi for reviewing investment
proposals by these agencies in the frame work of a comprehencive
transoprt planning approacK.The details of the technical
a.*d tu5uuS    liassianceprogram was required to be agreed with Government
once thc relevant studies were available.
F      EnSineerin"
3.o8        The second stage of construction of the Taiz-Al
Nafraq roace was designed by the consultants Kam .sex/8erger
in 1977. The overlay of the first 3 km from Tai was included
in the Third Highway l'roject in line with their recouuendations,
but.the remainder was deferred. However, because of the higher
than expected increase in truck traffic since that time, H.h.
retainod.the consultant SWECO to review the overlay design
before submitting the project to the Association for appraisal.
3.09.        SWECO also carriod out the design vf the river-
d.A*&aS   and flood protection works along critical sections of
the road where it runs parallel to the wadi Habasho In this
task, they were given invaluable  assistanceo.by 1U.A. which
made available an 'on-the-spot* report of the 1980 flooding

is given in Tables 3.1 and 32e. These estimates were later
on revised andthe total cost of the project was estimated
at US : 18.78 million.
The project was financed by IDA, ;.rab PFud

to Improve its working. The Consultants recommended
establishment of Mistry of Transport so that all m-odes
of transport are brought within the fold of one Ministry.
These recommendations were studied by the Government who
agrood to establish Ministry of Transport and Public Works
In August 1988. The organisation chart of the Ministry of
Transport is attached with this report. It is more or l-ea
In line with the reco mmedations of the Consultants and
requiremonts of the Govermoent.

on the type of training required for them. However all the
Issues related to their training were sorted out and 20 people
were Choosen to undergo 4 months training in rotation in
Egypt and other Countries.
H. Technical Assistance to Department
of Trans2ort
4.09     In view of the establishment of Mlkaistry of 'rransport
it was decided to defer the requiremeut of Technical
Assistance to Department of Transport and prepare a fresh
request for tochnical assistance needs of the Ministry of
Transport. Further action is in handin the matter. It is
expected that First Transport Project of IDA would Include
the technical assistance needs of the Ministry.
I   Auditing
4.10     The development Credit Agreement specified auditing
of the project-accounts by indopendent audit .ors. During
negotiations it was agreed by IDA that Yemen Contral
Auditing Organisation was acceptable to IDA for this purpose.
Auditing of the project accounts was regularly undertaken
every year by independent auditors and reports submitted to
IDA accordingly. The last report submitted was for 1987.
J   Procurement of Road Maintenance
EquiPmont. Materials & Spares
4.11      With the agreement of IDA, international competitive
bidding was undertaken to procure road maintenance
equipment, materials and spares essentialey required for
HA. Although in the original Credit agreement no such
category existed but IDA agreed on the request of the
Government to allow this essential procurement from the
Wavings of the Credit. The list of items being procured
and their total cost is shown in Table 4-1.

with the actual Is displayed in the Chart. Orignally the project
wa expected to be completed by 30 June, 1985 about 3 Years
after the signature of the credit agreement.



-16-
Actual implementation took almost twice as long. There were
three exthnaions upto 30 Jun. 1988. Books were kept opened
upto 31 March 1989 to procure equipment, material and spares
already committed before the closing of the Credit.Another
reason for the three extensions was the time taken by the
Government in establishment of Ministry of Transport. The
credit effectivoness was delayed by 9 months. The road.
strengthening work was cumpleted in time from the date the
work was stax6de Fellowships for Department of Transport took
smetime. before fializing the number of persons to be trained
and the type of training to be iupartevd Sometime was also
spent in getting agreement of IDA to utilize balance tuG for
Procarement of road mainteance equipment, matorials and spares
essentially required by HA. The studles of the Consultats for
Department of Transport was undertake in tine.
5.04      The last disbuwrment under the Credit is expected
to be made before 31 March 1989. The total disbursement Is
expected to reacb SDR 6.2 million with no cancellation. Details
of annual disbnrsemat are given in Table 5.2. Originally It
was estimated at the time of appraisal that the entire
disbursement shall be completed in 1984 calender year. In actual
the first disbursement started in 1984. Hence about 44 percent
of the total amount wore disbursed in 1984. More dotails are
given in Basic Data Sheet of the Project. Similarly the last
di*burseent. of Arab Fund Loan was done in  May 1988 . The total
amount utilized was ED 1.711,845. A sum of KD 388,155 was
cancelled as unutilized. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 show the disburament
details of IDA Credit and Arab Fund Loan Categorywisee

VI INSTITUINONAL DZVtLOPMENT
6.01    The main thrust of-the Project was institulonal
development of transport subsector especially the Department
of Transport. The epproach was similar to the previous projects
in which attention was givon to institutional developmeht of
HS. Consultants study was requirod to make detailed recommenda-
tions oan the role of the newly established Department of '
Transport and organizational and policy options to increase
the efficiency of the road transport industry and to lower
rood transport rates. Some experts were provided to serve in
executive postions and help in implmenting those recoo endatious
ialUdw4a drafting any necessary legislation and regulatlons;
setting up an agreed data dollection systes to serve an a basis
for foreasting future traffic and to amitor transport costs
-and prices; implemeting agreod refoms of the road transport
iu stry; advising the moAal agencies, etc. The details of
technical assistance program was to b- agreed.with the
Government after the Consultants study was available.
6.02    At the time of appraisal ports and Highways we" under
Ministry of Public Works whlle Airpots, Yemenia, Civil Aviation
and road Traport were under Ministry of Counications. There
was no coordination In various modes of tra.port . Based on
the recomsendation of the Consultants the Government declded
to set up Ministry of Transport in which all modes of transport
were brought under the fold of ous Ministry for coordinated
development transportation sector. This was much needed and
highly desireable institutional development sachieved under the
Fourth Highway Project. The organisation chart of the new
Ministry is attached with this report. By its eatabllahment, the
Government has provided more than that originally envisaged under
the project.



-18-
6.03    Under the project, trainig of the personnel of
Department of Transport was also achieved 20 persons have beon
selected to under go training in various fields related to
their work in Egypt and other Countries. Hence much needed
requirement of tho Department has been met. As for posting
ot Experts undor Technical Assistance, it was thought appropriate
to review over all situation and requirmeuts of Mlnistry of
Traswport and make a separato request under a now IDA project
to meet the neods. The activities of HA institutions and
balance botween construction and maintenance were continuously
wmitored. In order to strengthen the HA MaintenAnce Division
especially for maintaining the road strengthened under the
projects IDA agreed to the a.ver         bequest f4rttltmiug
dirPlus fdos low -procurement of mameh needad road mainteance
equipm ets materials and spares* A system of separate audititg
the accouts of the project by indopendent auditior acceptable
to IDA was also established and yearly audit repents were
furnashed to IDA regularly.
VII ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. A-_*imal Pro:lections
7.01           At the appraisal of the Fourth Highway Project,
quantitative analysis of economic returns were carried out for
two elements Tais Km 64 road pavement strengthening and drainage
& flood protection works. These works represented 76.44 percent
of the project's capital costs. The other doleoent of Transport
including studies by Consultants. In this case economic
benefits cannot be directly quatified in economic torms, even
though the outlays can be justified as important factors
contributing to the institutional development of transport
sub sector.



-19-
7.02      The economic justifications of road strengthening
and drainage protection works wore calculated separately
for sections between km 3 to 37, km 37 to 63 and drainage
and flood protection works. These are shown in Table No 7.1.
The economic rato of return cauwe to 39% for the first section,
33% for the socond section and 16% for drainage and flood
protection works using 15% discount ratoe
The benefit cost ratios were 1.97, 1.73 and 1.03 respectively.
The combined economic rate of return was 33% and benefit cost
ratio was 1.76 and the first year rate of return was 18%.
B Recalculation of Economic Returns
The ecoamic rate of return for thO Project was recalculated
kepi  the economic benefits name but after chan#Mg the
cost of the constructlon works as per actuals. The revised
figures of economic  naJlysis are illustated in Table 7.1.
he -economic rate of return was found to be more than 40%
The benefit cost ratio was equal to 2.55 and the first year
return worked out to be 28% for the construction works
including drainage & flood protection works. Hence the project
has shown groat beneflts and higher returns as compared to
that envisaged at the time of appraisal.

VIII COVENTANTS (F vt E CREDIT %GAL@!NT
8.01     The Borrower's compliance with its obligations
under the Credit Agreement was good as per project's
implementation record. Although the implementation
took longer than originally scheduled, the project
was carried out with duc diligence and efficiency.
Funds we e provided as and when required.
8.02      Covenants concerning the Credit were fully implemented.
The loan from the Cofinancier, Arab Fund for Economic
and social Development was signed and ratified by the
Vleople's Assembly. The Borrofer maintained separate
accounts and records of the project which was duly audited
every year by idependent auditors. Copies of Audit reports
were furnished to IDA. The Borrower announced establishment
of ?iinistry of Transport & Public Works thus met the
requirements concerning organizational improvement. A11
actions wsere adequate and obligations complied with in
reasonable time. The Project completion report was
prepared by HA.
IX  SU)IARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A   Performagce of the Borrower
9.01      Performance of the Borrower audits executing agency,
HA , when measured in terms of accomplishments under
the project, has been very good. HA had a clear sense
of mandate and objectiVes. It wfas positively committed
from the very outset to the tangible elements of the
project. The Borrowter also provided full support to
institution building and policy objectives of the project
and established Ministry of Transport accordingly.
Funds provided from the national sources were adequate.
EA readily took the lead to initiate actions needed and
to address issues in project implementation.
9.02      On the request of the Borrower savings in the project
were allowed to be utilized for procurement of maintenance
equipment, materials and spares very essential for HA
to continue its maintenance activities especially for
Taiz Al Mtafraq Road. Training of about 20 Yemeni staff
of Department of Transport in Egypt and other Countries
were also approved and a program chaked out. Hence all the
objectives of the project were fully achieved.



-21-
B.  Performance of the ..ssociation
9.0,      rerformance of IDo in successful implementation
of the project was equally -ood. It recognized the
need to make qruick approvakls of any changes required
in the Credit Agreement in order to solve problems during
implementation. Two such importanit changes were increase
in financing of road project from 50 to 62 percent and
a-reement to procure road maintnance equipment, materials
and spares for HA from the savings of the project: However
it did not agree to the earlier request of the Borrower
for utilizin- the balance funds of the Credit for continnin-
road Strengthening work beyond AlMafraq (km 64.) towards
Hodeidah stating that it would amount to a different project
beyond the Scope of present project scope and objectives.
9.04      IDA kept on pressing the Borrower for estabilshment of
Ministry of Transport as recomended in the study of the
Consultants, Rendal Palmer & Tritt6n. The Borrower was
also aware of the importance and need for its estalishment
but had to comply with certain requirements and formalities
before announcement of establishmeat of thls Ministry.
9.0.     Project Supervision was pragmatic and adequate. ID-
missions visit the project regularly. Difficulties and
problems that occurred during project implementation were
dealt with in a practical and flexible manner and in close
cooperation with the Borrower. Zxtensions of closing date
of the Credit were done when requested by the Borrower.
The project was implemented in a very understanding and
cooperative atmosphere.
C. Performance of Cofinancier
9.06      Performance of Cofinancier, Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Developmer.t wfas equally good. The Fund generously
agreed to utilize balance funds for extension of road
strengthening work beyond ADlafraq (km 64) upto Hayes
about 75 km. The financing ratio was increased to 75 percent.
A further extension of road strenGthening work upto 1.5 km
beyond Zabid i.e. a total length of 31.5 km was also agreed
by Arab-Fund. Ilence 166 percent more length of the road
wfas strengthened from the balance funds of Arab Fund.
In that way the achievement of the project was much more
than originally envisaged.
...1.



-22-
D. Performance of the Consultants
9-07      Consultants were appointed to Supervise Construction
of Taiz AlMafraq Overlay works. In addition Consultants
were also comuisioned to undertake the study of Department
of Transport. Performance by both Consultants was
satisfactory. The recommendations of the Consultants for
establishment of Ministry of Transport to improve the
organsation and Institution of transport sector were accepted
by the Government. The Supervision Consultants undertook
asphalt overlay design of additional longth of the road
upto Zabid during the time he was supervising the work hence
it saved time and money for the Borrower for continuing road
strengthening work before the Contractor could be demobilized
after completion of work upto AlMafraq.
So PerfoMances of Contractor
9.08      Coutractor's performance was: also satisfactory.
The rates of overlay work were quite 'empititive henoe the
Governmn t  g-tlid    with the Contractor for exteonion
work ot asphaIt overlay upto Zabid at the same rates. Therefore
it was possible to strengthening additional length of the
road (106.5 km) from the savings of Arab Fund Loan.
F. Results
9*09      On a broad front, the project achieved its objectives,
Institution building was successful in the form of
establishment of Ministry of Transport by the Govermaet.
Therefore the coordinated management of the transport
sector was possilbe. Training of personnel from the
Department of Transport was also made available to improve
the skill of the staff managinS road transport system.
Instead of cancelling the surplus funds from IDA Credit
were utilized for procurement of much needed maintenance
equipment materials and spares for HA and increase in the
lenght of road strengthening works by 166 percent more than
the originally envisaged scope of construction work.



-23,-
X LESSONS
10.1     The Project substantially met its objectives,
progress in tho implementation was satisfactory.
Several extensions of the closing date of the credit
were made in order to utilize surplus funds and to
havo progress is establishment of Ministry of Traugport.
The attitude of IDA and Arab Fund was cooporative
and flexiblo which made the implementation smooth and
to tbo best interost of the Borrower. The decision makors
in IDA and Arab Fund fully understood the spitit of
Government's requests for utilization of balance funds
for procurement of much needed addltional road maintenance
equipment, materials and spares for HA and additional
road strengthening works upto Zabid. There was sufficient
understanding botween the parties wbo tackled problem or
hurdles in the way of implementation in the spirit of
cooperation and goodwill. Tho most important lesson
learned from the project is that there should be enough
flexibility In the project as well as in the attitudes
of the decision makers to modify certain conditions
In the interest of smooth implementation of the project.
