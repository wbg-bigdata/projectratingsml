Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report covers the appraiBal of the Fourth Power Project of
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), for which the Government and the
company have requested financial assistance from the Bank.
ii.       ENDE, an autonomous Government corporation is responsible for
electricity generation and transmisBion in Bolivia except for the La Paz
area, which is served by the Bolivian Power Company (BPC), a foreign-owned
utility.
iii.      The estimated cost of the Project is US$28.8 million equivalent,
and its foreign exchange component and interest during construction of US$4.3
million would be financed by the proposed loan of US$25.0 million. Local
costs equivalent to US$8.1 million will be financed by internal cash generation
and Government equity contributions. The project consists of expansion of
the existing generation facilities in the Oriental System, expansion of the
Santa Isabel hydropower plant and of transmission facilities in the Central
System. The Project will meet increased power requirements in ENDE's power
systems up to 1981 and is the least cost solution. The return on the invest-
ment as measured by net revenues would be approximately 19%.
iv.       Consultants acceptable to the Bank would be engaged for all phases
of the Project. Procurement for the Project will be on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding for all equipment and works to be financed under
the proposed Loan. Bolivian suppliers would be granted a margin of preference
of 15% or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower.
v.        Significant management lmprovements have been made by ENDE over the
last several years and further progress is expected during the project cons-
truction period. EMN, with the support of conaultants, should experionoo no
problems in carrying out the proposed project successfully.
vi.       The Government has authorized tariff increases and ENDE's financial
performance, which had deteriorated in 1973-75, should be satisfactory during
the project's construction period. ENDE would finance 28% of its expansion
program from internal cash generation and earn a rate of return of 8.4% in 1976
and 9% thereafter on revalued assets.
vii.      The proposed Project is a suitable basis for a US$25.0 million loan,
with a term of 25 years including four years of grace. The loan will be made
to ENDE with the guarantee of the Republic of Bolivia.






APPRAI5AL OF FOURTH POWER PROJECT
E(PRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. (ENDE)
BOLIVIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Fourth Power Project of the Eipresa Nacional
de electricidad S.A. (ENIE), an autonomous Government corporation responsible
for electricity generation and transmission in Bolivia, except for the La Paz
area. The Government and ENDE have requested financing for the foreign exchange
cost of the Project amounting to US$25 million, including financing of interest
during construction. The local cost of the Project, US$8.1 millions will be
financed by funds generated by ENDE from its internal resources and Government
equity contributions. The loan would be the first Bank loan to and the fourth
Bank group operation with ENDE, which previously was the beneficiary of three
IDA credits.
1.02      The Fourth ENDE Project will comprise expansion of the Santa Isabel
hydroelectric scheme, additional 22 MW gas turbine for the Santa Cruz power
station and construction of transmission and substation facilities. This Project
is part of ENIE's 1976-1981 expansion program, which includes additional gene-
rating and transmission facilities with an estimated total cost of US$141 million
equivalent.
1.03      In the past, IDA has granted four Credits totalling US$30.4 million
for the development of the power sector in Bolivia:
a)  Credit 61-BO of US$10.0 million, in 1964.  The proceeds of the
credit were made available as an equity contribution to the
newly created ENIDE for the 27 MW Corani hydroelectric plant
and extension of other facilities.
b)  Credit 62-BO of US$5.0 million, in 1964.  The proceeds were
relent to the Bolivian Pbwer Company (BPC), a foreign-owned
utility for the 11 NW Chururaqui hydroelectric plant and
system improvements in La Paz and Oruro.
c)  Credit 148-BO of US$7.4 million, in 1969.  The proceeds were
in part (US$7.34 million) relent to ENDE for the 36 MW Santa
Isabel hydroelectric plant and the extension of other facilities;
and in part (US$0.06 million) made available to the Direcci6n
Nacionaal de Electricidad (DINE) for consulting services. The
Santa Isabel Project was completed in August 1973, fourteen
months behind schedule due to adverse geological conditions in
tunneling and to damages to the penstock during site tests. The
revised cost estimate was 13% over the original estimates of
US$10.4 million.
d)  Credit 433-BO of US$6.0 million in 1973.  The proceeds were in part
(US$5.92 million) relent to ENDE for two 8 MW gas turbines at
Santa Cruz, extension of transmission and substations facilities
in the Oriental and Central systems and an office building; and
in part (US$0.08 million) made available to DINE for studies. The
Third Project was initially delayed due to unexpectedly long delivery time



-2-
for the gas turbines originally planned to be installed
at Santa Cruz. For this reason ENDE had to call for bids
again, this time for a larger 22 NW gas turbine which was
readily available in the market.  Progress is now satisfac-
tory. Cost overruns are estimated currently at about 34%
over the original estimate of US$7.2 million. ENDE will
finance this overrun with its own funds.
1.104     The cost overruns on both the second and third ENDE projects are
attributable to substantial wage increases in the construction of the hydro-
power plant and some delays in calling for bids and escalation of the foreign
currency cost of the equipment. Despite these higher costs, the projects are
still justified, as the cost of alternative sources of energy has risen by an
even greater percentage.
11.05     This report is based on a feasibility study prepared by the consultant
Montreal Engineering Company, Limited (MONENCO) and on the findings of an ap-
praisal mission composed of Messrs. J. Cavallotti and S. Contreras which visited
Bolivia in October 1975.



2. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01      Bolivia is endowed with significant deposits of petroleum and natural
gas. While proven petroleum reserves have declined to about 130 million barrels or
roughly eight years' production at current output rates, gas reserves are estimated
between 2 and 3 quadrillion cubic feet, equivalent to thirty-three years' output
at prevailing production levels. Exploration is currently underway to locate
new reserves. Bolivia is an exporter of oil and natural gas.
2.02      Bolivia also has large potential hydropower resources.  UNDP has
granted a US$621,400 to finance a study of the energy resources of the country
and prepare a medium-term (1981-1990) plan of electrification. ENDE is the
cooperating agency and is contributing US$425,ooo equivalent to cover the local
cost component.
2.03      The commercial energy balance of the country in million tons oil
equivalent for 1973 was:
Production and Consumption of Commercial Energy
Production     Consumption      Exports
Hydrocarbons                  3.4             0.7            2.7
Hydroelectricity              0.2             0.2             -
Total                    3.6            0.9            2.7
The main fuel used by the power sector is natural gas (more than 90% of total fuel
consumption). Gas prices paid by the power sector only cover the cost of trans-
portation. This stems from a Government resolution dated 1969, which established
that the natural gas price for internal use would be zero at well head for a
period of 10 years. This gas is produced in fields which are not connected to
international pipelines. The Bank is at present studying the Bolivian hydrocarbons
sector and the pricing of natural gas will be considered in the study's recommendations.
The Sector
2.04      During the 1969-1974 period electricity generation grew at 6.1% annually,
and investment in the sector averaged Us$11.0 million per annum. The per capita
consumption was 160 kWh in 1974, which is one of the lowest in South America.
2.05      There are about 173,000 connected clients. While 82% of these are
residential consumers, more than two thirds of the Bolivian population have no
access to electricity, which is used mainly for industrial and mining purposes.
The distribution of electricity consumption by type of consumer in 1974 was:

2.06      The three major producers of electricity are BPC, ENDE and the Corpo-
raci6n Minera de Bolivia (CCMIBQL).  The first two are public utilities while
CC4IBOL, the principal Bolivian consumer of electricity is a self-producer.
2.07      ENDE is responsible for generation and transmission of electricity in the
countr,y except for the La Paz area, as well as for the integration of the various
electr:ical systems in Bolivia and interconnections with neighboring countries. It
is also endowed with the power to form associated utilities for the distribution
of electricity. Annex 1 describes these distributing utilities.
2.08      BPC, a subsidiary of the Canadian International Power Company (CIP) is
in charge of the generation, transmission and distribution in the La Paz area;
it also supplies bulk power to the Oruro area and to CaKIBOL in the central
system..
2.09      In addition, there are some small private, municipal and cooperative
producers. Farthermore, other enterprises such as Yacimientos Petroliferos Fis-
cales I3olivianos (YPFB), sugar mills and some mining companies generate part of
their power requirements.
2.10      tn 1974 the installed capacity and generation at the national level
was:

Future Developments
2.11      The next development in generating facilities is expected to originate
from onigoing studies of the:  (a) 42 MW Miguelito Project located on the Paracti
river iin the Central System, or 27 MW Huaji Project, located downstream of the



Cahua plant in the Zongo valley in the Northern system served by BPC and (b)
installation of additional gas turbines at Santa Cruz and Sucre stations.
While the Miguelito project would be built and owned by ENDE there is no
decision yet as to what entity would construct the Hhaji project.
2.12      BPC has prepared an investment program of US$24.0 million for ex-
pansion of its system in La Paz and its surrounding areas which will meet
the requirements of its service area until 1980. The financing of the pro-
posed investment program depends upon the Government's agreement to:
(a) increase BPC's rates by 30% in 1976 and (b) to guarantee a requested
US$4.0 million loan from external sources (see para. 2.20).
2.13      At present various pre-feasibility studies are being conducted, the
most important ones are: (a) the Misicuni multipurpose project located in the
Cochabamba area which would provide electricity (100 KW and 430 GWh), irrigate
about 20,000 Ha and supply potable water for the Cochabamba area; and (b) the
Rositas multipurpose project located at the confluence of the Rio Grande and
Rositas river, 120 km south of Santa Cruz, which would supply 300 MK  and 2,050
GWh of electricity, irrigate 200,000 Ha and control floods.
2.14      The expansion program for the period 1976-1981 would require around
US$207.0 million with the following breakdown:
Facilities                               millions US$         %
a) generating:                               61.2           29
b) transmission:                             97.0           47
c)  urban distribution:                      18.8            10
d) rural electrification:                    30.0            14
US$110 million of the foreign component would be financed by international credit
agencies and suppliers, and the balance, together with the local component would
be financed mainly by internal resources. The planned expansion is reasonable
given Bolivia's forecasted power requirements.
Rural Electrification
2.15      At present only 5% of the rural population of Bolivia, estimated at
some 3.6 million, has access to electricity service. It is expected that by 1978,
when the large rural electrification program being carried out by the Government
in various parts of the country at a cost of US$31.4 million will have been com-
pleted, some 65,000 families in 183 villages will have been connected to the power
supply system, i.e. about 15% of the rural population will be supplied with elec-
tricity (see Annex 2). The program is being financed partially by the Spanish
Government and USAID. While it would contribute to social development, the program's
primary objective is to establish a basis for economic development in rural areas,
particularly for irrigation and agroindustry.
2.16      The Government also plans to implement in the near future an integral
program of rural and industrial electrification in the subtropical region of the
Department of La Paz (Alto Beni), which offers favorable conditions for develop-
ment of farming and agroindustrial activities. Some 75,000 people living in the
area are expected to be connected to electricity service in the period 1978-1984
under this program. The Government would ask for external financing for this
progrsm.



-6-
Reguation
2.17      The Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons has the responsibility of
establishing the power sector policies and of enforcing the Electricity Code
through the Direcci6n Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) which is responsible for
regulating, auditing and coordinating the activities of the electric power industry.
2.18      The Electricity Code was promulgated by Supreme Decree No. 08438 in
July 1968. DINE has proposed to the dank some amendments to the Code as a result
of the studies included in Credit 148-BO, and is expected to implement them in
the near future, after incorporating the Bank's comments.
Tariffs
2.19      Electricity tariffs are regulated by DINE.  The Electricity Code
stipulates that power utilities shall earn a return of 9% calculated as an
average for a period of three to five years. The rate base is defined as
average net fixed assets in operation plus working capital (1/8 of the annual
opera.ting revenues) and inventories (up to 3% of the gross fixed assets in
operaition). Tariffs are reviewed annually by DINE and adjusted if the return
expected for the three-to-five year period under review falls below 8.5% or
exceeds 9.5%.
2.20      In the years prior to 1975 the Bolivian Government had negotiated with
BPC to acquire its assets; during this period of uncertainty the Government post-
poned the consideration of rate increases and BPC did not achieve the rate of
return provided for in the Electricity Code. Early in 1975 the Government decided
to permit BPC to continue its operations and shortly thereafter agreed to a 70%
average rate increase which would permit BPC to finance a large portion of the
needed distribution expansion for the period 1976-1980 (see para. 2.12). Oa
October 1, 1975 BPC asked the Government's (a) approval to request World Bank
financing for tho investment requirements not covered by internal cash generation
and (b) for an increase in rates of 15% early in 1976 and an additional increaae
of 15% towards the end of 1976 in order to earn a 9% rate of return. At the moment
the Glovernment is reviewing BPC's requests. It is likely that the Government
wlll grant periodic increases during 1976.
2.21      UEIZ's rates to bulk conumers are based on demand (kW) and energy (kWh)
charges, except in Santa Crus and Potosi whore the tariffs are baoed onlr a flat
energr charge.         It was agreed with IDE and DID  that no later ttan one
month after the effective date all tariffs will be based on appropriate demand and
energy, charge. COnce the results of the tariff structure study referred to below
are available, they should serve as a guide for establishing the tariff schedules of
the mein utilities (see Annex 3). The 1974 national average price of $b 0.38
(US$0.019) per kWh was low by international standards.  This was partly a reflection
of Bolivia's favorable resource endowment and partly a result of inadequate tariff
adjustments in prior years. As noted in para. 6.02 the Government has initiated on
corrective action to deal with the latter problem.



2.22      DINE will utilize a portion of the funds available to it under
Credit 433-BO to carry out studies which would recomend a tariff structure
designed to discourage power consumption during peak hours and make other suggestions
for improving tariff structures. Two external consultants will be hired to
carry out these studies in conjunction with staff of the main utilities. The
Terms of Reference for carrying out the studies are shown in Annex 4. The Govern-
ment agreed that DINE would review the results of these studies and would discuss
the implementation of their recommendations with the Bank.

3.  THE EXPANSION PR$GEhM AliD THE PROJECT
The Expansion Program
3.01      ENDE's expansion program for the period 1976-1981, of which the
Project forms a part, would require a total investment of US$141.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$91.0 million (64%) and
a local component of US$50.0 million (36%). (See Annex 5).
3.02      The expansion program comprises execution of the following principal
works:
(a)  completion of the thirdl ENDE power project financed by IiD
Credit 433-BO (para 1.03(d));
(b) the proposed IBRD Project, described in para. 3.03;
(c)  expansion of the Coran-i. hydroelectric power station to its
full capacity with two units similar to the existing ones
(2 x 13.5 MW) and installation of the second penstock;
(d) interconnection of the central and southern power systems by
means of a 115 Kf1 transmission line between Catavi and Pbtos1
substations;
(e) construction of the 115 KV transmission line between Potosi
and Punutuma substations;
(f) expansion of various substations in the southern system and
removal of the diesel units from Santa Cruz (4 x 3.2 MW) -Lor
installation in the Sucre power plant;
(g)  expansion of the generating and transmission facilities in tne
oriental system;
(h)  115 KV interconnection 'etween the northern and central systems;and
(i)  expansion of generating and transmission facilitles in the central
system and of transmission and subtransmission facilities in the
southern system.
Th- worcs described in paras. (c) through (f) above would be financeud unu. 
IDB loan of US$24.5 million.  The Bank project would finance the expansion oi the
isolated Oriental system and the extension of the Santa Isabel soheme and related
transmission lines, which are not dependent on the construction of the LL project.
The project to be financed by the Bank could therefore proceed in the event that
the IDB project is delayed. ENDE plans to seek external financing for items (g)
through (i) in 1973.
"'he 2roject
3.03      The objective of tile Idhi Project is to help meet increosin: power
requirements in the EilDE's systems up to 1)31.  fi"e Project -iaould eèns-Le   _oa-le
service at least cost.



- 9 -
3.04      The Project, further details of which are given in Annex 6, comprises:
(a)  Expansion of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric power station with
the incorporation of a third unit (18 MW) and the installation
of the second penstock;
(b)  Construction of a compensating pond with a capacity of 100,000
m3, to be located at the Santa Isabel power station intake, to
store water from the Corani power station;
(c)  Collection of water from the 5wo aras of the Vinto river at a
maximum discharge rate of 3 m /second for diversion to the Santa
Isabel tunnel;
(d)  Installation of a gas turbine with a capacity of approximately
22.8 MW at the Santa Cruz power station;
(e)  Construction of a single circuit transmission line at 115 Kv,
150 km long, between the Sacaba and Vinto substations; and
(f)  Construction of the Vinto substation, expansion of the Cochabamb&
and Sacaba substations and installation of shunt capacitors at
the Oruro substation.
Project Cost
3.05      The project cost is estimated to be US$28.8 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$20.7 million, excluding interest during construc-
tion and represents about 21t of the total cost of the Expansion Program. A
summary of the cost is given below. Annex 7 provides further details.

3.o6      The proposed loan for the equivalent of US$25.0 million would
finance the following:
Thousands of US$
1. Foreign exchange component of ecuipment and civil
works for the expansion of the Santa Isabel hydro-
electric power station, the compensating reservoir and
the river Vinto intakes including freight, insurance
and assembly.                                                   7,800
2. Foreign exchange component of equipment and civil
works of the third gas turbine unit for the Santa
Cruz power station, including cost of freight,
insurance and assembly.                                         3,900
3.  Foreign exchange component of materials, equipment
freight, insurance and assembly of the Sacaba-Vinto
transmission line, the Sacaba, Vinto and Cochb amba
substations and the shunt capacitors at Oruro2/.                5,400
4.  Engineering Services for items 1 to 3 above.                    1,300
5.  Unallocated                                                     2,300

Total to be financed                                     25,000
3.07      The feasibility study of the Expansion Program and cost estimates were
prepared by the Canadian consulting firm Montreal Engineering Company Ltd. with
funds provided under Credit No. 433-BO. This consulting firm has substantial
experience in work of a similar nature in Bolivia, having undertaken the prior
engineering and the supervision of the construction of the Corani power station.
Their original cost estimates were based on market prices at the end of 1974 but
have been updated to reflect the end-1975 market prices. Physical contingencies
have been calculated at a rate of 8% for equipment costs and 10% for erection
and civil works. These rates are considered adequate.
Price contingencies have been calculated using the following percentages, which
should be adequate:
Local Costs              Foreign Costs
(%)-                       MS

1/ Credit 433-BO included US$60,000 allocation for these capacitors. Their
transfer to the proposed project is recommended in view of the fact that ENDE's
consultants have recommended that their installation be deferred by 3 years.

Engineer    aruction ScheCd
3.08      E    wil eng age consultants acceptable to the Bank under satisfactory
toers and condit1ons for all phase  of the project. The dsign, bid evaluation
and supervision of the Sacaba-VintO transission line and the associated sub-
stations war contracted to the U.S. consultant Gilbert-Coonwealth in November
1975, which is satisfactory.  This consultant will also prepar  the tranmission
project to be fiuaned by IDB. IDB will finace  the cost of these services for
its project and ID  will cover the costs associated with the Sacaba-Vinto
tranmission project. Eli is currently conaidering proposals for consulting
services for the expansion of the generating facilities. hployment of consultants
necessary for the proposed Bank financed project will be a condition for effective-
ness of the proposed loan. The consultant services has 'een estimated in 255 man-
months with an average cost of US$5,100 man-month (see Annex 6).
3.09      The comtruction of the Santa Isabel hydropower plant and the transmis-
Sion line is to start in the laat quarter of 1976, the rest of the works, in 1977.
The project is expected to be completed early in 1980 according to the Project
implementation schedule (Annex 8). The Santa Isabel hydropower plant construction
schedule is reasonable with a probability of 95% that the station would be completed
in the period roughly between 193 and 212 weeks from the starting date. RNUE
confirmed this schedule during negotiations and will report on progress during
project execution.
Procurement
3.10      The project will be carried out by contractors.  All contracts for the
purchase of equipment and materials and for the execution of work to be financed
with funds from the proposed loan will be awarded under international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement. Bolivian
manufacturers would be given a margin of preference of 15% of the CIF value or
the applicable customs duty whichever is lower. The only item expected to be
eligible are electrical cables manufactured within the country. If the contract
for cables were to be awarded to the local manufacturer its total value would be
equivalent to about US$400,000 ex-factory of which sme 60% would correspond to
the imported component.
3.11     ERN1 wil1 award separate contracts for the expansion of the Santa Isabel
power station, the first will cover the purchase of equipment and materials and
the second the execution of the civil works and the installation of electrical and
mechanical equipment. A single contract would be awarded for work on the cons-
truction of the compensating reservoir and the river Vinto intakes. The would
also be a single contract for the supply of equipment, execution of civil works
and assem:b  o1 Lie gas turbine at the Santa Cruz station. A part of this work
may be carried out by Bolivian contractors.
3.12       ITES gill issue simultaneous but separate iavitations to bid for
materisls and equipment for the transmission lines and substations to be financed
with Bank and IDB funds, as this increases the probability of obtaining better
prices. Contracts for erection of the transmission lines and substations will
be separat3 from those for supply of materials and equipment.
3, a3 ds from the proposed loan would be applied to the payment of:



- 12 -
(a)  the CIF price of imported materials and equipjent and the
ex-factory cost of locally procured materials and .quipment
(see par&. 3.10);
(b) tne foreign exchange component of the cost of installation of '
equipment and civil works;
(c) engineering services;and
(d) interest on the loan during the construction period.
Annex 9 gives an estimated disbursement schedule. Any loan funds remaining
undisbursed on completion of the project would be appltod, after agremwat with
the Bank, to works similar to those included in the Project.
3.14      Retroactive financing of up to US$300,000 is recommended for payments
made by ENDE to the consultants after November 1, 1975.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Sector and Project Objectives
4.01      Through its support to the Bolivian power sector, the Bank has assisted
the Government in its efforts to strengthen sector institutions, provide the faci-
lities needed to meet demand for electricity for productive purposes at least cost
and increase access to service among lower income consumers. The Bank's involve-
ment has contributed to the emergence of DINE and ENDE as the dominant sector in-
stitutions, the adoption of a well-conceived Electricity Code and the development
of a national plan for expanding the sector's facilities. The Project includes
works required to meet the growth in demand from existing and new consumers through
1981. The tariff structure studies to be carried out by DINE (para. 2.22) should,
after their conclusions are implemented, contribute to improve the utilization of
existing facilities. Implementation of the Plan of Action (para. 5.04) and the
training program (para. 5.06) should contribute to increasing ENDE's efficiency
and the various measures described in Section 6 should improve its financial
position by reducing its dependence on borrowing.
4.02      A reliable supply of electric power is essential to Bolivia's economic
growth and the improvement of the standard of living of its population. As noted
in para. 2.05, industry and mining are the largest consumers of electricity.
The future needs of the largest enterprises in these sectors could be met through
captive generation rather than through reliance on ENDE's system. However, sich
a pattern of development would be wasteful of the country's resources, since it
would result in duplication of investment, loss of the considerable economies of
scale inherent in large-scale generation facilities, and uneconomic use of fuel.
Even more serious would be the impact on medium- and small-scale enterprises,
for which captive generation would in many cases be excessively costly. The
project, therefore, is expected to facilitate in particular the development of
medium- and small-scale economic activity in the areas outside of the capital.
As in most countries at Bolivia's stage of development, residential
consumption of electricity is low. However, access to electricity will increase
as a result of the rural electrification programs described in Annex 2. The
rural population will share in the benefits of electricity: efficient and
reliable lighting and refrigeration and low cost energy for pumping and machine
tools.
The Power Market
4.03      ENDE covers part of energy requirements in the Central and Southern
Systems and is the only public undertaking which generates power in the Oriental
System. ENDE's energy sales grew at an average annual rate of 17% during the period
1967-7h, with the following breakdown by system: Central 12.6%; Oriental 29%. In
the Southern system in which ENDE started operations in Sucre in 1974, energy sales
were expected to increase in 51% in 1975. ENDE's sales for the period 1975-1981 are
forecasted to increase slightly faster (17.5%). The average annual rates of growth
by system are expected to be: Central 13%; Southern 36.5%; and Oriental 17% (see
Annex 10). These projections are reasonable, since all new expansions of generating
and transmission facilities in the three systems are being made exclusively by ENDE,
while in the past a part of the growth was met through installation of captive
plants. 1/
1/ Actual sales in 1975 were substantially as forecast.



- 14 -
4.04      The maximum demand in the Central system is estimated to rise from 60 MW
in 1974 to 105 MW in 1981 with an annual growth of 8%, while generation would be
increased from 338 GWh to 564 GWh. In the Southern system, maximum demand of 21 .4 MW
in 1975 is estimated to increase to 52 MW in 1981 with an average annual growth
of 15%. The maximum demand reached 14.5 MW in the Oriental system  in 1974 and is
estimated to be 48 MW in 1 981 with an annual growth of 1 8%.
Least Cost Solution
Central and Southern Systems
L.05      Montreal Engineering made a comparative study to determine the most suitable
facilities for the Northern, Central, South and Orientai power systems, to meet
requirements through 1984 with satisfactory reliability and minimum cost.  The
study recommended interconnecting the Northern, Cerntral and Southern systems by
1978, but keeping the Oriental system isolated until 1988/90. However, ENDE has
decided to postpone the North-Central interconnection until the end of 1981 in
order to reduce its investment requirements.
4.06      A comparison of separate and interconnected development of the Central
and Southern systems demonstrates that this partial interconnection of the systems
is the least cost solution at any discount rate (Annex 11).
4.07      The Santa Isabel project and associated transmission line would be
a lower cost solution than an equivalent steam thermal station to be installed
in Oruro and using natural gas as fuel, at discount rates of up to 23 o. Even
at a price for the natural gas equivalent to transport cost alone (39% lower
than the assumed) the equalizing discount rate would be of 16%, which compares
favorably with the opportunity cost of capital in Bolivia (Annex 12).
4.08      Besides being a part of the future interconnection with the Northern
system, the transmission line between the Sacaba (Cochabamba) and Vinto (Oruro)
substations would make possible an appreciable improvement in the continuity of
service to an important mining area which presently depends on an unreliable
transmission system (the 140 km 115 KV Sacaba-Catavi line and the 70 km 69 KV
Catavi-Oruro line). Present supply losses caused by transmission failures would
be eliminated by the project, which would also improve voltage control and reduce
transmission losses. Construction of this transmission line is lower in both
capital and operating cost than the alternative of installing a standby plant at
Oruro.
Oriential System
4.09      To cover the increase in the Oriental System's power demand installation
of a third package gas turbine similar to the existing ones in the Santa Cruz
power station is planned. Adoption of 22 MW turbines (third unit in 1978 and
fourth in 1981) is the least cost solution compared to gas turbines ranging between
13 MW and 22 MW, the only feasible alternative.
4.10      The existing diesel units in the Santa Cruz plant (4 x 3.3 MW) would be
transferred to Sucre in 1976 when installation of the second 22 MW gas turbine
is completed in Santa Cruz. The transfer of these diesel units is a matter of
urgency to prevent rationing in the Sout.hern system between now and the time of
the int erconnection with the Central system, planned for 1978, and is a lower cost
solution than installation of a smaller gas turbine at Santa Cruz and of alternative
generation in the Southern system.



- 15 -
Return on Investment
4.11      Annex 13 shows that the rate of return of the program, defined as the
discount rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues with associated
costs, is 18.9%.  This rate of return is based on tariff levels expected to be
put into effect by ENDE to earn a 9% rate of return on revalued assets (see para.
6.02). A sensitivity analysis shows that even if the capital costs were 10% higher
and the revenues 10% lower than those assumed, the rate of return would be 15% which
is well above the opportunity cost of capital in Bolivia. This indicates that
electricity prices will, on average, be considerably higher than incremental system
costs, suggesting that wasteful use of electricity, and thus premature expansion
of capacity will be avoided. However, deficiencies in the tariff structure may
still preclude an optimal rate of development in the sector, a problem the tariff
study is designed to address (see Annex 4).
4.12      The above rate of return uses revenues as a proxy for the benefits
derived from the program. The economic rate of return is undoubtedly higher
since it would also take into account the factors mentioned in para. 4.o2, to
the extent that they are not reflected in electricity prices.

5. THE BORROWER
General
5.01      ENDE was established by the Bolivian Government in 1965 as an auto-
nomous Government utility.  ENDE's capital is composed of two types of shares:
(i) type "A" non-dividend paying voting shares, and (ii) type "B" non-voting
shares on which dividends can be paid. ENDE's authorized capital amounts to
US$40 million of which US$21 million has been subscribed by Corporacion Boliviana
de Fomento (CBF), YPFB and COMIBOL; a total of US$20.5 million had been paid
in as of December 31, 1974.
Organization and Staffing
5.02      ENDE is administered by a Board of Directors composed of six members.
The Minister of Energy and Hydrocarbons is the ex-officio Chairman of the Board.
Of the other five members, who are elected by the shareholders, three directors
represent CBF, one represents COMIBOL and one YPFB. All Board members serve
four years and are eligible for reelection. The Board appoints the General
Manager. The present General Manager who was appointed in 1972 is an experienced
engineer and competent executive.
5.03      ENDE is structured on the basis of 3 operational units: Operations,
Technical, and Financial, and of 4 staff units: Legal, Internal Audit, Planning,
and Distribution. The organization chart is shown in Annex 14. Despite the need
for some improvements ENDE with the support of consultants (para. 3.08) should
experience no problems in carrying out the proposed project successfully.
5.04      ENDE, with the assistance of its management consultant, Arthur Young & Co.
(whose services are partially financed by Credit 433-H0), has implemented a unified
financial structure; the financial fumction was previously scattered among various
organizational units. Also, periodic senior staff meetings chaired by the General
Manager have improved communications. Financial and accounting systems and reporting
practices have also been improved although full participation of the various techltal
unilts in resolving financial issues has yet to be attained. Major advances are
expected to be achieved with the implementation of a company-wide budgetary system
and improvements in fixed assets accounting and with the new office building which
will centralize activities now physically dispersed in several small buildings
located in widely separated parts of Cochabamba. These measures are expected to
be included in a Plan of Action which is being prepared by Arthur Young & Co. and
ENDE. The loan agreement requires ENDE to submit this plan of action to the Bank
for comment no later than a month after the Effective Date and to implement it
promptly thereafter.
5.05      ENDE's staff as of December 1975 numbered 253 of whom 105 are profession-
als; many of the professionals have pursued higher studies abroad. The present
staff is in general competent. Installed capacity per employee is about 451 KW.
This is acceptable for ENDE which is primarily a generating company.
Training
5.06      ENDE trains its personnel in three different ways: (i) by sending staff
abroad either to gain variety of experience by working in other utilities or by
participating in specific courses and seminars, (ii) by forming ad-hoc teams to
work in conjunction with the consultants both in the technical and in the management



- 17 -
areas, and (iii) by giving training courses for the staff in charge of the
operation and aaintenance of its facilities. In view of the size of its
construction program and the growth of its staff, ENDE agreed to prepare a
permanent training progra and present it to the Basnk for discussion not
later than end-1976 and carry out the progrin thereafter.
Manaaement Information Systems and Audit
5.07      ElnD  has substantially improved its informatiom system and has been
able to derive benefits from the engagement of management consultants. Manage-
ment reporting is now accurate,timely and seems quite well structured. However,
fixed asset accounting and budgetary systems are major areas that need improve-
ment (para. 5.04). ENDE maintains its accounting records in accordance with
generally accepted principles of accounting and follows closely the electric
utilities practices recomended by the lideral Power Commission of the USA. ENDS
has engaged the services of the independent accountant Coopers & Iybrand to perform
the audit of its 1975 accounts under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. ENDE
agreed to submit to the Bank its accounts verified by independent accountants
acceptable to the Bank, not later than 4 sonths after the end of each fiscal year.
Facilities
5.08      ENDE t installed generating capacity and end-i975 amounted to 114 KW of
which 63 KW wero hydroelectric plants, 22.8 MW gas turbines, and 28.2 KW diesel
plants.  58% of this capacity is installed in the Central Systems 31% in the
Oriental System and 11 lin the Southern System (see Annex 15).
5.09      ENDE operates its trsnsmission systems at 115 [V and 69 Kv. Al. its
lines are single-circuit with the exception of the 8 km section between the Corani
and Santa Isabel plants which is planned to be a double-circuit line. At end-
1975 ENDE had 194 km of 115 KV lines and 166 km of 69 [V lines, all operating at
50 Hz, which is the standard frequency of the country. The transformation capacity
is 182 NVA. END 's generating plant is well run and properly maintained. The
quality of service has been generally acceptable, though voltage regulating in the
Central System should be improved. This problem should be corrected as a result
of the project. Tranasmission losses have been 6% which is reasonable.
PFrformance Indicators
5.10      Annex 16 shows a selection of indicators of ENDBts perfornance through
the year following project completion. Perforeance as measured by the indicators
will be monitored during project execution.

6. FINANCES
6.01      ENDE's rate of return has deteriorated in recent years; however, tariff
increases recently approved by the Government should bring it close to the 9%
authorized by the Electricity Code. The financing plan is sound; it includes
retention of earnings, reduction of the level of accounts receivable and further
tariff increases. The financial position and the capital structure should remain
sound through project completion. Debt service should be well covered.
EarAias8 Hiator-r and Fature-Financial Erformanoe
6.02      Over the period 1972-74 the growth rate of revenues has been lower
than that of both operational expens  and fixed asseta; this lag has produced
a deterioration of ENDE's rate of return on partially revalued assets (see
Annexes 18 and 24)1from 9.3% in 1972 down to 6.7% in 1974; the average for the
per:Lod was 8.1%, lower than the 9% permitted by the Electricity Code. Tariffs
were increased in aid-1975, but the rate of return on revalued assets for 1975
is estimated at 5.9%. The Government has authorized END to raise its tariffs
by about 23% in two steps, Fhbruary 1 and May 1, 1976. This wi4 ,lead to a
rate of return of approximately 8.4% on revalued assets for 1976i' EMM and the
Government have agreed that Starting 1977 ENDM wlll request and the Governmnt
wil.1 authorize the tariff increases necessary for BEDE to achieve a 9% rate of
return on revalued assets (para. 2.19). Tariff increases have also been autho-
rized for the distrlbution companies to offset the increased cost of the energy
they purchased from  NM.
6.0,3     Fixed assets were revalued atter the 1972 devaluation of the Bolivian
peso; however, this revaluation only offset the adjustment in the peso'a US
dollar value. ENDS and the Government have agreed to annually revalu  ENDES'
assets using a method acceptable to the Bank. As an initial step ENDS recorded
in early 1976, a revaluation of its assets as of DIcember 31, 1974k, of about 36%.
ENDS has estimated that a revaluation of about 11% would be required for 1975
(see Annex 24).
Financial Pbsition
6.04     As explained in detail in Annex 24, EDS 's capital structure as of
December 31, 1974p was sound with a debt/equity ratio of 50/50. Long-term debt
of 58$22.06 million consisted principally of the proceeds of IDA credits
and IDB Fund for Special Operations (FS0) loans to the Government and
loans from USAID.
6.05      Accounts recoivable have been kept at a very high level during the
period 1972 through 1974 (about four months billings).  ENDS and the Government
agreed during negotiations to reduce the receivables to three months' billings
by January 1, 1977, to two months by January 1, 1978, and to maintain it at two
months thereafter; ENDE's management considers this a realistic plan.
I/  On assets revalued as of January 1, 1976, the rate of return would be 9%.



- 19 -
6.06      CBF has continued to press MMl for dividend payments.  In order
to protect the financing plan, the covenant of prior credits prohibiting
payment of dividends will be maintairzd in the proposed loan agremnt.
6.07      Delays in execution of coustruction programs have more than
counterbalanoed cost overruns and low revenue levels. With the above tariff
increases (para. 6.02), the reduction of the level of accounts receivable
(para. 6.05), and the retention of earnings (para. 6.06), BNIE'a cash position
is expected to remain satisfactory through project completion.
F$nanctla Plan

6.09      During the period 1976-1979 ENDE would contribute to its expansion
program with $b545.0 million (US$27.3), or 28% of the total, from funds from
internal resources; borrowings would finance $bt,269.4 million (US$63.5 million)
of 67% of the total expansion program. ENDEnwould finance the rest (5%) of its
expansion program mainly with equity contributionr from the Goverment.
/ Construction for the bulk of these projects would start in 1978; ENDE plans to
seek most of its financing from international lending agencies and 4upDliers.
/ Includes interest financing; final disbursements of $bU8.7 million (US$2.4 million)
in 1980.



- 20 -
6.10      The Government has already committed the following contributions:
(a) $b 49.2 mlllion (US$2.5 million) from the Fiduciary Fund
(Annex 24 para. 9); and
(b) $b 32.8 million (US$1.6 million) from the proceeds of the
service of the IDA Credit 62-BO which was lent to BPC.
6.11      In addition to drawing down existing borrowings, the financing plan
assumes that END will receive the proceeds of a 40-year US$24.5 million equi-
valent FSO loan from IDB which bears an interest rate of 2% (relent to MNME
as a 25-year loan with an interest rate of 8%). This loan is expected to be
approved in March 1976. The terms assumed for the US$25 million proposed IBRD
loan are: maturity 25 years, including four years of grace, and interest rate
of 8.5%. The assumed terms of future borrowings, which would be required from
1978, are given in Annex 22. The IBRD and IDB projects were appraised by a
joint mission of the two agencies. ENDE is negotiating a DM 7.9 million (US$3.6
million) supplier credit with AEG-Kanis for the second Santa Cruz gas turbine;
ENDE did not consider additional supplier credits at this time since the terms
would be too burdensome for the utility during the project construction period.
6.12      As described above, ENDE 's financing plan is satisfactory.
Debt Service CoveraRe
6.13      As shown in Annex 23, ENDE's annual debt service coverage of 2.13 in
1975 is adequate and is expected to remain satisfactory thereafter. EXDE agreed
not to borrow without the Bank's concurrence if net revenues cover its maximum
debt service requirement (including the debt proposed to be incurred) less than
1.5 times.

7. AGREMENTS REACHED AND RECGO=ENDAT IONS
7.01      During negotiations UEI  agreed:
a) to implement tariffs based on demand and energy charges (para. 2.21);
b) to employ engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
assist ENDE for all phases of the Project (para. 3.08);
c) to implement the Plan of Action recommended by ENJ's management
consultants (para. 5.04);
d) to prepare a permanent trainin program and present it to the
Bank for discussion no later than end-1976 and carry out the
progrm thereafter (para. 5.06);
v) to continue having its accounts audited annually by independent
accountants (para. 5.07);
f) to take all necessary steps to obtain and maintain tariffs to
produce a 9% rate of return on revalued assets (para. 6.02);
g) to revalue annually its fixed assets in accordanoo with methods
acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.03);
h) to reduce the level of accounts receivable to three mouths'
billings by January 1, 1977, and to two months' by January 1, 1978,
and to maintain it at two months thereafter (para. 6.05);
i) to retain all internally generated funds for reinvestment and
not to pay cash dividends until project completion (para. 6.06); and
J)  not to borrow without the Bank's canQ rence if it does not meet a
debt service coverage test (jara. .g ).o
The Bolivian Government agreed:
a) to cause DINE to review the results of the tariff studies and
discuss the implementation of their recomeandations with the
Bank (para. 2.22); and
b) to permit ElnD  to fulfill its obligations (paras. 2.21, 6.02, 6.03,
6.05 and 6.06).
7.02      Xgageucat of engineering conaultants is a condition for effectivwess
of the proposed loan.(para. 3.08).
7.03      The Project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$25.0 million
for a term of 25 years with a four-year grace period.

BOLIVIA
Electricity Distributing Companies
General
1.        All distributing companies described below have certain common features
in their organizational structures: all have some form of shareholders' assembly
which appoints a directory which in turn appoints a general manager. All these
agencies appear to need improvements in their administrative systems and procedures;
the loans these companies have received for rural electrification include compo-
nents for studies and implementation of improved administrative systems and procedures.
3NDE is assisting the companies in this task through its Distribution Department.
In 1974 the distributing companies formed an association, AAELEC, to represent
their interests.
Cooperativa de Electrificaci6n Limitada (CRE) de Santa Cruz
2.        CRE is the distributing agency of the Oriental System.  It purchases all
its electricity from ENDE. As of December 31, 1974 CRE's paid-in capital amounted
to $b 5,021 thousand. Every consumer has to buy a minimum capital share of $b 200.00
which entitles him to the electricity service. The company does not pay dividends
and capitalizes all its net income   Its outstanding long-term debt amounted to
$b188.8 million as of December 31, 1974.
3.        As the statistics below show, this is the distributing company which
has experienced the highest growth because the Santa Cruz area has been developing
over the last several years at a rate much faster than the rest of the country.
4.        At end-1970 a new distribution system started operations which brought
about a large increase in the number of consumers and, therefore, in consumption.
The period 1967-1970 was characterized by technical constraints (lack of sufficient
generation capacity, high distribution losses) and industrial consumers were forced
to generate their own energy.
Cooperativa Electrica Sucre S.A. (CESSA)
5.        CESSA is one of the distributors in the Southern System and distributes
to the city of Sucre and its surroundings. Its main customer is the Fabrica Nacional
de Cemento S.A. (FANCESA).
6.        CESSA's main shareholders are the Prefectura del Dapartamento de Chuquisaca,
the Alcaldia Municipal de Sucre, the Universidad .6oliviana San Francisco Javier, and
the consumers (minority shareholders).



ANNEX 1

Empresa de Luz y Fuierza E]Lctrica Cochabamba S.A. (ELFEC)
7.        ELFEC is the distributing company for the Department of Cochabamba, a
part of the Central System. As of May 31, 1975 ELFEC 's authorized capital amounted
to $b 15.0 million of which $b 12.0 million had been suscribed and paid-in.  ENDE
owned $b 5.7 million, or about 47%,of ELFEC's subscribed capital, but is in the
process of increasing its share to $b 13.5 million, or 68%. Most of ELFEC's capital
increase will be devoted to extensions of lines to rural areas. As of May 31, 1975
other shareholders included the Municipality of Cochabamba with about 36% of the
subscribed capital and other private shareholders with the remininig 17%.
8.        Ten percent of net income is capitalized as legal reserve and the rest is
capitalized or distributed as dividends in accordance to yearly decisions of the
SharehoLder 's assembly. So far, most of net income has been capitalized.
9.        As of December 31,1974 ELFEC had total assets of $b 60,978 thousand and
carried a long-term debt of $b 19,182 thousand; it obtained a rate of return of
8.6% for 1974 and the 5-year average rate of return was 7.4%.
10.       ENDE appoints 3 of the 6 directors which compose ELFEC's Board.
Servicios Electricos Potosi S.A. (SEPSA)
11.       SEPSA is the distributing company for the city of Potosi and surroundings,
a part of the Southern System. As of December 31, 1974 SEPSA?s authorized and
paid-in capital amounted to $b 26,656 million. ENDE owned $b.993 million, or about
4% of SEPSA 's capital. The main shareholder is the Comite Departamental de Desarrollo
y Obras P6blicas de Potosl with $b 25.025 million, or 93% (paid with assets).  The
Alcaldia Municipal de Potosi holds $b.638 million, or 3% of the capital.
12.       Five percent of net income is capitalized as legal reserve and the rest
is capitalized or paid as dividends as is decided annually by the shareholders,
assembly. As of December 31, 1974 SEPSA's total assets amounted to $b 35.1 million
and carried no long-term debt.  In 1974 there was a net loss of $b.405 million.
13.       ENDE appoints two of the 6 directors of SEPSA's Board.
Servicios Electricos de TariJa S.A. (SETAR)
14.       SETAR generates and distributed electricity in the city of Tarijaoand
surrouncldngs, a part of the Southern System.  As of December 31, 1974 SETAR 's
authorized capital amounted to $b 11.0 million of which $b 6.969 million had been
subscribed and paid-in. ENDE owned $b 3.073 million, or 44% of SETAR's subscribed
capital.. The other shareholders are the Comit6 de Obras P6blicas y Desarrollo de
Tarija also with $b 3.073 million, and the Alcaldia Municipal de Tarija with $b 0.823
million,, or 12%, of SETAR's subscribed capital.
15.       Five percent of net income is capitalized as legal reserve and the rest
is capitlalized or distributed as dividends as accorded by the Shareholders' assembly;
the company has never paid dividends.  Al. of December 31, 1974, SETAR had total
assets of $b 16.3 million; in 1974 SETAR obtained a $b 474 thousand net income.

Note:  The statistical data contained in this Annex might not be accurate since the
distributing companies seem to lack acceptable records and do not hire the
services of external auditors; therefore, they should be viewed as indicative
only.
18.       In addition to the companies described there are soveral minor
producers   which also distribute their energy, in small towns such as Trinidad
(capital of the Department of Beni), Cobija (capital of the Department of Pando),
Tupiza, Uyuni, Camiri, Riberalta, and others.  Also, BPC, a subsidiary of Canadian
International Power (CIP), distributes its own generation to the La Paz area; for
the distribution in the city of Oruro it sells energy to Empresa de Luz y Fuerza
Electrica Oruro, S.A. (ELFEO), also a subsidiary of Canadian International Power.
Asociaci6n Nacional de Empresas Distribuidoras de Energia Electrica (ANELEC)
19.       ANELEC was formed by the distributing companies on January 12, 1974.  Its
charter covers points of common interest to electricity distributors, such as serving
as a consultant on various matters and as a coordinator and representative to the
Government. The activities that ANELEC was designed to carry out cover a wide range;
if suitably managed it is expected to be of significant help to the sector at large.

Rural Electrification Program
1.  General
1.1       The population of Bolivia was estimated at 5.5 million at the end of
1974, of whom almost 66% lived in rural areas. The most important rural centers
are to be found close to Lake Titicaca, some 80 km northwest of La Paz (the capital)
the major urban center in the country with almost 700,000 inhabitants. Other
important rural centers close to La Paz are in the Alto Beni region, with a popu-
lation of 11,000 in urban centers and 64,000 in rural areas.
1.2       Other important rural areas are those located in Santa Cruz., and in the
center and south parts of the country, in which an intensive program of rural
electrification is currently underway being financed by USAID (see page 3(b)X At
present; only 5% of the rural population has access to electricity service, but it
is expected that with cmpletion of the current rural electrification program,
scheduled for 1978, almost 15% of the rural population will have access to power
supplies.
2. Organization of the Rural Electrification Program
(a) Ixstituto Nacional de Electrificaci6n Rural (INER)
2.1       INER is an organization under the Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons,
established to provide electricity to rural villages isolated from the electricity
supply system, within a cooperative framework. INER is governed by a board of
directors (Junta Directiva) made up of five directors and chaired by the Minister
of Energy and i>drocarbons, with the Undersecretary of Energy as alternate. Other
directors are representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Coordination
and Planning, DINE, ENDE and the Instituto Nacional de Cooperativas (INC), which
comes umder the Ministry of Labor.
2.2       INER is administering a program of rural electrification in isolated
areas in various parts of the country. It is at present working in 51 villages,
most of them with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, and is using funds obtained from
a US$2.45 million loan from the Spanish Government. The program started in 1970
and is due to be concluded early in 1976.
2.3       INER sets up cooperatives in each of the villages to be electrified and
makes them responsible for debt service; the cooperatives cover with their own funds
between 20% and 25% of local expenditures. Each member of the cooperatives makes
a payment of $b 200 (US$10) prior to connection of the service. It takes an
average of two months to set up cooperatives, particularly in the northeastern part
of the country. This short period required is due to the success that the

cooperatives have had particularly in instituting a savings and loan system.
2.4       INER will also be responsible for administering the electrification
program in the northern part of the Altiplano and the valley of La Paz, to be
executed with USAID loan funds, which is designed to provide permanent electri-
city service to some 10,000 families (60,000 persons) in an area with a total
population of some 660,000. This project, details of which are given below, is
scheduled to be in operation in 1978.
(b) Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDE)
2.5       ENDE is responsible for administering the current electrification pro-
ject for rural areas in Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Potosi and Tarijaa,
which is being executed with funds from two loans that USAID granted the Bolivian
Government in 1973 and 1974, aggregating US$21.4 million.
2.6       This project is divided into:  PHASE I for electrification of the Santa
Cruz and Cochabamba areas, at an estimated cost of US$16.6 million, of which
US$11.8 million will come from AID loan 511-LT-046, and US$4.8 million will
represent the local contribution from the participating agencies (sub-borrowers)
CRE and KNFEC, together with government loans. This phase is scheduled to be
completed in 1977.
PHASE II:  This covers electrification in the areas of Potosi, Chuquisaca, Tarija
and La Paz, at an estimated cost of US$12.9 million of which US$9.5 million
represents external financing under AID loan 511-LT-049, and US$3.4 million
represents the local contribution from the sub-borrowers SEPSA, CESSA, SETAR and
INER and from the Government. This phase is scheduled to be completed in 1978.
2.7       The loans mentioned above were granted by USAID to the Bolivian
Government, which in its turn transfers them to the project executing agencies
on the same terms: term 40 years, grace period 10 years, interest 2% p.a. during
the grace period and 3% p.a. during the remainder of the period.
3. Scope of the Program
3.1       The primary objective of the program is to establish a basis for economic
development in rural areas, particularly for irrigation and agroindustrial projects,
and also to contribute actively to social development in the countryside. The
current program, scheduled for completion in 1978, is the first large-scale program
in the country. It is intended to benefit a total of 55,000 rural families and
cover an area of 27,000 ku2.

The project also includes provision of domestic installations for subscribers.
It is anticipated that the latter will repay this cost over a period of 20 years,
with a low interest rate as part of their service bills.
Rural customers would pay the same tariff as urban customers. Since
the cost of service will usually be higher in rural areas, this means that the
urban sector will be subsidizing the rural sector.

Outline of Terms of Reference for a Tariff Study in the North and Oriental Systems
1. Objective
1t.1      The purpose of the study is to derive tariff structures which reflect
as closely as possible the costs to the economy of meeting the demand for elec-
tricity subject to any constraints imposed by the revenue requirements of the
utilities to meet their financial objectives and by any income distribution ob-
jectives (e.g. subsidizing poorer consumers) which the electricity tariffs may
be required to serve.
2. Outline of Study
Suggested guidelines for the execution of the studies for BPC and ENDE-
CRE are as follows:
2.1 Analysis of Cost Structure
2.1.1     The relevant costs are not the financial costs to the utilities of
expanding and operating their system to meet the demand but the
incremqental costs to the economy. Strictly speaking, therefore, shadow
prices (for capital, labor and foreign exchange) rather than actual
prices to the utilities should be used as appropriate for measuring
costs and any taxes on the utilities' inputs should be deducted and
subsidies added back. It is suggested that the opportunity cost of
capital for discounting future costs should be taken as 10%, considering
possible changes which could alter the least cost solution envisaged
in the expansion programs.
2.1.2     It is expected that the first step would be to analyze the marginal
costs of generating, transmitting and distributing electricity at
different places, times and voltage levels to different consumers over
the next few years, defined for the purpose as the period 1976-81.
This would require due attention to the daily and seasonal variations
in forecast systems demands and to the extent possible, in forecast
demands of various consumer classes. Much of the required information
for this purpose may have to be specially collected e.g. by taking
substation readings, by enquiring about shift-working, seasonal work-
patterns, etc. and by statistical analysis of available load curves.
The basis for the estimates of marginal costs would be the development
program for the period 1976-81, the proposed operating regime and
proposals for subsequent expansion.



Page 2 of 4
2.1.3     For time periods when demand does not come up against capacity
constraints (allowing for the reserve margins set to maintain
security of supply) marginal costs would be simply marginal run-
ning costs grossed up to allow for losses at the different voltage
-     levels and, where relevant, in different regions.  The relevant
losses are incremental losses, even if they can be estimated only
approximately, not average losses.
2.1.4     At periods when an increase in sales would cause the security
constraints to be exceeded, the marginal cost of meeting demand would
be the addition to all systems costs resulting from adding to genera-
tion capacities and/or storage, transmission and distribuaTon i;  order
to provide the increased supply with an unchanged probability of
failure. Where relevant, the studies should contemplate the impact
of local peak demands which do not coincide with the system peak.
2.1.5     It would also be necessary to study the incremental costs attributable
to poor power factors for those types of consumer (the larger ones) who
can be expected to improve their power factor in response to suitable
tariff incentives. The most important cost to concentrate on is the
extra MVA capacity required to cater for these poor power factors.
2.1.6     The cost of supply should initially be deteridned for the markets
served by BPC, CRE-ENDE considering:
(i) high density urban'areas; and
(ii) rural areas presently connected to interconnected systems,
together with those to be connected over the study period.
2.2 Existing Tariffs
2.2.1     It is envisaged that the next step would be to examine the existing
tariff structure and rates and compare them with the structure of
marginal costs of supply derived from the foregoing analysis. Large
differences between the two may be an indication that the existing
system is giving the wrong price signals to consumers. Examination
of the existing system should pay particular attention to the types
of metering in use and the quality of meter maintenance, since this
would provide some guidance to what types of tariff are feasible.
Other features to look for in examining the existing system are whether
it is difficult to administer, conducive to disputes or conducive to
fraud, since these will provide useful pointers to improvement in
devising the new tariff structure.
2.3 New Tariff Proposals
2.3.1     With the information thus collected, it should be possible to make a
first set of proposals for changing the-existing tariff systems so
that the incentives (and disincentives) it provides to consumers
correspond more closely to the schedules of marginal costs derived.
These proposals would consist of a classification of consumers and
a tariff (or set of tariffs) for each class, together with any



ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 4
connection charges and charges for reactive power which can be
justified. They would have to be modified as necessary to take
accoant of the following:
(i) Any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs because
of price distortions (e.g. of substitutes for public electricity
supply) elsewhere in the econory which are likely to affect
electricity sales in the absence of such slanting.
(ii) The need for the utilities to secure a rate of return on revalued
net assets in operation of 9% as established in the Electricity
Code. This would generally mean, if the revenues based on marginal
cost pricing are insufficient, raising those elements of the
proposed tariffs where demand is least elastic.
(iii) Any income and redistribution objectives (e.g. through subsidizing
poorer consumers) to which electricity tariffs may be required to
contribute in Bolivia.
(iv) Practicality and cost. There is a trade-off between the cost of
administering any tariff structure (which depends largely on the
cost of metering and billing) and the extent to which it can reflect
the structure of marginal costs. Complex metering, for example,
is likely to be worthwhile only for larger consumers, since the
response of small consumers to the extra incentives (or disincentives)
it offers would not justify the expense.
2.3.2     Modifications of the strict "marginal cost"t tariffs should be designed
to cause the least possible disturbance to the incentives they offer
to consumers in relation to the costs of supplying them.
2.3.3     The new tariffs schedules should provide for the automatic adjustments
of rates in the event of increases in:
(i) the price of fuel for thermal generating plant. The price level
above which this fuel-adjustment clause comes into effect should
be defined;
(ii) the cost of expanding capacity used in the calculation in para. 2.1.4.
2.4  Implementation of New Tariffs
2.4.l     The studies should give careful consideration to the problem of
transition from the old to the new tariffs in order to make the
changeover more acceptable. It should include a plan for the
implementation of the new tariffs structures in stages, possibly
introducing some of the new tariffs as options in the first instance.
The plan should include provision for publicity, meter acquisition
and installation, meter reading and billing, and all necessary staff
training to ensure a smooth transition to the new system.
2.4.2     The studies should also provide comprehensive recommendations for
General Conditions for 3Spply of Electricity, which would inter alia
include regulations for payment of indemnifications by consumers (for
damage to any part of the installations, unauthorized use of electricity,



MINWX  4
page 4 of 4
unmetered supply, breaking of seals, etc.), payment of indemnification
to consumers (e.g. for inaccurate metering), connection and disconnection
charges, interest and penalties for nonpayment of bills and similar
subjects. The consultants should also review the coverage of the
points mentioned in para. 2.4.2 in the Electricity Code and/or in the
Reglamentos of the various utilities and make the necessary recommendations.
2.5 Recommendations for further work
2.5.1     The study should include detailed recommendations for any further work
which may be required, such as measurement of load curves for different
classes of consumers, studies of losses, methods for approximating peak
and off-peak demand schedules, their price elasticities and cross-
elasticities both for the short and long runs, cross-elasticities of
electricity and sub3titutes like gas; etc.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. (ENDE)
BOLIVIA
Description of the Project
1.  Expansion of the Santa Isabel Hydropower Scheme
1.1       The proposed expansion of the Santa Isabel project consists of:
a) extension of the present powerhouse;
b)  installation of a third Pelton unit (18 MW) and the associated
mechanical and electrical equipment;
c) installation of the second penstock (2,650 m) with an inner
diameter diminishing from 1.25 m to 1.15 m at the beginning of
the manifold;
d) a compensating pond with a storage volume of 100,000 m3; and
e) the rio Vinto intakes.
Second Penstock for the Santa Isabel Power Plant
1.2       A second penstock is necessary since the existing penstock suffered
damage during the acceptance tests for the Santa Isabel power plant, and any
further damage to the penstock would put the station out of service for at least
three months. Also, if the new generating unit were to be connected to the
existing penstock: (a) it would be necessary to put the station out of service
for at least 20 days, with the consequent problems of rationing power and energy
in the central system; and (b) the friction losses would increase and the plant's
capacity would be reduced by some 4.2 MW (from 54.2 MW to 50.0 MW).
Compensating Reservoir
1.3       The compensating pond will allow a certain independence and flexibility
in the simultaneous operation of the Corani and Santa Isabel hydroelectric power
stations, arranged in tandem. The reservoir will be constructed in the Pmpa Tambo
plain, between the tailrace of the Corani statjon and the intake of the Santa Isabel
station, and will have a capacity of 100,000 m . Special attention will have to be
paid to the impermeabilization of the reservoir bottom owing to the permeable nature
of the soil.
Rio Vinto Intakes
1.4       The Rio Vinto intakes will be built on-the two arms of the river.  The
average flow of the river is 1 m /sec, which makes possible generation of an
additional 35 GWh in the Santa Isabel station.
1.5       The concrete intake linked to a sandtrap will be connected to a 522-m
pipe in the north arm and a 320-m pipe in the south arm, both masonry lined.
The pipe will carry the water to an intake of the Santa Isabel tunnel through the
access gallery which was made during construction of the first stage of the station.

2.  Gas Turbine at Santa Cruz Power Plant
2.1       The proposed project includes sup ly and erection of a package gas turbine,
and associated equipment with a capacity of approzimately 22 tlW at an mblient temp.-
rature of 300C and an altitude of 460 a above asa levels simiar to the existin&g.es.
The unit will be installed on a site adjoining the proesnt gas turbines. The unit will
be designed to operate in parallel with the preset station or as a separate and inde-
penient power plant.  With the commisioning of this unit early in 1978, the power
requirements of the Santa Cruz system can be satisfactorily not up to 1981.
3. Central Transmission System
3.1       The expansion of the transmission system includes:
a) a 115 KV single circuit line between the Sacaba and Vinto substations
over a distance of approximately 150 km with galvanized steel towers,
397.5 MCM (ACSR) conductors and a ground wire. The line, jointly with
the line between Catavi and Vinto to be financed by IDB, will complete
the ring linking the generating plants and Vinto substation providing
high quality service in the supply of power to the mines in the
Oruro area, and will form an integral part of the future interconnec-
ting facilities with the northern power supply system;
b) extension of one 115 KV line bay in Sacaba substation;
c) installation of Vinto substation with a three phase power transformer
of 12/16/20 MVA, 115/69 KV, three 115 KV line bays, one 115 KV
transformer bay and one 69 KV transformer bay;
d) extension of Cochabamba substation incorporating a three phase power
transformer of 7.5/10 MVA, 115/10 KV, one 115 KV transformer bay;
one 69 KV transformer bay and four 115 KV circuit breakers; and
e) installation of 10 MVA, 13.2 KV shunt capacitors in Oruro substation.
4. Eineerina Services
The consultant services will izylude the following:
a) preparation of specifications for the various equipment, material and civil
works of the generating and transmission facilities;
b) evaluations of equipment bids and purchase recomundations;
c) preparation of drawings and specifications for construction; and
d) supervision on site during construction.
The consultants services have been estimated in 255 Man-month with an average cost
of US$5,100 man-month, with the following breakdown:

As shown in fig. 1 the critical path for the extension of the Santa Isabel
plant (which is itself the critical element of the project) is given by
activities: 1-2-4-5-6-9-11-12-13-14. The variance of Te (the earliest expected
time) for the project completion is the sum of the nine variances along the
critical path and equal to 20.8 weeks. This may be interpreted to mean that
the tine to complete the Santa Isabel pz-oject is a random variable, normally dis-
tributed, with mean 202.6 weeks and standard deviation 4.6 weeks. This distri-
bution is shown in fig. 2.
There is a 95.5"" probability that the Santa Isabel hydropower project
would be completed in the period roughly between 193 and 212 weeks.
The schedule for the gas turbine would be as follows:

Return on InveMstmnt
1.        The following assumptions have been made to calculate the rate of
return on the investment:
(a) because the Santa Isabel hydropower plant and the associated
transmission system are only a part of ENDE's generating and
transmission expansion in the Central-Southern systems and
benefits cannot be directly attributed, the rate of return
calculated corresponds to the expansion program in which the
benefits are measured by incremental revenues attributable to
the investment in the expansion program;
(b) the capital costs (net of duties and taxes) are at December 31, 1975
constant prices;
(c) Investments in distribution have been estimated for the period
1976-1978 as follows:
Central-Southern Systems               Us$8.7 million
Oriental System                        US$7.0 million
(d) it has not been necessary to use shadow prices for labor, materials
and for the foreign exchange because their market value is believed
to approximate their economic value;
(e) although the current priges of gas fuel in Santa Cruz and Sucre
are 0. 3 and 0.35 US$/10 BTU, respectively, a fuel price of 0.82
US$/100 BTU, which corresponds to the present price of gas sales
from Bolivia to Argentina, has been adopted;
(f)  useful life:  hydropower plants:          50 years
transmission system:       30 years
gas turbines:               20 years
distribution systems        30 years
(g) R venues include taxes of 10% for residential bills;
(h) Residential and general sales:  eoual to 27to of total incrementql
sales in line with Annex 10.

2.        Return on Investment
Central-Southern System
(a) the stream of costs (excluding depreciation and taxes) and revenues
(including taxes) for the basic assumptions are shown in the table
on Page 3 of this Annex. The return on the investment is 18.9%; and
(b)  a sensitivity analysis of the return on the investment to changes
in costsand revenues shows that: (i) a 10% increase in capital
cost would reduce the rate to 17.5%; (ii) a drop in revenues by 10%
would reduce the rate from 18.9% to 16.5%; and (iii) a combination
of 1t0% increase in capital costs and a drop of 10% in revenues would
reduce the rate of return to 15%.
Oriental System
The streams of costs and benefits are shown on page 4. The return on
the investment is 27%. A 10% increase in capital cost would reduce the
rate to 25%. A drop in revenues by 10% would reduce the rate from 27%
to 23.8% and a combination of 10% increase in capital costs and a drop
of 10% in revenues would reduce the rate of return to 22%.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fixed Assets
1.        The fixed assets were revalued in 1972 in accordance with the
provisions of the October 1972 devaluation of the Bolivian peso. Despite
this revaluation ENDE's fixed assets as of December 31, 1974 were under-
valued. Effective January 1, 1976 ENDE revalued its assets using a method
acceptable to the Bank as described below. The average life of ENDE's fixed
assets is about 33 years and the annual depreciation rate of about 3%, applied
on a straight line basis, is considered reasonable.
Method for Revaluing Fixed Assets
2.        The method used to revalue assets considerss (1) internal inflation
as measured by the Consumer Price Index for La Paz prepared by the Instituto
Nacional de Estadistica, (2) external inflation as measured by the Bureau
of Reclamation's Price Index for Electrical Equipment, and (3) changes in
the exchange rate of the Bolivian peso. Assets and depreciation were revalued
with these indices since 1967, the year in which ENDE started its fixed assets
records. Since the 1972 revaluation was only partial it was eliminated and
then the indices above were applied. As of December 31, 1974 the revaluation
amounted to 76% without considering the 1972 revaluation, and to 36% net of
the 1972 revaluation. As detailed in Annex 20, projected fixed assets consider
revaluation estimates at the inflation rates shown in Annex 25.
Investments and Long-Term Receivables
3.        The long-texm investments and accounts receivable as of December 31, 1974
amounted to $b 67.1 million, or about 7% of total assets; it is composed of
(1) $b 17.5 million long-term loans to ELFEC, $b 40.0 million long-term loans
to CRE, (2) $b 9.5 million-equity in ELWEC, SETAR and SEPSA, and (3) $b 0.1 million
long-term receivables. Most of the long-term loans have been made out of proceeds
of external loans; ENDE agreed to act as coordinating agent between the external
agency involved and both ELFEC and CRE accepting full responsibility for the loans.
These loans carry a weighted average interest of 3.6% for a weighted average
term of about 22 years.
Accounts Receivable
4.        During the period 1972-1974 ENDE has maintained almost four months
billings in accounts receivable. Although this has not been a problem for
ENDE in the past the high level of receivables may produce liquidity problems
in the future. The causes of this high level of receivables can be traced to
a weak financial position of the distributing companies. The Government has
promised to solve the latter problems through tariff increases and ENDE to

reduce the level of receivables to three months billings in 1976 and to two
months in 1977 (see paragraph 6.05,.
Capi tal
5.        Almost all of ENDE's paid-in equity (US$20,515 thousand) is owned
by the Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (CBF) and nominal amounts (US$2.0
thousand each) are owned by the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB)
and by the Corporacion Minera Boliviana (COMIBOL). The equity is denominated
in American dollars and has been translated at the rate of US$1 = $b 20. Despite
pressures from CBF, ENDE has followed the policy of nonpayment of dividends
and all net profits are capitalized with the exception of the payment of one
month salary to its staff in accordance with existing legislation (see
paragraph 6.06). This policy has produced a good capitalization rate. ENDE's
capitalization as of December 31, l974 was as follows:
In millions   In millions
of $b        of US$      % of Total
Equity (paid-in capital)       410.37          20.52          46

.==== ...      m===
6.        In 1964, the Association granted to the Republic of Bolivia a
Credit (62-BO) for US$5 million which was relent to BPC; the service of this
debt was to be capitalized by ENDE as equity contributions from CBF. BPC paid
the installments due December 1972, 1973 and 1974 at the exchange rate of
US$1 = $b 12.089 instead of at the new rate of US$1 = 20.38- this aroduceda
difference of $b d.0 million.  Iuring negotiationa, iaQ -   - Wd uvzw
that it will continue to press BPC to adjust the payment to the new exchange
rate.

Long-Term Debt
7.        Long-term debt has been translated at current exchange rates.
Long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 1974, amounted to $b 441.2
millon (US$22.1 million), with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%
and a weighted average repayment period of about 22 years. The US$98.3
million long-term debt that OWDE will contract during the period 1976-1981
wil1 raise the weighted average interest rate to 8% by 1981 and will lower
the weighted average repayment period to about 16 years.   ENDE
proposes to purchase t h e second 22.8 NW gas turbine at Santa Cruz with
an AEG Kanis credit; the proposed terms of this credit--10 years including
two years of grace, an interest rate of 2.5% over LIBOR, a 0.75% commitment
charge and a 2% one-time fee_are burdensome. These terms are the usual
commercial terms for loans which other Bolivian Government agencies have
been able to obtain of late; although ENDE is still negotiating this loan it
will be very difficult to soften these terms. Long-term debt service is
expected to be suitably covered. As of December 31, 1974, IDA's participation
on EhDE's long-term debt amounted to US$8.4 million, or 38% of the total; the
joint Bank-IDA participation is expected to increase to US$34.0 million, or
28 % of the total, by December 1981. While the debt-equity ratio of 45/55
expected by 1981 would be below the 1974 level of 50/50, the average maturity
of debt will be somewhat shorter, as noted above. However, ENDE will continue
to enjoy a sound capital structure.
Debt Service
8.        During negotiations ENDE agreed not to incur additional debt
without prior consultation with the association if net revenues cover the
maximum debt service on existing and proposed debt by less than 1.5 times.
The analysis in Annex 23 reveals that even the low 1975 net revenues cover
the maximum debt service on existing debt by more than 1.5 times. However,
when adding the maximum debt service on debt ElDE expects to incur in 1976
the ratio is only 0.6 for 1976 net revenues.
9.        Several Credits granted by both IDA and IDB to the Republic of
Bolivia were relent to ENDE at the terms carried at the time by the Bank and
IDB loans. The debt service differential was to form a pooled fund formed by
debt service differentials on credits relent to all Bolivian sectors, the
Fondo Fiduciario. This Fund is administered by an interministerial decision
group who contributes these monies back to the various sectors in accordance
to a set of priorities that this group establishes. As of December 31, 1974,
pending a decision on ENDE's request to be permitted to capitalize automatically
the debt service differential, it had not paid a total of $b 7 million
(US$0.35 million) interest differential on IDA Credit 148-BO and IDB Loan 4/UK-BO
During negotiations the Govexnment indicated that it will agree to EIDE's
request.

Tariff Level and Rate of Return
10.       During the period 1972-1974 energy sales increased at an annual
growth rate of 1 ?% and average revenues per kWh at a rate of 22%; as a
consequence total operating revenues grew at a rate of 45%; however, since
operating expenses increased at a higher annual growth rate (63%) net operating
income grew only at a rate of 32%. This deterioration of net operating income
is also reflected in the increase of the operating ratio (operating expenses/
operating revenues) from 40% in 1972 to 50% in 1974. Due to the low tariff
increases obtained by EDB  in the period 1972-1974 as compared, mainly, to the
growth of its operating expenses, the rate of return on partially revalued
assets decreased from 9.3% in 1972 to 6.7% in 1974 (with an average of 8.1%
for the period) and to 5.9% on fully revalued assets in 1975. The decreasing
trend in the rate of return has been of some concern since its continuation
would have an impact on ENDE's ability to carry out its expansion programs in
the future, particularly when considering the harder credit terms the cQmvany
will have to sustain in the future (see para. 7). the tWo-step tariff mhrease
granted to ENDE in 1976 is designed to achieve a 9% rate of return on assets
revalued through December 31, 1975 (no transfers to plant in operation are
forecast during 1976). The Government indicated during negotiations that it
would in future years use the average of revalued net fixed assets in operation
during each year to compute the rate base. The rate of return expected for
1976 on the latter basis is 6.4%.

Assumptions Used in Financial Forecasts 1975-1981
1. Revenues
Ener&Z sales were assumed to grow at an average annual growth rate
of 17.5% which is in line with historical growth rates; annual estimate
demands consider consumption of certain new mining and industrial concerns.
A more detailed analysis by system is shown in Annex 10.
Average revenue per kWh was computed to provide for a rate of return
of 9% on revalued assets starting in 1976 (see Annex 18). average revenue per
kWh grows from ¢b 43.69 (US¢ 2.18) at end-1975 to  b 84-84  (TUS* 4.24) for 1981,
which would imply a12 % annual rate of growth. However, the 1981 average
revenue would remain constant if empressed in 1W73 dollars.
2.        Operating and maintenance cost were projected on the basis of 1975
costs escalated with the estimate inflation rates shown below and with factors
for additional personnel and materials required by expansion as follows
Average Annual   Percent of
1975 Costs    Rate of Growth   Total Costs
Materials            $b  4,885 thousand        32%           27.5%
Personnel            $b 14,700 thousand        10%           72.5%
Weighted average                               16%
Plus:  Average inflation rate                  12%
Total                                       28
Personnel costs for 1975 amounted to $b 23.5 million of which
$b 14.7 million were charged to expenses and $b 8.8 million were capitalized;
social benefits increase gross contractual payroll by about 70%. These
proportions were assumed to remain constant. As of end-1975 ENDE had a staff
of 253, of which 105 were professionals.
Average Fuel Cost
Gas - Santa Cruz $b 2.647/106 Btu = US$ .13/10  Btu
Gas - Sucre $b 6.8/106 Btu = US$ .3h/106 Btu
Diesel Oil - $b 23.2/106 Btu = US$1.16/106 Btu
Dual Fuel - Santa Cruz $b 4.3/106 Btu = US$0.21/106 Btu

Others                                      20%
3.        Inflation re.tes have been assumed as follows:
1976      1977-1979      1980-1981
local costs       14%          12%           10%
Foreign costs     10%           8%            7%
4.       Working capital items were computed as follows:
Accounts receivable             4 month billing in 1975
3 month billing from 1976
Other receivables               5% annual increase
Materials and supplies          1.5% of average annual gross fixed
assets in question
Notes and accounts payable 0.5% of foreign cost component of construction
plan
Interest payable                3 months interest on long-term debt.
5.        _NP
UTNP granted MDE in 1974 as its cooperating agency US$621,400 for
carrying out electricity related studies; final disbursements of US$512,000
are expected to take place in the period 1976-1979.
