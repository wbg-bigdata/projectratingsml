MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
THE KALIMANTAN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$136 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20
years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance
the Kalimantan Urban Development Project (KUDP). Part of the proceeds (US$33.5 million equivalent)
would be onlent by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to the five municipalities of Banjarmasin,
Balikpapan, Palangkaraya, Pontianak and Samarinda and their water enterprises (PDAMs) for a period
of 20 years at an annual interest rate of 11.5% which reflects the 6 month average of the 3-month
Sertifikat Bank of Indonesia rate at the time of project appraisal. The Government will bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.          Background. Indonesia's urban population exceeds 55 million and is growing at over 5 %
per year, more than twice the overall national rate. About 80 million Indonesians (about 40% of the
population) will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Infrastructure services lag behind. Only about 20-
25% of the urban population have direct access to piped water supply with the balance relying on
standpipes, shallow wells, vendors and surface water. Less than 60% of the urban households have
proper toilet facilities (39% with septic tanks), the balance share toilets or use waterways for sanitation.
In the larger cities, inadequate residential and industrial water supply, and liquid and solid waste disposal
cause serious environmental and health problems. The urban poor, who constitute 17% of the urban
population, are the more affected by deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental conditions.
Despite past progress in the provision of urban roads, some 60% of urban households still rely on access
roads less than three meters wide, and in 1990 some 25% of municipal roads were in poor condition.
Vehicle emissions are increasingly being recognized as the dominant source of localized air pollution and
health problems in cities. Moreover, there is limited traffic management in central areas, and public
transport is insufficient in many cities in Indonesia. To meet GOI's equity objectives, more investment
is needed in low-cost systems for poorly served urban areas.
3.          BAPPENAS is responsible for overall planning and the allocation of resources, based on
Five-Year Development Plans (Repelita) and Annual National Development Budgets (APBN). The
Ministries of Home Affairs and Public Works are respectively responsible for overseeing regional
governments and most infrastructure investments through provincial offices, that also execute centrally-
financed infrastructure projects. All key agencies with responsibilities in the urban sector are represented
in GOI's Interagency Coordinating Team for Urban Development (TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS, the
National Development Planning Agency. In this context, GOI relies on Integrated Urban Infrastructure
Development Programming (IUIDP) for improving local government management, infrastructure
investment planning, revenue mobilization and consultation between various levels of government--
Repelita VI, for the period 1994-98, builds on the IUIDP for achieving urban infrastructure and service
improvements. The central government also has a dominant role in financing local services through its
grants. Grants help resolve the disparity between local needs and local resource mobilization, which is
constrained by the limited ability to levy and collect taxes. Over the medium to longer term, GOI also
intends to increase resource mobilization at the local level; this will include more local borrowing at
market rates. GOI's strategy is to decentralize decision-making on urban sector matters.



4.           Kalimantan. Kalimantan lies directly north of Java. Its large area, 540,000 km2, is
endowed with abundant natural resources--in particular forests, oil and gas. Extractive and processing
activities expanded greatly in the 1980s and accelerated growth of urban centers, particularly in East
Kalimantan. Urban populations grew at 5.7% average during the 1980s, and most of the growth occurred
in the project cities. By 1993 of a total urban population of 2.5 million (20% of the population), almost
2 million were in these cities. The economic growth in modern sectors had considerable spillover
benefits but traditional sector activities predominate; they command lower incomes and some 15% of the
urban populations remain in absolute poverty--still, poverty incidence is higher in rural areas.
5.           As happened in other Indonesian cities, development of infrastructure did not match
population growth. Service levels are low, though variable across cities, in all sectors: clean water
(access ranges from 20% to 40% of the population), sanitation (commonly open drains and rivers are
used for sanitation needs), solid waste (final sound disposal sites are missing), drainage (drains are
clogged and flooding is common), and roads (roads need upgrading and extension). Services are further
affected by the project cities being low-lying, with high water tables, and most of them, subject to tidal
effects. Given the service backlog and further expected population growth, it is urgent and highly
justified to improve the urban infrastructure of the project cities.
6.           Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. The Bank's experience with 12 completed and
seven ongoing urban and water supply projects has elicited the following lessons in particular: (a) limited
planning and implementation capacity at the central level and the nature of local services reduces the
efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity building at the local level is a long-term process that
needs to be accompanied by an increase in local responsibility and accountability; (c) central-local
financial relations need to provide more local government autonomy; and (d) private sector involvement
needs to be enhanced. The project design builds on these lessons.
7.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia,
which is being presented to the Board on March 21, 1995, highlights the need for improving public
services delivery, especially to the poor, greater decentralization of responsibilities, and improved
environmental management. The project is fully consistent with this Country Assistance Strategy, because
it supports increasing decentralization of responsibilities for urban management and implementation to
the municipal governments of the five project cities; it integrates environmental improvement actions into
urban infrastructure development; it strengthens local government institutions and human resources for
more efficient urban management; and it provides services to lower income groups and underserved
areas.
8.           Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project are to:
(a)  improve the provision of urban infrastructure services and the efficiency of urban investments;
(b)  promote stronger, more autonomous, and financially more independent municipal governments;
(c)   contribute towards poverty reduction, mainly through better access to essential services; and
(d)  improve the urban environment.

9.           Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would finance:
(a)   Urban roads - arterial, collector and local roads, and bridge, upgrading and construction, and
improved traffic management (26% of base cost);
(b)  Water supply - source supply enhancements, improvements to transmission, storage and
distribution systems, reduction in non-revenue water, new house connections and standpipes, and
technical assistance (25%);
(c)   Drainage and flood control - channel rehabilitation, selective widening and deepening, removal
of bottlenecks (such as undersized culverts and bridges), and measures to improve areas subject
to frequent flooding (6%);
(d)  Human waste disposal - pilot on-site sanitation programs, construction of communal toilets,
construction of pilot trunk and interceptor sewers, waste water treatment plants, and procurement
of sludge disposal equipment (9%);
(e)   Solid waste - construction of new disposal sites and procurement of collection equipment (6%);
(t)   Kampung and Market Improvement Programs (KIP and MIP) - improvement of poor kampungs
(neighborhoods), benefitting about 300,000 people in the five cities, as well as rehabilitation and
improvement of high priority markets, and provision of infrastructure to low income housing
developments and pilot urban renewal schemes (22%);
(g)  Technical assistance for institutional development and capacity building (about 5%). This covers
institution building, program management/implementation (in support of greater local
responsibility and autonomy), sector development studies, and preparation of a follow-up 5 year
plan for the 5 cities; and
(h)  Design and engineering services for construction works (5%) is included in (a) to (t) above.
10.         Project costs and financing plan.  Schedule A provides details on project cost and
financing. Retroactive financing of US$5 million has been proposed for eligible project expenditures
incurred after May 31, 1994 for consultants' services, goods and civil works in order to make an early
start on the implementation of the program.  Schedule B sets out the amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key project processing events, and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The Staft Appraisal
Report No. 13154-IND dated February 24, 1995, is being distributed separately.
11.         Project Implementation. The principal implementing agencies are the Cities of Balikpapan,
Banjarmasin, Palangkaraya, Pontianak and Samarinda and their water enterprises. A Project Management
Unit and a Project Monitoring Office in each city will coordinate all project activities city-wide; the
Directorate General of Human Settlements, Ministry of Public Works, will be responsible for subprojects
under central jurisdiction, central technical supervision and overall management of KUDP. Policy and
general program coordination will be provided by GOI's Urban Development Coordination Team
(TKPP).

12.         Project Sustainability. The project design and implementation arrangements draw upon
the lessons of experience: greater involvement of the local governments in all phases of project
preparation through the IUIDP process, ownership through financial contributions from the municipalities
and the water enterprises; more participation in implementation by the project beneficiaries; increased
local resources for increased levels of O&M. These actions are expected to contribute to project
sustainability.
13.         Environmental and Social Impact.  Most project activities would have a positive
environmental impact. Water quality and quantity and sanitation would improve. Pollution would be
reduced in the rivers in the five cities. Appropriate environmental criteria have been incorporated in the
project design.  Project design has also minimized displacement of families.  Compensation and
resettlement for the 40 families affected by the project will follow the two action plans approved by the
Bank and would be monitored through technical assistance and Bank supervision. Compensation and
arrangements following consultations with affected and displaced families provide them opportunities to
start new and better lives. The project was classified early on as an "A" environmental assessment
category; an Executive Summary of the EA was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 11, 1994.
14.         Impact on Poverty. The project is expected to improve significantly the quality of life and
environment in the poorer kampungs of project cities. The population with access to piped water could
double while costs to poorer consumers would be reduced. Drainage and flood control components would
reduce the frequency and duration of floods in the low-lying areas where mostly poor people live. The
KIP/MIP components, targeted on poor neighborhoods, will benefit some 500,000 persons or 25 % of the
urban population.
15.         Azreed Actions: At negotiations the Borrower agreed inter alia to the following (recorded
in Schedule 5, Parts A ((a) and (b) below)) and C ((c) to (h) below)) of the Loan Agreement):
(a)   local government commitment to implement the agreed PJMs/LIDAPs/RIAPs including
increases in fees for solid waste and sanitation;
(b)   PDAMs will implement tariff increases by no later than January I of 1996,1998 and 2000
as necessary to fully cover O&M as of FY1996 and O&M and depreciation by FY1999;
PDAMs will consult the Bank, for any additional investment exceeding Rp 2 billion; and
to enhance the self-financing capacity of PDAMs, PDAMs will be allowed to retain profits
and use them for their project investments;
(c)  to prepare and agree with the Bank on a revised training program no later than 6 months
after loan effectiveness;
(d)   payments to local contractors would be made from the KPKN provincial offices;
(e)  to review with the Bank, not later than November 30 each project year, (i) the proposed
budgets for the following year, including any proposal to include a new project component
and (ii) the O&M expenditures for the previous year and to issue the respective budget
approvals by January 15 for PDAMs and May I for other agencies, each project year;
(f)  to carry out yearly technical audits and discuss the audit recommendations with the Bank;
(g)   a mid-term review with the Bank not later than June 30,1998; and



- 5 -
(h)  to resettle affected people according to the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plans
agreed with the Bank.
16.         The condition for loan effectiveness is that the Project Implementation Agreements and the
Subsidiary Loan Agreeents under the Project have been executed, ratified, and are legally binding.
17.         The PPF including charges and accrued interest will be repaid from the loan upon
effectiveness.
18.         With the above agreements and assurances, the project would be suitable for a Bank loan
of $136 million equivalent with a 20 year maturity including a 5 year grace period, at the standard Bank's
variable interest rate. The Borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.
19.         Project Benefits and Risks.  The project would benefit the inhabitants of the five
Kalimantan cities by improving the quality, reliability and accessibility of urban infrastructure services.
Water supply, drainage, and waste disposal investments would greatly improve the living environment
by providing safe water, reducing property damage, and decreasing pollution and the incidence of
diseases. The local economies would benefit from lower transport costs and travel times. Kampung and
market improvements would help lower income households in particular by bettering living conditions
and local commercial facilities. The main project risks are limited management capabilities at the local
level which may cause implementation delays, poor quality, cost overruns and non-achievement of
financial targets. Possible delays in the availability of GOI funds and late approvals by the central
government are also risks to efficient project execution. Steps taken prior to Negotiations and during
implementation, as well as close monitoring by supervision missions, are expected to minimize these
risks.
20.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan wouid comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

The report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Indonesia during May/June
1994. The mission comprised S. O'Humay (EA31N), F. Johansen (EA3IN), D. Hughes (ASTEN), J.
Darmody, J. Bsaies (consultants); and G. Soraya and R. Scouller (EA3RS) from Jakarta. The peer
reviewers were Messrs. J. Kozel (EAIIN), K.S. Lee (TWURD) and P. Stott (EA2TP). Mr. A Khanna,
Chief (EA31N) and Mrs. M. Haug, Director (EA3DR), have endorsed the project.
/a Preparation of the project was protracted largely because the IUIDP process was new to the local
governments in Kalimantan.
