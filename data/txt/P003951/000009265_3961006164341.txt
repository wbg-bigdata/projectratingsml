KALIMIANTAN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (KUDP)
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
LoAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          The Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiaries:     The Cities of Banjarmasin, Balikpapan, Palangkaraya, Pontianak,
Samarinda and their respective Water Enterprises (PDAMs).
Amount:            US$136 million equivalent
Terms:             Repayable in 20 years including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate
Onlending Terms:  Out of the loan proceeds, US$33.5 million equivalent would be onlent
by the Central Government to the five municipalities and their Water
Enterprises (PDAMs) at an annual interest rate of 11.5%,,the prevailing
6 month average of the 3-month Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (SBI) rate at
the time of appraisal for a term of 20 years, including 5 years grace.
Both Municipal Governments and their PDAMs are fully responsible for
the interest during construction. The Central Government bears the
foreign exchange risk.
Project Objectives
and Description:   The main objectives of the project are to (a) increase the provision of
urban infrastructure and services and the efficiency of urban
investments, (b) promote stronger, more autonomous, and financially
more independent municipal governments, and (c) contribute towards
urban poverty alleviation, mainly through better access to essential
services and an improved urban environment.
The project would finance priority investments in the five municipalities
in:  (a) urban roads; (b) water supply and distribution systems;
(c) storm drainage and flood control; (d) solid waste collection and
disposal; (e) human waste disposal (sewerage and on-site sanitation
facilities); (f) multi-sectoral programs for kampung (low income
neighborhood) improvements, market improvements, and infrastructure
for urban renewal pilot projects and for low cost housing developments,
(g) programs for the development and strengthening of local institutions,
(h) programs to increase local revenue generation, and (i) technical
assistance for implementation.



- ii -
Benefits and Risks: The project would benefit the urban populations in the five cities
through provision of better quality and more reliable and accessible
urban infrastructure and services. The water supply, drainage, and
human and solid waste disposal investments would greatly improve the
living environment by providing safe and reliable water, reducing
property damage and productivity losses, and decreasing pollution and
the incidence of diseases. The urban road investments would assist the
local economies by lowering transport costs and travel times. Kampung
and market improvement investments would help low income
populations by bettering living conditions and local commercial
facilities. The main risks are the limited capabilities at the local level
to manage and implement investment programs. In order to mitigate
these risks, appropriate measures have been taken, such as the use ot
standardized procurement documents, increased involvement of the
private sector in O&M delivery, training of staff, introduction of an
MIS system and employment of consultants, managed at the local level,
to assist with implementation. Another positive factor is the strong
ownership of the proposed program by the five municipalities developed
through their close involvement in the preparation process.

Poverty Category:  Targeted intervention: the KIP/MIP component (20 percent of project
cost) will favor the poorer neighborhoods and all the other components
will also, directly or indirectly, benefit the urban poor more than the
non-poor, except probably tor the road component.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:    15% to 40% for roads, minimum 12% for water supply, not quantified
for other components for which however benefits have been estimated
and are expected to cover or exceed costs.

1. URBAN SECTOR
A. SECTOR OVERVIEW
1 . 1       Demographic Trends. The urban population in Indonesia exceeds 55 million and is
growing at over 5 percent per year, more than twice the overall national population growth rate. About
80 million or 40 percent of Indonesians will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Indonesia's urban
settlements include 15 metropolitan and large cities of more than half a million people, 40 secondary
cities of over 100,000 (provincial headquarters and incorporated municipalities), 200 small towns (district
headquarters) over 20,000 and about 3,200 service centers (subdistrict headquarters) with 3,000 to 20,000
people. Seven out of the ten largest metropolitan areas are in Java.
1.2         Institutional Framework.  At the national level, there is no single ministry for urban
development. The National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS, is responsible for overall
planning and allocation of resources, focussed on Five-Year Development Plans (Repelita) and Annual
National Development Budgets (APBN). Within BAPPENAS, the Bureau for Urban Development,
Settlement and Public Housing, under Deputy V (Regional and Provincial Development), is responsible
for oversight and coordination of urban infrastructure development. All key agencies with responsibilities
in the urban sector are represented in the Inter-agency Coordinating Team for Urban Development (Tim
Koordinasi or TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS.
1.3          The principal central ministries involved in urban issues are the Ministry of Home Affairs,
the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is
responsible for oversight of the regional governments, primarily through its Directorate General for
Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) and Directorate General for Regional
Development (BANGDA). The Ministry of Public Works (MPW or DPU) is responsible for oversight
of most infrastructure. Within MPW, the following directorates-general are responsible for urban
infrastructure: the Directorate General for Human Settlements (Cipta Karya or DGCK) is responsible
for oversight of city and regional planning, water supply, urban drainage, sanitation and sewerage, solid
waste management, kampung improvement programs (KIP), and market improvement programs (MIP);
the Directorate General for Roads (Bina Marga or DGBM) is responsible for oversight of urban roads
and bridges; and the Directorate General for Water Resource Development (Pengairan or DGWRD) is
responsible for urban flood control and bulk water supply. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible
for central and local finance through its Directorate General for Monetary Affairs (DGM), while the
Directorate General for Budget (Anggaran or DGA) administers budget transfers.
1.4          At the regional levels, provincial (Level I) and local (Level II) governments operate with
increasing responsibilities and delegated authority.  In all, there are 27 provinces and 301 local
governments, including 54 kotamadyas (urban municipalities) and 247 kabupatens (districts). Legislative
powers at both provincial and local levels are held by People's Representative Councils (Dewan
Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah or DPRD).
1.5          Provincial governments are headed by appointed governors who represent the President
and the central government; the governors also head the semi-autonomous provincial administrations.
Bupatis (district heads) and Walikotas (municipal mayors) represent provincial governments, and head
their own local governments. Regional Development Planning Agencies (BAPPEDA I and II) report
directly to their respective governors, district heads or mayors, and are responsible for planning and
resource allocation. Regional government services are provided by separate departments (Dinas I and
II) analogous to line ministries of the central government.

1.6          Sectoral Coordination and Local Participation. Due to the hierarchical administrative
system, coordination of the urban sector has been difficult and local participation in the decision-making
process has been limited. The large size and diversity of the country, the rapid pace of urbanization, the
number of concerned agencies, the lack of effective management information systems and, perhaps,
cultural constraints to communication within and among agencies, have led to a somewhat fragmented
approach to urban development. In order to improve coordination, especially at the local level, GOI's
policy of decentralization needs to be pursued more effectively.
1.7          Sector Constraints and Priorities.  Average incomes in urban areas have risen
substantially over the past decade; however, income distribution remains relatively unequal and in 1990,
over 17 percent of urban dwellers were estimated to be "absolute" poor based on their expenditure levels.
The problems of low income are exacerbated by deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental
conditions causing health risks among the low income population. Country-wide, only about 20-
25 percent of urban households have direct access to piped water supply, another 15 percent buy drinking
water from vendors or standposts, and the rest rely on shallow wells and sometimes on surface water
courses. Surface water courses in urban areas are frequently polluted due to discharge of inadequately
treated wastewater.  Only about 40 percent of urban households have access to adequate sanitation
facilities. In the larger cities, inadequate industrial water supply, and liquid and solid waste disposal are
serious problems. To meet GOI's service and equity objectives, more investment is needed in local or
tertiary systems in poorly served urban areas. The Bank's 1993 Urban Public Infrastructure Services
Report (No. 12154-IND) estimated that the 1990 infrastructure investment backlog was at least some
US$5 billion for the main four subsectors (piped water, sewerage, urban roads, and drainage). Further,
a substantial backlog prevails in the maintenance of facilities, which has resulted in decreased productivity
of the infrastructure.
1.8          Sector Finances. Finances of provincial and local governments have long been dominated
by central government transfers and are characterized by weak local resource mobilization, low per-capita
budgets and limited use of credit for capital investment. The dominant role of central government grants
for financing local government services is partly due to the limited local authority for levying taxes.
Grants are a way to resolve the disparity between local needs and local resource mobilization. Although
grant allocation criteria have been modified to respond better to local needs and shortfalls (compared to
minimum standards), there is a need to relate grant allocations more to performance and productivity.
The larger infrastructure projects are financed directly from the national budget (APBN/DIP) and are
executed by the regional offices of central government agencies. These projects sometimes lead to
operations and maintenance (O&M) obligations which the local governments are not fully capable of
taking on.
1.9          Urban Infrastructure Issues. The main problems and issues faced by cities are: (a) large
infrastructure deficiencies and O&M backlogs; (b) lack of coordination in integrating infrastructure
investments with land management and transport objectives; (c) weak management of water enterprises
and municipalities, as evidenced by deficient accounting practices, the lack of adequate cost recovery,
revenue generation, and little use of credit as well as poor information systems; (d) inefficient
programming of the design and construction cycles, often compressed into single fiscal years; (e) complex
relationships among local, provincial and central agencies with respect to responsibilities for project and
program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and O&M; (f) shortage of trained and
experienced managerial and technical personnel at all levels; and (g) limited involvement of the private
sector in urban service provision.

B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
1.10         IUIDP Approach. With large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and a fast-growing
urban population, GOI's strategy in the past has emphasized physical infrastructure targets: length of
roads to be built, percentage of population to be supplied with piped water, sanitation services, etc.
These targets have a prominent place in the five year national development plans (Repelitas). In 1987,
GOI issued a Statement of Policies, representing a consolidated view of development in the sector. This
Policy Statement for Urban Development, incorporated in Repelita V (for the period 1989-94) includes:
(a) strengthening local governments to build, operate and maintain local services; (b) improving the
planning and programming of urban infrastructure investments; (c) mobilization of local revenues and
the optimization of their use; (d) implementing coordinated financing and administration systems for local
services; and (e) strengthening consultative processes at various levels of government, particularly the
participation of municipalities and districts.
1.11         GOI's Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programs
(IUIDP) as the operational approach for achieving the above objectives. The policy was translated into
action plans for local institutional reforms (Local Institutional Development Action Plan or LIDAP) and
improvements in local resource mobilization (Revenue Improvement Action Plans or RIAP), sector
planning, and financing arrangements. GOI is providing (with domestic funds) further support to the
reform effort of the local government revenue departments (DISPENDA), initiated under the Urban V
project. GOI has continued to develop the IUIDP process to emphasize the following priorities: (a)
expanding the scope of the IUIDP process to include additional subsectors which are important in
promoting the economic development of cities; (b) strengthening local government institutional
capabilities; (c) improving O&M of urban infrastructure; (d) improving cost recovery and implementation
of a more fully integrated system for the financing of urban infrastructure services; and (e) increasing
attention to urban land and environmental management.
1.12         GOI has issued regulations and policy clarifications to operationalize urban sector policy
and the IUIDP approach; with World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral assistance,
GOI has undertaken a nation-wide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation since 1987; and
UNDP and UNCHS have supported a central assistance team to the IUIDP Management Group (IMG).
More than 50 percent of local governments have so far adopted IUIDP planning.
1.13         Local Borrowing. Under Repelita V, GOI has also given priority to the expansion of
borrowing by local governments and their water enterprises. To induce a higher level of credit financing,
GOI has adopted less conservative financial criteria for borrowing by local entities (debt service coverage
ratio of not less than 1.5 for local government general fund operations and not less than 1.3 for local
enterprises like water supply PDAMs).  This has brought the legal borrowing capacity of local
governments, particularly the larger municipalities, more in line with their considerably underutilized
financial capacity. GOI's strategy is to move interest rates toward market rates over the medium to long
term, but suitable reference rates reflecting market rates for long-term borrowing still need to be defined.
1.14         Repelita VI. Repelita VI and the 25 Year Plan II, both of which started in April 1994,
emphasize sustainable urban development through improvement in the quality of the living environment,
support for economic growth, reduction in regional imbalances, and poverty alleviation.  While
continuing the basic premises of Repelita V and the National Policy Statement for Urban Development
mentioned above, Repelita VI takes a broader approach by expanding the IUIDP into an Integrated Urban
Development Program (IUDP) that includes: (a) a larger number of smaller cities and towns; (b) broader
spatial planning and urban planning in addition to public works infrastructure development plans; (c)
expanding the scope to cover low income and rental housing, infrastructure provision for low-income



- 4 -
areas, and urban renewal; (d) involving the private sector and communities to a greater extent; and (e)
strengthening environmental sustainability. To accelerate decentralization and implementation of plans,
emphasis will be placed on better use of resources, mobilization of local revenues, developing financing
mechanisms, and increasing cost recovery by municipalities and their agencies. Better coordination and
strengthening of local agencies will also be sought.
1.15         Environment and Resettlement.  In late 1993 the GOT enacted Law  51/93 on
environmental impact assessment and mitigation and monitoring measures, and Presidential Decree,
Kepres 55, on land acquisition for public facilities, to improve on earlier decrees and their application.
Law 51 makes further refinements to GOI's environmental assessment procedures, which were already
in line with Bank policies and consistent with best practices under Bank-financed projects. Decree 55
seeks to ensure adequate access to information, fair negotiations, compensation awards based on market
values, and rights of appeal to the courts. A first tier of implementing regulations and guidelines was
issued in March 1994 for Law 51. Kepres 55 still has gaps primarily in the areas of entitlement
eligibility and funding sources, and time will be required to develop implementation capacities based on
local experiences.
C. BANK EXPERIENCE
1.16         Overall Sector Experience. The Bank has been involved in the urban water supply sector
since the 1960s, with relatively little change in approach. While many projects have provided substantial
economic and health benefits, the experience indicates: (a) supply of water has lagged behind increasing
demand; (b) delays in project implementation are common; (c) improving institutions and achieving cost-
recovery have been slow and difficult; (d) water quality is a persistent problem; and (e) disposal of waste
water in densely populated areas has been difficult.
1.17         Bank involvement in the urban sector started in the early 1970s with low cost investment
projects in shelter, water supply, sanitation, and urban transport, aimed at alleviating urban poverty.
Sites and services and slum upgrading projects were to demonstrate replicable approaches benefitting the
poor, while recovering costs and reducing the financial burden on the public sector. Many of these
projects succeeded in physical terms, but had little impact on the policies of national and local
governments and on urban management. The Bank had not paid adequate attention to the policy and
institutional requirements for improving the productivity of the urban economy and reducing urban
poverty, and improving management of the urban environment. Further, as many of the urban programs
did not achieve sustainable policy reform and institutional development, project approaches were generally
not replicable outside the framework of Bank financial support.
.18         By the mid-1980s the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to shifts in approaches
to the urban sector. It was recognized that central governments alone were unable to meet the increasing
needs for infrastructure services of rapidly growing urban populations and greater efforts had to be
devoted to: (a) improving the management capability of urban institutions and inter-governmental fiscal
relations; (b) improving local resource mobilization; (c) enhancing the management and quality of urban
infrastructure, particularly with regard to maintenance; (d) establishing enabling rather than constraining
regulatory frameworks; (e) expanding financial services for urban development; and (f) promoting private
sector participation in urban service delivery. Recent initiatives by governments and donors in these areas
reflect a growing appreciation of the importance of policies, institutions, and regulations in formulating
effective strategies to manage urban growth.



1 .19        Experience in Indonesia. The Bank has financed 12 completed and 8 ongoing urban and
water supply projects in Indonesia since 1974, for more than fifty local governments and many of their
water enterprises (see Annex 1).  Urban lending operations in Indonesia have progressed from
demonstration projects in Jakarta through more programmatic investments in selected other large cities,
to sector lending within an agreed policy and institutional framework (although still limited in terms of
area and subsectoral scope). Water supply projects initially covered only a few cities at a time, but later,
like Bank projects in other countries, assisted a large number of urban settlements under one operation.
Details concerning Bank-funded water and urban infrastructure projects are available on file. In urban
transport projects, or the transport components of urban development projects attention has focussed on
road construction and maintenance. Even so, implementation of road schemes has been slower than
expected, quality of construction was frequently an issue related to reduced facility lifespan. Inadequate
attention has been given to traffic management, to improvement of public transport services and facilities
for pedestrians.
1.20         Bank experience confirms that: (a) limited planning and implementation capacity at the
central government level, and the difficulties inherent in providing essentially local services by central
government departments, reduces the efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity building at the
local level is a long-term process that needs to be accompanied by training to achieve an increase in local
responsibility and accountability; and (c) to develop such responsibility and accountability, central-local
financial relations need to provide more local government autonomy and enable private sector
involvement. The proposed project design takes into account these lessons. Significant responsibility
in project implementation will be handled by the local governments and their water enterprises; suitable
training in project management, local revenue administration, and improvements in operations and
maintenance will be provided; and management advisory services will be provided to the water
enterprises.
D. BANK SECTOR STRATEGY
1.21         The Bank has oriented its overall sector lending to assist the Government to deliver
adequate urban infrastructure services in cost-effective ways. GOI and the Bank emphasize improvements
in: (a) service levels, in a regionally balanced fashion, and particularly for the poor; (b) urban
productivity and the effectiveness of investments through better infrastructure planning and programming,
especially at the city level, and through enhanced local government capacity for fiscal management,
revenue mobilization, project implementation and O&M; and (c) the urban environment by enhancing
local government capacity to plan, build and operate infrastructure in an environmentally sound fashion
and also by enhancing community participation.
1.22         In promoting efficient urban development, the Bank's strategy supports the expanded IUDP
approach; however, implementation should include both sectoral and integrated approaches as
appropriate. While all plans should be integrated, in some cases, implementation could be handled
through separate sectoral projects. For example, in smaller municipalities multisectoral projects are
generally of manageable size and complexity; an integrated investment approach would, therefore, be
more appropriate. In other cases, where the requirements of a particular sector are sufficiently large and
complex, both in technical terms as well as on policy, institutional and financial matters, sectoral projects
within the framework of an integrated plan may be better.
1.23         Improving local management capacity is another area where the Bank's strategy is aligned
with that of GOI. Local governments and local institutions such as PDAMs should have well qualified
and well trained staff. In addition, local resource mobilization and retention should be increased. These



- 6 -
issues could be addressed through revenue improvement programs, greater attention to tax collections,
pricing policies to effect cost recovery (O&M costs and a portion of or full investment costs), flexibility
to use funds as needed in priority areas, and increased local borrowing at market interest rates. The Bank
also recognizes that the infrastructure deficiencies are large and that the financial capabilities of local
institutions are limited in the short run; GOI has most tax bases and transfer grants will therefore continue
to be an important source of local financing. In order to optimize their use, grants should be allocated
on an incentive basis.
1.24         The Bank's strategy also promotes establishing an enabling regulatory and planning
framework for urban land management. A key focus of the Bank's strategy will be to support GOI
efforts to establish an effective land management system and simplify other regulations to facilitate more
efficient and environmentally sound urban land use and strengthen land tenure. The Bank is helping the
Government develop improved implementation frameworks for addressing environmental and social
impacts of urban projects.
2. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN KALIMANTAN
A. POPULATION AND URBAN SERVICES
2.1          Population. The Indonesian region of Kalimantan covers the southern three-quarters of
the island of Borneo that is located north of Java. It comprises some 30 percent of Indonesia's total land
area, but no more than 5 percent of the country's population, and even less of its urban population. The
region is divided into the four provinces of West, Central, South and East Kalimantan.
2.2          Kalimantan's most developed urban areas are the three coastal cities and old trading ports
of Pontianak (West Kalimantan), Banjarmasin (South Kalimantan) and Balikpapan (East Kalimantan) and
the inland cities of Samarinda (old center of East Kalimantan) and Palangkaraya (new capital of Central
Kalimantan). Except for Balikpapan, the cities are provincial capitals. Palangkaraya is located some 60
km inland, accessible only by water and air. All five cities are located on at least one major river that
provides them with access to their extensive hinterlands; navigable waterways are the transportation
backbone in Kalimantan. Roads have been developed in and around the major cities but interurban roads
are few, the main ones lying between Balikpapan and Samarinda and in the valley northeast of
Banjarmasin.
2.3          In 1990, about 28 percent or 2.5 million people of Kalimantan's 9.1 million population
lived in urban areas. East Kalimantan contained more than one third of Kalimantan's urban population,
slightly less than one third lived in South Kalimantan, one quarter in West Kalimantan, and less than 10
percent in Central Kalimantan. East Kalimantan has the highest ratio of urban to rural population of
Kalimantan's provinces, followed by South Kalimantan (about one quarter), West Kalimantan (one fifth)
and Central Kalimantan (slightly more than 15 percent). The five largest cities comprised 1.9 million
persons by 1993.
2.4          During the 1980s, Kalimantan's population grew on average at 3.1 percent per annum,
compared to an urban population growth rate of 5.7 percent. Most of the urban population increase in
the decade was absorbed by Kalimantan's five major cities; on average, the increase was 60 percent
(ranging from 35 percent in Banjarmasin to 100 percent in Palangkaraya). During its rapid expansion
in the 1970s and for the most part of the 1980s, Kalimantan's economy attracted labor from other islands,
with in-migration occurring in particular in the industrializing cities of Samarinda and Balikpapan, where
oil, gas and timber dominate the economy, and Banjarmasin, the center of plywood and rubber processing



industries. Kalimantan's rural populations decreased-except for Palangkaraya where rural population
almost doubled (although from a relatively low base). Between 1980 and 1990, rural populations shrunk
on average by nearly 40 percent.

/a For the kotas; growth in suburbs was normally higher, with average urban population growth of 5.7% in
Kalimantan in the 1980-90 decade.
/b Excluding direct oil and gas revenues, most of which accrue elsewhere.
2.5          In 1990, regional GDPs varied markedly among the provinces; from Rp 1.4 trillion in
Central Kalimantan to Rp 10.8 trillion in East Kalimantan, of which about Rp 6.4 trillion due to oil, gas
and related products. Likewise, per capita regional GDPs varied greatly, from about Rp 850,000 ($425)
in West Kalimantan to Rp 3.3 million ($1,670) without direct oil, gas and related product revenues that
accrue only in part to the local populations, in East Kalimantan. Despite these relatively high average
GDPs per capita, Kalimantan's provinces still have considerable poverty: some 30 percent of the
population in West Kalimantan, 20 percent in Central Kalimantan, and some 15 percent in South and East
Kalimantan, are estimated to be "absolute" poor.
2.6          Urban Services. There are significant backlogs in urban infrastructure services. In the
five cities, between one quarter and less than half of the population is supplied with water by local
PDAMs, either in the form of house connections (20-38 percent) or public taps (2-8 percent). In 1993,
the five water enterprises sold piped water at average tariffs between Rp 415 (Palangkaraya) and Rp 681
(Balikpapan) per m3, and minimum tariffs between Rp 230 and Rp 421 per rn3. Per capita water
consumption from house connections varied from less than 80 liters per day in Pontianak and
Palangkaraya to 140 liters in Samarinda- and 20-30 liters per capita per day from public taps. Service
tends to be rather unreliable, in particular during dry seasons. Most people depend on low-quality water
from shallow wells, rivers and canals as well as rain water, and on high-priced water bought from
vendors or neighbors.



2.7           Between half (Banjarmasin) and more than three quarters (Balikpapan) of the households
are equipped with on-site sanitation facilities, either in the lorm of septic tanks or pit latrines. The
remainder of the population uses public sanitation facilities or open places and rivers for their toilet needs.
In addition, the cities have few desludging facilities and disposal sites, and public as well as private
sanitary facilities are poorly maintained.  In particular, overflowing septic tanks result in fecal
contamination of ground (shallow well) water and thus cause water-borne diseases like diarrhea and skin
diseases. High water tables make standard on-site sanitation technologies ineffective and alternative
solutions are required.
2.8           Only 50-60 percent of the population has solid waste collection in the five cities. While
in Samarinda about three-quarters of domestic waste gets collected, it is only one-third in Pontianak.
Frequently, households dispose of their waste by either burning it in their yards, or by dumping it near
their homes or into the nearest river. Burning waste contributes to air pollution; waste accumulation in
rivers and canals reduces the capacity of the drainage system, and contaminates river and coastal waters.
Service levels for non-domestic waste collection tend to be relatively high, varying between 75 and 100
percent. However, municipalities lack environmentally-sound final disposal sites, and adequate collection
and transfer facilities.
2.9           Flooding is a major environmental problem in the five low lying cities covered by KUDP.
Along the rivers, land is often below the high tide water level. Due to insufficient drainage and flood
control capacities, which are at least partly attributable to poor maintenance, floods bring contaminated
water into direct contact with mostly lower income people. Floods also affect buildings and disrupt
traffic.
2. i0         Rapid growth in motorized urban traffic--about one motorized vehicle every 10 persons
in 1990--narrow roads, rights-of-way encroachment, and inadequate traffic management measures, have
resulted in frequent traffic congestion, in particular in the central business districts. In the absence of
effective pollution control measures by central government (e.g., by requiring emission standards and
cleaner engines and enforcement strategies and measures), as well as of local measures to reduce
congestion, air pollution affects the health of urban populations. It is in particular the poor who are more
exposed to detrimental environmental conditions and, thus, to health risks.
2.11          Deficiencies remain both in coverage and quality of services as in Indonesian cities
elsewhere, specifically in or related to: (a) transport infrastructure and planning capability to guide urban
growth and traffic engineering and management to make the most of existing facilities; (b) water
distribution and/or bulk water supply; (c) micro-infrastructure and services and effective and safe low-cost
sanitation techniques in the kampungs, where most low income people live; (d) policies and operational
programs for: (i) O&M of infrastructure and utility services; (ii) revenue generation and the use of
municipal borrowing; (iii) private sector participation in delivery of municipal services; and (e) complex
relationships between municipal and central government authorities with respect to preparation, appraisal,
financing and implementation and O&M of infrastructure services.
B. URBAN PLANNING AND FINANCING
2.12          Development Planning Framework. The problems call for an efficient metropolitan
development strategy matched with a balanced intersectoral investment program using low-cost
technologies where practicable. The poorer communities can participate in upgrading their infrastructure,
without moving out. Much of the growth will continue to take place at the cities' peripheries and the
need to expand investments there, particularly in basic services, is high. Without adequate spatial



- 9 -
planning, the cost of providing these services rises rapidly and unnecessarily over time, and
environmental resources are lost or degraded.
2.13          Each of the five kotamadyas has prepared a master plan containing the main planning
guidelines for urban development, in accordance with central government guidelines. The master plans,
which cover 20 years, were officially approved around 1986; detailed spatial plans were ratified in 1987
by Local Government Regulation No. 8. The broad nature of the master plans as well as changing
socioeconomic factors justify the preparation of more detailed 5-year plans (PJMs); PJMs have been
prepared in the cities since about 1990.
2.14          Central Grant Dependency.  Infrastructure investments in Kalimantan cities have not
matched the rapid growth of the five urban areas. Like other Indonesian local governments, the five
municipalities under the KUDP are dependent on central transfers to a considerable extent because of the
prevailing centralized tax structure.
2.15          Local Revenues.  Local governments' main non-grant revenue sources fall into three
categories: local government taxes; local service charges; and assigned central government revenue.
Growth in local revenues has been fairly good overall in recent years with Palangkaraya and Samarinda
doing better than the others.  PBB (land and building tax) is the largest of these sources in East
Kalimantan and the lowest in South Kalimantan (Table 2.2). Registration, valuation and assessment duties
tor this centrally administered tax are performed by local offices of the Directorate General of Taxation
of MOF. However, major parts of the collection work relating to PBB are performed by, or under the
supervision of, the local governments; 64.8 percent of the gross proceeds, irrespective of the collecting
agency accrues to local government.
2.16          Borrowing. Local governments, apart from their own enterprises, have not made much
use of borrowing for capital projects. Savings after routine expenditures are generally too low to cover
any level of debt service. Until recently local governments were required to restrict the levels of their
borrowing by reference to the "debt service ratio" criterion, broadly defined as the ratio of debt service
(principal repayments plus interest charges) payable in a year, to total revenues available for development
in that year. However, the application of that criterion was unclear and open to varying interpretations.
The maximum permitted ratio was 0.15, which was very conservative. GOI has recently decided to
replace it with one based on a more closely defined minimum "debt service coverage ratio" (DSCR).
This has been stipulated for any given year as: [projected grant and local revenues for the year in question
less projected routine account expenditure on staff, administration and O&M needs] divided by [total
estimated loan charge obligations (interest charges plus principal repayment) arising in that year from
currently outstanding loans and future proposed borrowing]). The minimum ratio required is 1.5.
C. WATER ENTERPRISES (PDAMs)
2.17          The five largest PDAMs of Kalimantan are located in the five project cities. All PDAMs
suffer from weak management and shortage of skilled personnel partly due to the less attractive conditions
of employment the local governments offer and the limited training the staff receive. The management
is normally appointed by the mayor and does not have operational autonomy. All PDAMs are organized
and managed according to national guidelines for water enterprises, which stipulate ownership and
operation by local governments, establishment as a local enterprise, the use of the accrual accounting
convention, and adoption of the National Standard Water Rate Structure (NSWRS) for tariffs. Tariff rates
vary depending on the cost structure of the enterprise and the make-up of its commercial base. The
authority to set the tariff rates sits with the local parliament, as does the distribution of profits.

2.18         All PDAMs are required to prepare annual financial reports for audit either by the BPKP
or public accountants. Financial reports to 1993 have been audited. The financial reports of the last four
years indicate a range of performances from very weak to generally sound. Of the five PDAMs, only
Palangkaraya has growing operating deficits, and it also has the lowest tariffs. PDAM Balikpapan was
able to cover its O&M expenses except for 1992 partly due to an expansion in the distribution system,
and a new treatment plant of 250 I/s which were completed in 1989 and 1991 respectively. PDAMs
Banjarmasin, Samarinda and Pontianak showed relatively stable financial results, Samarinda showing
better performance; however the PDAM Banjamasin recently received an Italian loan to expand its supply
capacity that will strain its finances.
3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION
3.1          In Kalimantan, the IUIDP process began in 1988 when a decision was made to assist the
four provincial governments prepare multi-year expenditure programs based on priority infrastructure
needs, and related financing packages, for the five largest cities on the island, including their water
enterprises. The preparation process itself is seen as a first phase of the project. The assistance for
preparation was provided through consultant services funded initially under the Urban Sector Loan (No.
2816-IND) and subsequently supplemented by a PPF; the technical assistance services were managed
overall by DG Cipta Karya. A first full project preparation report (30 volumes) was completed in August
1992. This report required some revisions, and an in-house team of staft drawn from IMG, Bina Marga,
and Cipta Karya in collaboration with local governments, was set up in May 1993 to finalize the
preparation of the project. A revised report became available in October 1993, and a final report was
completed in May 1994. The preparation phase has been long for a variety of reasons, some with
positive effects on the design and ownership of the project in each city. First, there was a question of
the novelty to the local and provincial staff and their authorities, of the concept of integrated multi-year
programming embodied in the IUIDP process; consultants had to work hand in hand with the local teams,
who were being exposed to new planning approaches; second, Cipta Karya could not adequately supervise
the preparation work of the consultant and local teams due to staff constraints; third, there was lack of
clarity concerniiig the size and both sectoral and geographic scope. However, the efforts have paid off;



- I1 -
the cities have been following the IUIDP approach for their own expenditure planning since about 1990
and have been closely involved in completing project preparation, and the in-house effort, assisted by a
minimum of consultants, was a learning-by-doing exercise that has increased Cipta Karya's capability.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.2          The 1994 Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia, presented to the Board
shortly before the proposed project was appraised, highlighted the need to focus on interregional equity,
delivery of higher quality services and enhanced competitiveness in a climate of macroeconomic stability.
The 1995 CAS further endorses the Government strategy of outward-oriented, labor-intensive growth,
more targeted delivery of social services, and more region-specific interventions. This will be addressed
through a lending program of smaller, regional and more locally managed investments to overcome
bottlenecks in infrastructure services and human resource development; decentralizing responsibilities and
increasing community participation are also part of the objectives, as is reducing pollution and
environmental sustainability. This project is part of a series of urban development projects supported by
the Bank under the IUIDP framework in line with the above objectives. It will make a contribution in
these areas in the five largest cities in Kalimantan and has the following principal objectives: (a) improve
the provision of urban infrastructure services and the efficiency of urban investments, (b) promote
stronger, more autonomous, and financially more independent municipal governments and PDAMs,
(c) contribute towards poverty reduction, mainly through better access to essential services for the urban
poor, and (d) improve the urban environment.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.3          The project will support a 5 year program of high priority expenditures in the five cities
(Banjarmasin, Balikpapan, Palangkaraya, Pontianak and Samarinda) in roads, water supply, drainage and
flood control, human waste management, solid waste management, and KIP/MIP and infrastructure for
pilot urban renewal schemes, complemented by local institutional development action programs to
increase the capacity of implementing agencies and revenue improvement action plans to improve weak
management and revenue generation and collection. The project is summarized below and is described
by city in Annex 2. The detailed plans, by year and financial source by component (the PJMs) are in
separate reports in project files (Annex 3).
3.4          Water Supply. The proposed project component includes in the five cities, investments
in water treatment plants and transmissions and distribution networks, to increase and balance the
systems' capacities; also, investment in rehabilitation and leakage control, to reduce the high proportion
of non-revenue water; and increased operations and maintenance. In all, the expenditures will allow some
105,000 new connections to the piped water system, more reliable services, and better quality water.
Feasibility studies and systems' optimisation studies have identified the exact sizes and lengths of pipes,
reservoirs and booster pumps needed and their location in the cities for increased piped water distribution
in accordance with estimated demand; preliminary engineering studies have been prepared defining the
size, type and location of new water treatment plants and their intakes; programs for leakage control,
house and bulk water meter replacement and new installation are planned early under the project. While
the distribution systems will be laid in rights of way of roads, some land acquisition is necessary for 5
new water reservoirs--a total of about I hectare--affecting, but not displacing, 5 families. Detailed
engineering and procurement documents will be prepared under the project. The project will also assist
in financing supervision of the works.



- 12 -
3.5          The project also includes a) studies to identify future raw water sources; the current
sources in some cities are river locations subject to tidal variation and sea water intrusion; b) advisory
services to improve management, operations and finances of the PDAMs.
3.6          Urban Roads: The five cities have an urban road network of some 1000 km including
national, provincial and local roads. The project would improve its routine maintenance, contribute to
periodic overlays/rehabilitation of some 125 km and improve (widen, upgrade or other works) some 280
km.  In addition, the project would assist in constructing 30 km of new major roads needed to
accommodate traffic flows. Traffic management programs would be implemented in four cities.
3.7          Routine and periodic maintenance needs have been identified with the assistance of
consultants and DGBM/Binkot, following accepted standards in the road administration. Costs have been
based on standard material volumes and unit rates from previous contracts. Road improvements have been
prepared to preliminary design stage, in accordance with the function/traffic on the road. Final designs
and procurement documents will be prepared as needed under the project. The new major roads--dualling
the airport access road in Pontianak, a new ring road/airport access road in Balikpapan and a new ring
road in Banjarmasin--require detailed designs, that will also be done under the project. The final design
of the Banjarmasin ring road will include an environmental study to protect the wetland the road will
traverse.
3.8          Solid Waste Management: The component consists of construction of new final disposal
sites for each city, procurement of bulldozers, dump trucks and containers and construction of transfer
stations. Some 32 ha have to be acquired for landfills, transfer depots and interim disposal sites in the
five cities. The identified landfill sites are on vacant land in low density suburbs. Care will be taken
in not disrupting recycling activities currently undertaken by private operators.
3.9          Sanitation/Human Waste Disposal: The component includes construction of on-site
facilities, including pilot schemes, of pilot sewerage/interceptor schemes and of septic sludge disposal
sites, within the solid waste disposal sites, and procurement of septic sludge disposal trucks. The high
water tables of the project cities make technically ineffective standard on-site sanitation solutions. The
project will try to identify more appropriate and cost-effective technologies through collaboration of the
central and local public work agencies and communities in Banjarmasin, in a pilot effort. The results will
be used in the other cities, and education campaigns, especially targeted at women, will be undertaken
to improve sanitation.
3.10         KIP/MIP/Infrastructure for Low-cost Housing: This component aims at improving all
poor kampungs by 1999: 64 kampungs with an area of about 1000 ha would be upgraded through
provision of roads/paths, drainage, sanitation and water supply, with community participation. The
project would also provide infrastructure, mainly roads, for new low-cost housing developments covering
a total area of about 100 ha, and roads for 3 pilot urban renewal programs, covering 64 ha in down-town
areas. And, the project would improve the infrastructure of 29 markets, with an area of 134 ha in very
poor condition.
3.11         Preliminary surveys and estimates have been made of the KIP/MIP needs by local and
central agencies; consultants under the project will help in finalizing consultations with beneficiaries, final
designs/preparation and procurement documents either for small local contractors or for material
purchases for self-help works. Preliminary designs have been prepared for the pilot urban renewal
programs, that will be undertaken with private participation outside the scope of the project; the project
will assist with final design preparation of roads/paths and their construction. The new low cost housing



- 13 -
developments are being built by GOI's housing agency, and the project will assist with the needed roads
and water supply. No land acquisition is required for these components.
3.12         Drainage: This component includes rehabilitation and improvement of primary and
secondary drains, normalization of river banks and deferred and incremental O&M. The final designs
for the drainage components will incorporate flood control system needs and will review the usefulness
of hydraulic flushing gates for selected locations.
3.13         Project Implementation Support TA: As described above, the project provides
engineering services to help with final designs of works in the program and supervision of their
construction to be done by contractors. The administrative budget to handle the increased workload, 2
percent of the base costs for water supply and 4 percent for other sub-sectors, has been included in the
project cost and will be provided domestically.
3.14         Institutional Development TA and Training: This component consists of assistance for
program management and monitoring, municipal management, improved environmental and resettlement
practices, institutional capacity-building for each of the agencies and technical and management training
for the water enterprises. The project also includes assistance to Bappenas to further, country-wide, the
IUDP concept and practice. The project includes the preparation of strategic urban plans and of medium-
term expenditure programs (PJMs) to follow the proposed project period, but envisages that alternative
sources of finance will be found later, when needed. Annex 7 provides a summary of the proposed TA.
D. PROJECT COSTS
3.15         The total cost of the project, as summarized in Table 3.1 is estimated at Rp 541.2 billion
(US$251.3 million equivalent) including contingencies of Rp 78.8 billion (US$36.6 million) over the
project period, and taxes and duties of approximately Rp 45 billion (US$21 million). Direct and indirect
foreign costs are estimated Rp 177.9 billion (US$82.6 million or about 33 percent of the total project
costs). Base costs have been estimated as of appraisal date. Physical contingencies for civil works and
equipment are estimated at 8 percent and price contingencies are estimated at 9 percent of the base cost
over the implementation period; physical contingencies are lower than average in other projects due to
the program nature of this project; cost of subprojects reflect preliminary estimates but the global
envelopes are relatively firm, under the PJMs. Price contingencies reflect current Bank estimates of
domestic (5 percent) and foreign (2.5 percent) inflation until 2001 and front loading of implementation.
Interest during construction is estimated at US$1 1 million equivalent. The base cost of implementation
support, engineering and supervision, is US$10.3 million (5 percent) and that of technical assistance and
training, is US$1 1.7 million (5 percent). The share of total costs by city is as follows: Balikpapan 19
percent, Banjarmasin 28 percent, Palangkaraya 11 percent, Pontianak 25 percent, and Samarinda 16
percent. Details are in Annex 4.
E. FINANCING PLAN
3.16         The proposed Bank loan of US$136 million equivalent would repay the PPF of US$1.45
million (plus accrued charges and interest) and finance 54 percent of total project costs, or about
67 percent of the project costs net of identifiable taxes, increased administration budget costs and
incremental O&M expenditures. The loan would cover foreign exchange costs of investment estimated
at US$75 million equivalent and local investment costs of US$61 million equivalent. Counterpart funding
would be provided by the central government (US$42.9 million equivalent), provincial governments
(US$3.2 million equivalent), local governments (US$41.0 million equivalent), and water enterprises
(US$28.2 million equivalent). Further, the central and local agencies will fully fund current O&M for

infrastructure and interest during construction on subloans under their respective responsibilities estimated
to add US$48 million to the project cost. Annex 5 provides details of the financing plan; a summary is
provided in Table 3.2 below. Final financing plans for the central and local governments and PDAMs
were confirmed during negotiations, and assurances were obtained regarding timely provision of
counterpart funds. Budget approvals will be issued each project year by January 15 for PDAMs and May
I for other agencies.
3.17         On-lending. Of the Bank loan to the GOI, Rp 28 billion and Rp 44 billion (US$13
million and US$20.5 million equivalent) are to be on-lent by the central government to the kotamadyas
and to the water enterprises. The amount of borrowing was determined on the basis of the willingness
and financial capability of local governments and water enterprises to borrow under subsidiary loan
agreements (SLAs) satisfactory to the Bank. Proceeds of the subloans would cover 91 percent of the
costs (excluding administration costs) to the kotamadyas and water enterprises under the project. Central
government will bear the foreign exchange risk and the risk of interest rate variation. The lending terms
of funds onlent through SLAs are for 20 years, including five years of grace and will carry a fixed
interest rate. The interest and commitment charges would be paid during the grace period. The interest
rate for subloans is 11.5% p. a., the six-month average of the three month Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (SBI)
rate prevailing at the time of appraisal. The onlending rate and amounts and draft SLAs were agreed at
negotiations. Final SLAs acceptable to the Bank should be completed for loan effectiveness and the

overall SLA mechanism will also be discussed in the framework of a sectoral dialogue, as recorded in
minutes of negotiations.
3.18         Central Government Non-Repayable Financing. Of the total central financing of project
costs which are non-repayable by the local agencies, one part, Rp 44.2 billion (US$20.6 million
equivalent) consists of the formula driven and ad-hoc development grants (INPRES Dati II and INPRES
Jalan) that provide cash supplements to regional budgets (Annex 5). The other part, Rp 309.5 billion
(US$143.7 million equivalent), consists of central government development budget (APBN) funds, which
can also be divided into two parts. One part, about Rp 221.5 billion is for infrastructure and technical
assistance and is classified as central government responsibility. These are APBN DIP (national project)
funds and would be distinguished in practical terms by having central government staff as project
managers (Pimpros) and assistant managers (Pimbagpros) responsible for signing contracts. The other
part (Rp 88 billion) is central government grants to local and provincial governments on the basis of an
approved multi-year expenditure program (SPABP) for infrastructure and TA classified as provincial or
local responsibility. Typically the projects financed under the SPABP are implemented and managed by
the staff or project managers of the local governments.
3.19         Regional Financing. About Rp 156.0 billion (US$72.4 million equivalent) or 28 percent
of the total project costs would be financed from regional level resources. These resources include water
enterprise operating revenues (Rp 60.7 billion), second level regional government taxes, assigned
revenues, service charges and other local revenues (Rp 88.3 billion), and contributions from the
provincial government budgets (Rp 6.9 billion).

3.20         Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing for project expenditures started after May
1994 hut before loan signing, could facilitate project implementation.  Expenditure incurred for civil
works contracts and technical assistance and engineering services, would be eligible tor up to US$5
million.  Procurement should be in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures
("Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" of May 1992, as amended, and
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing
Agency" of August 1981). A Project Preparation Facility in the amoupt of US$1.45 million had been
granted by the Bank and was used to finance part of the preparation services. The PPF, charges and
accrued interest will be repaid from the loan after its effectiveness.
4. PROJ.ECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. IMPLEMENTATION AGENCIES
4.1          Implementation of the project will follow standard IUDP procedures being applied under
3 ongoing IUIDP Bank projects and one approved in FY94, although increasing attention is given to
environmental and resettlement aspects. Existing organizations at the municipal level will be responsible
for implementation of the project as mentioned below and schematized in Annex 6:
(a)          Urban Roads and Traffic Management.  The Roads and Bridges Section of the
Municipal Public Works Agency (DPU 11) is responsible for the construction, maintenance and
supervision of local roads and bridges.  Provincial and national roads are the responsibility of the
Directorate of Urban Roads (BINKOT) in D.G. Bina Marga and its provincial offices (DPU 1).
IEngineering consulting support is being provided under the project to assist the agencies.
(h)          Water Supply. The PDAMs are responsible for implementing their respective programs.
Consultants will be appointed by each PDAM under general guidance from Cipta Karya to help them
implement the programs. A project implementation unit will be set up in each PDAM.
(c)          Solid Waste Management. Dinas Kebersihan (Cleansing Agency) in the municipalities
will be responsible for solid waste management activities. It will be supported by technical assistance
to be managed under the PMU.
(d)          Human Waste Disposal/Drainage.  Dinas PU TkIl will be responsible for on-site
sanitation system activities and drainage improvements at the local government level. Implementation
of pilot off-site systems will be the responsibility of DGCK.
(e)          KIP/Infrastructure for Low-cost Housing.  The municipal housing agency (Dinas
Perumahan) in each city will be responsible for the implementation of the KIP components. Consultant
teams, providing assistance on the technical, financial, economic, institutional and environmental aspects,
will be located in the Dinas Perumahan, but will be responsible to the Directorate of Housing, DGCK.
(t)          MIP. The market agency in each city (Dinas Pengelola Pasar) prepares the plans and the
DPU will be responsible for implementation of the MIP component of the project.
4.2          Provincial Agencies.   Provincial governments of Kalimantan will have direct
implementation responsibility for subprojects financed from INPRES I and APBD I funds, that are a
relatively small share of the project funding. The provincial planning agencies (BAPPEDA I) assist local
governments in the normal preparation of funding requests for approval by the central government.

4.3          In order to ensure the availability of full-time staff in the implementation units, the
municipal governments will issue special Letters of Assignment to release staff from their regular duties.
An IMG-approved draft of the official Instruction (SK) on Implementation Arrangements and a final draft
of the Instructions from the city mayors on the establishment of the implementation units were available
for negotiations. Staff for the units have been selected and will be trained prior to loan effectiveness.
4.4          In order to improve project implementation, the GOI will prepare and agree with the Bank
on a training program within 6 months of loan effectiveness, aimed at development of local institutional
capability more broadly (identifying who will provide each of the courses, the duration of each course,
and the prior academic requirements of trainee applicants; and a detailed statement of how the local
governments can access the training program for their staft).
4.5          Project Implementation Agreements (PIA). Project Implementation Agreements (PIA)
have been drawn up between GOI. the five Kotamadyas, and their PDAMs confirming essential
understandings and commitments based upon the medium-term expenditure programs (PJM), financing
plans, Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAP), Local Institutional Development Action Plans
(LIDAP), and sound criteria for land acquisition and resettlement. Through the PlAs, Kotamadyas and
their PDAMs commit themselves to comprehensive sectoral expenditure programs (including O&M
budgets), specific revenue targets and measures to strengthen the institutional capabilities of urban
managements as included in this project. The investment and sector plans can be amended annually to
reflect changing conditions during project implementation, as is the IUDP approach.  Amendment
proposals, if necessary, should include an environmental assessment, a resettlement plan, and a
management and monitoring plan. Draft PlAs acceptable to the Bank between GOI and the Kotamadyas
Banjarmasin, Balikpapan, Pontianak, Samarinda and Palangkaraya and their PDAMs were available at
negotiations and will be finalized by loan effectiveness.
B. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING
4.6          Central Agencies. Coordination and guidance for the project will be provided by the
Urban Development Coordination Team (TKPP, composed of director-general level officials), with the
assistance of the IUDP Implementation Management Group (IMG, composed of directorate-chief level
officials). BAPPENAS chairs TKPP and IMG, and is responsible for daily management of the IUDP
Implementation Support Unit. Overall responsibility for technical supervision and management of the
proposed project in the central government will be assumed by DGCK and DGBM of MPW. DGCK and
DGBM will also be responsible for direct implementation of infrastructure programs classified as central
responsibility, assisted by the DGCK-based Central Project Management Office (CPMO) and Central
Project Finance Office (CPFO). Established under earlier urban projects financed by the Bank and other
donors, the CPMO would be responsible for monitoring all program and subproject implementation. The
CPFO, similarly, was established under past projects and would be responsible for oversight, monitoring,
consolidation, and preparation of all project accounts. It would also be responsible for preparing annual
project accounts for audits (see para 4.16) with the help of core consultants/staff resident in each of the
five cities assisting with technical auditing of the projects physical works.
4.7          Municipal Governments. Each municipal government will have primary responsibility
for project coordination and monitoring at the local level. A Steering Committee (SC) and a Technical
Team (Tim Teknis) established at the local level planning board (BAPPEDA 11), functioning as a Project
Monitoring Office (PMO), will provide overall guidance. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be
established under the Dinas PU by the city mayor to coordinate the activities of the units implementing
the various sector programs.  Local Project Finance Offices (PFO) will be established under the



- 18 -
jurisdiction of the finance section of each Mayor Secretary's Department for financial monitoring of the
project. The project will provide technical assistance to the municipal IUDP teams.
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
4.8           Project implementation is expected to commence in GOI's FY1995/96 and be completed
over a five-year period ending FY2000/2001. The technical teams at the local level which will be
responsible tor implementation were involved during the preparation phase. The first year program will
concentrate on a) implementing relatively standard components that require little technical preparation,
such as road overlays, KIP/MIPs, pipe and meter installations for water supply components; and b) in
preparing other components that require more detailed technical preparation, resettlement and land
acquisition, and terms of reference for more detailed studies and follow  up assistance.  The
implementation schedule is included in Annex 8.
4.9          In order to facilitate project implementation to start early a high priority technical
assistance and engineering services package has been identified for the required first year activities.
Terms of reference, a shortlist of consultants and a letter of invitation were approved by the Bank and
are in project files. A tirm had been preselected by negotiations; the selected firm is to start work before
loan effectiveness with financing from another Bank loan.
D. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.10         Procurement of civil works, goods and consultant services will follow Bank guidelines.
Large civil works contracts costing US$3 million or more and goods contracts costing US$200,000 or
more will be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the Bank's
standard bidding documents (SBD). A General Procurement Notice would be issued in advance to
encourage participation of eligible parties. Smaller civil works contracts, valued at less than US$3
million up to an aggregate amount of US$113 million and goods contracts valued at less than US$200,000
up to an aggregate amount of US$6 million would be procured under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
procedures acceptable to the Bank (Table 4.1). Goods contracts for less than US$20,000 each up to an
aggregate total of US$2 million, may be procured through prudent international and/or local shopping
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank.  All consulting services under the Bank loan would be
procured in accordance with the Bank guidelines for the use of consultants (para. 3.20). Domestic
preference would be provided during bid evaluation at a rate of 15 percent of the CIF price or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower for local manufacturers participating in the ICB procurement
of goods.
4.11         Procurement Review. Civil works contracts exceeding US$I million equivalent in value,
goods contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent in value, and consultant contracts with an estimated
value of US$100,000 or more for engagement of firms (US$50,000 or more tor the engagement of
individuals) would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The balance of contracts for goods and civil
works, including those reimbursed under Statement of Expenditures (SOE), will be subject to selective
post-review by the Bank. Contractors tor civil works exceeding US$1 million in value would be pre-
qualified in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Terms of reference for all consultant
services, including detailed engineering design and supervision, studies and other technical assistance,
would also be subject to prior Bank review. The use of standardized bidding documents by the borrower
will facilitate Bank review.

4.12         Procurement Packaging.  Where technically feasible and administratively practical,
subprojects have been/will be packaged together for tendering. Procurement of physical components will
be kept separate for each agency (central and local governments, PDAMs) to avoid administrative delays
and complex payment procedures. Similarly, procurement will be kept separate for each sector (roads,
drainage, etc.) as each contract will be administered by a different agency. However, consultant services
will be combined wherever feasible, e.g., support packages for studies, institutional strengthening for all
cities, etc. Table 4.2 summarizes the number of ICB and LCB contracts expected by sector.
4.13         Disbursements. Loan disbursements would be made at the following rates for the various
expenditure categories:  (a) civil works, 60 percent; (b) 100 percent of CIF costs of directly imported
goods (ICB), and 100 percent of ex-factory costs, for goods supplied by local manufacturers, and
65 percent of the costs of other locally procured goods; (c) subprojects under SLAs to local governments
and water enterprises - 91 percent; and (d) consultancy services and training - 91 percent of the costs of
contracts managed by the municipalities and PDAMs, and 80 percent of the costs of contracts managed
by central government agencies except for the contracts signed before June 1, 1995 for which 91 percent
applies (Table 4.3). Domestic funding will be used for procurement of vehicles. No taxes will be paid

4.14         To facilitate loan disbursements, a Special Account will be opened by the Ministry of
Finance in Bank Indonesia for withdrawals against all eligible foreign and local expenditures. The
authorized amount of the Special Account is US$5 million. This account would be maintained in US
dollars, with an initial deposit of US$3.5 million. When disbursement will have reached US$7 million,
the Special Account deposit can be increased to US$5 million. Withdrawal applications would be fully
documented, except for civil works contracts below US$1 million equivalent and equipment contracts
below US$200,000 equivalent, and consulting firms valued below US$100,000 equivalent and individual
consultants valued below US$50,000 equivalent, and all the training, for which the use of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs) would be required. Replenishment of the Special Account would be made on a
monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes first. Detailed
supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by DG TUA and the implementing agencies and
made available to the Bank for review on request. Assurances were provided at negotiations that
payments to local contractors including contracts under SLAs, would be made from the KPKN Treasury
offices in the respective provincial capitals (as is being done normally with SPABP payments).
4.15         The proposed disbursement period of five years is somewhat less than the disbursement
profile for IUIDP projects in Indonesia. However, as this project has been prepared taking into account
the start up problems encountered in the earlier projects, and thus steps taken to (a) mobilize early the
consulting services, (b) use up to US$400,000 from the Jakarta Urban Development Project II for starting
some project activities prior to loan effectiveness; and (c) assure availability of counterpart funds for the
first year, it is considered achievable. The project completion and loan closing dates are December 31,
2000 and June 30, 2001 respectively.  The estimated schedule of disbursements and the related
disbursement profile are shown in Annex 10.
E. PROJECT ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
4.16         The finance offices of each implementing agency are responsible for project accounting
and audit arrangements. At the local level the Finance Offices (FOs) in each city will maintain accounts
for project related expenditures financed by all sources of funds for all project components, including
those relating to the PDAMs. Each PDAM will maintain a separate account for the project. At the
national level, the Central Project Finance Office (CPFO) in Cipta Karya will prepare project accounts
of all components implemented directly by the central agencies. CPFO will also be responsible for
consolidating quarterly project accounts for the entire project and submitting them annually for audit by
the government auditors, Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan (BPKP). CPFO will also
coordinate separate audits of the SOEs with the Directorate General for Budget, Bank Indonesia, and the
central office of the State Audit Board.
4.17         Assurances were provided during negotiations that the consolidated project accounts,
including the Special Account and SOEs, as well as the overall accounts of the PDAMs, will be audited
annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and that the audited project
accounts would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,
commencing FY95/96. Audits of PDAMs overall financial statements should be retained at each PDAM
for review by Bank missions. In addition to financial audits, assurances were obtained at negotiations
that GOI will also appoint the Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Public Works and the provincial
level Inspectorates as auditors for technical audit of project implementation including, inter alia, civil
work contracts, procurement of goods and training programs, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
Domestic sources will fund the audits. The first technical audit will be discussed with the Bank no later
than I year after loan effectiveness; and at regular I year intervals thereafter. Terms of reference for
both financial and technical audits will be finalized by GOI in consultation with the Bank.



- 22 -
F. PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION
4. 18        DGCK, with assistance from its CPMO and CPFO, will prepare and submit to the Bank
quarterly progress reports (QPR) on the basis of inputs from the five cities and implementing agencies
of the central government, with an overall summary and covering the progress on: (a) physical aspects
of each component; (b) institutional development (LIDAP) and revenue improvement (RIAP) actions; (c)
consulting services; (d) compliance with loan agreement covenants; (e) administration and finance,
including project cost, commitment and disbursement schedule; and (f) a list of actions to be taken by
the various parties. The progress reports substance including performance indicators, and the format will
be discussed at the workshop for the project launch scheduled for April 1995 (as recorded in the minutes
of negotiations). QPRs would be submitted within 45 days from the end of each quarter, starting with
the quarter ending December 31, 1995. On completion of the KUDP, the DGCK, assisted by the five
cities, would prepare a Implementation Completion Report within 6 months after the loan closing date,
for review by GOI and the Bank.
4.19         The project would require some 30 staff weeks of Bank supervision each year during the
first two years and 20-25 staff weeks annually in the subsequent years of the project (Annex 11).
Supervision missions would include engineering, institutional, financial and environmental expertise. The
missions will review the yearly plans and budget proposals not later than November 30 each project year.
After completion of two project years, not later than June 30, 1998, a mid-term review would take place.
The proposed arrangements and schedule for project supervision were agreed with GOI at negotiations.
G. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
4.20         Expenditure programs for the municipalities and PDAMs include O&M budgets in every
subsector in accordance with IUIDP guidelines. MHA Ministerial Decree No. 5 of 1990 promulgated
Performance-oriented Operations and Maintenance Management Systems (POMMS) and revised local
budgeting procedures to encourage O&M.  Current O&M  expenditures and incremental O&M
expenditures (to reach necessary levels and expand coverage) are clearly separated. Adequate budgeting
for current and incremental O&M is an important objective of KUDP; domestic sources will fully fund
O&M to ensure sustainability of the increased level under the project. Advisory and training assistance
would be provided under the project to improve maintenance practices. During negotiations the Borrower
agreed to review annually with the Bank the operation and maintenance expenditures of the previous year
as well as the budget for the following year.
H. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION
4.21         The project minimizes resettlement through design alternatives that reduce land acquisition
needs.  KIP programs improve on-site poor neighborhoods through community participation in
identification, planning and implementation of upgrading community infrastructure. Most other civil
works are of a rehabilitation/upgrading nature that do not require land acquisition. Pipes for expansion
of the water transmission and distribution systems will be laid in existing rights of way of roads,
including sidewalks where applicable. Where subprojects require new land, the extent is generally small
and in most instances has been acquired during the long project preparation process. Nevertheless, as
of September 30, 1994, some 39 hectares still had to be acquired under the project (20 of them are
government-owned vacant land to be acquired by an agency). Only 57 families would be affected and
39 families would be displaced in all 5 cities. Two settlement action plans have been prepared and found
satisfactory by the Bank. Details are in Annex 12.



- 23 -
4.22         Presidential Decree 55/93 on land acquisition for public facilities will be applied to all
resettlement financed by Bank-assisted components (para. 1. 15). Unlike cities in Java, where land and
financial resource constraints inhibit resettlement, site-specific factors that favor successful resettlement
in KUDP include the fact that land is not in short supply, making it possible both to adjust civil works
to reduce resettlement needs, and to find alternative housing sites that do not pose significant transport
costs on resettled families. The cities already have large affordable housing programs operating under
other urban investment programs that have been used for successful resettlement; Samarinda has received
the Aga Khan award for a central business district redevelopment. The cities have sufficient funds at
hand to pay adequate compensation. Managing resettlement for the proposed project will only involve
introducing some refinements to familiar procedures.
4.23         Project Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plans. The municipal government of
each city is responsible for managing land acquisition and resettlement, with technical support provided
by DG Cipta Karya or DG Bina Marga. Only 2 project components displace more than 10 families. One
is the ring-road in Banjarmasin (19 families displaced and 37 families affected; a number of families were
moved prior to the inclusion of the road in the proposed project and were compensated adequately). The
other project component displacing more than 10 families--20 families--is the wastewater/interceptor
aeration pond in Samarinda. Resettlement Action Plans have been prepared and found satisfactory; they
are in the project file. Sites have been individually surveyed. The core of each resettlement plan consists
of providing resettlers with the option to accept cash compensation at replacement value, or serviced plots
or serviced plots with a core house in larger resettlement and affordable housing programs being
developed by each city. None of the resettlement sites is more than 7 kilometers (most are closer) from
current sites, and the project will provide moving assistance to families that elect to move. Affordable
transportation to work is already available at new sites. Where only a few families are affected or
displaced, the local governments are applying the same compensation criteria, as expressed in the Project
Implementation Agreements, although detailed plans will not be prepared. For subprojects that need land
acquisition and resettlement, the related costs are included in the project budget keyed to civil works
timetable for each sub-project. The Government has agreed to resettle affected people according to the
plans agreed with the Bank. A resettlement specialist will be included in the project's technical assistance
program under TORs agreed with the Bank, to assist municipal governments with implementation,
preparation of monitoring reports and development of improved guidelines for resettlement under future
programs.
L. ENVIRONMENTAI, IMPACTS
4.24         The project will have a positive impact on the human and natural environment in all five
cities through improvements in waste disposal, drainage and flood control. Most negative impacts will
be minor, corridor impacts associated with construction, rehabilitation or upgrading of urban roads,
drainage systems and flood control. However, the project includes a small number of sub-projects,
including new solid waste disposal sites in all five cities and possibly sewerage treatment plants in 2
cities, that could have significant though localized negative impacts. The project was labelled "Category
A" early on. The Environmental Assessment Summary was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 11, 1994.
4.25         Under GOI regulations (PP 29/1986) Preliminary Environmental Assessments (PILs) were
undertaken for each of five sectors (water supply, solid waste, drainage, roads and sanitation) for each
of the five cities in 1992. Based on these assessments, environmental management and monitoring plans
(RKL/RPL) were prepared. The central commission of the Ministry of Public Works approved the PILs



- 24 -
in 1993, and the relevant commissions approved the environmental impact analyses (ANDAL) prepared
for the solid waste sector, and RKLs and RPLs, in January 1994.
4.26          The major areas for attention are: a) the proposed Banjarmasin ring road, whose alignment
traverses a wetland area. The engineering design will have to minimize any disruption to the wetland
system; the Bank will want to review the design before the start of procurement. As the road would
likely induce settlement within the wetland, the city land use plan to he prepared under the project will
include measures to protect the wetland, in particular its function in controlling tlooding; b) supervision
will be required to oversee transport and disposal of material dredged from drains and canals during
upgrading; c) supervision will be required to minimise traffic disruption during construction of road sub-
projects; d) design and post-construction monitoring will be required for solid waste disposal sites and
for the eventual sewerage treatment plants/waste water systems. Criteria for mitigation of environmental
impacts that will be provided as guidelines for contractors are detailed in Annex 13.
4.27          The review of RKL/RPLs identified the need tor improved inter-agency coordination to
manage and minimise impacts during construction.  In all five cities institutional capacity for
environmental management requires strengthening with regard to staff numbers, skills and experience.
Within about the next five years, other donor-funded projects will provide laboratory facilities and trained
technical staff at the provincial-level for air and water quality monitoring; these will he readily available
to the city administrations. Thus, TA under KUDP will develop and deliver on-the-job training programs
for Dinas Cipta Karya and Dinas Bina Marga staff, for improving each city's capacity to effectively direct
environmental planning, assessment and management processes. In addition, funds will also be used to
prepare and deliver public awareness campaigns on proper methods of domestic waste disposal, to
complement the work being undertaken to improve solid waste collection and urban drainage.
4.28          If any new major component were to be added later to the project, environmental
screening and/or assessment and a resettlement plan, as may be appropriate, would be required prior to
Bank approval for funding.
5. FINANCIAI. ASPECTS
A. LoCAL GOVFRNMENTS
5.1           Most local governments will continue to receive substantial grant funding in the
toreseeable future. Non-grant revenue forecasts under the RIAP process project a somewhat higher
average real growth than in the recent past for all five cities; the projections are reasonable and within
the local governments' power to achieve. Revenues are expected to double by the year 2000. (Annex
14).
5.2           RIAP/LIDAP Process. Although annual growth in local revenues has generally been
steady, studies undertaken during preparation of the Revenue Improvement Action Programs (RIAPs)
indicate that current levels of revenue from major sources are considerably below their potentials.
Deficiencies are often found in local administrations: a significant number of potential tax payers go
unregistered, taxes are under-assessed, and revenues, under-collected. The project seeks to address these
deficiencies. RIAPs and LIDAPs introduced during the project preparation phase, and to be refined
during project implementation, seek to identify steps to achieve improvements in the planning and
administration of local taxes and service charges. Such steps typically include collection of data on the
revenue bases including proper identification of tax objects and subjects, tax assessment approaches,
review of tariffs, and establishment of annual revenue targets for progressively narrowing of the gap



- 25 -
between performance and identified potentials. The local governments have committed themselves to
implementing the RIAPs/LIDAPs with technical assistance and necessary equipment provided under the
project.
5.3          Cost Recovery. The cities charge for solid waste disposal and sanitation (including on-site
sanitation and sludge removal). The level of O&M cost recovery varies among cities, with Samarinda,
Pontianak and Balikpapan covering up to 80-100 percent. Because of low rates and low collection
efficiencies, the 1993 revenue from solid waste charges in Banjarmasin and Palangkaraya covered only
40-70 percent of O&M costs, with no contribution being made towards capital costs. All five local
governments have agreed to increase periodically solid waste tariffs to at least cover O&M. They have
also agreed to implement sanitation tariff increases resulting from the RIAPs.
5.4          Borrowing. Estimates of maximum borrowing capacity for each local government have
been prepared by making revenue and expenditure projections for the program period and a number of
subsequent years sufficient to establish that the savings from locally generated revenues, after deducting
routine expenditures, can service debt. The total borrowing capacities are small. All local governments
have nevertheless made commitments to borrow small amounts in consultation with central and provinciai
governments. A total of about US$13 million out of the Loan is expected to become subsidiary loans to
the local governments; the local government proposals are generally satisfactory.  Draft sub-loan
agreements for the local governments were reviewed during negotiations and the specific amounts were
confirmed. Local governments eligible for borrowing under this project agreed to maintain minimum
debt service coverage ratios of 1.5, based on locally generated revenues.
B. WATER ENTERPRISES
5.5          Financial Management. Given that PDAMs' accounting, reporting, billing, accounts
receivable, and controls are generally weak, partly due to shortages of skilled personnel and relaxed
requirement by the authorities, technical assistance and training will be provided for: (a) improving the
financial reporting systems to suit a timely annual audit cycle; (b) setting up accounting and reporting of
accounts receivable to monitor aging debts and prepare action plans for collection; and (c) organizing the
meter reading and billing functions with effective controls.
5.6          Tariffs. The tariff structure is progressive with quantity consumed and is higher for non-
domestic users. Tariff increases ranging from 33 percent to 60 percent were implemented in 1993 for
all except PDAM Banjarmasin and Palangkaraya. Palangkaraya's new rate became effective January 1994
and Banjarmasin's, in July 1994. Tariffs will be increased every other year in order to ensure that at
least cost escalations due to intlation are covered and the foreseen capital self generation is achieved. In
current prices, average tariff per m3 are expected to increase from 1994 to 1999 as follows: Rp 649 to
1030 in Pontianak, Rp 540 to 983 in Palangkaraya, Rp 628 to 1212 in Banjarmasin, Rp 757 to 1251 in
Balikpapan, Rp 729 to 1056 in Samarinda (Annex 15). Tariff increases will be implemented every two
years starting January 1, 1996 to enable PDAMs to fully cover O&M after FY1995 and fully cover O&M
and depreciation by FY1999, while incorporating efficiency improvements that should reduce costs.
5.7          Financial Projections. The financing plans maximize self financing first, from revenues;
then include borrowing as possible, and residually, equity contributions. Only Samarinda does not count
on new equity. Key financial indicators are shown in Annex 14. They are based on a list of assumptions
for each PDAM, the most important of which include: (a) number of existing and additional connections;
(b) minimal capacity utilization to be attained; (c) reduced levels of non-revenue water; (d) level of new
investments and subloans; (e) agreed periodic tariff increases; and (t) PDAMs will be allowed to retain



- 26 -
profits and required to use them towards financing their programs during the project period, as needed.
Detailed financial projections are in project files; they indicate that all PDAMs will cover the cost of their
O&M by 1995 and will achieve a three year average debt service ratio of at least 1.5 by the end of the
grace period. Any PDAM investment additional to the PJM exceeding Rp. 2 billion would require prior
Bank consultation. Draft sub-loan agreements for the PDAMs were reviewed during negotiations;
specific amounts were confirmed. PDAMs eligible for borrowing under this project agreed to maintain
minimum debt service coverage ratios of 1.5, based on locally generated revenues. More generally, to
enhance the self-financing capacity of PDAMs, the GOI agreed to take measures such as instructing
PDAMs by September 1995 to deduct depreciation from their estimated profits available for distribution
to local government (as recorded in minutes of negotiations).
6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
6.1          Each of the investments planned for funding under the project have been subject to
economic analysis by consultants. As the cities had relatively low service levels in 1993, and their
populations are expected to grow by almost 500,000 persons by the year 2000, the investments are highly
justified. Below are some of the main features; some details are provided in Annex 15, and hill reports
are on file.
6.2          Water Supply. The proposed project component includes investments in water treatment
plants and distribution networks, to increase and balance the systems' capacities; investments in
rehabilitation including leakage control; and it emphasizes O&M. In selecting the individual schemes,
least cost investment schemes were determined by comparing alternative solutions in terms of their long-
term economic and operational performance. Specifically, larger conventional custom designed concrete
water treatment plants were found to be superior to smaller steel package plants, and a network analysis
helped define optimal distribution system expansions. Also, water resource studies will be undertaken
in preparation for the next capacity expansions.
6.3          Some half the populations depend on unreliable and poor quality water sources, in
particular during dry seasons when salinity levels are high. Demand surveys and analyses have been done
in every city. The project is expected to provide piped water through house connections to 600,000
persons in the five cities. Credit schemes will be available for low income households that otherwise
would not be able to afford the connection charge. Including users of public taps, the PDAM coverage
would increase from 30-40 to 60 percent average of the population in the 5 cities. The main benefits are
increased availability of piped water at reduced costs; water tariffs from house connections are generally
less than 10 percent those from vendors, so that the proposed tariff increases do not compromise
affordability. As overall benefits from the better water supply, including reduced morbidity, are not
easily quantifiable no economic rates of return have been calculated. However, analyses have estimated
that the willingness to pay for the water exceeds the costs and tariffs. Cost recovery is an indication of
minimum economic returns; the PDAMs are expected to fully recover costs including financial costs and
depreciation, by the end of the project period.
6.4          Drainage and Flood Control. The cities are low-lying and subject to tidal flooding along
their water courses. While flooding may not be eliminated from some areas, the frequency and duration
can be mitigated. Existing deficiencies in drainage and flood control are mainly attributable to inadequate
maintenance; capacity can be increased by cleaning drains and canals currently clogged with solid waste,
sediment, and vegetation. The lowest cost solution among various technical solutions usually corresponds



- 27 -
to undertaking regular maintenance.  Nevertheless, rehabilitation and realignment have also been
identified as necessary for some canals/drains; and flood control studies are needed for a few larger
problem areas. The proposed investments will benefit a total of some 940 ha, between 3 and 15 percent
of the city areas, by reducing: (a) flood-related physical damage, building damage and break-up of roads;
(b) traffic disruptions caused by flooding and damaged roads; (c) health problems--especially of poor
people living in low-lying and hence flood-prone areas. The benefits are not easily quantifiable and no
ERR has been calculated. However, the cost has been verified to be less than that of relocating residents,
and a cost-benefit ratio has been calculated for each component by dividing expected increases in land
values (which have been used as a proxy for economic benefits) by investment and O&M costs of the
proposed drainage and flood control schemes. For the component to be economically justified, land value
increases of 0.3-29.5 percent for the regularly flooded areas would be required; the increases are feasible
in light of prices in similar, but non-flooded, areas. Studies for wetland protection will be undertaken,
as necessary, as part of land development plans.
6.5           Sanitation. In general, regularly desludged septic tanks represent an adequate sanitation
solution in low population density areas. However, the high water tables in the project cities make
conventional septic tanks to be technically inefficient; further, desludging is rarely done because of high
cost and unawareness of the benefits. Alternative technologies will be tested, and the most appropriate
will be adopted under the project. A credit scheme will be available to allow low-income households to
install on-site sanitation facilities. Investments in sewerage systems are justified, in life cycle terms, in
areas with higher population densities--such as Banjarmasin's Banjar Barat subdistrict with more than 250
persons per ha. In all, it is expected that an additional 25 percent of the populations will have improved
sanitation. This project component generates benefits in terms of health and avoided ground water
contamination which are not easily quantifiable; thus, no ERR has been calculated. However, cost
recovery is expected over time for the on-site installations and partial cost recovery from the sewerage
systems (the benefits from reduced negative externalities may not be tapped for cost-recovery).
6.6          Solid Waste Management. Solid waste is being generated at a rate of 3 liters per capita
per day--between 1,160 m3 and 1,500 m3 per day in the four larger cities. Only between 50 and 60
percent is being collected. The proposed investments in solid waste management will increase solid waste
collection levels to some 80 percent, benefitting the majority of the residents. Environmental degradation
caused by burning or dumping of uncollected solid waste into rivers and drains would be reduced through
environmentally safe collection services and operation of new and improved landfill sites. The cost
recovery for the mostly publicly provided garbage removal will gradually increase under the project
according to the RIAPs. It is also expected that the project will attract private sector participation, for
improved service and cost recovery. However, lesser cost recovery will be possible at landfills.
6.7          Kampung/Market Improvement Programs. The KIP component provides public toilets,
solid waste collection, foot paths and drainage. The program is expected to be able to upgrade all the
low income kampungs and benefit some 500,000 persons. At about Rp 50 billion or 10 percent of total
project costs, investments under this component are relatively low; capital expenditures per beneficiary
(Rp. 100,000) are low and far exceeded by benefits. KIPs tend to substantially improve the living
conditions of the residents and mobilize community resources. Beneficiary households and communities
will be involved in the identification, planning, preparation and implementation of the works, as well as
the operation and maintenance; some training will be provided for self-help works but larger works will
be contracted out. Some infrastructure, mainly roads, will also be provided under the project in 3 poor
areas totalling 64 ha where urban renewal is planned with private sector participation and funding, and
for 6 new low-income housing developments totalling some 100 ha, mainly to be built by Perumnas. The
houses would have 18 m2 on 60 m2 to 200 m2 lots, and cost $2000 and upwards; credit will be available
from provincial banks for mortgages. The houses are in high demand because they are one of the few



- 28 -
ways of acquiring land, and their low initial cost allows buyers to upgrade them progressively with their
own work. And, the infrastructure of 24 markets with an area of 134 ha will be improved, including
improvements to superstructures; the improvements are very much needed and their costs are more than
recovered from municipal fees on the vendors, who participate in deciding the improvements.
6.8          Roads. The five cities total some 1000 km of roads, and a majority of the 500,000 motor
vehicles registered in the four provinces are located in these cities. Given high motorized traffic growth,
down-town roads tend to carry traffic volumes exceeding design capacity. The road agencies will
undertake improved road maintenance with budget increases from domestic sources, to ensure their
sustainability. Maintenance strategies have been developed by the central government's road agency and
are followed by the local agencies; in accordance with the strategy, roads should be resurfaced every 5
or 6 years. Returns on good maintenance are high, typically over 30 percent. Under the project some
125 km of roads will receive periodic overlay -- 77 km of them in Pontianak but much shorter lengths
in the other cities, that have preferred to include road upgrading under the project. In all, some 280 km
of roads, mainly "local" roads, will be improved/upgraded through widening, new drains, sidewalks, etc.
Each of the planned improvements has passed the test of an economic analysis that required a minimum
expected rate of return of 10 percent; average returns are much higher. In all, about one third of the
urban road length will be improved under the project. Furthermore, the project includes 30 km of new
road construction (dualling the airport road in Pontianak, a new alternative airport road in Balikpapan;
a new ring road in Banjarmasin). Benefits of works include savings in vehicle operating costs due to
reduced congestion and in some cases, reduced travel distances.  Savings in travel times are also
estimated. All rates of return exceed 10 percent without travel time savings. Finally, traffic management
studies will be undertaken in some of the cities with a view of implementing their recommendations under
the project.
B. POVERTY IMPACTS
6.9          The project is expected to substantially alleviate poverty as many components are targeted
at improving the quality of life and environment in the poorer kampungs. The population with access
to piped water could about double while reducing the cost for many consumers. An instalment payment
plan would be provided for house connections for consumers who would otherwise not aftfrd them.
Monthly water bills would be less than 5 percent of the expenditures of low-income (assumed Rp
150,000) households. The drainage and flood control component would reduce the frequency and
duration of the floods in the low lying areas where many of the urban poor have settled. It would reduce
property damage and health impacts associated with stagnant polluted water in the neighborhoods, and
reduce access disruptions. The human and solid waste disposal components will reduce morbidity (or
medical expenditures) by expanding the coverage and using better ways for disposal. In particular, the
pilot studies on new sanitation technologies and public education campaigns should lead to greatly
improved services and reduced morbidity and environmental contamination. Care will be taken to allow
continued recycling by scavengers at the new landfills. The traffic management programs, that would
improve conditions for non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians, would also benefit the poor. The KIP
and MIP programs to improve micro-infrastructure are targeted on densely populated poor neighborhoods,
they would benefit some 500,000 persons, or 25 percent of the urban populations--it is expected that by
the end of the project all poor kampungs will have been improved, in line with a renewed anti-poverty
campaign by the Government (the INPRES Desa Tertinggal). Community participation at all stages and
training are added benefits of the project. Likewise, downtown urban renewals will benefit the poor and
revitalize business; one of these areas include a riverside community that had an outbreak of cholera a
few years ago, in Samarinda. The project avoids resettling people by upgrading their neighborhoods.
But at the same time, the new low-income housing developments allow an affordable alternative to those



- 29 -
who want to move--although demand tends to exceed supply, and non-poor are also interested in the
schemes.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS
6.10         The project will have a positive impact on the environment in the five cities through
improvements to solid and human waste disposal, drainage and flood control, and supporting the kampung
improvement program. Environmental management and mitigation measures have been built into the
design and cost of subprojects, and institutional arrangements have been made for monitoring impacts on
the environment.
6.11         All the subprojects are within the existing city boundaries. A majority of the subprojects
will be improvements on site: (a) for roads, all the periodic maintenance works, the upgrading and
widening on existing alignments, the improvement of side drains will have a beneficiary environmental
impact; fuel consumption per kilometer by motorized vehicles will be reduced, reducing air pollution,
through improved road capacities, surfaces and traffic management, where applicable; (b) for drainage,
improved maintenance of drains will reduce flooding and disposal methods for the sludge are to be
improved; the justification of small scale hydraulic gates for flushing in Pontianak and Banjarmasin on
a pilot basis will be reviewed; and flood control studies will be undertaken in 4 of the 5 cities.
6. 12        Unsanitary human waste disposal will be improved with a beneficial environmental impact.
While vertical septic tanks had been installed on a pilot basis and proposed as a new on-site technical
solution for these cities with high water tables, from new impact data the appraisal concluded that they
would not achieve the intended objectives despite their high cost.  The project thus includes the
development and monitoring of other on-site prototype solutions during its first year, for implementation
of the successful ones on a wider scale during subsequent years. The monitoring is to include health
surveys, chemical contents (TKN, SS, TOC, DO, etc), social acceptability, cost and ease of operations
and maintenance, and environmental impacts. Subsequently, training and education programs will ensure
that women, in particular, will understand the benefits of the new systems and will know how to use and
maintain them properly; also, credit schemes will be available to ensure the affordability of the systems.
Overall these improvements will reduce ground water contamination. The project also includes studies
for small scale sewerage/waste water schemes and their implementation in dense business districts where
on-site solutions are technically unviable, and their monitoring for subsequent improvement or replication.
6.13         The landfill operations would satisfy the Bank's environmental requirements--they will be
operated on a sanitary basis, will include a composting area and continue to support recycling by private
operators. The existing inadequate landfills will be closed and thereby soil and water contamination will
be reduced. Increased availability of solid waste collection trucks at affordable fees will reduce the
amount of waste that currently goes uncollected--burned or dumped in drains or empty lots--from some
50 percent to some 20 percent average (Annex 16).
6.14         The three new road construction subprojects were added at appraisal. In Pontianak, the
airport road will be dualled on an existing, fully cleared right of way, and the detailed design will include
appropriate cross and side drains, to be approved by the Bank for final subproject approval. The new
airport access road in Balikpapan, that will also serve as a city ring road, is to be built by upgrading an
existing road on its right of way; appropriate drainage will be included in the design and an
environmental review will be made for Bank approval. The new ring road in Banjarmasin, highly
justified to reroute polluting heavy traffic from densely populated downtown areas, has been proceeding



- 30 -
gradually with the appropriations the municipality could secure from yearly budgets and will be completed
under the project, pending final engineering including an environmental analysis.
6.15         For development of the cities beyond the project period, the project includes technical
assistance to help prepare land use development plans taking into account environmental considerations.
Financing for the studies, however, is not included in the project cost estimates. Studies on raw water
sources will help select the best future sources.
D. RISKS
6.16         The major risks of the project are: limited institutional capacity to manage implementation,
delays in counterpart funds for the project due to budget constraints, inability of local governments to
meet their revenue targets, and delays caused by protracted procurement procedures for works,
materials/equipment and consultants. To minimize the risks, and as part of start-up activities and under
a schedule agreed upon with the Bank, the cities will train their project managers and appoint consultants
to help with design, implementation and supervision. The financing plans have been endorsed by the
agencies that will provide the domestic funding. Standard bidding documents and procedures have been
discussed, with the local agencies and to the extent possible works have been packaged to attract larger
contractors who normally deliver better quality works. Project implementation plans will be agreed at
negotiations, the programs will allow flexibility in adapting later year components to changing needs, as
appropriate. The Bank has planned what is considered sufficient supervision resources, especially in the
early years, for early detection and solution of problems.

2.     The Project Implementation Agreements with the local governments include the following criteria for
Resettlement Plans in line with GOI policy under KEPPRES 55/1993:
(a)    Displaced households will have an option between cash compensation and moving to a resettlement
site. Households left with less than 60 m2 following acquisition will also be eligible for resettlment benefits.
(b)    Cash compensation will reflect at least the NJOP level.
(c)    The compensation value for land taken by the project will be sufficient to pay for an area of land at
the new site with at least the same area.
(d)    Compensation for the building at the old site will be sufficient to build a new house of the same
quality. Displaced families will also be allowed to take the old building materials from the previous site.
(e)    Displaced families will have the option between buying standard houses built by a developer at a new
site, or building their own houses of suitable size and quality.
(t)    At the resettlement site, the Government will provide reasonable infrastructure levels, such as
footpaths, roads, drainage, water, electricity, and public facilities such as schools, health services,
transportation, etc., if not already available.
(g)    People will be given assistance to restart and develop at the new site any small businesses displaced
from the previous site.

KALIMANTAN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Mitigation of Negative Environmental Impacts
1.     The following criteria will be provided to consultants preparing designs and to
contractors executing works under the proposed project, to mitigate potential negative
environmental impacts.
Dredging of Drains and Floodways
2.    All of the rehabilitation and up-grading work of drains in each city will involve
preparatory dredging. The spoil is probably severely contaminated with human waste,
industrial wastes, and lead benzene from storm water runoff. Care must be taken in the
dredging and disposal of the spoil. Prior to dredging, a plan of action to mitigate potential
environmental damage will be prepared by the consultant and submitted to the Bank for
technical review and approval prior to contracting this work. The plan should take into
account the following criteria:
i)   the method of dredging should ensure minimal dispersal of pollutants both
during the dredging when metals can become resuspended in the water and
during hauling when the wet sludge can slosh onto the road. Possible options
may include;
a) using temporary suspended platforms during dredging and construction for
de-watering sludge prior to transport,
b) using boats for transport of sludge and drying before off loading to a truck
for final disposal, and
c) providing by-pass pumping (where feasible) of up stream flow to dewater
and isolate an area thus preventing resuspension of pollutants in the water.
ii)   the final disposal site(s) at the TPAs should be selected to ensure that the spoil
do not enter and pollute local watercourses. The spoil could also be considered
as capping material for existing landfills which are scheduled to close.
iii)  the spoil should not be composted with sludge or organic wastes unless they
have been tested and shown not to contain heavy metals or other toxics.
In all locations, construction should adhere to MPW Construction SOPs for urban drainage
(Petunjuk Teknis, Proyek Drainase Perkotaan 1990). Where there is a possibility of landslips
occurring during construction, shoring will be required to prevent damage to adjacent
properties and/or infrastructure.

Annex 13
Page 2
Road Widening and Upgrading
3.    In some locations construction of new roads could lead to induced development,
particularly the ring-road in Banjarmasin. Local BAPPEDAs will prepare land use and zoning
plans under the project that take into account such potential development. In addition, road
construction in wetland areas can affect the cross drainage of surface & ground water severely
daminising the quality of the environment. All road design & construction should mitigate
such negative impacts by providing adequate cross drainage. In a number of cities, road
improvement may entail disruption of traffic, especially on smaller collector roads which will
need to be managed. The following conditions should be part of contracts let for road
widening or upgrading.
i)    In all locations construction should adhere to MPW  Construction SOPs for
roads (Petunjuk Teknis, Proyek Jalan dan Jembatan 1990).
ii)   In locations where severe and/or prolonged disruption of traffic will occur
during construction, alternative routes should be selected in advance and
coordinated with local police and traffic authorities.
iii)    All construction sites should have traffic signs and safety barriers erected
throughout the construction period, construction materials should be stored in
a manner that does not impede traffic flow, and the adjacent road should be
maintained free of spoil and other waste materials during construction.
Solid Waste Disposal Sites (TPA)
4.    In all five cities the construction and operation of the solid waste disposal sites should
adhere to MPW Solid Waste Disposal SOPs (Petunjuk Teknis Proyek Persampahan, 1990/92).
Toxic substance disposal should be coordinated with the industrial, hazardous, and toxic waste
program through the Ministry of Industry and Bappedal including provision or toxic substance
disposal at the TPA.
5.    Because of the possibility of ground water pollution by uncontrolled runoff and plans
to use the TPAs for sludge disposal (from dredging and sewerage treatment), particular care
is required in the design and construction of these facilities. It is recommended the following
contractual arrangements for engineering design and construction be required:
i)    Prior to initiation of detailed engineering design, the preliminary technical plans
and drawings for each TPA must be submitted to the Bank for technical review
and approval by a waste disposal and sanitation expert of the Bank.
ii)    Prior to finalisation of detailed engineering designs the plans, drawings and
specifications for each TPA must be submitted to the Bank for review and
approval by a waste disposal and sanitation expert of the Bank.

Annex 13
Page 3
iii)   Prior to completion of construction or commissioning of each TPA, each of the
municipal authorities be required to submit to the Bank a detailed staffing and
technical plan for operation of the TPA, including the leachate treatment plant.
6.    The design of TPAs should take into account the following criteria:
i)    each TPA will have an area for sludge and composting/organic recycling.
ii)   scavengers will be allowed to recycle waste.
iii)   provision of a ground-water cut-off barrier, together with leachate treatment
facilities to prevent contamination of the surrounding ground-water table, may
be needed.
iv)    compacting may be acceptable if adequate soils are not available for "sanitary"
operation.
v)    consideration should be given to capping the existing landfills scheduled for
closure with the drainage spoils and then with a top layer of dewatered sludge
which has been composted with organic solid waste. The top layer should then
be planted with cover reduced the amount of precipitation entering the landfill.
Any precipitation which manages to flow through the organic zone will become
anoxic thus preventing the resuspension of metals in the seepage water. This
could provide and excellent method of both sludge, drainage spoils, and organic
solid waste disposal.
