MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Madagascar - Study of the Plain
of Antananarivo Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1086-MAGj
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Madagascar
Study of the Plain of Antananarivo Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1086-MAG)" prepared by
the Africa Regional Office. No comments on Parts I and m were received from the Borrower.
This technical assistance project with limited objectives provided resources to complete
an integrated plan for flood control and development in the Plain of Antananarivo. The master plan
was used as the basis for preparing the Antananarivo Plain Development Project (Credit 2117-MAG)
and was instrumental in obtaining assistance from donors for other projects on the Plain. As such,
the project is rated as satisfactory.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) is informative and satisfactory. However, the
PCR notes that two supervision reports are missing from the project files resulting in permanent loss
of institutional memory of this project.
An audit is recommended jointly with two other investment projects in the agricultural
sector and an agricultural sector adjustment operation (ASAC) since this would provide an
opportunity to evaluate a number of sectorwide issues and some aspects of the Bank's role in the
agricultural sector in Madagascar.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1086-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Technical Assistance Project
for the Study of the Plain of Antananarivo in Madagascar, for which Cr. 1086-MAG in the
amount of US$2.32 million (SDR 1.8 million equivalent) was approved on December 18, 1980.
The credit became effective on October 16, 1981, a delay of seven months. The Credit was
closed on December 31, 1986, a delay of three years. The credit was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement took place on August 25, 1987. 1/
The report (Preface, Evaluation Summary, and Parts I and III) was prepared by
the Agriculture Operations Division of the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department of the
Africa Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on the President's Report, Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and Internal Bank
memoranda. The PCR was sent to Government with a request to prepare Part II. No comments
were received.
1/    The delay in producing this report was the result of an earlier decision to combine this
report with the project completion report for the follow-on project. (Antananarivo Plain
Development Project, Cr. 2117-MAG.) This decision was reversed in order to avoid
further delays.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    The Plain of Antananarivo, located close to the capital city of the same name, used
to be a predominantly agricultural area, but has now become a partly residential area due to
the expansion of the city. It is subject to serious, periodic flooding. Major floods occurred
in 1954, 1959 and 1977. In 1959, twenty percent of the dwellings in the area were flooded
and the Plain was under two meters of water, parts of it for several months. The 1977 flood,
caused major damage to the dikes because of their generally poor state of maintenance.
About 16,000 persons were affected, large areas of the capitol city were flooded and an
important part of the rice crop was lost. Also, when flooding occurs, serious outbreaks of
malaria follow.
2.    The Government had, at the time of project preparation in 1979-80, no coherent plan
for the protection of residential and agricultural areas of the Plain against floods. The
proposed project was to fill this gap and assist the Government in defining an integrated flood
control and development program for the area.
Objectives
3.    The objective of the project was to prepare an integrated plan for flood control and
development in the Plain of Antananarivo. Specifically, (a) technically coherent and
financially feasible pre-investment studies were to be conducted at a pre-feasibility stage for
flood control and expansion of economic activities; (b) the network of research stations for
erosion and soil protection, hydrological measurements and flood alerts, was to be improved;
and (c) the capability of the Directorate General of Planning was to be strengthened to
supervise the project.
Implementation Experience
4.    The consultant selection process to carry out the study was lengthy and caused a 9
month delay in project start-up. Aerial photographs could not be taken during the dry season
in September-October 1981 as scheduled and had to be postponed to June 1982; in addition,
the company that held the monopoly on aerial photography, Air Madagascar, did not provide
the quality and quantity of photos required. The initial contract with the consultants was
therefore extended from 21 to 30 months.
5.    After the initial slow start-up phase, progress was good. Project execution was smooth
without any major problems. The first stage of review was completed in February 1983.



iv
During the second and third phase, the consultants reviewed in more detail the technical
implications of six of the selected scenarios and their financial and economic impact. In the
final phase, a selection was made on the scenario with the lowest cost-benefit ratio. By
December 1984, the master plan had been completed. In the process, three promising ideas
and engineering designs emerged and it was decided to use the remaining funds to prepare
feasibility studies on these. Consequently, the closing date was extended to December 1986.
Results
6.    This was a successful Technical Assistance project. The final masterplan for the
rehabilitation and long-term development was revised to minimize investment needs and
maximize economic benefits, to improve the flood-warning system for the lower town of
Antananarivo, and for institutional coordination of major structures in the plain. The
masterplan was used as the basis for the Antananarivo Plain Development Project (Cr. 2117-
MAG), which was approved on March 29, 1990. It also led to significant donor support for
other projects on the Plain.
Sustainability
7.    Project results were sustainable in the sense that the studies led to several IDA and
donor financed interventions.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.    The major findings and lessons learned are:
-     It is important to keep a project such as this one simple and focussed.
When considerable uncertainty exists on available options, the design phase
of a large project should be separated from the implementation phase in order
to avoid lengthy delays.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name: Study of the Plain of Antananarivo Technical Assistance Project
Credit No.:   1086-MAG
RVP Unit:    Africa Regional Office
Department:  South-Central and Indian Ocean Department
Sector:      Agriculture, Infrastructure
Sub-Sector:   Technical Assistance
2.    Project Background
2.1    The Plain of Antananarivo occupies a central position in Madagascar. The city of
Antananarivo and neighboring villages were originally built on hills located on the edge of the
Plain, but with urban growth, low-lying areas have been increasingly developed, most of the time
with low-standard dwellings lacking modern infrastructure. Most of the Plain is subject to
frequent flooding. Very early in Malagasy history it benefitted from reclamation of marshes,
construction of dikes and of drainage and irrigation canals. Production in flat areas is irrigated.
Paddy is the most important crop.
2.2    Major floods occurred in the Plain in 1954, 1959 and 1977. In 1959, twenty percent of
the dwellings in the area were flooded and the Plain was under two meters of water, parts of it
for several months. The 1977 flood, caused major damage to the dikes because of their generally
poor state of maintenance. About 16,000 persons were affected, large areas of the city were
flooded and an important part of the rice crop was lost.
2.3    The Government had, at the time of project preparation (1979-80) no coherent multi-
sectoral plan for the protection of the city and the Plain against floods. The proposed project was
to fill this gap and assist the Government in defining an integrated flood control and development
program for the area.
3.    Project Obiectives and Description
3.1    The objective of the project was to support the Government's efforts to prepare an
integrated flood control and development program for the Plain of Antananarivo. Specifically,
the project had the following components:



(i)    pre-investment studies to be conducted at the pre-feasibility stage to define a
technically coherent, economically justified and financially feasible investment
program. The studies were to include:
(a)    Review and critical analysis of existing documentation and experience
with available technical options to protect the Plain against floods and
improve drainage; and with agronomic packages to intensify agriculture
in the region;
(b)    Definition of possible flood control and development schemes, taking
into account their implications for the future growth pattern of the
Antananarivo urban area;
(c)    Assessment of costs and benefits of possible schemes, with an analysis
of their economic consequences in all sectors involved; and finally
(d)    Definition of not more than five feasible programs and a proposal for a
choice among them; these programs would also define self-contained
steps for phased implementation.
(ii)   Improve the network of research stations for erosion and soil protection on the
upper catchment areas of the Plain, and improve the hydrological measurement
and flood alert network in the Plain; and
(iii)   Strengthen the capability of the Directorate General of Planning of the Ministry
of Finance and Planning to supervise the program of studies for the Plain.
4.    Project Design and Oreanization
4.1    The project had a relatively simple design. It was set up to carry out a number of pre-
feasibility studies in preparation for one or more larger scale investment projects. The project
consisted of four basic phases:
I.     Collection of existing data and proposition of a limited number of technically
coherent plans (TCP).
II.    Detailed work on the technical implications of the TCPs.
III.   Financial and economic analysis of the costs and benefits of the TCPs.
IV.   Comparison of the TCPs.
4.2    The involvement of the General Directorate of Planning of the Ministry of Finance and
Planning was expected to contribute to strengthening the coordination, supervision and decision-
making capabilities within that ministry.
4.3    Three types of risks had been identified: (i) the complexity of the technical and socio-
economic problems involved; (ii) the intricacy of the coordination and decision making process;
and (iii) the uncertainty over the feasibility of a flood control scheme.

5.    Proiect Implementation
Project Effectiveness
5.1   The project was approved on December 18, 1980, and became effective on October 16,
1981, a delay of about seven months. This delay was caused by bureaucratic tardiness in
obtaining the Government's legal opinion.
Disbursements
5.2    Disbursements were slow for the following reasons: (a) project execution was initially
held up due to late credit effectiveness; (b) late availability of the aerial photographs and
problems with the mathematical model of Plain hydrology; and (c) project activities were
redesigned to include preparation of detailed design and tender documents for irrigation
rehabilitation and flood protection. As a result, the closing date of the credit was extended twice
to December 31, 1985. A third extension to December 31, 1986, was granted to permit
financing of the studies for the Drainage/Flood Control Project (never implemented), which were
completed in September 1986.
Studies
5.3   The contract for conducting the pre-investment studies was given to a Malagasy-French
engineering consortium EEGC DINIKA/SCET International; the award of the contract was held
up for some months by disagreement within the Commission Centrale de Marches and was
ultimately signed in October 1981 by the Minister of Finance without the Commission having
reached agreement. The contract was signed in November 1981. Due to the late award of the
contract, a dry season for aerial photography was lost. The contract for the supervision of the
study was awarded in February 1982 to the Malagasy-Dutch consortium EEDR
Mamokatra/EuroConsult for the sum of FMG 36,662,460 (about US$100,000).
5.4    A severe cyclone, which occurs on average only once every seven years, struck at the
beginning of 1982. This provided a unique opportunity for the compilation of data on flood
damage caused by the Ikopa River overrunning its banks. Delays were incurred, however, when
the consulting firm was obliged to use Air Madagascar for aerial photography. Photos were of
mediocre quality and only part of the project area had been photographed. As a result, the
contract period had to be extended from 21 to 30 months and the contract price increased from
FMG 439,200,000 (about US$1.2 million) to FMG 484,000,000. Topographical and geological
surveys were carried out and high water levels were measured. Phase I was completed by the
end of February 1983. Even though the aerial photography had still not been completed, two
reports were produced: (i) outlining the data underlying all TCPs; and (ii) an outline of the
TCPs. Four conclusions could be drawn at the end of Phase I. First, Government and donors
had a limited capacity to fund a project. Second, the Phase II studies would need to be project
oriented. Third, the limited capacity of local institutions to support Phase II activities, and
fourth, the limited role of agriculture in likely project orientations.
5.5   Phase II and Phase III studies were implemented with some delays (Table 5, Part III).
The delays were the result of the late availability of the aerial photographs and problems with the
mathematical model of the Plain's hydrology. Cost estimates for the six selected scenarios ranged
from FMG 19-26 billion (about US$ 32-45 million). The two least cost solutions were selected



for further evaluation. Z/ The Plain was divided in seven hydrologically homogeneous units.
For each of these units, three rehabilitation and/or improvement scenarios were considered: (i)
raising dike levels; (ii) construction of a reservoir dam; and (iii) raising dike levels and
construction of a drainage system separate from irrigation canals). The final results showed that
raising dike levels of the right bank of the Ikopa river (Laniera irrigation scheme) to the ten year
flood level was the most cost-effective approach. The protection of Antananarivo's lower town
had by this time been separated from the general flood control problem of the Plain. The
construction of a reservoir dam was not judged feasible because of siltation problems.
5.6    By December 1984, the project, as originally designed, was winding to a close with its
primary objective achieved; i.e., a master plan for the protection of the Plain had been prepared.
In the process, three promising project ideas emerged which represented the first stages of the
master plan implementation. It was decided to use the remaining funds on the feasibility of these
studies. This was the justification for the extension of the closing date. The three engineering
designs prepared were: (i) the flood protection works for the lower town of Antananarivo; (ii)
the rehabilitation of the Laniera irrigation scheme; and (iii) improvement of the downstream
drainage of the Plain.
5.7    Supervision of the feasibility studies for flood protection of the lower town of
Antananarivo was transferred to the East Africa Projects Water and Urban Department as part
of the preparation of the Sanitation and Flood Control Project of the City of Antananarivo, which
later became the Antananarivo Plain Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG).
5.8    The Laniera Perimeter was, after additional studies, excluded from  the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1337-MAG), because investment requirements were too large and the
area did not fit the selection criteria.  The French Caisse Centrale pour la Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) provided financing for this irrigation scheme under a separate arrangement.
The improved drainage of the Plain through additional pumps or a gravity style design was
judged not to be economically feasible.
5.9    A special study had been made of soil erosion problems in the catchment areas of the
Ikopa and Sisaony rivers based on six experimental sites in the Ikopa catchment area and aerial
photography. It was found that the Sisaony catchment area was very much degraded and in need
of reafforestation. Possible solutions would be sought under the Forestry Management and
Protection Project (Cr. 1878-MAG), which was under preparation at the time.
Research Stations
5.10   Decisions on the types of equipment needed to improve the network of research stations
for erosion and soil protection on the upper catchment areas of the Plain could not be taken. It
was unclear what equipment would serve future needs best, given the range of technical solutions
to the flooding problem. It was therefore decided to include the procurement of this equipment
in a potential follow-on project.
21     A later supervision mission estimated the lowest cost scenarios at US$ 40 million. No
reason for the discrepancy could be found in files.



- 5 -
Strengthening the Directorate General of Planning of the Ministry of Finance and Planning
5.11   The project was to fund local consultants to assist the Directorate General in supervising
the studies and to provide transportation. The Malagasy-Dutch engineering consortium, EEDR
Mamokatra/EuroConsult was hired for this purpose (para. 5.3) and a vehicle was procured for
the project coordinator within the Directorate General. No implementation issues arose.
6.    Results
6.1    This was a successful Technical Assistance project. A masterplan for the rehabilitation
and long-term development of the Plain was completed and designed to minimize investment
needs and maximize economic benefits, to improve the flood-warning system for the lower town
of Antananarivo, and to provide for institutional coordination of major structures in the plain.
The masterplan was ultimately used as the basis for preparing the Antananarivo Plain
Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG). It also led to significant donor support for other projects
on the Plain.
7.    Sustainability
7.1    Project results were sustainable in the sense that the studies led to several IDA and donor
financed interventions.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1    Bank supervision missions were frequent. They were mostly combined with other
supervision missions in Madagascar to save resources. Staff involved adhered to project
objectives and were able to convince Government of the need to limit design options and
minimize investment costs.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1    Government's response was slow in the recruitment of consultants.  Government
submitted a list of nine pre-selected firms, and although the Bank proposed to reduce the list to
five or six, Government maintained its decision to invite proposals from the nine firms. In April
1981, Government notified the Bank of its intention to award the contract to EEGC
DINIKA/SCET International. Although Government was notified of Bank's non-objection in
May 1981, the contract was not submitted for another six months in spite of repeated requests
by Bank missions. The contract was finally awarded to consultants on November 12, 1981. This
delayed start-up of the project.
10.   Consultants Performance
10.1   Both consulting consortiums performed satisfactorily. The technical quality of the studies
was in line with expectations and the same two consulting consortiums were maintained during
project implementation.

11.   Project Documentation
11.1  Project files were incomplete, with two supervision reports missing. Due to the long
delay in producing this PCR, much of the institutional memory was lost.
