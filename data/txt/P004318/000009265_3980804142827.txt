IMPLEMENTATICON COMPLETION REPORT
M[ALAYSIA
THIRD FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3484-MA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third FELCRA Land
Development Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 3484-MA in the amount of US$94.0 million
was approved on June 9, 1992, signed oni July 13, 1992, and made effective on September 1,
1992.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1997, one year after the original closing date. There was
a cancellation of US$5.54 million on November 26, 1992, because of Government's decision to
proceed with the procurement of unmixed fertilizers under Central Government Contract
guidelines and not eligible for reimbursement under the Loan. The remaining loan amount of
US$88.46 million was fully disbursed with the last disbursement being made on July 22, 1997.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Philippe Boyer (Task Manager) and William Cuddihy
(Agricultural Economist), with the assistance of Mr. David Sislen (Consultant) and Mmes.
Nancy Barrett (Program Assistant) and Amanda Days (Task Assistant), Rural Development and
Natural Resources Sector Unit of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EASRD), and was reviewed
by Mr. Geoffrey Fox, Sector Manager, EASRD, and Mr. Guy Darlan, Acting Country Director
for Malaysia. The Borrower provided comments that are included as Appendix 2 to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR is based on the findings of the Bank's implementation completion
mission in October 1997 and on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR by offering views r eflected in the mission's Aide-Memoire (Appendix 1),
commenting on the draft ICR, and preparing its own evaluation of project execution
(Appendix 2).



MALAYSIA
THIRD FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3484-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
i.   Introduction.  By the early 1990s, Malaysia's economic growth was rapid and
widespread. However, significant pockets of poverty remained, particularly in rural areas.
Government rural development policy concentrated on eliminating rural poverty through
expansion of smallholder settlement schemes and through rehabilitation of existing
smallholdings. Because of low farm incomes, many rubber smallholders had reverted to part-
time care of their holdings to enable them to work in higher paying jobs elsewhere, others had
neglected their rubber entirely with occasional tapping when rubber prices rose cyclically, while
still others had left their trees in the care of older family members who often were unable to carry
out the more arduous work. Following on from the series of successful FELDA land
development projects supported by the Bank, Government extended the approach of using a
well-funded parastatal agency, FELCRA, to develop and manage land for smallholder treecrop
production as a cooperative estate to rehabilitate existing farrrmland.
ii.   Project Objectives. The project followed on three successful previous Bank-assisted
projects aimed at supporting and expanding FELCRA's rural development activities. It was
designed as a four-year time slice to support FELCRA's continuing development program and
was aimed at: (a) increasing rural incomes and improving the quality of rural life; (b) expanding
national tree crop revenues; (c) strengthening FELCRA's institutional capacity to develop the
rural sector; and (d) assisting with its efforts to disengage from the management of mature
operations and palm oil mills. The project included two main components: agricultural
development and strengthening of FELCRA's institutional capacity.
iii.   Evaluation of Objectives. Project objectives were clear, realistic, and timely, building
on the achievement of the three previous projects supporting :FELCRA, and were consistent with
the Bank's assistance strategy for Malaysia, which, in the early 1990s, emphasized reduction in
rural poverty. Conceptually, the project was neither comaplex nor risky, and, considering
FELCRA's satisfactory past implementation performance, did not place heavy demands on the
Borrower's implementation capacity. Ex-post, the major project risk was the continuing decline
of interest in rubber. This was known at appraisal and flexibility was given for crop choice.
Another major project risk, i.e. the difficulty of finding available land suitable for crop expansion
and rehabilitation in Peninsular Malaysia, was not identified at appraisal.
iv.   Achievement of Objectives. Project implementation was generally satisfactory but took
about five and half years, one and half years longer than estimated at appraisal, mainly due to the
slow progress of the crop expansion and rehabilitation program, caused by the increasing demand
for land for non agricultural purposes in Peninsular Malaysia.  By closing date, despite



-iii-
decreasing land availability, FELCRA had achieved about 106% of the appraisal targets for oil
palm development and 131% for the maintenance of immature crops, while it had successfully
introduced labor-saving rubber tapping techniques in about 90% of mature rubber areas and
completed most agricultural infrastructure development. However, only 26% of the appraisal
targets for incremental rubber planting were achieved, as farmers showed more interest in oil
palm than in rubber, reflecting oil palm's higher return and lower labor requirements. The
savings were used to finance maintenance of existing rubber and oil palm. Very little interest
was shown by farmers in diversified crops, such as fruits, because of higher market risks.
Institution building objectives were partially achieved.   FELCRA's capabilities were
strengthened with the creation of new Plantation and Finance Divisions and a structure to
coordinate human resource development, the implementation of an extensive training program
for staff and settlers, and the privatization of management of the palm oil mills. However, the
divestment program to turn responsibility for scheme management back to farmers after loan
repayment was completed by the scheimes' participants stopped at an early stage, pending
completion of Government's review of the role of state land development agencies. By loan
closing, Government was in the final stage of restructuring FELCRA as a self-financing state-
owned corporation providing management services directly to settlers and settler groups.
v.    Project Costs and Financing. Total project costs at RM1,005.8 million (US$386.8
million) at closing date (June 30, 1997) were very close to appraisal estimates of RM976 million
(US$361.6 million). The share of agricultural development costs (RM466 million) in total
project costs (46%) was close to that estimated at appraisal (44%), as the reduction in new rubber
establishment was compensated by the increase in crop maintenance during the extended project
period. Other project costs were also generally consistent with appraisal estimates, with the
exception of expenditures for vehicles and equipment below appraisal estimates.
vi.   Results and Impact. The project has had a marked impact on production, planted area,
productivity, incomes, employment and concerned institutions, both in the beneficiary
communities and for the Government. About 14,500 families are expected to benefit directly
from the establishment of new schemes at full development. The annual output of areas
developed under the project is expected to rise around 2010, at full production, to about 105,000
tons of palm oil, 23,000 tons of palm kernel and 8,500 tons of dry rubber, which would be worth
a total of about RM275 million annually at March 1998 prices (about US$78 million at March
1998 exchange rate). On newly planted areas, the net incremental income per beneficiary
working on the scheme with an average 2.5 ha is estimated at full production to reach about
RM700/month for rubber and RM1,400/month for oil palm. This compares favorably with the
official poverty threshold of RM425 per month per family.  For absentee beneficiaries,
comprising about 70% of beneficiaries, the net incremental income for an average 2.5 ha holding
is estimated to reach about RM350/nionth for rubber and RM1,300/month for oil palm.
FELCRA's continued operation of the schemes allows beneficiaries to earn substantial non-farm
incomes away from their holdings.
vii.  Project Sustainability. Project sustainability depends on the future of FELCRA. At
present, participants of mature schemes are dependent upon FELCRA for scheme operation and
maintenance. FELCRA will have to prove its ability to continue without the budgetary transfers



-iv-
which Government has decided to end in line with the policies set out under the Seventh
Malaysia Plan toward the commercialization of the smallholder sub-sector and the improvement
of productivity.
viii.  Project Outcome. The overall outcome of the project is satisfactory. Project objectives
were largely achieved and the re-estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is 12% compared to
the appraisal estimate of 13%.
ix.   Performance of the Bank and the Borrower.  Bank performance overall was
satisfactory during the project cycle. The excellent working relationship developed between
FELCRA and the Bank during the previous projects greatly assisted the preparation and later
implementation of the project. The rapport was particularly enhanced by the technical assistance
provided by the Bank for the introduction of the labor saving rubber exploitation technology, as
well as in the area of financial management. Continuity of staff with the required expertise was
maintained by the Bank during project supervision and was much appreciated by FELCRA.
Overall performance of the Borrower was also satisfactory. FELCRA was able to achieve most
project objectives, despite occasional budgetary shortages and increasing competition for land
while coping with uncertainties related to the reorganization of its structure.
x.    Future Operation. FELCRA was corporatized on September 1, 1997, and is now a
company known as FELCRA Berhad, wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance. All the
programs started under the project will be completed, operated and maintained by FELCRA
Berhad. When schemes have repaid their development loans, however, settlers will have to
decide whether they require further assistance from FELCRA Berhad. For schemes which have
commenced production but not repaid their development loans, the output will be marketed
through FELCRA Berhad, while marketing arrangements will be discussed with settlers of
schemes which have repaid their loans. Operating and maintenance costs, including FELCRA
Berhad's management expenditures, will be financed by sales of the schemes output and
commercial bank loans, and will not require any Government funding. Key indicators proposed
by FELCRA to monitor future project impact include: crop maintenance area (ha); production
(total and yield/ha); oil palm and rubber prices; total income; maintenance and production costs;
and income per ha and settlers' incomes.
xi.   Key Lessons Learned.  The main lessons learned from project implementation
experience are the following: (a) in a rapidly industrializing economy like that of Malaysia,
agricultural development projects need to take into account in project design the increasing
opportunity cost of land and labor; (b) projects intended to promote production of specific
commodities need to be flexible to respond to market signals; (c) smallholder development using
a parastatal agency functioning essentially as an estate plantation can be successful in
overcoming the special problems in treecrops with long gestation periods and high start-up
capital requirements provided the agency is adequately funded and competently staffed.



MALAYSIA
THIRD FELCRA LAN:D DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOiAN 3484-MA)
PART I: PROJECT IM4PLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.   Introduction. The project followed on three successful Bank-assisted projects' aimed at
supporting and expanding FELCRA's rural development activities. In 1991, when the project
was appraised, output of the agricultural sector was growing at a relatively high rate of 5% per
annum. However, this was slower than thie 7% per annum in the previous decade as expansion
into new lands slowed, and was slower than the growth rate of the economy as a whole.
Although the sector contributed about 15°% of GDP, this was down from 25% a few years earlier
as the pace of industrialization accelerated. Since farming still employed 25% of the work force
the relative decline in agricultural incomes was a major concern for Government. The
Government's Second Outline Perspective Plan 1991-2000 reaffirmed the objectives for the
sector set out in the National Agricultural Policy. These were to (a) maximize farm incomes to
alleviate poverty and retain productive labor in the sector, and (b) expand production of export
and import-substituting agricultural commodities. At that time, about 86% of planted area in
Malaysia was devoted to treecrops and the country was the largest producer and exporter of
rubber and palm oil. The 1990 Household. Expenditure Survey estimated that most farmers were
rubber and oil palm smallholders with relatively low productivity compared to that of estates and
a key rural development strategy was the rehabilitation and consolidation of these smallholdings
using a variant of the successful approach employed by FELDA to develop new land. The
approach used by FELCRA identified Large blocks of low productivity smallholdings and
grouped farmers into clusters. Participants entered into contracts with FELCRA whereby the
agency would consolidate the holdings into large management units (schemes). Each scheme
would be replanted and provided with infrastructure and managed through to crop maturity.
Costs and returns from sales of produce would be pro-rated to individual farmers' accounts
depending on their land contribution. FELCRA managed sales and processing, and cost recovery
was through deductions from sales income. At maturity, management theoretically would revert
to the smallholders who would be able to clear the liens on land titles as the loans were paid off.
2.    Statement of Objectives. The project, which was designed as a four-year time slice to
support FELCRA's continuing development program, was aimed at: (a) increasing rural incomes
and improving the quality of rural life; (b) expanding national tree crop revenues; (c)
strengthening FELCRA's institutional capacity to develop the rural sector; and (d) assisting with
Trans Perak Area Development Project (Loan 1960-MA); FELCRA I Project (Loan 2013-MA); Second
FELCRA Land Development Project (Loan 2917-MA).



-2-
its efforts to disengage from the management of mature agricultural development schemes and
palm oil mills.
3.    To accomplish those objectives, the project included two main components: agricultural
development and institutional strengthening of FELCRA. Agricultural development activities
consisted of: (a) the rehabilitation of idle lands by establishing about 48,000 ha of crops, at a rate
of 12,000 ha/year; (b) the maintenance of 83,900 ha planted! prior to the project and 36,000 ha
planted during 1992-94; (c) the construction of associated infrastructure, including access roads,
offices and staff quarters, utilities and harvesting facilities, and state offices and training
facilities; and (d) the promotion of improved crop production technology, including the
introduction of labor saving exploitation methods in rubber and the use of sound nursery
production systems for rubber and oil palm. The institutional development program consisted of
organizational changes, improvement in financial and agricultural management, human resource
development and disengagement from the management of mature operations and palm oil mills.
4.    Evaluation of Objectives. Project objectives were clear, realistic, and timely, building
on the achievement of the three previous projects supporting ,FELCRA, and were consistent with
the Bank's assistance strategy for Malaysia, which, in the early 1990's, emphasized reduction in
rural poverty. Conceptually, the project was neither complex nor risky, and, considering
FELCRA's satisfactory past implementation performance, did not place heavy demands on the
Borrower's implementation capacity. Ex-post, the major project risk was the continuing decline
of interest in rubber. This was known at appraisal and flexibility was given for crop choice. The
relative profitability of rubber continued to decline and only 26% of the target area for
incremental rubber was actually planted. The savings were used to finance maintenance of
existing rubber and oil palm. Another major project risk, i.e. the difficulty of finding available
land suitable for agricultural development in Peninsular Malaysia, was not identified at appraisal.
During project implementation, the demand for land for non-agricultural purposes rose markedly
and severely constrained the availability of land for crop expansion and rehabilitation,
particularly in Peninsular Malaysia, while in East Malaysia chronic labor shortages constrained
the suitability of this labor-intensive strategy.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.   Impact on Rural Incomes.  The number of families directly benefiting from the
establishment of new schemes under the project is expected to be around 12,000 at full
development, while the number of other beneficiaries such as oil palm harvesters and rubber
tappers is expected to be about 2,500. On newly planted areas, the net incremental income per
beneficiary working on the scheme with an average 2.5 ha is estimated at full production to reach
about RM700/month for rubber and RM1,400/month for oil palm. This compares favorably with
the official poverty threshold of RM425 per month per family. For absentee beneficiaries,
comprising about 70% of beneficiaries, the net incremental income for an average 2.5 ha holding
is estimated to reach about RM350/month for rubber and RM1,300/month for oil palm, because
of the need to pay for tapping and harvesting. FELCRA's continued operation of the schemes
allows beneficiaries to eam substantial non-farm incomes away from their holdings. Because
FELCRA schemes are spread throughout the country, there is a wide variation in participants'



-3-
incomes. Overall recovery of loan payiments due are above 95% because output is usually sold
through marketing arrangements with FELCRA which deducts loan payments before passing on
returns to growers.
6.   Impact on Treecrop Revenues and Exports. The annual output of schemes planted
under the project is expected to rise around 2010, at full production, to about 105,000 tons of
palm oil, 23,000 tons of palm kernel and 8,500 tons of dry rubber, representing 100% of
appraisal targets for oil palm and only 25% for rubber due to the reduction in area planted to
rubber under the project. The combined output of palm oil and rubber, which would represent
less than 2% of national production at that time, would be worth a total of RM275 million
annually at March 1998 prices (US$78 rnillion at March 1998 exchange rate).
7.    Institutional Development Impact. FELCRA's capabilities continued to strengthen
under the project. Two new Finance and Plantation Divisions, headed by qualified and
experienced Directors promoted from within FELCRA, were established on January 1, 1994, one
year after the date agreed at negotiations (December 31, 1992), as FELCRA had to wait for the
outcome of Government's review of public service staffing. As anticipated at appraisal, the
creation of the new Plantation Division, which was staffed with some of the best scheme
managers and agricultural professionals drawn from the state offices, enhanced the capabilities of
FELCRA to supervise the agricultural schemes, monitor the progress and quality of land
development and enabled FELCRA to achieve the significant improvement in agricultural
performance noted above. With the creation of the new Finance Division, grouping the
previously separated finance, budgeting and data processing sections, FELCRA's financial
management capabilities were also considerably strengthened, and the accounting and financial
management systems were improved in-house by FELCRA's staff, with the Bank's technical
advice, without the inputs of external consultants as had been envisaged at appraisal. In January
1994, FELCRA also created three units under the Director of Personnel to deal with human
resource planning, training of staff and settlers, and personnel administrative functions. With the
establishment of a strong focus for human resource development and the completion of two new
training facilities at Seberang Perak and. Tebbing Tinggi, FELCRA was able to turn its attention
to human resource management and obtain maximum effectiveness from its large investment in
training and staff development, which from 1992 to 1997 included training for a cumulative
12,732 staff participants (of which 15% were females), and a cumulative 44,223 settlers and
dependents (37% females).
8.    Divestiture of Scheme Management. FELCRA's program of withdrawal from the
management of mature agricultural schemes, which had repaid their land development loans, was
only partially implemented. After the initial transfer in January 1992 of 16 schemes to KPFB
Holdings, a company formed by the settlers' cooperatives with FELCRA's assistance, and the
satisfactory review of their first year performance under new management, FELCRA
recommended the transfer in 1993/94 of a second batch of 16 schemes which had repaid their
loans. The second transfer did not proceed as planned, however, for lack of formal approval
from the Ministry of Rural Development, which was reconsidering the role of FELCRA first in
the context of a rationalization study of the different land development agencies and later within
the framework of preparation of the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000). With regard to the



-4-
palm oil mills, FELCRA disengaged itself from their management in November 1991 in favor of
KPFB Holdings. After the transfer of management responsibilities, the financial results of the
mills showed increased turnover and an improved level of profitability.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
9.    Project implementation was generally satisfactory but took about five and half years,
one and half years longer than estimated at appraisal, mainly due to the slower than expected
progress of the agricultural land development program and delays in associated civil works.
However, with the extension of the closing date by one year, FELCRA was able to fulfill most
project implementation targets with the exception of a significant shortfall in the establishment of
new rubber areas.
10.   Agricultural Development. From the beginning of the project, FELCRA experienced
increasing difficulties in sourcing idle land suitable for rehabilitation and consolidation in
Peninsular Malaysia due to the rapid pace of industrialization in the country and the increasing
release of agricultural land for the housing and industrial sectors. Toward the end of the project,
however, FELCRA accelerated the pace of new land development for oil palm in Sarawak and
Sabah, where vast areas are still available for agricultural development, and the one-year
extension of the project enabled FELCRA to complete the physical development of a number of
ongoing projects. By the closing date, FELCRA had achieved 106% of appraisal targets for oil
palm with 25,396 ha planted or cleared and ready for planting, but only 26% for rubber with
4,979 ha planted, and 6% for diversified crops, amounting to 64% of aggregated appraisal
targets. The cumulative area of maintenance of immature crops, including areas planted prior to
the project, amounted to 408,722 ha for 1992-1997, about 31% above the appraisal estimate of
312,000 ha for 1992-1995, while the average annual maintenance of immature crops, at about
68,000 ha, however, was 13% below the appraisal estimate, due to the shortfall in the
establishment of new rubber areas during the project period.
11.   While indicative crop ratio targets for oil palm, rubber and other crops (fruits) had been
set at appraisal, the final crop choice was made at the local level, based on the consensus of
scheme beneficiaries, local agro-climatic conditions, commodity price trends and crop
processing/marketing facilities. The actual crop ratio of 83:16:1 achieved under the project
against targets of 50:40:10, confirmed the marked emphasis on oil palm observed under the
previous Second FELCRA Land Development Project (Loan 2917-MA), which had achieved an
actual crop ratio of 71:26:3. It reflected the continuing increasing financial attractiveness of oil
palm and the declining interest in rubber partly caused by its higher labor requirements as
compared to oil palm, in the context of increasing labor shortages, and demonstrated the capacity
of FELCRA to respond to market signals. Instead of promoting new rubber development,
FELCRA concentrated its efforts on maintenance and productivity increases.
12.  Improved Crop Production Technology.  The program  was aimed at enhancing
agricultural performance, to increase the profitability of the agricultural schemes and increase
smallholder incomes. Its main focus was to expand the pilot program of demonstration of the



-5-
labor saving, reduced frequency tapping (RFT) technology for rubber exploitation, which was
launched with the Bank's assistance in 1990 under the previous Second FELCRA Land
Development Project, and to introduce the technology progressively to all rubber schemes facing
labor shortages. The technology consists of the use of tapping systems combining a reduction of
the tapping frequency with chemical yield stimulation to compensate for the lower number of
tapping days. The program received strong support from management, which was concerned
with the increasing shortage of tappers and untapped rubber areas in many schemes, and
benefited from continued assistance from the Bank. By the closing date, FELCRA had
successfully introduced RFT in about 39,100 ha, representing 90% of total mature rubber areas.
The results of the demonstration blocks and the economic evaluation of RFT carried out by
FELCRA in 1995 confirmned the effectiveness of the technology in overcoming labor shortages
and improving the economics of rubber exploitation. This increased tappers' productivity by
about 50% (in d/3) to 70% (in d/4), while maintaining the same yields in d/3 and reducing bark
consumption, reducing labor requirements and tapping costs while doubling average tappers'
incomes to about RM500/month and increasing dividends to settlers. Overall, FELCRA reduced
its labor requirements by 3,500 tappers and the number of tasks lost due to the lack of tappers to
16% in 1996 from about 30% in the early 1990s. In the context of the improved crop production
technology program, FELCRA also promoted and achieved improvements in the quality of
rubber and oil palm planting materials. For rubber, two pilot nurseries were established
following a study tour to private rubber nurseries in Indonesia organized for three FELCRA
managers with the assistance of the Bank. The pilot program for rubber, however, was
discontinued after partial improvements had been achieved in planting material quality, due to
the declining selection of rubber for new land development.
13.   Agricultural Performance.  Based on the actual yields of the first three years of
production of oil palm planted under the project, which are above the appraisal estimates,
reflecting the improvement in nursery standards and general crop maintenance, it is expected that
yields of oil palm will achieve appraisal expectations of an annual average of about 18 tons
FFB/ha over 25 production years with a peak of about 22 tons by the 10th production year. For
rubber, production of trees planted under the project has not started, due to its longer immaturity
period. However, based on the successfuil adoption of the new rubber exploitation technology,
the improvement in planting material quality and the implementation of monoclonal planting
policy, it is also expected that rubber yields will achieve appraisal expectations of an annual
average of about 1.5 tons over 24 production years, with a peak of about 1.7 tons by the 10th
production year.
14.   Associated Infrastructure Development. Construction of associated scheme infrastructure
progressed slower than expected at appraisal mainly due to changes in policies, insufficient
budget allocations in certain years, and delays in procurement. By the closing date, however, the
program was completed with respect to access roads (145% of appraisal targets), latex collecting
centers (196%) and oil palm FFB loading ramps (90%), water and electricity supply systems
(131%), but remained far below targets for staff housing (28%), as a smaller number of new
houses were needed due to the short.fall of land for agricultural development and the
rationalization of scheme management arrangements through the establishment of clusters, in
line with Government's efficiency drive. Construction of the two training centers and four of



-6-
five state offices, which started under the previous Second FELCRA Land Development Project,
also remained behind schedule but was completed by the closing date, while construction of the
state office for Johor was unfinished (65% completed).
15.   Studies and Project Management Support. With the strengthening of its internal
financial management capabilities, the originally planned broad financial management study was
no longer required, and FELCRA management proposed to narrow its terms of reference to focus
on setting up a financial Management Information System (MIS). FELCRA, however, decided
not to proceed with the study, following the announcement in 1996 of the upcoming change in
FELCRA's organizational structure in the context of the Seventh Malaysia Plan. Two other
studies (Rural Industries and Production Costs), which had been tentatively included by the Bank
under the project, did not proceed, as FELCRA did not expand the rural industrialization
program and production costs were closely monitored and kept within control. The procurement
of equipment and vehicles included computer systems, weighbridges, agricultural tractors and
four wheel drive vehicles.
16.   Project Costs and Financing.  Total project costs at about RM1,005.8 million
(US$386.8 million) as of June 30, 1997, were consistent with appraisal estimates of RM976
million (US$361.6 million) (3% higher in RM and 7% higher in US$ terms because of exchange
rate movements). Although new crop development only achieved 64% of appraisal targets and
actual unit field development costs for oil palm and rubber were approximately equal to appraisal
estimates, the share of agricultural development costs (RM466 million) in total project costs
(46%) was close to that estimated at appraisal (44%), due to the increase in crop maintenance
expenditures during the extended project period, which compensated for the reduction in new
crop establishment expenditures.  Other project costs were also generally consistent with
appraisal estimates, with the exception of expenditures for vehicles and equipment which were
only 30% of appraisal estimates, as requirements were revised due to the reduction in new land
development and the adoption of longer periods before replacement.
17.   Major Factors Affecting the Project.   The main factors affecting  project
implementation were positive and included: the excellernt working relationship between
FELCRA management and the Bank, which was enhanced by Bank staff continuity; and
FELCRA's familiarity with Bank procedures (procurement and disbursement). However, there
were also some negative factors. The main one, which was beyond the control of the Borrower
and caused the loan to be closed one year later than planned at appraisal time, was the decreasing
availability of suitable land for agricultural development in Peninsular Malaysia, due to the rapid
pace of industrialization in the country and the increasing competition for agricultural land by the
housing and industrial sectors. Other negative factors included the progressive decline in
counterpart funding and slow procurement procedures.
18.   Counterpart Funding. Government financial stringency for agricultural development
during the Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-1995), resulting from the strong competing demands of the
industrial and tertiary sectors, directly affected FELCRA's capacity to implement the project as
planned at appraisal. Both the development budget and operational budgets remained almost
every year below appraisal estimates. The lower allocation for agricultural development was not



-7-
a significant factor in the shortfall of new crop development, but led FELCRA to extend the
economic life of vehicles and tractors before replacement and slowed down the implementation
of the infrastructure construction program. Budget cuts were particularly severe for operating
expenditures, which FELCRA had to finance from internal sources (interest earned and palm oil
profits), and resulted in the curtailment of training activities during the first two project years, as
well as other non critical activities.
19.   Procurement. Procurement of fertilizers, vehicles, tractors, computer equipment was
carried out following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. While the familiarity
of FELCRA with the Bank's procurement procedures facilitated the preparation of bidding
documents, FELCRA often faced difficulties in reconciling the Bank's bid evaluation
methodology with Government's regulations, causing delays in contract awards and fertilizer
delivery, thereby affecting crop maintenance on a number of occasions. National competitive
bidding (NCB) procedures were used for civil works and tractor trailers, while planting materials
were procured mostly from scheme cooperative nurseries under standard terms with FELCRA.
Crop maintenance works were carried out by force account. An ex-post review of NCB
procurement conducted by a Bank procurement specialist in 1996, resulted in FELCRA
rectifying some provisions, particularly with regard to the participation of foreign firms and bid
evaluation, to ensure their consistency w'ith Bank guidelines.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   Project sustainability depends on the future of FELCRA. At present, participants of
mature schemes are dependent upon FELCRA for scheme operation and maintenance. FELCRA
will have to prove its ability to continue without the budgetary transfers which Government has
decided to end, in line with the policies set out under the Seventh Malaysia Plan for encouraging
private sector participation in agriculture and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of all
agricultural agencies. Without FELCRA, participants would have to return, giving up work
elsewhere, or hire a plantation managernent company or form management cooperatives along
the lines of the KPFB, which would likely be unsustainable without FELCRA support.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
21.   Bank performance overall was satisfactory during the project cycle. The excellent
relationship developed between FELCIR and the Bank during the previous projects greatly
assisted the preparation and later implementation of the project. At all times there was frank
dialogue on project concerns. The rapport was particularly enhanced by the technical assistance
provided by the Bank for the introduction of the labor saving rubber exploitation technology,
through the regular participation of a consultant rubber specialist in almost each supervision
mission, as well as in the area of financial management through the frequent inputs of a Bank
financial specialist. Overall, continuity of staff with the required expertise was maintained by the
Bank during project supervision and was greatly appreciated by FELCRA.



-8-
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.   Overall performance of the Borrower was also satisfactory, except for insufficient
counterpart funding. FELCRA had to operate in a tight financial environment and was faced
with increasing competition for land from non-agricultural sectors. Furthermore, during the last
two project years, management and staff were awaiting the announced reorganization of
FELCRA into a corporate body, consistent with the directives of the Seventh Malaysia Plan, but
remained very conscious of the agency's mandate to farmers. Despite these constraints,
FELCRA was able to achieve most project objectives. Audit reports on SOEs and audited
financial statements of FELCRA were prepared and submitted to the Bank on time, except
during the first two years when audited financial statements vvere late.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
23.   The overall outcome of the project is satisfactory. Had agricultural land been available as
expected at appraisal, and the implementation period been shorter, the outcome would have been
rated highly satisfactory. The re-estimated net present value of the project at a discount rate of
10% is RM87.6 million, and the re-estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is 12%, compared to
the appraisal estimate of 13%.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
24.   FELCRA has already prepared an operational plan for the post project period (see
Appendix 1, Attachment). FELCRA was corporatized on September 1, 1997, and is now a
company known as FELCRA Berhad, wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance, while the
Ministry of Rural Development will act as the regulatory body for the Government. FELCRA
Berhad will continue to be committed to its role as the agent of socio-economic development for
the rural people while at the same time having to ensure profitability of its activities to remain
financially independent. All the programs started under the project will be completed, operated
and maintained to full maturity by FELCRA Berhad to ensure their long-term sustainability.
When schemes have repaid their development loans, however, settlers will have to decide
whether they require further assistance, and if so, whether they wish to enter into a management
contract with FELCRA Berhad or another plantation management company. For schemes which
have commenced production but not repaid their development loans, the output will be marketed
through FELCRA Berhad, while marketing arrangements will be discussed with settlers of
schemes which have repaid their loans. All new rubber areas coming into production will adopt
the reduced frequency tapping system. Operating and maintenance costs, including FELCRA
Berhad's management expenditures, will be financed by sales of the schemes output and
commercial bank loans, without requiring further Government funding.  For ongoing
development work started under the project, however, it is expected that funds will continue to
be provided from Government budget and FELCRA Berhad has obtained an allocation of
RMI 15.0 million for 1998.
25.   The following key indicators were proposed by FELCRA to monitor future project
impact: (a) crop maintenance area; (b) production (mature area, total pro" .1tion and yield); (c)



-9-
prices of oil palm and rubber; (d) total income; (e) cost of maintenance and production; and (f)
income per ha and settlers incomes.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   The main lessons learned from prcject implementation experience are the following:
(a)   in a rapidly industrializing economy like that of Malaysia, agricultural
development projects neecl to take into account in project design the increasing
opportunity cost of land and labor. More attention should have been paid to
imperfections in rural land markets since rehabilitation of uneconomic sized farm
units may not produce competitive incomes and after development the
fundamental problem may remain. In this case the farm sizes were too small to
generate an income competitive with those elsewhere. While the productivity
improvements were substantial, they appear to have been unable to offset the
decline in relative income on small holdings in the context of rapidly growing
non-farm incomes;
(b)   projects intended to prormote production of specific commodities need to be
flexible. The project essentially promoted rubber and oil palm even though
provision was made for diversified crops. Fortunately, the sharp decline in
interest in rubber was offset by oil palm; and
(c)   smallholder development using a parastatal agency functioning essentially as an
estate plantation can be successful in overcoming the special problems in
treecrops with long gestation periods and high start-up capital requirements,
provided the agency is adequately funded and competently staffed as was
generally the case with FELCRA. However, there remains the difficulty of
divesting control back to the settlers and ending subsidies, both explicit and
implicit, because the management, technology and financial structure of the
development are best suitecl for the estate mode of production.

MALAYSIA
THIRD FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 3484-MA)
World Bank October 1997 Implementation Compleition Report (ICR) Mission
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank mission, consisting of Messrs. Ph Boyer, Task Manager (Sr. Agronomist)
and W. Cuddihy (Sr. Agricultural Economist) visited Malaysia from October 20 to 25, 1997, to
solicit the views of the Borrower and the implementing agencies on project implementation and
operation, to provide advice and support to the Borrower for preparing its own contribution to the
ICR, and to collect data for the preparation of the ICR. During its stay, the mission met with
Dato' Dr. Hadenan Jalil, Secretary, Finance Division, Federal Treasury, Mr. Ahmad Konchong,
Director, Agricultural Section, EPU, and Dato' Mustapha Juman, Chief Executive Officer,
FELCRA Berhad. The mission also visited rubber and oil palm schemes in the State of Melaka.
The mission findings were discussed at a wrap up meeting hteld on October 24, 1997, and are
summarized in this aide-memoire, which, as usual, is subject to confirmation by Bank
management. The mission wishes to thank senior management and staff from FELCRA Bhd. for
the close assistance and courtesies extended to the mission.
2.    The Loan Agreement for US$94.0 million for the Third FELCRA Land Development
Project was signed between the Government of Malaysia and the World Bank on July 13, 1992,
and became effective on September 1, 1992. The closing date of the Loan was originally
scheduled on June 30, 1996, but was extended by one year to June 30, 1997, when the Loan was
closed. After the early cancellation of US$5.54 million, the remnaining Loan amount of US$88.46
million was fully disbursed, with the last disbursement on July 22, 1997.
3.    Discussions on preparation of the ICR for the project started in November 1996, and
continued during the March 1997 supervision mission, when detailed guidelines were provided
and ICR preparation arrangements agreed with FELCRA, as recorded in the aide memoire dated
April 8, 1997.
4.    Project Objectives and Main Features. The project followed on three successful
previous Bank assisted projects aimed at supporting and expanding FELCRA's rural
development activities. It was designed as a four year time slice to support FELCRA's
continuing development program and was aimed at: increasing rural incomes and improving the
quality of rural life; expanding national tree crop revenues; strengthening FELCRA's
institutional capacity to develop the rural sector; and assisting with its efforts to disengage from
the management of mature operations. The project included two main components: (i)
agricultural development consisting of the rehabilitation of idle lands by crop establishment and
early maintenance; associated infrastructure development; and promotion of improved crop
production technology; and (ii) strengthening of FELCRA's institutional capacity, through
organizational changes, improvement in financial and agricultural management, human resource
development and disengagement from management of mature operations.
5.    Project Implementation. Implementation of the land development program was slower
than anticipated at appraisal as, from the beginning of the project, FELCRA experienced



Appendix 1
-23-                        Page 2 of 3
increasing difficulties in sourcing new or idle land suitable for rehabilitation and consolidation in
Peninsular Malaysia due to the rapid pace of industrialization in the country and the increasing
release of agricultural land for the housing and industrial sectors. Toward the end of the project,
however, FELCRA accelerated the pace of new land development for oil palm in Sarawak and
Sabah, where vast areas are still availab]Le for agricultural development, and requested a one year
extension of the project to complete the physical development of a number of ongoing projects.
By the closing date, FELCRA had achieved 106% of appraisal targets for oil palm with 25,396
ha planted or cleared and ready for planting, but only 26% for rubber with 4,979 ha planted, and
6% for diversified crops, amounting to 62% of aggregated appraisal targets. The emphasis on oil
palm reflected the increasing financial attractiveness of oil palm and the declining interest in
rubber partly caused by its higher labor requirements as compared to oil palm, in the context of
increasing labor shortages, and demonstrated the capacity of FELCRA to respond to market
signals. Instead of promoting new rubber development, FELCRA concentrated its efforts on
maintenance and productivity increases. In this respect, FELCRA was very successful in
introducing labor saving technology for rubber exploitation (RFT) in rubber schemes facing
labor shortages, achieving a total of about 39,000 ha under RFT, as of June 30, 1997,
representing 91% of total mature rubber areas. FELCRA also promoted a pilot rubber nursery
program aimed at improving the quality of planting materials. Crop maintenance was
implemented on schedule, with on average about 70,000 ha of immature crops maintained
annually during the extended project period, achieving 131 % of appraisal targets. Construction of
the associated infrastructure was completed with respect to access roads (145% of appraisal
targets), latex collecting centers (196%/o) and oil palm FFB loading ramps (90%), water and
electricity supply systems (131%), traiining centers and state offices (86%), but remained far
below targets for staff housing (28%), consistent with the slow pace of land development.
6.    FELCRA achieved most project's objectives for institutional development. Plantation and
Finance Divisions were established, headed and staffed by qualified and experienced personnel.
FELCRA considerably strengthened its financial management capability with Bank's technical
assistance, and subsequently decided not to hire financial management consultants as envisaged
at appraisal. FELCRA carried out a large training program reaching about 2,500 staff and 8,500
scheme participants annually, and promoted access to training by women who accounted for one
third of total trainees. FELCRA, however, was unable to achieve appraisal objectives with
respect to its disengagement from the management of fully repaid schemes, as after the first
group of 16 schemes was transferred under the management of KPFB Holdings, the divestment
program was suspended pending the outcome of Government's review of agricultural
development policies and FELCRA's future role, in the context of the preparation of the Seventh
Malaysian Plan.
7.    Project Costs. Total project costs at about RM1,006 million as of June 30, 1997, were
consistent with appraisal estimates of RM976 million (103%). Although new land development
only achieved 62% of appraisal targets and actual unit field development costs for oil palm and
rubber were approximately equal to appraisal estimates, the share of agricultural development
costs (RM466 million) in total project costs (46%) was close to that estimated at appraisal (44%).
This reflected the increase in crop maintenance expenditures during the extended project period,
which compensated for the reduction in iiew crop establishment expenditures. Other project costs



Appendix 1
-24-                        Page 3 of 3
were also generally consistent with appraisal estimates, with the exception of expenditures for
vehicles and equipment which were only 30% of appraisal estimates, as requirements were
revised due to the reduction in new land development and the adoption of longer periods before
replacement.
8.    Project Impact. The project had a marked impact on production, planted area,
productivity, incomes, employment and concerned institutions, both in the beneficiary
communities and in Government. The number of families directly benefiting from the
establishment of new schemes under the project is expected to be around 12,000 at full
development, while the number of other beneficiaries such as oil palm harvesters and rubber
tappers is expected around 2,500. The output of schemes planted under the project is expected to
rise around 2010, at full production, to about 105,000 tons of palm oil and 8,500 tons of dry
rubber, respectively worth US$53 million and US$8.5 million annually at today's prices. This
would represent about 100% of appraisal targets for oil palm and only 25% for rubber due to the
reduction in area planted to rubber under the project. The combined output of palm oil and
rubber is equivalent to less than 2% of national production and would not depress prices. On
newly planted areas, the net incremental incomes per beneficiary per year are estimated at
US$1,500 equivalent for both oil palm and rubber.
9.    Future Operational Plan. The mission discussed the attached draft operational plan
prepared by FELCRA Bhd., which was established on September 1, 1997, as the successor to
FELCRA. The plan describes future institutional and financing arrangements as well as the
proposed key indicators for monitoring operational performance.
10.  ICR Preparation Schedule. It was agreed that: (i) FELCRA Bhd. would send its
contribution to the project ICR to the Bank by mid-November 1997; and (ii) the Bank would
send the draft ICR report to Government for comments by end-December 1997, with the aim of
finalizing the ICR report by end-January 1998.

Third Felcra:Land Developrnent Project which closed on June 30, 1997. The final
loan disbursement was on July 22, 1997.
2.  MAIN PROGRAMMES
The major programmes implemented under the project comprised the
following:
2.1   Africultural Development
e Rehabilitation through crop establishment of some 30,000 ha. of idle
and low productive smallholdings planted with oil palm. rubber and
other diversified crops, organized as group farms (or estates) and
benefiting about 12,000 families.
* Maintenance of areas planted before and during the project.
comprising 54,300 ha as of June 30, 1997.
*  Improved crop production technology focusing on the introduction of
reduced frequency tapping system in rubber (39,100 ha).
2.2  Infrastructure Support
-  Construction of access roads (528 km)
-  Construction of scheme buildings (21 scheme offices/stores/garages)
- Construction of Staff Quarters (205 units)
-  Water and Electricity Supply (176 installations)
- Harvesting Facilities ( 62 loading ramps and 55 latex collection centres)
- State Offices (4 units)
- Training Centre and School (2)

2.3   Institutional Strenzthening
-  Organizational Restructuring involving the establishment of 3 new divisions.
namely Finance and Human Resource Divisions.
- Improvement to accounting and financial management systems.
- Training.
- Withdrawal from 16 schemes which have repaid development loans.
2.4   Proiect Management SupRort
- Equipment. Furniture and Vehicles
- Computer Equipment
3.    OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
3.1   Institutional Arraneements
The main objectives of the project were to. increase the level and efficiency of
agricultural production and to improve the income and living conditions of rural
households in Malaysia. and to support the institutional development of Felcra. In
order to achieve these objectives, all the prograrrmes started under the project
must be completed. operated and maintained to ensure long term sustainability of
the project. For schemes which are or have commenced production, Felcra will
be responsible for the marketing of the scheme produce to ensure recovery of
development loan.  Scheme infrastructure and assets will continue to be
maintained accordingly.
Felcra was officially corporatized on September 1, 1997 and is now a company
known as Felcra Berhad wholly owned by the Minister of Finance Inc. The
Ministrv of Rural Development will act as the regulatory body for the
government. As from that date it is to be fully self-financing and has to source for
its own funds. Felcra Berhad will continue to be a social enterprise committed to
its role as the agent of socio-economic development for the rural people while at
the same time having to ensure profitabilitY of its prozrammes in order to be
financially independent.
With the corporatization of Felcra Berhad. the policv of scheme divestment will
no longer be implemented. Felcra Berhad will take over the management of the
16 schemes which have been managed by KPFB Holdings since 1992 and will
continue to manage all future schemes which have repaid their development loans
and request further management assistance.

3.2    Marketing Arranaements
For mature schemes which have not vet repaid their development loans. the output
which up to now has been marketed through the settlers' cooperative company,
KPFB Holding Sdn.Bhd.. will henceforth be sold through a company to be jointly
owned by Felcra Berhad and KPFB Holdings. For schemes which have repaid
their development loans, rnarketing arrangements will be discussed with the
settlers who mav decide to continue with the existing practice or may sell through
other channels.
3.3   Maintenance Arrangements
The agricultural schemes will continue to be maintained to full maturity by Felcra
Berhad. Crop maintenance for areas planted before and during the project cover
54.300 hectares and include costs such as weeding, fertilizer. pest control, pruning
and sanitation. soil and foliar analvsis and maintenance of farm roads, bridges and
drains. Contracts for various works in the schemes which are at various stages of
development. maintenance and production, will be carried out by contractors.
Prioritv for award of contracts will be to the scheme cooperatives. KPR. All new
rubber areas coming into production will automatically adopt the reduced
frequencv tapping (RFT) system while existing areas which still have not
converted to the RFT system will be encouraged to do so. Harvesting facilities
such as loading ramps and latex collection stations will continue to be constructed
in mature schemes which require them. Felcra Berhad will ensure that works
started under the project which are still ongoing will be completed including the
Johor State Office and other infrastructure facilities such as access roads, water
and electricity supply, staff houses and scheme office buildings.
3.4   Operation and Maintenance Fundine
The annual recurrent cost for operation and maintenance of schemes is estimated
as follows:
Scheme Management and Supervision Cost - RM53.88 million
Operating Cost (Production)           - RM 297.16 million
Infrastructure Maintenance Cost       - RM62.24 million
Total                                 - RM413.28 million
The above management expenditures would be paid to Felcra Bhd which would
manage and supervise the schemes where requested. Operating and maintenance
costs would be paid to suppliers. contractors and laborers and would be financed
by sales and commercial bank loans. Marketing fees would be paid to Felcra Bhd
and KPFB Holdings.

Page 4 of 4
These expenditures paid to Felcra Bhd and KPFEB Holdings would cover their
operating costs and these entities would be expected to be financially sustainable
and would not require further Government funding. However, for ongoing
development work started under the project or other work carried out on behalf of
Government. it is expected that these will be funded from Government's budget.
In this respect, Felcra Bhd has requested an allocation of RMI 15 million from the
Federal Government for 1998.

THIUD FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJEQ
(aan No. 3484 - MA)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION REPORT
This report is prepared by the imtplementing agency, Felcra Berhad (formerly the
Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority) on behalf of the borrower,
the Government ofMalaysia. It contains, inter alia,
(a) an assessmeat of the project objectives, design, implementation and operation
experience;
(b) an evaluation of the borrower's (Felcra's) own performance during the evolution
and implementation of the project;
(c)    an evaluation of the perfbrmaace of the Bank during the evolution and
implementation of the project, including the effectiveness of the relationship between
the borrower and the Bank; and
(d) lessons learned from the project which may be relevant in the future.
The report on the Operational Plan. for the project has been completed and submitted
to the Bank
(a) Assessment of Project Objectives, Design,
Implementation and Operation Experience
2. The project objectives as stated in the Appraisal Report were to support Felcra's
continued evolution into a stronger and more effective development institution, to
increase smallholder incomes and improve the quality of rural life; enhance the
quality and efficiency of agricultural performance; support the agency in the
transitional period as it began to disengage from the management of mature
agricultural schemes in favour of beneficiaries' cooperatives and to privatize
management of its palm oil mills; and expand national revenues from tree crops. The
main features of the project were to include:
(a)  rehabiliEation of about 48,000 ha of idle agriculrural lands and maintenance of
about 120,000 ha of tree crops under group farming arrangements, as well as
promotion of improved crop production technology for rubber and oil palm;
(b) construction of agricultural scheme infrastructure and management facilities;

financial managemenL computerized information systems and other management
support:
(d) support for Felcra's efforts to disengage trom the management of agricultural
schemes and palm oil mills;
(e) human resource development through staff training and skill training for scheme
workers and farily beneficiaries; and
(i technical assistance through consultant studies;
3. The project, which covcred a period of four years fiom 1992.1995 of the Si.xth
Malaysia Plan, was to provide for time-slice financing of the approved programme,
except for the activities of village development and nrral industries. The project
would absorb about 92% of Felcra's total budget for the period.
4. The project objectives were in line with the needs of Felcra at the time of
formulatihg the project. World Bank funding of Felcra's programmes through three
loans since 1981 has without doubt seen Felcra developing into a stronger and more
effective development institution and this loan further lent support and continued to
nurture Felcra into one of rhe strongest rural development agencies in Malaysia today.
5.  The objective of increasing the incomes of smallholder beneficiaries and
improving che quaLity of life has always been one of Felcra's main objectives and thus
fulfilled the organization's needs. In the 80s, Felcra's emphasis had been quantitative
rather than qualitative, i.e. to rehabilitate and develop as much idle lands as possible.
However, in thc ealy 90s. the emphasis had shifted to consolidation of what had been
developed thus far and enhancing the quality and efficiency of agricultural
performarLce, which was also in line with the Project's objectives.
6.   From  project preparation to appraisal, Felcra provided all the support and
information needed. Project preparation was made easy by the fact that Felcra III was
a continuation of Felcra if and staff continuity was maintained as the same Bank staff
who supervised Fetcra II were maintained for the preparation and supervision of
Felcra III. Bank's familiarity with Felcra operations helped considerably in speeding
up the project preparation stage. A strong feature during project inplezentLation was
the constructive dialogues and support between Bank staff and executing agency.
7. The project period occurred at a time when many of the schemes developed in thc
late 60s and early 70s had completed repayment of their land development loans and
were due for repIanting. It was also a time to hand over these mature schemes to the
scheme participants to be managed by thenL To ensure che conriinued existence and
sustainability of these schemes, the Felcra Sertlers' Cooperative Limited (KPFB)
established a company. KPFB Holdings Sdn. Bhd. to take over the management of
these schemes. The Barnk had shown keen interest and was supportive of such efforts
throughout its association with Felcra and had given technical and financial advice



-31-                     Appendix 2
Page 3 of 7
wherever and whenever necessary. Towards the later part of the loan period however.
circurnstances changed as Felcra was overtaken by events and changes in government
poLicies resulting in the switch to the corpomEisation of Felcra, announced by the
Governuent in Febrnary 1997. These changes rendered the objective of discngaging
from the mana,ement of mature schemes unnecessary.
8.  Bank's technical assistance in the area of improved crop production technology
under the Project had been most relevant and mirnely in a period in which Malaysia
was and still is facing severe labour shortage in the plantation industry in the wake of
rapid industrialization of the country. With Bank's assistance, Felcra has emerged as
the leading agency to adopt reduced frequency tapping (RFT) with chemical
stinulauion on a wide scale. For the first time, such a large-scale transfer of
technology to the srnallholders was introduced in the smallholder sector and this in
itself is indeed a great achievemcnt both for Felcra and for the rubber industry in
iMalaysia.
Implementation aiid Operation Experience
9. In general project implementation was fairlv satisfactory despite the fact that the
project was extended bY 1 V/2 years. Progress was slow with the agricultural
development component and it led to a corresponding delay in the associated
infrastructure development works. The labour-saving technology for rubber
exploitation had been successfully implemented in more than 90% of the mature
rubber areas and the pilot rubber nurscry production programme aimed at improving
the quality of planting materials was also in place though this was later abandoned
because of lack of interest in rubber development by scheme participants.
Phvsical Performance
10. At the end of loan closing in June 1997, the land development programme had
achieved 30,659 ha or 64% of appraisal target of 48.000 ha with 25,396.ha planted to
oil palm, 4,979 ha to rubber and 284 ha diversified crop. The shortfal in achievemenr
was due to the lack of availability of suitable agricultural lands for rehabilitation in the
Peninsular given the competing demands for such lands by the industrial sector as the
momentur  of industrialization vathered pace. A government directive favouring state
lands for agriculmre to be developed by the private sector fuarther aggravated Felcra's
physical performance, adversely affecting its consolidation programme. Oil palm
was the preferred crop to rubber in view of the faster returns and the comparatively
less labour requrement given the acutc labour shortage in all sectors of the economy.
II.  The project objective of improving Felcra's agricultural performance  was
achieved with the large-scale adoption of the RFT system in Felcra co address labour
shortage and consequent loss of production in rubber schemes. Felcra was able to
successfully introduce thc technology to 39,100 ha or 91% of total production areas.
To complement this programrne. a pilot intensive culling rubber nursery programme
was inplemented aimed at improving the qualitv of planting materials. Crop
maintenance for the immature areas. meanwhile progressed satisfactorily with about
6B.000 ha maintained annuallyv 13'% below appraisal estimate.*



-32-                      Appendix 2
Page 4 of 7
12. The infrastructure development component performed well, many exceeding or
nearing.appraisal targets with the exception of staff housing which only achieved 28%
but was anticipated due to the shortfall in land developmenL Components which
achieved or exceeded appraisal targets were access roads which achieved 145%10. latex
collecting centres 196%, water and electricity systems 131% and training
centre/school 100% while state offices and FFB loading ramps reached 86% and 90%
respectively.
13. As for institutional development, most of the project objectives were achieved -
Plantation, Finance and Human Resource Development Divisions were established.
headed by qualified and experienced staff; financial management capability was
strengthened with Bank's technical assistance and as a result, the financial and MIS
consultant was not engaged; annually an average of about 2.300 sta  and 8,000
scheme participants and their dependents were trained. However, in the divestment
programme involving the disengagement from the management of fiuly repaid
schemes. Felcra uws unable to achieve the appraisal objective after it stopped at the
hand-over of The first 16 schemes to the scheme participants through the holding
company of its cooperative arm, KPFB Holdings Sdn. Bhd. The next set of 16
schemes which was to be transferred to KPFB Holdings was postponed pending the
decision of the Ministry of Rural Development. This programme was fnally
cancelled with the corporatisation of Felcra as the newly-formed Felcra Berhad
decided to continue with the maintenance of these schemes on its owa4 subject of
course to The agreement of the scheme participants who incidentally have no objection
to Felcra Bhd.'s proposal in almost all the cases. It must be emphasized though rhe
participants are given the freedom of choice in selecting their managing agenL
14. The appointment of the financial and MIS consultant was cancelled because
Feicra's financial and accounting system improved markedly with each supervision
mission where Bank's senior financial analyst formed part of the team. Technical
advice was provided and on each occasion Felcra adopted the suggestions for
improvement to the extent that consultant services were no longer required.
15.  Felcra managed to submir audited SOEs on schedule and as for the audited
annual financial accounts, with the exception of the first two years. these were also
submirted fairly on time for the other years. This reflects on the efficiency of rhe
accounting system in generating the annual accounts in relatively good time to enable
the extemra auditors to perform their audit of Felcra's accounts within the time
sTipulated.
Financial Perfornance
16. The project costs up to June 30,1997 amounted to RMI.005.S million (US386.8
million) representing 103% of the appraisal estimate of RM976 million. While this
may appear to be inconsistent with the physical .chievement for new land
development of 62% against the appraisal target. in reality the discrepancy was
reflected in the increase in crop maintenance expenditures ot the exrended project
period.

17. Of the four World Bank-financec loan packages, the Third Felcra Project was the
largest with US88.46 million. From project identificaion to loan completion it went
on fairly smoothlv with no major prDblems - Lhe proiect proposal, modified in line
with Bank suggestions, was formally forwarded to the Bank in August 1991. Pre-
appraisal took place in September 1991 and the project was appraised in December
1991. During implementaion however, Felcra encountered budget cuts for some
components which resulted in implementation delays of these components. From the
start Felcra had anticipated budget cuts in operating expenses because of the Federal
Government's sclf-financing directive and also there were policy changes which did
not work in favour of Felcra.
Problems Encountered
18. As in any project there were sore implementation problems but these were not
significant as to cause undue delays.
(i) Procurement of tractors and fertilis. For every ICB tender, Bank required Felcra
to submit the tender documents for review and comments prior to tendering. The
tender for 80 units of tractors in 1996 had to be retendered because the successful
bidder could not fidfill his contract due to serious financial problem. As for fertiizers,
there were problems in complying with Bank's procurement procedures which caused
delay resulting in lack of time in catching up with the manuring season. Consequently,
tenders had to be called loeally using local procedures and thus could aot be submitted
for reimbursemenL
(ii) New land developmenL This component was hampered by the lack of availability
of agricultural lands for rehabilitalion due to competition for such lands for
conversion to industrial or commercial purposes. Additionally, Felcra's stringest
procedures in screening and processing new areas for rehabilitation hindered progress
- only areas which were economically viable were allowed to be .developed. As a
result a number of projects which were socially motivated had to be rejected because
they were not economically viable. Also, the consolidation programme was hindered
by a governmnent directive favouring all state lands to be developed by the private
sector.
(iii) Budget Cuts. In some years Felcra like other government agencies, especially
agriculture based ones, experienced budget cuts at the start of the vear but these were
usually restored in rhe later part of that year. By then, however, it was too -late to
utilize the funds allocated and had to be brought forward to the next year. For
instance, in 1993 the vehicle and equipment allocation was significantly reduced and
as a result the purchase planned for that had to be postponed.
Loan Covenants
19.   Felcra complied with all loan covenants except for the appointment of
accounting consultants which was no longer essential given Felcra's appointment of
external auditors and progress achieved in financial management and accounting.
5



Appendix 2

(b) Borrower's Performance
20. Generally the performance of the Borrower.was, satisfactory. That the full loan
amount of USS88.46 million could be fully utilized for thc purpose for which it was
intended even though it took I I211 years longer than anticipated was an achievement in
itself.
21. Feicra operated under rather difficult financial constraint in some years and had to
compete with the other sectors of the economy not only for finds but for land as well
which became an increasingly scarce commodity during this pcriod. The private
sector was rapidly encroaching inco agricultural areas for conversion to commercial
and, industrial lands to feed the rapid pace of industnalization in the country.
Corporatisarion and privatization were the government's panacea- to an ever
expanding bureaucracy and increasing financial burden. Felcra like other government
agencies, was directed to work towards self-financing and it was eventuallv
corporatised in September, 1997. So it was under such a scenario that Felcra operated
during the Project Thus, despite the odds, rhe project objectives were achieved.
(c) Bank's Performance
22. Throughout the project, the Bank made a positive contribution to the physical,
institutional and technical development of the project. Overall Bank performance had
been satisfactory and comnendable. There was continuity in terms of staff assigned
to the project as practically all the Bank staff and consultants assigned to the Projecr
were familiar with Felcra's operations and had been on supervision missions of the
Second Felcra Project.
23.  Banrk mission members provided guidance in fonnulating and packaging the
project for financing and also provided technical advice during the implementation
stage. A lesson learned from the Second Felcra Project which was put into practice
was the increase in the fequency of field visits made by supervision mission members
to selected Felcra schemes, focusing in particular on rubber schemes to ensure the
smooth implementation of the RFT system. The Task Manager who is a rubber
specialist was insturnental in inEroducing the R.FT system to Felcra on a commercial
scale. Tcchnical assistance in the form of a rubber consultant from the Centre for
Intemational Rubber and Development (CIRAD) was provided and assisted Felcra in
establishing demonstation blocks for higher frequency tapping, in data collection,
recording and analysis as well as in training and developnient of agricultural and field
staff. The RFT system has brought tremendous benefits co Felcra's rubber sector - it
has considerably alleviated the problem of labour shortage, increased labour
productivity and hence tappers' wages, brought prevxously untapped arcas into
production, improved quality of tapping resultingy in lower bark coasumption and this
in turn increased the life span of rubber trees.
24.  Technical assistance was also provided in the area ot Thnance and accountin,.
Periodically, Bank's senior financial analyst was fielded on supervision missions to
review Felcra's financial and accounting system and he provided much useful

comments and advice on how  to improve the overall syswtm  to provide for
transparency in Felcra's accounting system. Bank's involvement had helped to instill
the importance of discipline in preparing the annual accounts in a timely manner.
resultinzg in Fetcra being able to submit its auditpd annUal accounts on time for the last
three years of the project period.
25. In the area of training, Felcra was able to upgrde the Training Unit to a Division
to reflect the importance of the training function in Felcra and Bank's technical inputs
had been to field a training consultant on a number of occasions to provide expert
advice on the training package and blueprint prepared by Felcra's Training Division.
Exposure to overseas training by Fe lcra officers brought about from Bank financing of
the training component has enriched Felcra grearly in terms of its humnan resource
developmenL
(d) Lessons Learned
26. The followiig lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the Third Felcra
Land Development Project:
(i) De'tailed project imnplementatiojn schedules and project monitoring and reporting
formats for all project components should be drawn up at appraisal to ensure
achievement of project objectives and targets.
(ii) Standard terms and conditions irL the tender specifications for the procurement of
goods, works and services should be agreed at the start of project commencement and
such documents used throughout the project period without fuirther amendments so as
to avoid urnnecessary delay in the caLUing of tender. Procurement schedules for major
items of purchases, in particular, those required to be tendered using international
competitive procedures (ICB), could be incorporated at appraisal to ensure
implementing agencies monitor theiir requirements without any slippage.
(iii) Much technical know-how and assistance could be passed on to implementing
agencies by the careful selection of well-qualified and experienced team members in
the supervision missions, including the Task Manager or Mission Chief, as had been
experienced under this project.
