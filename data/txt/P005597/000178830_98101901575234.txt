SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Societ6 Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) was established in
1959 with a share capital of D 2 million, 58% owned by the Tunisian Govern-
ment. Between 1959 and 1965, SNI invested most of its capital in the
equity of new and expanding enterprises and, having no other long-term
resources, could not meet new demands for equity and long-term loan capital.
During 1965 and 1966, it was therefore reorganized, with the assistance
of IFC and the Bank.
ii.       The reorganized SNI emerged with a share capital of D 1.5 million,
and with a majority private ownership. IFC invested D 300,000 in SNI shares
and both local and foreign financial institutions became shareholders. The
Government gave it various forms of financial assistance, and the Bank granted
SNI a loan of $5 million, SNI's only source of foreign exchange. As a result
of these measures, SNI's resources were more than doubled, from D 2.5 million
to more than D' 6 million.
iii.      Activities in 1966 and so far in 1967 have developed satisfactorily
and at a higher rate than IFC had expected. The emphasis shifted from equity
investments to long-term loans, of which SNI approved almost D 2 million in
the last seven months of 1966 and D 1.2 million in the first four months of
1967. Of the total D 3.2 million, D 2.5 million ($h.8 million equivalent)
was for foreign exchange requirements, and SNI will need new foreign exchange
resources soon. It requested, in December 1966, a new loan of $10 million
from the Bank.
iv.       Organizationally and administratively, SNI's progress has also
been satisfactory. Management is in good control; the organization, with
a reduced stalf, functions better than before; project appraisal has im-
proved.  However, further strengthening and improvement are necessary, new
appraisal staff needed and, in particular, a system of regular follow-up
of loans and investments must be installed.
v.        SNI's capital structure is sound.   Its net profit (tax exempt,
and including a Government subsidy) corresponded to 10.3% on the share
capital in 1966, and is expected to increase to 16% in 1968. Profits are
likely to drop to about 10% on share capital in 1969, when they will be
subject to taxes and the special subsidy will be discontinued, but should
rise again to about 12.5-13% in 1970. The assumptions are that the pro-
jected level of activity is attained, and that SNI sells at ie1at Dlmillion
of its unprofitable share portfolio for investment of the proceeds into
loans and profitable investments. If not, profitability will not reach
the levels here predicted, and SNI should consider measures to improve it,
including the increasing of its lending rate.



- ii -
vi.       In the three-year period 1967-1969, the annual level of private
investment is expected to be bet-ween-D 4.5-6 million in manufacturing in-
dustry, and between D 8-10 million in the tourist sector. For SNI, this
indicates new business at approximately the same rate as in the past year -
D 3 million per annum or a little more.
vii.      Tourism is proving to be a sector with great growth potential
in Tunisia, and the Government has decided to leave most of new investments
to the private sector. SNI will be a main source of long-term finance for
tourist projects, and its exposure in this sector will build up rapLdly.
Although little can be done to protect SNI against internal or external
factors which might adversely affect the conditions of the tourist trade,
SNI's management must do all it can to minimize the risks over which it
has some measure of control. Among such measures are careful project ap-
praisals, insistence on sufficient equity capital, qualified management,
and adequate security for projects financed. Spreading the risks geo-
graphically and over various categories of projects should also be en-
deavored.
viii.     In the two-and-a-half -years to the end of 1969, SNI would need
new resources of $13 million to cover loans and investments expected to
be approved, of which about $11 million for foreign exchange requirements
and $2 million for dinar use. It could, therefore, effectively use a new
Bank loan, as requested, of $10 million as well as an additional loam of
$3 million to be used partly for foreign exchange, partly for dinar re-
quirements. The assumption for this estimate is that SNI will have sold,
by the end of 1969, D 0.8 million of its old share portfolio, under guaran-
tee of the Government.
ix.       Thie terms and conditions of the proposed new Bank loan should
largely follow those of the first loan. Its proceeds should be for the
foreign exchange expenditures of specific projects, and its repayment
schedule should reflect SNI's repayment schedules for sub-loans finatnced
from the loan, normally not to extend beyond 15 years. Each portion of
the loan credited to the loan account would carry the interes-t rate then
applicable for similar Bank loans., If SNI proposes to finance equity
investments from the loan, all should, as now, have the Bank's prior
approval before crediting to the loan account. For loans, however, it
is suggested that only those higher than the equivalent of $100,000
would be subject to prior approval by the Bank. The present "free limit"
is $t50,000. As another new feature, the loan would carry the Bank's
normal commitment fee, i.e. on the entire undisbursed amount of the
loan starting 60 days after the signing of the loan agreement.   As for
the first Bank loan to SNI, the Government has agreed to assume the
foreign exchange risk related to SNI's repayment of the loan.



RE-APPRAISAL OF THE
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        In May 1966, IFC made an investment equivalent to about $570,000
in the shares of the reorganized Societ6 Nationale d'Investissement (SNI).
The IFC investment was coupled with a Bank loan of $5.0 million to SNI.
By December 1966, SNI had approved loans of about $3.2 million to be
financed from the Bank loan, and requested a new loan of $10 million.
II. FINANCING AND GROWTH OF INDUSTRY AND TOUTRISM
Investment Trends
2.        Reference is invited to the Bank's recent economic report on
Tunisia.!/ Tunisia has pursued in the past few years an aggressive in-
vestment policy. Total investment went up from 14% of GDP in 1960 tC)
28% in 1965-66.J Although domestic savings increased from 9% to 13%' of
GDP during the same period and foreign capital inflow averaged $100 mil-
lion a year, this was not enough to finance the heavy investment program
and part of the financing was met by a rise in the money supply. Since
GDP was stagnant during 1966 mainly as a result of a serious drought in
that year, the rise in the money supply resulted in some pressure on
prices.
3.        As a result of these pressures, and in accord with the recom-
mendations of the International Monetary Fund, the Government decided to
cut down the rate of investment to 20% of GDP or D 110 million in 1967.
Severe restrictions have been put into effect by the Central Bank in order
to limit the expansion of credit during 1967. The discount rate was raised
from 4% to 5% in September 1966; this was followed by an increase in the
interest rate on medium-term rediscountable loans from a range of 6.25%
to 7% to a ranige of 7.25% to 8%. The financing of investments by com-
mercial banks - mainly by way of med-Lum-term credits rediscountable at
the Central Bank - has been sharply reduced for 1967 to the level of repay-
ments received on the same type of credits. Investments in both manu-
facturing and tourism can be made only after they have been approved by
the "Commission d'Investissement".
"The Current Economic Pbsition and Prospects of Tunisia", Report
No. AF-56b, dated February 20, 1967.
GDP in 1966 amounted to D h40.4 million of which D 63.0 million
was accounted for my manufacturing and D 10.5 million by tourism.



-2-
4.        Despite the reduced overall investment figure, real output is
expected to increase by 6% annually (from a previous average level of
5.5% for the years 1960 through 1966) as a result of the greater produc-
tivity expected in new investments as well as the delayed entry into
production of several big projects started between 1964 and 1966. The
better productivity would be achieved through a reduction in non-productive
investments as well as the growing role given to private enterprise in the
manufacturing and tourism sectors.
Role of the Public and Private Sectors and SNI
5.        Since 1959-60, the major share of industrial financing has been
done by the Government either directly through equity participations or
indirectly through its banking and insurance subsidiaries lending or taking
equity positions in industrial companies.
6.        The GJovernment is now anxious to encourage private enterprise
in order to mobilize more fully the resources of the private sector and
to improve the productivity of new investments. The reorganization of
SNI into a privately-owned institution was a step in this direction.
The Government has expressed interest in selling to private investors
some of its investments in light manufacturing industries, such as tex-
tiles. A tax exemption of four years is granted to all new enterprises.
7.        With respect to tourism, the Government intends to leave most
new investments to the private sector. In addition, it has enacted a
series of financial measures designed to encourage private investment in
this field. Thus, hotel pfomoters may be reimbursed for their original
architectural studies, they may be given choice land at very low prices
and their interest charges may be subsidized by three percentage points,
but only if 45% of total financing is provided by equity.
8.        This policy of encouraging private entrepreneurs together with
the remarkable growth of tourism in recent years has yielded results and
there is a good number of entrepreneurs willing to invest in tourist
facilities. Foreign exchange receipts from this source have increased
at the rate of 60% per year from 1961 to 1966 and they totaled approxi-
mately D 15 million in 1966. Not all regions of Tunisia have developed
their tourist trade at the same rate, however, and hotel occupancy ratios
are much higher in the southern than in the northern part of the country.
9.        Until 1966 the main source of foreign exchange for investment
in manufacturing industry was suppliers' credits.  However, new suppliers'
credits have to be approved by the Central Bank which has decided to limit
these to $17 million in 1967 ($4 million for hotels and industry and the
rest for general infrastructure projects) as compared to $42 million for
1965 and $21 million for 1966. Another source has been an AID loan of
$5.0 million administered by the Societ6 Tunisienne de Banque (STB).



-3-
However, the AID loan has now been exhausted.  SNI thus emerges as the
main institutional channel of long-term foleign exchange credit for the
financing of new private investment in manufacturing and tourism. This
situation lends substance to the intentions of the Government in deciding
to reorganize SNI.
III. DESCRIPTION OF SNI
Reorganization
10.       SNI: was reorganized duringr 1965 and 1966 with the assistance of
IFC and the Bank. Prior to SNI's reorganization, its share capital of two
million dinars was held 58% by the Government and government agencies and
42% by over 80,000 small Tunisian investors. From its inception in 1959,
SNI devoted its resources to the provision of equity capital to new enter-
prises. Operating with this limited scope and with only its own equity
capital for resources, SNI could not effectively meet the demand for in-
vestment finance, and also was not profitable. Its difficulties were
compounded by a lack of continuity in its management.
11.       The reorganization of SNI involved a reduction of its share
capital to D 1.5 million, the sale by the Government and the Central
Bank of some of their shares to IFC and to private banks, both Tunisian
and foreign, the provision of a Government grant and a long-term, low-
cost subordinated loan to supplement the equity capital, and the Bank
loan. SNI's long-term resources were more than doubled, from about
D 2.5 million to more than D 6 million, and SNI emerged as a predomi-
nantly private institution. Annex 1 is a list of major shareholders as
of December 31 1966.
12.       SNI's Policy Statement adopted at the time of the reorganiza-
tion (Annex 2) reflects also a change in emphasis in SNI's activities.
From being a promoter and equity investor in new enterprises, both govern-
ment and private, SNI was to become a broadly-based development finance
company concerned with providing long-term loans as well as equity par-
ticipations in private industry and tourism. It would encourage the
creation of new enterprises in the private s"tor and would try to assist
in the formation of a capital market. However, only in very special
circumstances would SNI take on management responsibilities for companies
in which it has invested.



Resources
13.       SNI's total long-term resources as of December 31, 1966 can be
summarized as follows:
(D '000)
Share capital                       1,500
Reserves                              312
Government grant                       500
Government subordinated loan           615
Central Bank loan                      185
Caisse Nationale de S6curit6
Sociale (CNSS) loan                  470
IBID loan ($5 million)               2,625
TOTAL      6,207
Included in the amount of reserves above is an amount of D 140,000 of
stock dividends, the value of which is covered by a Government guarantee
(cf. para. 26). The Government grant is not to be repaid, and constitutes
part of SNI's equity. The terms ancd conditions of the three local long-
term loans are as follows:
Original     Balance     Interest    Total       Year
Lender        Amount    Outstanding      Rate      Term     Granted
Government        D615,000     D615,000       None    30 years     1966
(including
15 years
grace)
Central Bank      D185,000     D185,000        5%     15 years     1966
(including
3 years
grace)
Caisse Natioriale  D500,000    D470,000       4%     15 years     1964
de Securit6                                           (including
Sociale                                                2 years
grace)
The Government loan is subordinated to other debt and ranks pari passu
with the share capital in liquidation.



14.       IBRD Loan.  The Bank loan of $5 million (equivalent to about
D 2.6 million) was signed on May 16, 1966 and became effective in July
1966. Projects involving a sub-loan of more than $50,000 require the
prior approval of the Bank before the Loan Account may be credited.
If SNI proposes to finance an equity investment from the proceeds of
the Bank loan, the Bank's prior approval is required in all cases, ir-
respective of amount. As of June 20, 1967, the position of the loan was
as follows:
Projects approved by SNI
for loan                   approx. $4,900,000
Credited by Bank                      2,677,000
Submitted to Bank and
under review                        $ 48h,000
Total            $3,161,000
Remains to be submitted
for crediting                      $1,839,000
Disbursed                            $ 533,000
SNI expects that it will have submitted the entire $5 million to the Bank
for crediting by September 30, 1967.
Organization, Personnel and Procedures
15.       Board.  SNI has a Board of 11 directors representing the prin-
cipal groups of shareholders: One, the Government; one, the Central
Bank; four, private Tunisian business; two, Tunisian banks; two, foreign
banks; one, IFC. Annex 3 gives the names and affiliations of the B3oard
members as well as membership of the Executive Committee.
16.       Executive Committee.  Appointed by the Board from its members,
the Executive Committee consists of the President, the Administrateur
Delegue, the Central Bank representative, one representative of the
Tunisian banks and one representative of the other private shareho-Lders.
The Executive Committee has authority to approve commitments up to a
limit of D 50,000 and supervises the affairs of SNI between Board Meetings.
17.       Management.  Mr. Abdelaziz Mathari, President and Director
General since 1958 of the government-owned Societe Tunisienne de Banque
(STB), the largest commercial bank in Tunisia, was appointed Chairman of
the Board and chief executive officer of the SNI in August 1965; he
remains President of STB and divides his time between the two institu-
tions. He is highly respected in private as well as Government circles
and his experience is of great value to SNI.



18.       Besides the President, day-to-day management is the responsi-
bility of SNI's General Mainager (Administrateur Delegue), who is also
appointed by the Board. The present General Manager is M5r. Rachid
Ben Yedder, who joined SNI in the summer of 1965. Although at that time
he had no investment finance experience, he appears to be an able manager.
His relationis with the private business community are also good. F1r. Mar-
cello Luri, seconded to SNI as an adviser by the Banca Commerciale Italiana
for a two-year term, arrived in Tunisia in June 1966. He works well with
management and staff and has been valuable to SNI in helping to organize
the work, particularly in tne project appraisal department.
19.       SNIts management team provides strong, competent management.
Both Mr. Nathari and Mr. Ben Yedder expect to remain with SNI for some
years, thus providing a continuity of management. It also appears desirable
that SNI should have an experienced adviser beyond June 1968, when Mr. Luri's
term expires. If his term cannot be extended, SNI will start looking for
somebody else to replace him.
20.       Organization and Procedures. Annex 4 is an organization chart of
SNI. The institution is divided into three operational departments, the
Credit Department, responsible for the appraisal of projects, the Portfolio
Department, responsible for the supervision of SNI's equity investments,
and an Administration and Accounting Department.
21.       SNI has made a good start in staffing and organizing its Credit
Department. Project appraisals are usually of fair but varying quality.
With experience further improvements in the appraisals can no doubt be
expected. Mr. Majoul, the head of the Credit Department, was formerly
Assistant Manager of STB's Credit Department, and appears well qualified
for his position. He is assisted by six young economics and commerce
graduates, three of whom are Tunisians and three Europeans, and by one
senior engineer. The three young Europeans are in Tunisia for a two-year
assignment in substitution for their military service obligations.   In
view of the transient nature of the Europeans' assignments, more permanent
staff should be recruited. If at all possible, some of the new staff should
have experience in the appraisal of hotel projects in view of the heavy
investments which SNI expects in this sector. It would also be desirable to
have one more engineer to assist in the technical appraisal of projects.
22.       I'he supervision of loans and investments has not yet been put on
a regular basis. However, there has been some follow-up by the Portfolio
Department and through board memberships in those companies in which SNI
has a relatively large shareholding. Accounts from these companies are
received regularly, but no analysis of them or of operations is carried
out and there have not been any serious attempts to evaluate the quality
of the equity investments. The growing loan portfolio accentuates the
need for a regular system of follow-up and SNI's management intends to
take the necessary steps to install such a system.



23.       Summary.  Progress has been made during the past year in develop-
ing an experienced staff. Several unnecessary jobs have been abolished
and payroll was reduced to D 4o,500 in 1966 from D 61,000 in 1965. Quality
of staff at the departmental level is still somewhat uneven and efforts must
continue to train the present staff and to recruit qualified personnel.
IV. O.RATIONS
Prior to Reorganization
24.       Equity Investments.  Between 1959 and the end of 1965, SMI made
equity investments in approximately fifty companies, mostly new projects,
twelve of which it promoted itself. The yearly amount of equity invest-
ments was as follows:
1959/61               D   890,000
1962                      594,000
1963                      496,000
1964                       56,000
1965                      156,000
D 2,192,000
The reduction in the yearly volume of equity investments reflected SNI's
diminishing resources which, however, were replenished from some sales of
investments.  In 1963, SMI sold, at cost price, investments with a book value
of D 423,600, chiefly to the principal Tunisian Insurance Company (STAR) and
to the Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale (CNSS) and during 1965 two com-
panies issued share dividends totaling D 139,630.  SNI's equity portfolio
had a book va:Lue of D 1.86 million at the end of 1965.
25.       Loans and Guarantees.  In October 1964, SNI began some lendcing
activities and had loaned approximately D 0.5 million, medium-term, by
the end of 1965. Also, SNI found itself extending guarantees on behalf of
some of the newly created companies it had promoted and giving them short-
term loans or advances until more permanent financing could be found. A8
of December 3:l, 1965, short-term advances totaled approximately D 0.55 mil-
lion and guarantees outstanding amounted to D 0.66 million.
26.       Government Guarantee.  At the time of the reorganization, practi-
cally all resources had been invested and very little cash was available.
In order to facilitate the reorganization process, avoid a lengthy and
difficult evaluation of the portfolio and insure SNI's ability to recover
the resources already committed, the Government undertook to guarantee the
book value of SNI's shareholdings and the repayment of loans, and to assume
the liability for guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 1965.



- 8 -
27.       With respect to the equity portfolio, the guarantee enables SNI
to sell within five years, if it so wishes, part or all of its share port-
folio. If SNI cannot find purchasers willing to pay SNI's book cost or
better, the Government will have the choice to make up the loss or to take
over the shares in question at SNI's book cost. On the other hand, if SNI
sells shares at a profit during the guarantee period, the gain will accrue
to the Government, but the possible surplus of gains over losses wil:L only
be payable at the end of the guarantee period.
28.       Annex 5 lists the 44 companies in which shares are held, showing
their earnings record in 1965 and dividends paid out in 1966. Twenty
companies made a profit in 1965,   12 companies made losses or were in
liquidation, and 12 companies were still under construction or just starting
operations. The 20 profitable companies represented an SNI investment of
about D 1.1 million, and the net profit after tax of these conpanies
attributable to SNI's shareholdings were D 453,564, representing a return
of 40%. However, only 10 of the 20 companies paid dividends, D 38,0:37 in
all; a return of only 4.85% on SNI's investment in these 10 companies, and
no more than 2% on the whole share portfolio. This is a very unsatisfactory
return to SNI, and the return is entirely incommensurate with actual company
earnings.  SNI, being a major shareholder and represented on the Board of
many of the companies, should certainly press fo. higher pay-ots.   Dividend
payments should be ve-7y mich largei if they were to corr ensate SNI for the
foregone income that it would earn by selling the unprofitable shares
and lending the proceeds at 8%.
29.       So far, SNI has only sold or liquidated about D 90,000 of the
guaranteed shareholdings, without loss or need to invoke the guarantee.
From several points of view, more substantial share sales appear desirable.
Firstly, SNI needs new dinar resources (cf. para. 49); secondly, most of
the shares give no return whatsoever to SNI; and thirdly, some of the
shareholdings are likely to result in losses. Within the next 3-1/2 years,
therefore, SNI should dispose of overly vulnerable shareholdings, sell
its shares in companies now making losses and not likely to become profit-
able, and also consider selling the shares in profit-making companies which
are not likely to be willing to pay reasonable dividends.
30.       Because of the low return, most of SNI's shares offer little
attraction to private investors, and the absence of a developed capiltal
market adds to the difficulty in finding private purchasers willing to
pay SNI's book cost or better for the shares.   Many of the shares will
therefore have to be sold at a loss, or taken over by the Government.
During the negotiations concerning the proposed new Bank loan to SNI,, the
Government reaffirmed its willingness to redeem, if SNI so wishes, the
entire guaranteed share portfolio by end-1970. However, before offering
shares to the Government, SNI will explore all possibilities of selling
them into private hands.



Loan and Investment Activities in 1966; policies
31.       Apart from three small equity investments totaling D 70,700 in
companies to wghich SNI granted new long-term loans (an air charter com-
pany, a yeast factory and a furniture factory), SNI's activity during
1966 was concesntrated on long-term lending to industry and tourism.
Annex 6 contains a list of loans approved during 1966. In all, SNI ap-
proved 21 loans for a total of D 1,961,300. Of this total, D 1,764,800
(equivalent to $3.35 million) was for foreign exchange requirements.
These 21 loans represented a broad risk diversification over 14 different
industries, including tourism. Four hotel projects totaled D 547,000 and
the largest industrial loans were made to a wood particle board factory
and to a canned food project. Most loans have a term of between 6 and
11 years, incLuding up to two years of grace. The average size was
D 93,000 ($177,000).
32.       When negotiations were under way for the reorganization of SNI,
the prevailing interest rates for long-term loans were around 7% and it
was felt that these rates were too low to insure SNI's profitability.
The Government and the Central Bank, which have to approve lending rates,
agreed therefore that SNI would be free to charge, for its loans, the
rates of interest necessary to assure it a satisfactory profitability.
To start with, rates ranging between 7-8% were thought to be appropriate.
In actual fact, SNI has charged 8% on all loans. However, in the case of
medium-term credits rediscountable at the Central Bank, SNI would charge
2-1/2% above the discount rate, or 7-1/2% at present. These rates appear
to have gained general acceptance, helped no doubt by the general re-
strictions on credit and the rise in the discount rate.
33.       SNI usually obtains a first mortgage on buildings and equipment
as a security for its loans, but in some cases settles for chattel mort-
gages and personal guarantees only.  Total equity investments will be
limited to the equivalent of SNI's own equity, including the Government
grant. SNI will not invest in the equity of any single enterprise more
than 10% of the sum of its own equity plus the subordinated government
loans; at present, this means a maximum of about D 300,000 ($570,000).
Total commitment in any single enterprise whether as loans or equity is
limited to 15% of the same basis or D 450,000 at present.  SNI will not
engage in operations smaller than D 15,000. In actual practice, SNI has
kept well within these limitations, found in its policy statement (Annex 2).
It also has, in most cases, restricted its financing of any project to a
maximum of 50% of total project cost, and intends to continue this as a
general rule.
34.       In its agreement with the Bank, dated May 16, 1966, to guarantee
the Bank's loan to SNI, the Government undertook to protect SiTI against the
foreien exchaLnge risk connected with this loan.  The Government has a,reed
to assume this risk also for the proposed second Bank loan.



- 1.0 -
Deposit Business
35.       In 196h, SNI started to accept call and term deposits and
some large deposits from public enterprises and governmental institutions
were transferred from STB to SNI. The total volume of deposits reached
D 1.98 million by the end of 1965 and declined slightly to D 1.95 million
by the end of 1966. SNI pays between 1.25% and 1.75% on call deposits,
which represent about 90% of all deposits, and up to 3.5% on a few small-
term deposits. It employs these funds as well as some of its excess
cash balances at fluctuating interest rates in a 28-day money market
maintained by the Central Bank. At present, SNI receives interest on
these funds at a rate of 5-1/2%.  As of December 31, 1966, the total
amount on loan to the money market stood at D 2.32 million as compared
with short-term deposits of D 1.95 million. SNI does not actively seek
to increase its deposit business, and there are very few depositors,
mainly government agencies and a few client companies. Two sources
account for approximately 75% of the total amount. They are the
Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale and the Caisse des Prets aux
Communes. For the latter, SNI receives the funds at the beginning of
the fiscal year and acts as a disbursing agent for the Government in
its loans to small municipalities, so in this case the "deposit" is
really a managed fund rather than a regular deposit.
36.       SNI's deposit business is carried out in a restrained and
prudent manner and cannot be seen in any way to interfere with its
primary financing functions as a development finance company. There
is practically no element of competition with deposit banks, the
deposits are adequately matched by SNI's liquid assets, they are mostly
of a special character, and constitute an important source of income
for SNI.
V. OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Operating Results
37.       IV agreement with the Government, SNI's income until the end
of 1968 is tax exempt, provided SNI pays no more than 4% dividends to
its shareholders. For four years, 1965 through 1968, the Government also
pays SNI D 50,000 annually towards its administrative expenses.
38.       Summarized income statements for 1965 and 1966 are shown in
Annex 7.  In 1966, net operational income (excluding the Government
subsidy) increased almost three times, from D 38,900 in 1965 to D 105,100.
This corresponds to a before-tax return of 2.6% on the share capital in
1965, 7% in 1966.  Including the Government subsidy, the return in 1966
was 10.3% on the share capital. A major portion of the income in both
years stermmed from SNI's short-term place.ments in the money market (see
para. 35).  SNI received, in 1966, D 101,000 more in interest than it paid on
funds used in these operations. I)ividends received on equity investments
increased from D 28,800 in 1965 to D 38,000 in 1966, but were still
just over 2% average return on all of these investments in 1966.



39.       Administrative expenses decreased, both absolutely and rela.tively,
in 1966, but wiere still fairly high at about 1.6% of total assets.
40.       SNI's first dividend to its shareholders, 4%, was declared for
the year of 1965.  The amount, D 60,000, was to be paid partly from 1965
income, partly from retained earnings.  4% has been declared also for 1966.
Financial Position
41.       Sumnarized balance sheets as of December 31, 1965 and 1966, are
given in Annec 8. They can be conde:nsed as follows:
December 31,
1965     1966
(Dinars '000)
Short-term investments and
other current assets                    2,921    3,2991/
Medium and long-term loans                  483      6021l
Equity investments                        1,859    1,8371/
Fixed assets, establishment
costs (net)                              122       106
ASSETS                            5,385    5,844
Deposits and other current
l:iabilities                            2,168    2,172
Conventional borrowings                     500      745
Subordinated Government loan                500      615
Capital, reserves and un-
distributed earnings                    2,217    2,312
LIABILITIES AND EQUITY            5,385    5,A44
42.       SNI's liquid position is strong, with a current ratio of 1 .5:1
at the end of 1966. Practically all of the current assets are either
money market placements (at 5-1/2%) or short-term advances (at 6-8%).
1/ These include the following amounts guaranteed by the Government:
Short-term advances              D    5h7,000
Medium-term and long-term loans       433,000
Equity investments                  1,820,000



- 12 -
43.       in its loan agreement with the Bank, SNI has agreed to limit
borrowings with a term of more than one year to an amount three times
the total of its own equity and the subordinated Government loan. As of
December 31, 1966, this gave SNI a borrowing capacity of D 8.8 million
($16.7 million), of which only D 745,000 ($1.4 million equivalent) had
actually been drawn down. As only about D 300,000 of loans and inves-t-
ments outstanding at December 31, 1966 were not covered by the Government
guarantee, reserves and retained earnings, D 812,000, were adequate
and no special bad debt provisions appear to be needed.
VI. PROSFECTS
Outlook for Private Investment in Industry and Tourism
44.       Excluding the large investments in the El Fouladh steel mill,
completed in 1965, investment in manufacturing industry was stable around
D 13-14 million per year in 1965 and 1966. Because of the completion of
some large textile mills (public sector) in 1966 and of the general auster-
ity program (see para. 3), the Bank?s Economic Report predicts lower total
investments in industry in 1967 (D l) million) and in 1968 (D 8 million),
but expects them to increase to almost D 12 million in 1969 and to around
D 15 million in 1970. However, the t;emporary drop in investments will
probably be in the public rather than in the private sector; in the latter,
investments could be expected to grow from an estimated annual level of
D 4 million in 1966 to about D 6 million by 1969.
45.       Investments in hotels and other tourist facilities could be as
large as, or larger than, investments in industry and practically all these
investments are likely to be in the private sector. In 1966, an estimated
D 12 million was invested in the tourist sector. At the end of the year,
some 90 projects, for a hotel capacity of almost 16,000 beds, were re-
gistered with the Government's tourist promotion agencylJ to be set up and
completed in 1967, 1968 and 1969. At an estimated average cost per bed
of D 2,500, these projects would require D 40 million.  In comparison, the
Bank's Economic Report suggests that 13,000 new hotel beds should be added
by the end of .1969, to the estimated 17,000 beds at the end of 1966, at a
total cost of about D 32 million. This would mean an annual investment
level of around D 11 million. For the purpose of the following projections,
it has been assumed that investments in private hotels and other tourist

- 13 -
facilities will be D 8 million in 1967 and D 10 million in each year 1968
and 1969. Investment levels in private industry and tourism would, on
these assumptions, be as follows:
1967      1968      1969
Industry            4.5       5.0       6.o
Hotels              8.o      10.0      10.0
12.5      15.0      16.0
Forms of Finance Required
46.       In 'runisia, equity finances less than half of new investments
both in industry and hotels. New hotels have been set up with as little
as 30% equity capital, which appears much too low. In the following it
has been assumned that the debt/equity structure for new investments will
be 55:45 for industry, 60:40 for hotels. At least 50% of the cost of in-
vestments in industry, and about 25%, on average, of the cost of hotels,
are likely to be for equipment imported from abroad. Based on an annual
investment level of D 14 million, which is a little less than the estimated
average (D 14.5 million) for 1967-69, the following estimate of forms and
amounts of finance needed in one year can be made:
Dinars million            US$
Industry   Hotels   Total   Equivalent
Foreign ]3cchange loans    2.5        2.3     4.8       9.1
Dinar loans                0.3        3.1     3.4       6.5
Equity capital             2.2        3.6     5.8      11.0
5.0        9.0    14.0      26.6
Prospective Demands on SNI
47.       Foreign Exchange.  Beside suppliers' credits and possible direct
loans from abroad, SNI is the only supplier of foreign exchange loans in
Tunisia.  Assuming that suppliers' credits and direct foreign investmiepts
in industry and hotels will amount to between $4-5 million per annum ±l one
may estimate the potential foreign exchange loan demand on SNI at about
$4 million in 1967, and at about $4.5 million each year in 1968 and 1969.
For the three-year period 1967-1969, therefore, SNI should be able to
approve foreign exchange loans totaling about $13 million. At the end of
1966, SNI had available $1.8 million of the Bank loan over and above loans
for foreign exchange then approved by SNIo It needs, therefore, about
$11.2 million more in foreign exchange resources to cover its requirements
through 1969.
/ Cf. para. 59.



- 14 -
48.       Dinar Requirements. The restrictions on medium-term commercial
bank credit, mentioned in paragraph 3, have made it difficult for investors
to obtain the necessary dinar loans for their projects. The need for such
loans is particularly strong for hotels, and if SNI can muster the necessary
dinar resources, it will probably find the use for them mainly in hotel
projects. Assuming a total annual demand of 3.4 million for dinar loans,
SNITs share is estimated at D 0.8 mi:Llion a year, a total of D 2.4 million
for 1967-69. In addition, SNI shouldi find opportunities for equity invest-
ments of at least D 0.4 million in this period. Total dinar requirements
through 1969 thus appears to be of the order of D 2.8 million, or a little
less than D 1 million annually.
49.       SNI should be able to cover about D 0.8 million of these require-
ments by sales of shares from its portfolio (cf. para. 29), and anoth,er
D 1.1 million through recovery of loans and advances and other interrJal
cash generation. However, there would still be a shortfall of about
D 0.9 million ($1.8 million equivalent).
50.       Projects Under Study.  In iaggregate, new loans and investments
are expected to be approved at a rate of a little more than D 3.0 million
a year, of which two-thirds, roughly, for foreign exchange requirements.
This overall estimate finds some support in the number of projects already
approved and expected to be approved in 1967. Since January 1, 1967, SNI's
Board has already approved loans for a total of D 1.2 million (Annex 6).
There are approximately ten other projects under active study requiring
approximately D 1.2 million of loans and there is a further thirty in-
dustrial and haotel projects under preliminary investigation which would
require approximately D 4.0 million in loan financing. A few of these
projects are likely to be approved in 1967, others in 1968 and 1969. An
analysis of the projects already approved and those under active study
shows requirements amounting to approximately 1/3 for dinars and 2/3 for
foreign exchange, which is in line with the estimates deduced from the
overall investment outlook.
51.       Suggested Coverage.  SNI's need for new resources to cover loans
and investments expected to be approved through 1969 thus appears to be
of the order of $13 million, of which $11.2 million to cover foreign ex-
change requirements and $1.8 million equivalent for dinar uses. SNI could
therefore use a new Bank loan of $10 million to cover most of its foreign
exchange requirements, as well as an additional loan of $3 million to be
used partly for foreign exchange, partly for dinar requirements. Such a
loan is now under discussion between SNI and the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA).
Exposure in Tourist Projects
52.       If the projected volume of business in tourist projects is carried
out, hotel loans and investments will constitute approximately half of all
loans and investments approved by the end of 1969.  This is a high exposure



- 15 -
in a single sector and there is some question as to whether SNI should
shoulder such -a high risk. One has to consider, in this connection, that
tourism is the main growth sector in the Tunisian economy at present, that
the Government has decided to leave most of new hotel investments to the
private sector, and that SNI - set up to cater for tourism as well as for
industry - has become the main private financing institution for hotels in
Tunisia. Should SNI not be able to meet the demands for hotel financing,
its volume of business will be greatly reduced and other financing mecha-
nisms will have to be created to fill the gap. There are strong reasons,
therefore, for SNI to engage heavily in hotel financing.
53.       The risks involved in the tourist sector can be classified into
the follmoing categories:
a) Risks of a macro-economic nature related to general
economic conditions outside of Tunisia, particularly
in Europe, to growth of tourism in general, and to
possible changes in the appreciation of Tunisia's
attractions from the tourist's point of view.
b) Risks related to the fact that a flourishing tourist
trade is dependent on a continuing stable political
as well as economic internal situation.
c) Risks of a local geographical nature such as over-
concentration in certain areas of the country.
d) Risks associated with faulty project selection,
weak management, or caused by lack of experience
in hotel financing.
54.       SNI's Board, on April 3, 1967, decided to set the limit, for the
time being, at one-third of all loans and investments outstanding. It is
wise to set such a limit. When it has been reached, or when it is clear
that it will be reached soon, the justification of a heavier exposure
should be reconsidered in the light of the experience gained. It is im-
perative, if SNI decides to go deeply into this sector, that it uses all
possible means to soften the risks. It cannot, obviously, prevent external
or internal economic-political dislocations which might affect the Tunisian
tourist industry. iWhat it can do, is to be particularly careful in its
appraisal of hotel projects, insist on a reasonable portion of equity
capital in projects financed, insist on qualified, professional manage-
ment in all projects, obtain the best possible security for its loans, and
seek a good spread of projects, geographically as well as by category of
hotels or other facilities.



- 16 -
Financial Forecasts
55.      Projected operations, income statements, balance sheets and cash
flow statements for 1967, through 1970, are found in Annexes 7 to 10. Net
operational income is expected to increase from the D 105,000 level in 1966
to around D 317,000 in 1970; the latter would be about 21% of the share
capital and 11% of projected equity. However, 1968 will be the last year
in which SNI will receive the D 50,000 Government subsidy, and also the
last year of tax exemption on income. As a result, total net income is
projected to drop rather sharply, from about D 2h3,000 in 1968 to D 15L,000
in 1969, while it would rise again to D 191,000 in 1970. This corresponds
to a return on the share capital of 10.1% in 1969, 12.7% in 1970, which, if
achieved, is a satisfactory prospect. The forecasts are based on the
assumption that there would be a 2% interest spread between the cost and
the relending rate for new loan funds used in operations by SNI, and that
SNI sells D 1 million (by the end of 1970) of its unprofitable equity port-
folio for investment of the proceeds into loans and new, profitable invest-
ments. Obviously, if such re-investments do not take place, or only to a
smaller extent, and if SNI is not able to transact the volume of business
projected, profits will not reach the levels here predicted. In that case,
SNI should consider various measures to improve its profitability, including
the increasing of its lending rate.
VII. CONCLIISIONS AMD RECOMMEMDATIONS
56.      The expectations attached to the reorganization of SNI appear to
have been justified. Its performance so far has been satisfactory, and
there is good reason to believe that SNI will make a major contribution
to the development of private manufacturing industry and tourism in
Tunisia. Management is well in control of operations and problems, and
projects approved for financing so far appear to speak of good judgment.
This is a good start. However, SNI's organization and procedures need to
be further developed: Staff need more training and experience, new staff
is needed, appraisal procedures must continue to be improved, a regular
system of follow-up will have to be established.
57.      The volume of operations in 1966 and so far in 1967 goes beyond
estimates a year ago and, despite the overall reduction in investments
envisaged in Tunisia, indications are that new medium-sized projects in
the private manufacturing and tourism sectors are forthcoming at a ccn-
tinuing high rate. In the three-year period 1967-69, the annual level of
private investment is expected to be between D 4.5-6 million in manu-
facturing induistry, and between D 8-10 million in the tourist sector.
Given the shortage of foreign exchange as well as dinar long-term fi-
nancing, it is probable that SNI will have to grant at least D 3 million
per annum in 'Loans and investments to make such investments possible.



- l7 -
58.       SNI has accepted some call and term deposits.   However, most of
these deposits are of a special character, and SNI does not seek deposits
from the general public. The deposits are adequately matched by short.-
term investments and contribute, for the time being, a very major portion
to SNI's income.  The deposit business is carried out in a restrained and
prudent marner and, although not a very usual activity for a development
finance company, cannot be seen in any way to interfere with SNI's pri-
mary financing functions.
59.       SNI's capital structure and liquidity are sound.   Its profit-
ability is expected to develop satisfactorily, despite a temporary set-
back when the present tax exemption and annual subsidy from the Government
come to an end in 1969, provided that SNI sells, under the guarantee agree-
ment with the Government, a substantial portion of its unprofitable share
portfolio for investment of the proceeds into better yielding loans or
investments. If such re-investments do not take place, or if SNI is not
able to transact the volume of business projected, profits will not reach
the predicted levels. In that case, SNI should consider measures to
improvre its profitability, including the increasing of its lending rate.
60.       If SNI can find the necessary dinar as well as foreign exchange
resources, loans and investments approved for hotels and other tourist
projects maLy, by the end of 1969, amount to approximately half of all
loans and investments approved.  This would be a high exposure for SNI ini
one single sector. However, one of SNI's main objectives is to assist in
the development of the tourist sector, one of the most promising in Tuni-
sia. While, therefore, SNI's management must keep in mind the risks
involved and must take measures to mitigate these risks, SNI should be
encouraged to meet the challenge of effectively assisting the tourist
sector.
61.       In addition to funds already available to SNI from both internal
and external sources, SNI will need about $11 million in new foreign ex-
change resources and about $2 million equivalent in resources utilizable
for dinar expenditures to cover expected new loans and equity investments
approved through 1969.  Consequently, SNI could effectively use a new
Bank loan, as requested, of $10 million, to cover a major portion of its
foreign exchange requirements, as well as an additional loan of about
$3 million, part of which could be used for dinar expenditures. The
assumption for this estimate is that SNI will have sold, by the end of
1969, D 0.83 million of its old share portfolio, under guarantee of the
Government.
62.       SNI is a suitable borrower for a new Bank loan.   The terms and
conditions of the proposed loan should in general followi those of the
Bank's first loan to SNI. The proceeds of the loan should be used for
the foreign exchange expenditures of specific projects. The amortization
schedule for the loan should be a composite of the repayment schedules which
SVI works out with its borrowers, normally not to extend beyond 15; years,



- 18 -
or as agreed between the Bank and SNI in case equity investments by SNI
are financed from the loan. Each portion of the proposed loan withdrawn
from the loan account should carry interest at a rate to be determined
and notified to SNI at the time suc'h portion of the loan is credited to
the loan account; this should be the rate then generally applicable to
new Bank loans to similar borrowers.
63.       In the case of the first 'loan to SNI, the Bank agreed that its
prior approval of projects for credit to the loan account was required
only when a 'loan of more than $50,000 was involved. In view of the prog-
ress SNI has made in its project appraisals in the past year, this limit
should be raised to $100,000 for the first as well as the proposed second
loan. Based on the past year's experience, such an increase would mean
that about one-third by number and about 80% by amount of all projects sub-
mitted to the Bank would need its approval before crediting, compared with
about two-thirds by number and about 90% by amount under the present
approval requirement. When SNI proposes to finance an equity investment
from the Bank loan, the Bank's prior approval should as now be required
in all cases, irrespective of amount.
6h.       While the Bank is charging its commitment fee on the first loan
to SNI only for the undisbursed amounts of portions credited to the loan
account, the proposed loan should, in accordance with the Bank's newi
practice for loans to development finance companies, carry the Bank's
normal commitment fee, i.e. computed on the entire undisbursed arnount of
the loan starting 60 days after the signing of the loan agreement.

Statement of General Policies and Operations
Adopted by the Board of Directors on July 4, 1966
(Translation)
I. Purpose of' this Statement
These provisions define the general policies and the guiding
principles governing the operations of the Societe Nationale d'Investisse-
ment.
It is evident that the Management may propose to the Board of
Directors of the SNI any necessary amendment which may be justified, in
the lighti of experience, in order that the SNI may perform its services
to the Tunisian economy with greater efficiency. In view of the importance
of the subject; matter to be discussed, the Board shall be given ample
time to study such proposals.
II. Purposes of the SNI
(1) The SNI, through the various forms of operation as
specified in III below, shall endeavor to stimulate the
industrialization of the country and the development
of tourism through productive, economic and financiaLLy
sound projects.
(2) The SNI shall also seek methods which may reactivate and
develop the capital market and, in particular, broaden
the securities market.
III. Investment Policy
(1) The SITI will assist the Tunisian economy by one of the
following methods, or a combination of several of them:
(a) medium- and long-term loans for the foreign
currency needs of a borrowing company;
(b) medium- and long-term loans for its local
currency needs;
(c) equity investments;
(d) underwriting syndicates for issue to the public
of shares of a borrowing company.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(2)  The SNI shall concentrate its assistance in the industrial
and tourism sectors.
(3) It will provide financial assistance solely to private
enterprises or enterprises with a majority of private
shareholders. The following may be considered as private
entlerprises or enterprises with a majority of private
shareholders:
(a) Companies where the capital is held solely by private
natural or juridical persons.
(b) Companies where more than half of the capital is held
by private natural or juridical persons, though the
remainder is held by the Government or public agencies,
or institutions where the Government is a majority
shareholder.
(4) The total amount of financial assistance which the SNI shall
grant to any single company, in the form of loans or equity
investments, shall not normally exceed 15% of the SNI's own
resources (share capital plus free reserves plus grant plus
Gorernment loan ranking pari passu with the share capital).
In exceptional cases, where the financial assistance of the
SNI exceeds such limit, the Board of Directors shall examine
the project particularly carefully after a detailed and
thorough study conducted by the Management.
The SNI shall not engage in operations, whether loan or equity
investment, requiring less than D 15,000 from it.
No equity investment in an industrial or tourist enterprise
shELll exceed 10% of the SNI's own resources as defined above.
The total amount of SNI's equity investments shall in no case
or at any time exceed the total of the capital, free reserves
and grant.
(5) The SNI's equity investments in industrial and tourist enter-
prises shall be as diversified as possible between the
indcustrial and tourist sectors and within a specific sector.
(a) With regard to industry, among various groups such as:
mining, chemicals, mechanical industry, textile industry,
food industry, etc.
(b) With regard to tourism:
both among various types of hotels (de luxe and
intermediate categories), vacation centers, etc.;
and between hotels located in the southern, central
and northern regions of the country.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(6) The SNI shall not, as a matter of principle, hold a majority
of shares in a company, except:
(a) where SNI acts as promoter of an enterprise and
expects to place shares among private subscribers
which will bring its holding down to a minority
position (below 50%);
(b) where the company under consideration is in a
difficult financial situation requiring the direct
intervention of the SNI in the best interests of SNI.
As a general rule, the SNI shall not allow itself to assume
the managerial responsibility of enterprises in which it shall
have an equity investment.
(7) A :Loan which the SNI is requested to grant to a company directed
by a member of SNI's Board of Directors, and in which this
director holds a large equity participation, shall be:
- on the one hand, granted only after due consideration and
approval by the Board of Directors as a whole;
- on the other hand, subject to a special report of the
auditors to the next Ordinary General Meeting, in
accordance with the provisions of the Code of Commerce.
(8) The SNI will support all initiatives for the development of
the capital and securities markets. In particular, it will
take the following measures:
- it will endeavor to ensure the maximum turnover of its
portfolio by giving preference to the resale of all or
part of the good securities held;
- it will subscribe to share issues, whether the companies
are borrowers or not from the SNI;
- it will take part in the promotion of "variable capital"'
Lnvestment companies (mutual funds) or any other type of
portfolio investment companies.
IV. Financial Policy
(1) The SNI shall ensure that the total of medium- and long-
term debts outstanding (i.e., maturing beyond one year)
does not exceed at any time three times the total of its
share capital plus free reserves, plus grant, plus
Government loan ranking pari passu with the share capital.
(2) For each foreign borrowing, the SNI shall protect itself
against any exchange risk arising from loans in foreign
currencies. It shall consider with the proper Tunisian
authorities the measures to be taken in this respect.



ANNEX 2
(3)  The SNI shall obtain fromn its lending, guarantee and other
operations a rate of interest and commission sufficiently
high for it to be reasonably profitable, build adequate
reserves and distribute a small dividend.
(h)  From the profits of each year of operations, the SNI shall,
in addition to the legal reserve, establish a provision for
contingencies and extraordinary reserves reasonably commensurated
with its commitments and the nature of the risks involved.
It shall also pay reasonable dividends in accordance with
its annual profits.
V. Organization
(1)  The SNI shall recruit a hLghly qualified personnel for
the financial and technical analysis of the projects to
be financed.
(2)  The SNI shall also set up an organization adequate to give
technical assistance to its clients and to enable them
