                     I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE

A. Countryand Sector Issues

1.       The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country situated between Romania and the
Ukraine, with the exception of a short frontage of about 500 meters on the river Danube in the
extreme South o f the country. Moldova is a gateway between the former Soviet Union countries
and the West, both trade-wise, language-wise and culturally. With the recent accession of
Romania to the European Union inearly 2007, Moldova has now become a border state between
the European Union (EU) and the countries further to the East. The Pan European Corridor IX
(Moscow-Kiev-Bucharest) crosses Moldova from East to West, going through the capital city of
Chisinau. The challenge of Moldova, similar to that of all low income CIS' countries, is to
secure better access to EU markets and thus to encourage exports and foreign direct investment
inflows into the country. At the same time, it must also seek to maintain access to its traditional
markets inthe CIS countries.

2.      Towards this end, the World Bank and Moldova have been collaborating successfully
over the past several years in the area of Trade and Transport Facilitation. In 2001 Moldova
entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) and joined the Stability Pact for South-Eastern
Europe. With its highly trade-dependent economy, membership in the WTO is a significant
achievement, which will help to attract foreign investments more easily. Moldova's economy
and exports will for some time remain based mostly on agriculture and agro-industry, both of
which are highly dependent on a well-functioning road transport industry and a solid road
infrastructure. As a new direct neighbor of the EU since January 2007, Moldova could benefit
from new trade opportunities, and its transport sector could gain importance inthe region.

3.      However, presently it appears that Moldova might not be able to seize its opportunities,
because of its deteriorating transport infrastructure, and its crumbling road network, inparticular.

4.      Moldova's road network totals about 16,800 km, of which 3,666 km are classified as
National Roads and the remainder as Local Roads. Considering the size of the country and its
population, the road network size is mostly adequate, with little or no need for expansion. If
Moldova's road network had been sufficiently maintained and were in good condition, its asset
value would be close to US$12 billion2.However, about 67 percent of National Roads and more
than 75 percent of Local Roads are classified as poor. This is the direct result o f severe and
prolonged neglect of the road network during the past 15 years, during which very little
resources have been spent for road maintenance and rehabilitation. About 400 km of formerly
paved roads have lost their pavement and have reverted to unpaved gravel or earth roads. The
present asset value of the Moldovan road network is only about US$8.4 billion, instead of the
US$12 billion it would be if the network had been well maintained. The loss of road network
asset value which resulted from insufficient maintenance and rehabilitation is a shocking US$3.6
billion, equivalent to 1.4 times the entire GDP of Moldova in2004.



' CIS -Commonwealtho f IndependentStates (former Soviet Unionmember states).
  An assessment of Moldova's Road Network Asset Value was done as part of the WB 2006 Public Expenditure
Review.

5.       Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the road network is still Moldova's single most
important physical infrastructure asset, and certainly much larger invalue than all power plants,
railway lines and the electricity grid combined. An urgent and important effort is neededto save
what is left and to gradually improve the road network, without which sustained economic and
social development will not be possible. The Economic Growth and Poverty ReductionStrategy
Paper (EGPRSP) objectives include the improvement of road infrastructure through the
implementation of a program to first stop the further degradation of the road network. It also
includes the creation of a sustainable and transparent system of road maintenance funding,
modernizing the technical assessment of roads, and negotiation with international donors, with a
view towards obtaining financing resources for road rehabilitation.

6.       Inrecognition of the above, the Government has decided to sharply increasespendingon
road maintenance and rehabilitation, using both domestic and external funding. The year 2006
saw the beginning of increased road expenditures which rose from the previous annual average
of about US$7 million to a total of about US$14 million. The budget for 2007 shows Lei 184
million (US$14 million) for road maintenance alone, and Lei 196 million (US$15 million) for
road rehabilitation, and additional amounts may become available. According to the agreements
with the donor community within the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) framework,
Moldova should spend on roads at least US$50 million in 2007, US$75 million in 2008 and
US$90 million in 2009. However, these spending targets can only materialize with support from
the international donor community, and the use of foreign contractors for works execution, given
the low capacity ofthe domestic road construction industry.

7.       The Government (with technical support from the World Bank and a Grant from the
Government of Spain) is presently preparing a comprehensive Transport Sector Program for the
period 2008-2017 with special focus on the road sector. It will include a Strategy for Road
Infrastructure Recovery and a prioritized 1O-year Road Sector Investment and Expenditure Plan
which will then be the sole basis for decision-making on road investments. The Strategy will
address the underlying causes and issues o f the road infrastructure crisis and propose legal,
institutional and physical measures to overcome this situation. The preparatory work for the
Road Sector Program should essentially be ready in late April 2007, and after a process of public
consultations the Government could then finalize, adopt and disseminate the Road Sector Program
before the end of 2007. Once adopted, it will constitute the framework for all actions, investments
and expenditures inthe Road Sector starting from 2008 onwards, including those to be financed by
external donors. Inthe meantime, investmentsinthe road sector for the year 2007 are based on the
Government's interim short-termprogram.

8.       The most urgent reforms in the road sector are (i) creation of a reliable and stable
                                                              the
financing mechanism for road maintenance, (ii)the reform of the way road maintenance is
executed, and (iii)the introduction of an axle load control system to curb the circulation of
overloadedtrucks on Moldova's roads.

B. Rationalefor World BankInvolvement

9.       Inearly 2006 the World Bank andthe Government reached an agreement inprinciplethat
the World Bank would support the Government's Road Sector Program through IDA funds. This
i s reflected in the CAS update of October 2006. Concrete discussions about a project started in



                                                2

June 2006, when it was agreed that the World Bank would also help the Government to prepare a
Transport Sector Program with special focus on the Road Sector. The preparation o f the Program
i s now ongoing, with support from a consulting firm financed from a Spanish consultant trust
fund.

10.      Subsequently, both EBRD and EIB indicated their willingness to participate in the
funding of a project. It is fair to say that the participation of EBRD and EIB became possible
mostly because o f the World Bank's involvement, for two reasons:

     0   Moldova's program with the IMF includes a clause under which all new external loan
         packages must have a certain percentage o f grants. Such a grant element is brought
         through IDA'Sparticipation in the combined IDA/EBRD/EIB package. Neither EBRD
         nor EIB could provide stand-alone loans.
     0   The World Bank's leadership (i)in helping the Government to prepare a Road Sector
         Program; (ii) inpreparing an overall project package for the road sector, to be financed
         by the three donors, which is coherent with the Road Sector Program; and (iii)the World
         Bank's technical expertise and readiness to support the various reforms in the road sector
         which are needed inthe coming years.

11.      The proposed Road Sector Program Support Project would be the first World Bank
supported operation in Moldova's transport sector. It would be the second externally financed
project in Moldova's Road Sector since the country's independence, after an earlier EBRD-
financed road rehabilitation project which was however cancelled prematurely in 1998, because
o f mismanagement.

12.      The World Bank's involvement and support to Moldova's Road Sector, and inparticular
the creation through the project o f a reliable and unified system for handling large road sector
investments, i s expected to help the Government in its efforts to secure additional external
financing for road investments. Such funding could potentially come after 2007 (i)from the EU
under its NewNeighborhood Program, and (ii)from the US Government through the Millennium
Challenge Account.

C. HigherLevel Objectivesto Which the ProjectContributes

13.      In2004 the Government ofMoldovaand its development partners adopted the Economic
Growth and Poverty Reductions Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) as the guiding document for
development in the country. It i s based on a three-pillar strategy, namely (i)sustainable
economic growth, (ii)  human development, and (iii)social protection and inclusion. The Strategy
addresses Moldova's key obstacles to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, and
aims at achieving three medium-term objectives linked to the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). One o f these is achieving sustainable economic growth o f at least 5 percent per
annum. The proposed Road Sector Program Support Project i s indirect support to the first pillar
o f the Strategy. The EGPRSP states that economic growth and poverty reduction will be driven
by reforms and investments in agriculture and infrastructure, and by improving governance. The
Transport Strategy within the EGPRSP clearly focuses on road rehabilitation as a key factor in
facilitating international trade and transport, and passenger services. The proposed project also
has a strong emphasis on improving governance - another focus o f the EGPRSP - through the


                                                 3

creation o f a reliable, transparent and unified system for managing road investments and road
maintenance.

 14.     The World Bank's Board o f Executive Directors discussed the FY05-08 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova on December 14, 2004. The CAS itself i s in direct
support to the objectives o f the EGPRSP. A CAS update and progress report was adopted by the
World Bank's Board in September 2006; it takes stock o f CAS implementation and introduces
some program adjustments for the remainder o f the period. One o f the adjustments i s a renewed
emphasis on transportation, by specifically adding to the World Bank's portfolio the new project
inthe roadsector to helpbuildthe institutions that finance andmanage roadrehabilitation, and to
finance the rehabilitation o f main roads.

                               11.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. LendingInstrument

 15.     The project will be financed through three separate financing agreements to be signed
between the Republic of Moldova on one side, and IDA, EBRD and EIB on the other. IDA will
provide an amount equivalent to US$16 million, in the form o f a Specific Investment Loan
(SIL). EBRD and EIB will each contribute  12.5 million. The total combined financing for the
project from the three donors will be US$48.7 million equivalent, at the present exchange rate
between  and US$.The Borrower is the Republic o f Moldova and the representative o f the
Borrower is the Ministry o f Finance. The implementingagency i s the State Road Administration,
which i s under the control o f the Ministry o f Transport and Road Industry (MTRI).

B. LinkageBetweenProgram and Project

 16.    The project is in direct support of the Government's overall Road Sector Program which
i s being preparedwith substantial technical support from the World Bank and grant fwnding from
the Governments of Spain and Japan. The IDA credit will finance a number o factivities included
in that Program, but more importantly, the project's implementation arrangementsare designed
to create a reliable, transparent and unified system for planning and managing large-scale road
sector investments. This, in turn, i s expected to open the doors for large-scale donor support to
Moldova's road sector. Such support has been pledged in principle during the Moldova Donors
Consultative Group Meeting in December 2006 in Brussels, but is clearly contingent on the
existence o f (i)a well-designed Road Sector Strategy, (ii)a prioritized road sector investment
and expenditure plan for the next ten years, and (iii)reliable, transparent and efficient system
                                                         a
for the absorption o f donor funds.

C. ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators

 17.    The development objective o fthe proposed project wouldbe to reduce road transport costs
for road users in Moldova, by improving the condition and quality of its road network and the
way it i s managed. This project objective would be achieved by:




                                                   4

    a. Road Network Recovery Component: Rehabilitation of about 400 lane-km o f main roads
        (equivalent to about 160 to 200 km of main roads) and thereby reducing road user costs
        inthe short term.
    b. Institutional Strengthening Component: Improving the capacity o f the State Road
        Administration to manage effectively the road network under its responsibility, and to
        carry out road maintenance, rehabilitation, and investment programs in an efficient and
        transparent manner. This should leadto a reduction o f road user costs inthe longer term.

The project will be executed over a four-year period, from mid-2007 to mid-2011.

18.     The implementationprogress and eventual success o f the program and the project will be
measured interms o f outcomes (results) and of outputs (physical achievements).

    0   The outcome o flower vehicleoperating costs for roaduserswill be measuredby calculating
        and comparing vehicle operating costs, before and after the project, using the HDM IV
        model. This will be done at two levels: (i) the project level, for the specific road sections
                                                      at
        improved under the project, and (ii)    at the program level, to see how road user costs in
        Moldova have developed in general as a result of Moldova's overall investments in roads
        over the project period. Inthe road user cost analysis, factors not related to road conditions,
        such as fuel price changes, will be kept constant.
    0   The SRA will also periodically update the Road Asset Value calculation, which was
        carried out in the context o f the Public Expenditure Review in 2006, and evaluate the
        results o f the Road Sector Program interms o f Road Asset Value increase.
    0   The capacity of the Government to manage road investments is an important outcome
        which will also be measures at two levels, At the project level, the satisfactory
        management and implementation of the roads to be financed under the project will be
        evaluated. At the Program level, the quality o f management and implementation o f
        Moldova's overall Road Sector Investment Program will be evaluated.
    0   The physical outputs o f the Project and the Program will be measured interms o f "number
        o f kmo f roads rehabilitated". The unit o f measurement will be lane-km o froad.

Details o f the monitoring criteria and indicators are presented inAnnex 3.

D. ProjectComponents

19.     The project will have two components. The first component will focus on physical road
rehabilitation. The second component will support the implementation of various institutional and
other measureswhich will also be included inthe Action Plano fthe Transport Sector Strategy.

Component 1: Road NetworkRecovery (US$44 millionequivalent, of which US$13 million to
befinanced from IDA credit)

20.     Component 1 will consist o f physical road works and o f consulting and other services
directly related to those works, such as feasibility studies (technical and economic), detailed
engineering design, preparation o f bidding documents and supervision of works. This component
will absorb about 90 percent of total project resources. The type o f works to be carried out through



                                                     5

the project can be characterized as localized repair, periodic maintenance and light rehabilitation.
Heavier rehabilitation could be involved on shorter sub-sections o f roads where the base course
needs to be improvedor replaced. It has been agreedthat the road sections to be rehabilitated under
the project will be along the main North-South road corridor, between Criva in the north, Balti,
Silngerei, Orhei, Chisinau, Hinqesti and Comrat in the South. The Chisinau - Hinqesti section of
that corridor i s at the same time a link between the capital city o f Chisinau and the border with
Romania to the west. The roads sections identifiedare Moldova's most important ones interms o f
traffic levels and economic impact. Works will mostly consist of the application o f a levelingcourse
and a wearing course of asphalt concrete, after localized repairs have been carried out on the base
course o f the roads. Other works to be included are the reestablishment of adequate drainage, and
the improvement o f horizontal and vertical signage. Specific road safety features are to be included
where appropriate and cost-effective, such as supply and installation of guardrails and traffic
calming measures invillages along the road. The total amount to be spent per km o f 2-lane road is
expected to be between inthe order o f two to three million Lei (about US$150,000 to US$220,000
per km) for works only, excluding design and supervision costs. The project could possibly include
some short road sections which are badly deteriorated and where rehabilitation costs per km could
be significantly higher. For that reason, and also because some road sections have four and six
lanes, the total length of roads to be covered under the project i s expected to be between 160 and
200 km.

Component 2: InstitutionalSupport (US$4.7 million equivalent, of which US$3 million to be
financed from IDA credit)

21.      This component aims at strengthening the Government's capacity to manage and maintain
the network ofNational roads. It will provide various types of support to the Government towards
the implementation of institutional, legal and other measures which will be included in the
Transport Sector Strategy Action Plan. The most important activities will be (i) creation o f a
                                                                                     the
reliable financing mechanism for road maintenance; (ii)a review o f the way road maintenance is
carried out inMoldova, (iii) strengthening o f SRA's capacity to efficiently manage and maintain
                              the
the roads under its responsibility and to manage investmentprograms for road rehabilitation; and
(iv) the implementation o f a system designed to curb the circulation o f overloaded trucks. Other
activities may be included, depending on the availability of resources under the project. The
component will most likely consist o f advisory services to be provided by specialized local and
foreign consultants (technical, institutional andlegal), training andthe purchase of some equipment.

Details o fplanned activities under both Components are presented inAnnex 4.

E. LessonsLearnedand Reflectedin the ProjectDesign

22.      An important lessonthe World Bank and its borrowers have learned over the years is that
true capacity-building i s difficult if projects are executed under "island" arrangements such as
Project Implementing Units (PIU's). While the creation and use o f PIU's does usually allow
projects to start up quickly and get implemented relatively easily, they rarely enhance the
capacity o f the Government's line agencies which would normally be incharge ifthe project was
financed from internal sources. After the projects are completed, the PIU's are dissolved and
their qualified staff look for another project they can work on. Inevitably, there is a series o f



                                                   6

follow-on projects, which leads to a situation where the real action is in the PIU's while the
Government's line ministry languishes with a staff of demoralized civil servants. The root of the
dilemma is often in the incapacity o f Government line ministries to attract and retain staff with
the qualifications needed to manage projects efficiently -- essentially the result o f very
inadequate civil service salary structures.

23.      The above lesson is incorporated inthe project design. While there is no claim of having
fully resolved the dilemma caused by low salaries in the public sector in Moldova, the project
implementation arrangements represent nevertheless a big step forward from traditional PIU
arrangements, and towards a unified system, invarious aspects:

       0   The Government's Road Sector Investment Program will be implemented uniformly
           and applying the same procedures for all roads, independentfrom the financing source
           o f individual road investments(internal or external).
           The responsible agency will be the State Road Administration, which has the status of
           a public enterprise and the legal right to recruit qualified staff on a contractual basis
           andpay salaries which are significantly higher than regular civil service pay. This right
           will be exercised.
       0   The same staffwill handle both internally and externally financed road contracts.
           Disbursement o f all funds (internal budget, and external loan and credit proceeds) will
           be handled through the Treasury. However,. loadcredit proceeds will not be mixed
           with regular budget resources (not budget support financing) and will be audited
           separately. This provides the needed reassurance for donors in terms o f fiduciary
           controls.

More details are provided inAnnexes 6 and 7

F. AlternativesConsideredand Reasonsfor Rejection

24.     Both for the Government and the World Bank, the temptation was large to implementthe
project through a traditional Project Implementation Unit (PIU). After long discussions, it was
however decided that a PIU would not be created and that the short-term problems and
difficulties and the possible delays inproject startup would be well worth it, given the important
medium-and long-term benefits and gains to the MTRIand SRA. These gains are expected to be
inthe areas of improved governance, transparency and efficiency, and they are expected to have
spin-off effects to other sectors. If this project's implementation arrangements can be made to
work, it will mean that most or all future development projects in Moldova will follow the same
path.

                                 111.      IMPLEMENTATION

A. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

25.     The project will be implemented under the general supervision and responsibility of the
Ministryof Transport andRoad Industry (MTRI). MTRIwill execute the project through the State
RoadAdministration (SRA) as the direct executing agency. This delegation to the SRA will be done
through an ImplementationAgreement.

26.     A Steering Committee (SC) has been established by the Prime Minister to ensure broad
Government oversight and guidance for the Government's entire Road Sector Program,
including those activities funded by donors such as this project. The Steering Committee o f four
members i s headed by the Deputy Prime Minister and includes the Ministers o f Transport,
Finance and Economy. The members of the Steering Committee are involved inthe design o f the
Government's overall Transport Sector Program; they have also met and discussed with donor
staff during project preparation missions. The Steering Committee will meet at least twice a year
to review implementation progress o f the Road Sector Program and take any high-level decisions
which may be needed.

27.     Direct responsibility for the day-to-day implementation o f the Project will be with the
SRA. The S R A has already appointed an experienced staff member as the head o f its Investment
Department which will handle the project activities. SRA's responsibilities will include
procurement, financial management, contract management, project/program monitoring and
evaluation, and reporting. To strengthen SRA's capacity to carry out those functions, up to five
local experienced specialists are being recruited through a competitive selection process. These
will work in the areas o f procurement, financial management, environment and contract
management. They would work with existing SRA staff to transfer skills, organize activities, and
generally increase the efficiency o f the agency.

B. PartnershipArrangements

28.     The project is part o f the Government's overall Road Sector Program. The project is
financed from three separate sources: (i)an IDA credit of US$16 million equivalent, (ii)an
EBRD loan of 12.5 million and (iii) EIB loan o f12.5 million3. The project is defined as all
                                        an
those activities within the Government's Road Sector Program which will be funded by these
three donors. Parallel financing will apply, such that each donor will be responsible for the
funding o f different activities and contracts, and each donor would sign a separate financing
agreement with the Government.

C. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomes/Results

29.     The project will introduce a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systemto monitor project
activities and the activities of the overall Road Sector Investment Program. The system will be
implementedby the SRA, with assistance and guidance provided by MTRI, and with technical


 The EBRD / EIB amounts of 12.5 million each are the first tranches of two larger loans totaling Euro 30 million
each.

assistance to be provided by a management consultant (to be funded by EIB). The M&E system
would monitor: (i)outputs o f the Project (such as lane-km o f roads rehabilitated, technical
assistance activities completed, results o f financial and technical audits, verification that
completed works comply with specifications, as well as other indicators to be agreed at
Negotiations; and (ii)outcomes o f the Project (such as lower vehicle operating costs for road
users, and increased capacity at the S R 4 for road maintenance and rehabilitation). Details o f the
M&E systemare presented inAnnex 3.

D. Sustainability

30.      Sustainability o f the project would be expected to come from four main areas supported
by the project: (i)creation of a reliable, transparent and unified system for planning and
managing road investments, which would continue after the completion o f the project; (ii)an
improved system o f road maintenance financing to help ensure that road investments do not
suffer premature deterioration; (iii)design and implementation o f an axle load control system
which should reduce truck overloading inMoldova; and (iv) reform o f the methods and practices
in which road maintenance is executed in Moldova, and thus improve quality and ensure
sustainability and cost-efficiency,

                                IV.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY

A. Economicand FinancialAnalyses

36.     A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted for the rehabilitationworks of all potential
road sections to be included in the project. Although the project will only rehabilitate about 160
to 200 km o f road sections, the CBA covers some 400 kilometers of national roads which were
initially considered to be candidate roads. The results of this CBA show positive Net Present
Values (NPV) at a discount rate o f 12 percent for all road sections under the North-South
corridor, with a total N P V for the entire corridor o f US$87.5 million in 2005 values. The
Highway Design and Management model (HDM-4) was used to carry out the analysis, which
simulates life cycle conditions and costs, and provides economic decision criteria for road
construction and maintenance activities. The same HDM-4 based analysis shows that the
proposed rehabilitation works will result in a decrease in Road User Costs (RUC) on the road
sections to be rehabilitated by at least 6 percent on the roads sections to be rehabilitated. Details
o f the economic analysis are presentedinAnnex 9.


B. Technical

37.     The type of road works to be carried out through the project can be characterized as
localized repair, periodic maintenance and light rehabilitation. It has been agreed that the road
sections to be rehabilitated under the project will be along the main North-South road corridor,
between Criva inthe north, Balti, SSingerei, Orhei, Chisinau, Hinqesti and Comrat in the South.

This includes the road section betweenChisinau and Hinqesti which is an important linkbetween
the Moldova's central region and the border to Romania (and therefore the EU) to the west.
Works will mostly consist o f the application o f a leveling course and a wearing course of asphalt
concrete, after localized repairs have been carried out on the road. Other works to be included are
the reestablishment o f adequate drainage and horizontal and vertical signage. Specific road safety
features are to be included where appropriate and cost-effective, such as supply and installation o f
guardrails and traffic calming measures invillages along the road. The total base amount to be spent
per km of 2-lane road is expected to be between two and three million Lei (about US$lSO.OOO to
US$220.000 per km) for works only, excluding design and supervision costs, and price escalation
contingencies. The project could possibly include some short road sections which require more
intensive rehabilitationworks and with costs per km significantly higher.For that reason, and also
because some road sections have four or six lanes, the total length o f roads to be covered under the
project i s expected to be around 160to 200 km, depending on the prices which will result from the
biddingprocessfor works.

C. Fiduciary

38.     The financial management arrangements envisaged for this project differ from those
typically made under World Bank financed projects. This i s because the project will not be
implemented by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) as i s common practice under donor-
financed projects in Moldova and most other countries. Instead, the project i s conceived to help
improve and strengthenMoldova's own system for the unified management and implementation
o f its Road Sector Investment Program, with basically the same concepts and procedures for
financial management and contract management to be applied for both internally and externally
financed road investments.The Financial Management System designed for this project will thus
be applied in an almost identical fashion for the other road sector investments outside the project
as such.

39.     Once implemented, the financial management plan described inthe Annexes to this P A D
will simultaneously satisfy the objective o f a unified system for financial management o f
Moldova's entire Road Sector Investment Program, and also the need to comply with the World
Bank's fiduciary requirements for this project.

40.     This project will be the first one inMoldovato pilot the use o f such a unified system, and
it is natural that this will entail certain risks. Project Component 1 will involve three relatively
large contracts o f about US$13.3 million each, and there i s a risk o f undue pressures and
corruption during procurement and contract execution. It i s remembered that some eight years
ago EBRD had to cancel prematurely the only donor-financed project in Moldova's road sector
after the country's independence, due to mismanagement during project implementation. To
address the risk o f mismanagement and corruption, a number o f measures have been designed
within the financial management system of this project; these are also part of the Anticorruption
Action Plan (ACAP).

Annexes 6,7 and 8 describe the fiduciary arrangements under the project.

D. Social

a. mat are the opportunities, constraints, impacts and risks arising out of the socio-cultural and
political context?

41.     A Social Assessment was undertakenas part o f the Sector Environmental Assessment
(SEA), to identify social issues relevant to project objectives and project execution. Because the
project focuses on road maintenance and rehabilitation, all o f the resulting works will be
implementedwithin the existing right-of-way of the road and there will be no need for any land
or asset acquisition. It was found that the project will have positive impacts on the living
standards o f Moldova's population through its direct effects on employment and economic
growth. The residents in the area o f influence o f the road subprojects will benefit from: (i)a
reduction in travel times and in transport costs, (ii)improvements in the quality o f road
passenger and cargo transport; and, (iii)   employment generation. It i s expected that the project
will create important employment opportunities, mostly in the road construction industry. Any
negative impact o f the proposed project on the local population would be minimal and is related
mostly to increased traffic and its effects on road safety.

b. How have key stakeholders (civil sociev, business, public sector, social, or other non-
governmental groups or individuals whose participation can positively or negatively affect
project outcomes) participated in project preparation, and how will they be involved in
implementation, monitoring and evaluation?

42.     Various interested parties such as national environmental authorities; representatives
from different state institutions, private sector, academia and environmental Non-Governmental
Organizations were consulted during project identification and preparation by the Ministry o f
Transport and Road Industry (MTRI) when carrying out the SEA. The main issues within these
consultations were to identify environmental and social concerns in the road sector; assess
opinions o f different stakeholders with regard to the proposed project; to confirm roles and
responsibilities in the EIA process and discuss possible mitigation measures. Issues relating to
the need to generate local employment opportunities and to improve road safety emerged as
priorities during these consultations. The SEA report was made public for review by interested
parties. Subsequently, a public presentation o f the SEA was carried out so as to inform
stakeholders and obtain their suggestions, which were then taken into account in the project
design. The public presentation o f the document was supported by the Ministry o f Ecology and
Natural Resources (MENR) and MTRI. At the implementation stage, the main stakeholders also
will be involved in project monitoring and evaluation. On an annual basis the MTRI and the
State Road Administration (SRA) will make publicly available the results o f the project,
including the implementation o f the social and environmental safeguards. Furthermore, the SRA
will conduct social surveys and participatory workshops, involving main stakeholders and
general public to identify their perception and concerns on the project results.

c. How will the main social impacts of theproject be monitored?

43.     The project includes a monitoring and evaluation plan based on a combination o f the
following: (i)surveys and data compiled by the S R A to report on selected monitoring indicators
agreed upon under the project's logical framework; (ii)field data collection; and (iii)


                                                  13

participatory workshops. Social development outcomes will be monitored using as indicators (i)
the number of local jobs created; and (ii) decrease in vehicle operating and transportation
                                             the
costs. Monitoringwill be ensured by the SRA.

E. Environment

a. Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation
(including consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging
from this analysis.

44.     As the project will consist of several relatively similar road improvement sub-projects
along Moldova's main North-South road axis for which the exact location had not been
identified with precision until project appraisal, it was decided to apply a phased approach to the
EA. At the first stage a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) was carried out, consisting of:
(i)an analysis of EA institutional capacities and preparing general recommendations for
improving EIA process in the road sector; (ii)an environmental assessment and management
framework (EAMF), which establishes the safeguard procedures to be applied for selected
specific road subprojects, guidelines on how to deal with potential environmental issues, and a
template for the preparation o f Environment Management Plans (EMPs) for road subprojects
once identified. At the second stage, after the road sub projects are identified, the EA will
include: (i)screening o f proposed subprojects and identifyingthose that need partial or full EIA
study; and (ii)carrying out specific environmental impact assessmentsfor selected roads.

45.     The development of the SEA and the preparation o f EAMF and of Environmental
Guidelines was coordinated with the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR). The
draft SEA has been presented to the broad public via Internet. Additionally, the local consultant
who helped prepare the SEA has organized a public briefing and consultation on the SEA'Smain
results and recommendations. These recommendations are included in the final version of the
SEA report.

46.     The SEA shows that no major environmental impacts of the project are expected. The
proposed road works will consist o f the rehabilitation and maintenance o f already existing road
sections and there will be no new road construction and/or widening undertaken. The possible
addition o f a short climbing lane at steep road sections would not require any land acquisition.
Most potential environmental impacts will be temporary, during the construction phase, and will
cause only minor and localized negative effects. Most o f them will be limited to the effects
associated with rehabilitation works, such as dust and noise, smell due to the use o f bitumen,
disposal o f solid materials removed from the roads during construction, erosion control, and
labor camp management. These impacts are common in road rehabilitation works and can be
mitigated with existing management techniques. After completion, the project will have positive
indirect impacts on human health and safety through decreased number o f accidents, reduced air
pollution resulting from more constant rates o f travel speeds on rehabilitated road sections,
cleaning up o f solid waste from roadside drains, and reduced water pollution resulting from
rehabilitated drainage systems. Inorder to minimize potential off-site impacts, the SEA proposes
that materials (e.g. asphalt, stone, etc.) would be supplied only from sources with approved
licenses, permits, and/or approvals for environment and worker safety. Furthermore, any



                                                 14

equipment used during construction would meet internationally recognized standards for
environment and worker health and safety.

b. Whatare the mainfeatures of the EMP and are they adequate?

47.     The SEA includes an EMP that identifies measures to mitigate any potential impacts, and
also provides monitoring plans, budgets, responsibilities, and schedules o f execution. The EMP
consists o f the following: (i)proposals for developing the sector and institutional policy and
regulatory framework for the EIA, strengthening the EIA capacity inall institutions involved; (ii)
Environmental Assessment Management Framework (EAMF) which covers procedures for
environmental screening o f subprojects and criteria for categorization, as well as the criteria on
which to decide if a full EIA i s needed for selected subprojects or only an EMP; (iii)
environmental guidelines describing potential environmental and social impacts with suggested
mitigation measures, based on international practices; (iv) monitoring plan, including
specifications for supervision, as well as basic environmental performance indicators, timeframe,
and responsibilities for proposed monitoring activities; and (v) implementing and budgeting
arrangements for all proposed measures.

48.     The World Bank reviewedthe terms o f reference for the SEA jointly with the Borrower
during pre-appraisal. The main SEA features are sufficient and cover all key aspects o f
environmental management o f the road subprojects. The S R A i s using the services of an
environmental specialist who i s responsible for implementing the provisions o f the SEA and
prepare the specific EMP's for selected road subprojects. Project funds would also be used to pay
for training on environmental management aspects o f road investments to staff o f the MENR,
MTRI and their rayon offices. Duringproject implementation, the provisions o f the EMP's will
be applied to all road rehabilitation activities within the Government's Road Sector Program.
Furthermore, it i s proposed that mitigation measures specified in the EMP's will be incorporated
as requirements in all bidding document for works to ensure that the contractors undertake the
measures specified inthe EMP's for selected road subprojects.

c. What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on
the environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?

49.     A detailed monitoring plan designed to confirm the effectiveness o f the mitigating
measures i s included in the EMP. It contains detailed environmental compliance-monitoring
requirements, including parameters and indicators for the recommended mitigation measures.
The implementation o f the monitoring program will be the responsibility of the State Road
Administration, in collaborationwith the State Ecological Inspectorate and its local offices. Their
TOR'S require them to report on compliance with the provisions o f the EMP through the regular
progressreports that they are requiredto submit to the MTRI and the World Bank.

a. What is the safeguard screening category of theproject? (SI, S2, S3, SF)

50.     The safeguard screening category for this project i s SF. Based on the analyses completed
and the scope of the projected road improvements, the project will not trigger any of the social
safeguards policies. There are no "indigenous" people in the area. N o cultural assets will be
negatively affected. N o involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will occur.

b. What is the environmental screening category of theproject? (A, B, C,FI)

5 1.    In accordance with World Bank Safeguard Policies (OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment) the project is rated environmental category B and a Sector Environment Analysis
has beenprepared by the Borrower (see Annex 10).

c. What is the borrower's capacity to implement the safeguard policy recommendations, and if
the capacity is insufficient, how will this capacity be brought to the required level?

52.     With over eighteen years o f experience the SEE has sufficient technical capacity to
reviewenvironmental impact assessments.At the same time, withinthe MTRIandthe SRA there
are no special units or designated staff responsible for environmental and social safeguards inthe
road sector. A full-time environmental specialist will therefore be appointed within the S R A to
assist with the implementation o f the SEA and EMPs. The specialist will provide training on the
environmental management aspects o f the project to MTRI, MENR, and their rayon offices and
will also be responsible for the proposed monitoring activities. The project will provide TA for
strengtheningMTRI and MENR capacities with regardto safeguards issues.

d. What types of consultations have been conducted related to safeguard issues? How did these
consultations influence project design?

53.     All major stakeholders were consulted during the SEA study. These included
representatives from national state institutions, environmental authorities, academia, private
sector and NGOs. The stakeholders agreed with the main SEA approaches and recommendations
and affirmed their commitment to the project and its environmental objectives.

MTRI, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Geography and Ecology, and
from various environmental NGOs. A summary of the SEA was translated into Romanian and
was widely distributed among all interested parties, as well as posted on the web site of the
MTRI. A complete SEA (inEnglish and Romanian) will be kept at MTRI in Chisinau for review
by interested parties.

e. Whenwere the safeguard studies made available at the Infoshop?

55.    The SEA was sent to the InfoShop on February28,2007.

J: When and where were safeguard studies made available in the cooperating country?

56.    The draft SEA was publicly disclosed in Moldova on the website of the Regional
Environmental Center - REC (http://www.rec.md) which i s the environmental website of the
Government of Moldova, on January 26, 2007. The final version of the SEA was publishedon
the same website on February 28,2007

                 MOLDOVA: ROAD SECTOR PROGRAMSUPPORT PROJECT


Country Background

The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country situated between Romania and the Ukraine, with the
exception of a short frontage (500 to 800m) on the river Danube. Moldova is a gateway between the
former Soviet Union countries andthe West, bothtrade-wise, language-wiseand culturally.

Moldova's strong growth performance since 2000 has reversed a decade of economic decline and rising
poverty.Inthe last six years the economy has grown by nearly 40 percent leadingto a massive movement
out of income poverty. Continuedstrong economic growth will be crucial to Moldova's efforts to reduce
poverty, recuperate income per capita lost during the transition years in the 1990's and remain on a
convergent path with countries of Central and Eastern Europe. While the abundant inflow of workers
remittances that have ledto the currentconsumption driven growthwill likely continue, it is unreasonable
to expect that these inflows will continue to grow at the same rapid rate. Similarly, it will become
increasingly difficult to sustain the past growth in labor productivity since the opportunities provided by
labor shedding and factor reallocation in the economy are gradually being exhausted. Thus, while
remittances have helped fuel the current expansion, only continued increases in productivity can be the
driver of sustained long-termgrowth.

In order to put growth and poverty reduction on a sounder footing, a stronger and more robust domestic
supply response will be required. This will necessitate further improvements in the domestic investment
climate in order to increase the incentivesfor heretoforelow domestic private investmentand innovation.
Higher private investment, however, will needto be supported by an increase in the currently low level of
public investment.Over the past 15 years, public investment, particularly in critical road infrastructure,
has been almost nonexistent with the result that road infrastructure has seriously deteriorated with
negative implicationsfor growth and internationalcompetitiveness.

The deteriorated road network causes important losses to Moldova's road users, in the form of increased
vehicle operating costs. This relative increase is estimated at around US$250 million per year (or
approximately 8 percent of GDP). Confrontedwith highertransportationcosts, Moldovanproducers must
either (i) pay lower wages to its workers, (ii)accept lower profits, or (iii)increase productivity.Countries
with higher transport costs, such as Moldova, are however less likely to attract much needed Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI). Since FDI is often a key channel of international knowledge and technology
diffusion, these higher costs may lead an economy to be further removed from the world technology
frontier and impede its rate of productivity growth.

Economic analysis suggests that the principal trading partners of Moldova should be the EU countries.
Instead, Moldovan trade has continued to be dominated by exchange with other CIS countries. High
transportation cost is one of the reasons why this reallocation of trade patterns has been slower in
Moldovathan neighboringcountries.

With the recent accession of Romania to the European Union in early 2007, Moldova is now a border
state betweenthe European Union (EU) and the countries further to the East. The Pan European Corridor
IX (Moscow-Kiev-Bucharest)crosses Moldova from East to West, going through the capital city of
Chisinau. The challenge of Moldova, similar to that of all low income CIS4countries, is to secure better

 CIS -Commonwealthof IndependentStates (former Soviet Unionmember states).


                                                     18

access to EU markets and thus to encourage foreign direct investment inflows into the country. At the
same time, it must also seek to maintainits access to its traditionalmarkets inthe CIS countries.

Towards this end, the World Bank and Moldova have been collaborating successfully over the past
several years in the area of Trade and Transport Facilitation. In 2001 Moldova entered the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and joined the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. With its highly trade-
dependent economy, membership in the WTO is a significant achievement, which will help to attract
foreign investments more easily. Moldova's economy and exports will for some time remain based
mostly on agriculture and agro-industry, both of which are highly dependent on a well-functioning road
transport industry and a solid road infrastructure.As a new direct neighborof the EU since January 2007,
Moldova could benefit from new trade opportunities,and its transportsector could gain importance in the
region. However, presently it appears that Moldova might not be able to seize its opportunities, because
of its deterioratingtransport infrastructure,and its crumblingroadnetwork, in particular.

Road Network

Moldova's roadnetwork totals about 16,800 km, of which 3,666 km are classified as National Roads and
the remainder as Local Roads. Consideringthe size of the country and its population, the road network
size is mostly adequate, with little or no need for expansion.Roadengineering standards of existing roads
are also mostly adequate in terms of road width and drainage, but most roads have a relatively low load
bearingcapacity. The road network density of 31.5 km of roads per 100 km is similar or slightly above
that of other countries in the region:

                                Country               Road Density

IfMoldova's road network had been sufficiently maintainedand were in good condition, its asset value
would be close to US$12billion. However, Moldova's road network is not in good condition, with about
67 percent of national roads classified as poor. For local roads the situation is worse, with at least 75
percent estimatedto be in poor condition. This is the direct result of severe and prolongedneglect of the
road network during the past 15 years, during which very little resources have been spent for road
maintenance and rehabilitation.About 400 km of formerly paved roads have lost their pavement and have
reverted to unpaved gravel or earth roads. The present asset value of the Moldovanroad network is only
about US$8.4 billion, instead of the US$12billion it would be if the network had been well maintained.
The loss of road network asset value which resulted from insufficient maintenance and rehabilitationis a
shockingUS$3.6 billion, equivalentto 1.4times the entire GDP of Moldova in 2004.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the road network is still Moldova's single most important
infrastructure asset, and certainly much larger in value than all power plants, railway lines and the
electricity grid combined. An urgent and important effort is needed to save what is left and to improve
gradually the road network, without which sustained economic and social development will not be
possible. The Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) objectives for 2004-

2006 include the implementation of a program to stop the degradation of the road network. It also
includes the creation of a sustainable and transparent system of road maintenance funding, the
modernization of the technical assessment of roads, and negotiations with international donors, with a
view towards obtainingfinancingresourcesfor roadrehabilitation.

Administrative setup in the road sector

The Ministry of Transport and Road Industry (MTRI) is in charge of the general planningand oversight
of Moldova's roads; it has a very small Roads Departmentwithin its organizationalstructure. The MTRI
controls the State Road Administration (SRA), a corporativeroad agency responsiblefor executingroad
maintenance, road investments and road safety. The SRA only has limited autonomy since it is directly
controlledby MTRI.

The SRA controls 40 local district road maintenance firms located throughout the country. These were
formerly fully state-owned, but have now beencorporatizedasjoint-stock companies. Between 10 and 30
percent of their shares were transferred to their staff, and the State holds all of the remaining shares.
Although they have been corporatized, these firms have a very limited independence, since their
management is appointed by the SRA. Every year the SRA allocates an average of US$175.000to each
firm through a maintenance contract, which the firms use for routine maintenance tasks. In their present
form these firms are not viable as commercial entities; they operate without making any profit and are
unable to replace their old and mostly obsolete equipment. It is unclear how they can survive for much
longer. Occasionally, some road construction equipment is bought from the State budget and is
transferred to the district road maintenance firms without any payment. The district road maintenance
firms do however play a very important role, because they assure routine maintenance and winter
maintenanceat least at a basic level and at a low cost, andthus ensureat least aminimum service level for
road users. A gradual reform of the system over the coming years is necessary and will be addressed
throughthe Road Sector Strategy.

The State Road Administration also controls fivejoint-stock road constructionfirms with various degrees
of private participation.None of these firms has much physical capacity and not all of them are active.
SRA also controls one road engineering firm which is 100 percent state-owned. The Road Maintenance
Fund is simply an account in the Ministry of Finance and thus not controlled by the State Road
Administration.

Government Action -Road Sector Program

In recognition of the bad condition of the road network, the Government decided in 2005 to sharply
increase spending on roadmaintenance and rehabilitation, usingboth domestic and external funding. The
year 2006 saw the beginning of increased expenditures which rose from the previous annual average of
about US$7 million (only routine maintenance) to about US$14 million for both maintenance and some
rehabilitation.The 2007 budget includes US$14million for road maintenance alone, plus another US$15
million for roadrehabilitation.Accordingto the agreements with the donor community within the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) framework, Moldova's road sector spending should reach at least
US$50 million in 2007, US$75 million in 2008 and US$90 million in 2009. However, these spending
targets can only materializewith supportfrom the internationaldonor community.

The Government (with support from the World Bank and a grant from the Government of Spain) is
presently preparing a Transport Sector Program 2008-2017, which will include a Transport Sector
Strategy and a prioritized 10-year Transport Investmentand ExpenditurePlan. The Strategy's main focus
i s on roads; it will address the underlyingcauses and issues of the road infrastructure crisis and propose
legal, institutional and physical measures to overcome this situation. The preparatorywork for the Road


                                                    20

Sector Program should be essentially ready by end of April 2007. After public consultations with
stakeholders, the Government could then formally adopt and disseminate its Road Sector Program later
during2007. It will constitute the frameworkfor all actions, investments and expenditures inthe Road Sector
startingfrom 2008 onwards, includingthoseto be financedby external donors. Investmentsinthe road sector
for the year 2007 are to be basedonthe Government's interimshort-termprogram.

In early 2006 the World Bank and the Government reached an agreement in principle that the World
Bank will support the Government's Transport Sector Program(in particular, the Road Sector Program)
through IDA funds. This is reflected in the CAS update of October 2006. Concrete discussions about a
project started in June 2006. Subsequently, both EBRD and EIB indicatedtheir willingness to participate
in the funding of a project,The proposed Road Sector ProgramSupport Projectwould be the first World
Bank-supported operation in Moldova's transport sector. It would be the second externally financed
project in Moldova's RoadSector, after an earlier EBRD-financedroadrehabilitationprojectwhich ended
prematurelyin 1998, about half-way through its implementation,after serious irregularitiesresultingfrom
high-level political interferencewith contractmanagement.Very significant additionalexternal financing
for the Government's Road Sector Program is likely to come after 2007 (i)from the EU under its New
NeighborhoodProgram, and (ii)from the U.S.Government throughthe Millennium ChallengeAccount.

Road Maintenance Funding

Moldova's road network as it exists today was built mostly between the 1930's and 1990, with the most
intensive period of network improvement and expansion between 1965 and 1985. During that period,
financing of road infrastructureexpenditures was based essentially on two separate sources. These were
(i) domestic revenues raised through the Road Funding Law of 1958, and (ii)transfers of important
resources from the budget of the Soviet Union, in the form of specific subsidies to Moldova for the
constructionof "strategic roads". Transfers ofthose latter subsidies essentiallyended inthe late 1980's.

The RoadFundingLaw of 1958remained inplace until 1993 and established a broad-basedtax to finance
the development and maintenanceof the country's road network. The tax rate was set at (i)a general rate
of 1.5 percent of the revenues of all legal productive entities; (ii)a reduced rate of 0.5 percent on the
turnover of all trading enterprises; and (iii)various different percentage levels on the revenues of
transport enterprises, depending on the type of vehicles used. Overall, available resources for roads
exceededthe absorptioncapacityofthe roadconstructionsector in most years. However, the early 1990's
were marked by a dramatic overall reduction of economic activity in Moldova, as a result of the
disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ensuing collapse and shutdown of a large number of state
enterprises made the long-standing system of road financing through taxation of general economic
activity non-viable. In 1993, Parliament adopted a new funding mechanism for roads based mainly on
vehicle ownership.Funding levels remained, however, very insufficient, and in 1994 the idea of creating
a Road Maintenance Fundemerged.

The year 1995 saw the adoptionby Parliamentofthe RoadLaw Nr.509-XI11of June 22, 1995 which is in
force until today. It established a variety of funding sources for the road sector. However, all these
revenues became non-earmarked general budget revenues which were not linked in any way to roads or
road maintenance, and this new Law again failed to solve the funding problem for roads, which had
clearly become an acute crisis. Another attempt was made in 1996 through Law Nr. 720-XI11 which
established the Road Fund and which is still valid today. The purpose of the Law was to channel to the
road sector those funds collected as the result of the Road Law of 1995. Also, the fuel excise tax was
more than doubled, to 270 Lei (US$64) per ton of gasoline and 96 Lei (US$23) per ton of diesel fuel.
Regrettably,the RoadFundwas set up as a special account held at the Ministry of Finance, and this made
the Road Fund again a budgetary instrument which falls short of the basic criteria of both first- and
second-generation Road Maintenance Funds. It clearly does not, and never did, fulfill its objective,


                                                    21

because its principal source of revenue, the fuel excise tax, has regularly been allocatedto the general
budget, and only a minor share (15 percent in 2005) to the Road Fund. This completely undermines the
original objective of the Road Fund law of creating a stable and reliable funding source, independent of
short-termpolitical decisions.

The shortcomings of the existing RoadFundare thus numerous and serious:

    0    legislationallows that its single largest revenue source is divertedto the general budget;
    0    it does not have any autonomy and instead is managed by the Ministry of Finance as a sub-
         account of the general budget;
    0    it allows no participationof road users in decision-makingon the use ofthe funds;
    0    it mostly finances annual across-the board allocations to State-controlled district road
         maintenance enterprises;
    0    there is no competitivebiddingfor works funded by the RoadFund;
    0    there is no clear accountabilityfor outputs and quality controlof works funded by the RoadFund;
         and
    0    there are no independent financial and technical audits of the Road Fund and of the activities
         executed with its funding.

A revised draft law to reform the Road Fund was prepared and sent to parliament in 2001, but never
adopted. A reform of the road maintenance financing mechanism is thus clearly necessary to address the
continuedserious deteriorationof Moldova's roadnetwork.

Axle Load Control System

Most of Moldova's roadswere designedfor axle loads of about six to eight tons. Today's legal axle load limit
in Moldovais however ten tons for National Roads and six to eight tons for other roads, and it is certainthat
many trucks circulatewith axle loads significantly higher than that. (The EUaxle load limits is 11.5 tons.) At
the same time, the lack of investmentand maintenanceofMoldova's roads over the past 15 years has ledto a
weakening of existing road structures, and thus to a high vulnerability of roads to structural damage due to
overloading of trucks. This should normally be countered through a system of axle load controls and the
impositionof substantial fines for overloading. However, the only public vehicle weight stations in Moldova
are at the borders, andthey are usedexclusivelyto determine transit fees for trucks, but not to protectthe road
network.This issue will certainly have to be dealt with in the context of the Transport Sector Strategy. The
introductionof an axle load control system (possibly through some mobile brigades to carry out axle load
controls throughoutthe roadnetwork)hasto be combinedwith the introductionofa legal framework to cover
this activity and the imposition of sanctions for overloading. These measures should be put in place in
consultation with major road users such as truckers associations, and factories which are sources of heavy
cargo(cement and steel factories, etc.).

World Bank-financed Projects

The only World Bank (IDA) financed project related to the transport sector was the Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project, for which an IDA credit was approved on June 10, 2003 for SDR5.3
million (US$7.21 million equivalent).The overall implementationperformance rating is satisfactory.The
project will close on September30,2007.

Others

The only donor-financedproject in Moldova's road sector after independence was the EBRD-financed
Road Rehabilitation Project approved in 1996. Its execution was cancelled in 1996, half-way through
projectexecution, becauseof high-levelinterferencewith contract management.

                  MOLDOVA: ROAD SECTOR PROGRAMSUPPORT PROJECT


The project will have two components. The first component will consist of physical road works and of
consulting and other services directly related to those works, such as feasibility studies (technical and
economic), detailed engineering design, preparation of bidding documents and supervision of works. This
component will absorb about 90% of the project resources. The second component will support the
implementation of various institutionaland other measures which will be includedinthe Action Plan of the
Transport Sector Strategy. Detailsofthe two componentsare describedbelow.

Component 1: Road Network Recovery (US$44 million equivalent, of which US$13 million to be
financed from IDA credit)

Descriptionof Component 1

The physical works to be financed and executed under the project shall focus as much as possible on those
roads whose basic structure is still essentially intact, and which can be rehabilitated at a relatively low cost
per km. The type of works to be carried out through the project can be characterized as localized repair,
periodic maintenanceand light rehabilitation.This type of interventions will extend the useful lifespan of a
part of Moldova's main North-Southroad corridor, and of a part of the corridor linking Chisinau with the
Romanianborder, by approximately 10 years. The component will constitute one of the three sub-programs
of the Government's overall road expenditures, the other two being routine road maintenance and heavy
rehabilitation and reconstruction of badly deterioratedroads.

Early duringproject preparation it was agreedthat the road sections to be rehabilitatedunder the project will
be (i) along the main North-South road corridor, between Criva in the north, Balti, Singerei, Orhei,
Chisinau, Hinqesti and Comrat in the South, and (ii)on the European corridorEuropeanroads linking
Chisinauwith the border to Romania to the west.. These two road corridorsare Moldova's most important
ones in terms of traffic levels and economic importance. Works will mostly consist of the application of a
levelingcourse and a wearing course of asphalt concrete, after localizedrepairs have been carried out on the
road, Other works to be includedare the reestablishment of adequate drainage and horizontal and vertical
signage. Specific road safety features are to be includedwhere appropriate and cost-effective, such as supply
and installationof guardrails and traffic calmingmeasuresinvillages along the road. The total amount to be
spent per km of 2-lane road is expected to be between two and three million Lei (about US$150,000 to
US$220,000 per km) for works only, excluding design and supervision costs. The project could possibly
include some short road sections which are badly deterioratedand where rehabilitationcosts per kmcouldbe
significantly higher. For that reason, and also because some road sections have four o six lanes, the total
lengthof roadsto be covered under the project is expectedto be between 160to 200 km.

An international consulting firm has been recruited for the feasibility study, engineering design, and
preparation of bidding documents for the road works to be included in the project. The services will be
carried out in two phases. The objective of the 1st phase is to undertake a pre-feasibilitystudy for some 500
km of road sections within the selected road corridors, with the purpose to optimize the choice of the exact
road sections to be covered under the project. Upon approval by MTRVSRA and WBEBRDEIB, the 2nd
phase of the study will include the detailed designs of those road sections and the preparation of bidding
documents.The Consultant shall also lay out environmentalmitigationplans in accordancewith World Bank
safeguardpolicies.

Component 2: InstitutionalSupport (UW4.7 million,of which US$3 millionto be financed from IDA
credit)

This component aims at strengthening the Government's capacity to manage and maintain the network of
National Roads. It will provide various types of support to the Government towards the implementation of
institutional, legal and other measures included in the Transport Sector Strategy Action Plan. The most
important activities will be (i)the creation of a reliable financing mechanism for road maintenance; (ii) a
review of the way road maintenanceis carried out in Moldova; (iii)the strengthening of SRA's capacity to
efficiently manage and maintainthe roads under its responsibility and to manage investment programs for
road rehabilitation; and (iv) the implementation of a system designedto curb the circulation of overloaded
trucks. Other activities which are part of the Transport Sector Strategy may be included depending on the
availability of project resources.The component will most likely consist of advisory services to be provided
by specialized local and foreign consultants (technical, institutionaland legal), training and the purchase of
some equipment. Details ofplannedactivitiesare presentedbelow.

Moldova's existing Road Maintenance Fund is essentially a budgetary instrument and does not ensure an
adequate financing level for road maintenance. The project will support either the transformation of the
existing Road Fund into a second-generation Road Maintenance Fund, or the introduction of another
adequate mechanism for road maintenance financing, based on the solution adopted under the Road Sector
Strategypresently underpreparation.

Giventhe extremely low spending levelfor roads inMoldovaover the past 15 years, the SRA now does not
have a proven capacity to absorb funds efficiently.The strong projected increase of financing in Moldova's
road sector, bothfor road maintenanceand for road investments(mostly rehabilitation)makes it necessaryto
strengthen SRA 's capacity in the areas of project and program management, procurement, financial
management,environment, etc. The project will support avariety of measurestowards that end, all gearedto
create a solid and unifiedsystem able to absorb both internaland external funds. An initial assessment of the
SRA will be carried out to: (i)evaluate SRA's capacity; (ii)perform a general needs assessment; and (iii)
develop a trainingplanand make any other recommendationsbasedonthe outcomes ofthe assessment.

A good part of Moldova's road network was designed for axle loads of about six to eight tons. Today's legal
axle load limit in Moldovais however ten tons for pavedroads and six to eight tons for other roads, and it is
certainthat many trucks circulate with axle loads significantlyhigher thanthat. This is particularly evident on
roads leading to and from cement factories, quarries, mines, steel plants, etc. The lack of investment and
maintenance of Moldova's roads over the past 15 years has led to a weakening of existing road structures,
and thus to a high vulnerability of roads to structural damage due to overloading of trucks. This should
normally be countered through a system of axle load controls and the imposition of sanctions for
overloading, etc. However, the only publicvehicle weight stations inMoldovaare at the borders, andthey are
used exclusivelyto determine transit fees for trucks, but not to protect the road network.This issue will be
dealt with prominently in the context of the Road Sector Strategy. The project will support the
implementation of an axle loadcontrol system, includingthe introductionof an adequate legalframework to
cover this activity, a road user awareness campaign and the imposition of sanctions for overloading. In
addition, in order to avoid that the axle load control system becomes a source of corruption, specific anti-
corruption measures shall be designed and implemented. All of these measures should be put in place in
consultation with major road users, such as truckers associations and operators of factories which are sources
of heavy cargo (cement and steel factories, etc.).

                  MOLDOVA: ROAD SECTOR PROGRAMSUPPORT PROJECT


PartnershipArrangements

The project is part of the Government's overall Road Sector Program. The project is financed from three
separate sources: (i)an IDA credit of US$16 million equivalent, (ii)an EBRD loan of 12.5 million and
(iii) an EIB loan of 12.5 million5.The project is defined as all those activities within the Government's
Road Sector Program which will be funded by these three donors, as described in Annex 4. Parallel
financing will apply, such that each donor will be responsible for the funding of different activities and
contracts, and each donor would sign a separatefinancial agreementwith the Government.

It has been agreedthat each of the three donors would finance a single, relatively large works contract (in
the order of US$12-14 million each) which would consume by far the largest part of their respective
financial contribution. EIB is mandated to finance only such roads which are part of European corridors
or Europeanroad links. The World Bank and the EBRDwill concentrate on the north-southroad corridor
(precise sections also to be determined based on the feasibility and design study). Concurrently with the
project, the Government will finance the rehabilitation of various smaller road sections, as part of the
overall Road Sector Program.

ImplementationStructure

The project will be implemented underthe generalsupervision andresponsibilityofthe Ministry of Transport
and Road Industry(MTRI). MTFUwill execute the project through the State Road Administration (SRA) as
the direct executingagency.

A Steering Committee (SC) has been established by the Prime Minister to ensure broad Government
oversight and guidance for the Government's entire Road Sector Program, including those activities
funded by donors such as this project. The Steering Committee of four members is headed by the First
Deputy Prime Minister and includesthe Ministers of Transport, Finance and Economy.The members of
the SteeringCommitteeare involvedinthe design ofthe Government's overallTransport Sector Program;
they have also met and discussed with donor staff during all project preparationmissions.The Steering
Committee will meet at least twice a year to review implementation progress and take high-level
decisions on Program and Project orientationand any restructuring, if needed. The SC will however not
be involved in procurement decisions or any other day-to-day project management issues.

Direct responsibility for implementation of the Project will rest with the SRA. Its responsibilitieswould
include procurement, financial management, contract management, project and program monitoringand
evaluation, and reporting. To strengthen SRA's capacity to carry out those functions, up to five local
specialists are being recruited through a competitive selection process. These will be in the areas of
procurement, financial management, environment and contract management. They will work with
existing SRA staff to transfer skills, organize activities, and generally increase the efficiency of the
agency. Staff salary levels at the SRA are significantly higher than civil service pay and it seems likely
that SRA will be able to hire and retain sufficiently qualified staffto manage a growing road investment
and maintenanceportfolio.

                                                    30

In addition, an international Management Consultant will be recruited to provide general technical
assistance and support to the Government's overall Road Sector Program, for a period of three years.
Among his responsibilities will be to assist with the overall implementation of the Project and the
Program, ensuring compliance with procurement rules and procedures, contributing to knowledge
transfer, ensuring harmonization between donor- and Government funded activities, and generally
providing technical and strategic advice to the Ministry of Transport and Road Industry. Grant funding
would be sought to finance the internationalconsultant; if not available it would be funded from the EIB
loan.

A Bid Evaluation Committee has been established to carry out the selection of contractors, consultants
and suppliers in conformitywith agreed procurement rules and procedures. The Committee is dominated
by technical specialists from the Road Sector (MTRI and SRA), but also includes representatives from
other Ministries / Organizations, such as the Ministry of Finance and the National Procurement
Organization.

Responsibilitiesof the SRA

Procurement. The SRA will be responsible for carrying out all procurement activities in a manner
consistent with agreed procurement guidelines. These will be the World Bank's procurement guidelines
for works, goods and consultant services, with a few minor modifications neededto ensure compatibility
with the EBRD's and EIB's procurement guidelines.Responsibilitiesof the procurement team within the
SRA would be to carry out all steps in the tendering process, such as the preparation of terms of
references, request for proposals, short-listing, negotiating contracts, maintaining an adequate filing
system, updatingthe procurementplan, etc. Details are providedinAnnex 8.

Financial Management. The SRA will be responsible for maintaining comprehensive files, records,
financial statements, etc, of all donor-funded and Government funded activities as stipulated in the
various financing agreements. The SRA will also be responsible for ensuring the accurate flow of funds
as described further below. The SRA would ensure that all agreed internal controls in processing of
contractorbills are followed before submission of payment requests to the Treasury (through the Minister
of Transport and Road Industry).Training will be providedto staff as needed. The SRA will be required
to implement an administration-wideaccountingsystem, which will also be used for project accounting.
Detailsare providedin Annex 7.

Operations Manual. Zhe completionof an Operations Manual(OM), satisfactoryto the three Donors, will
be a Condition of Effectivenessof the Project. The OM would guide the project and serve as a roadmap
for implementation. It shall include comprehensive sections on all areas required for implementation,
such as detailed procedures for carrying out (i)procurement, including a procurement plan; (ii)an
implementationplan; (iii)financial management; (iv) monitoring and evaluation; and (v) flow o f funds,
and any other procedures, guidelines or criteria necessary for implementation. A short-term consultant
will be recruitedto assist SRA with the preparationofthe OM.

Contract Management. S R 4 will be responsible for managing all contracts financed under the Project.
MTRIwill be involvedin the technical managementof those consultant contracts which are not relatedto
works design and supervision, such as support to sector reform measures under Component 2 of the
project.

Monitoring and Evaluation, and Reporting. The Government will be required to monitor Project
indicators agreed between the Donors and the Government at the time of Negotiations(Annex 3). The
monitoring will be the responsibility of the SRA, and results will be included in the quarterly progress



                                                  31

reports to be submitted to the Government and the Donors. It was agreed that a unified report shall be
prepared, with annexesas neededto satisfythe requirementsofthe Government and Donors.

Auditing. It was agreedthat annual financial audits will be carried out not only for the projectaccounts (as
required by the financing agreements with the Donors) but also for the SRA as an entity. Audits will be
done by an independent internationalaccountingfirm acceptable to the Donors. Additionally, to ensure
compliance of road works with the technical specifications and standards described in the bidding
documents, a Technical Audit will be carried out annually (or as required) by an independent firm or
expert. The TechnicalAudit will includethe drilling of roadcore samples, andtheir laboratorytesting and
analysis. It will cover all roads included in the Government's Road Sector Program, independent of their
financing source.

contracts will probably all be made directly by EBRD to the contractor/consultant.EIB will not make
direct paymentsand all paymentswill go throughtheir Special Account heldby the Treasury.

Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

The projectwill introduceamonitoringand evaluation(M&E) system to monitor projectactivitiesas well
as activities of the Road Sector Investment Program. The system will be implementedby the SRA, with
assistance and guidance provided by MTRI and through technical assistance to be provided by a
management consultant (funded by EIB). The M&E system will monitor: (i) outputs of the Project (such
as lane-km of roads rehabilitated, technical assistance activities completed, results of financial and
technical audits, verification that completed works comply with specifications,as well as other indicators
shown in Annex 3; and (ii) outcomes of the Project(such as lower vehicle operating costs for road users,
and increased capacity at the SRA for road maintenanceand rehabilitation).

Sustainability

Sustainability of the project is expected to come from four main areas supported by the project: (i)
creation of a reliable, transparent and unified system for planningand managing road investments, which
would continue after the completion of the project; (ii)an improved system of road maintenance
financing to help ensure that road investments can last without premature deterioration; (iii)design and
implementation of an axle load control system which should reduce truck overloading in Moldova; and
(iv) reform of the methods and practices in which road maintenance is executed in Moldova, and thus
improveon quality and save cost.

Anti-CorruptionActionPlan

In general, the risk of corruption is widely acknowledged as an issue in the public sector in Moldova.
However, given the low levelof investmentsand expenditures in the road sector duringthe past 15 years,
the opportunities for corruption in the road sector have also been small. Correspondingly,the expected
large increase in road spending potentially opens up opportunities, and this risk must be countered by
specific anticorruption measures to be implemented under the project. The Anticorruption Action Plan
(ACAP) prepared during project preparation will cover the entire road sector. The risk mitigation
    ..
measures includedin the ACAP would includethe following:

        Ex-ante Controls by the Treasury. Expenditureswill be incurred by SRA but payments will be
        effectedby the Treasury which will performex-ante checks beforemakingpayments.
        Independent Verijkation of the Quantity and Quality of Works by an International Supervision
        Consultant. All contractor's bills will be reviewed by internationalsupervisionconsultants who
        will verify and certify quantity and quality of works executed.
        Independent Oversight by an International Management Consultant. As part of the EIB
    .   requirements, an independent internationalprogram management consultant will work full-time
        in SRA and hisTerms of Referencewill includewhistle-blowingifneeded.
    ..  Prior Review of Procurement. A relatively low threshold will be set for the World Bank's prior
        review of procurement decisions by the Borrower.
        Annual Financial Audit. The financial audit will cover both project accounts and the SRA as an
        entity.
        TechnicalAudit. All completed road sections will be subjected to a technical audit involving the
        drilling of road cores at random locations (at an average of one sample per 2-km section), their
        measurement and testing in a laboratory, and comparison with specifications.This should allow
    ..  detecting non-compliance of works with specifications, and should serve as a deterrent to all
        parties involved.
        Complaints Mechanisms. A complaint handling mechanism (described in the Anticorruption
        Action Plan) will be deployed to handle complaintsabout any type of corrupt behavior.
    ..  Transparency and Public Information. Informationabout projectactivities includingprocurement
        will be continuouslypostedon the SRA website to inform civil society.
        Forensic Audit. A forensic audit will be carried out if major allegations of corruption surface
        duringproject implementation.
        Intensive Supervision by the World Bank. Overall supervision, including procurement
        supervision, will be undertakenby World Bank staffat leastthree times per year.

The AnticorruptionAction Plan was discussedand agreedwith the Borrowerduring projectpreparation

Introduction

The financial management arrangements envisaged for this project differ from those typically made under
World Bank financed projects. This is because the project will not be implemented by a Project
ImplementationUnit (PKJ)as is common practice under donor-financedprojects in Moldova and most
other countries. Instead, the project is conceived to help to improve and strengthen Moldova's own
system for the unified management and implementationof its Road Sector Investment Program, with
basicallythe same concepts and proceduresto be applied for both internally and externally financed road
investments.

Once implemented, the financial management plan described below will simultaneously satisfy the
objective of a unified system for financial management of Moldova's Road Sector Investments, and also
the needto comply with the requirementsofthe World Bank, EBRD, EIB and other donors.

This projectwill be the first one in Moldova to pilot the use of such a unified system, and it is naturalthat
this will entail certain risks. It will involve three relatively large contracts of about US$12-14 million
each, and there is a risk of undue pressures and corruption. It is rememberedthat some eight years ago
EBRD had to cancel prematurely the only donor-financed project in Moldova's road sector after
independence, due to mismanagement during the implementationprocess. To address this type of risks, a
number of measureshave beendesignedwithin the financialmanagement system of this project;these are
described further below.

        detecting non-compliance of works with specifications, and should serve as a deterrent to all
        parties involved.
         Complaints Mechanisms. A complaint handling mechanism involving an independent local
         agency will be deployed to handlecomplaintsregardingany type of corruptivebehavior.
         Transparencyand Public Information. Informationabout project activities includingprocurement
        will be continuouslypostedon the SRA website to inform civil society.
        Forensic Audit. A forensic audit will be carried out if major allegations of corruption surface
        duringprojectimplementation.
        Intensive Supervision by the World Bank. Overall supervision, including procurement
         supervision, will be undertakenby World Bank staffat leastthree times per year.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministry of Transport and Road Industry (MTRI) shall have the overall responsibility for project
implementation.The State Road Administration (SRA), which is an agency subordinate to the MTRI but
having limited operational autonomy, will be responsible for actual implementation of the Project,
includingprocurement, financial management,and contractmanagement.

State RoadAdministration (SRA)

Organizational Structure of the SRA

The State Road Administrationis a state-owned enterprise (but not ajoint stock company) established by
a decree of the Ministry of Transport and Road Industry. SRA has its own articles of foundation.
Employees of the SRA are not civil servants. The General Director is appointed by the Minister of
Transport and is employed on a 5-year term contract, while most other employees are hired on a
permanent basis by the General Director.The total number of SRA employees is 112, includingtechnical
specialists working in the districts. SRA has only one office located in Chisinau(there are no regional or
other offices).

The SRA is primarily responsible for three main activities:
    (1) Constructionof new roads - capitalworks;
    (2) Repairs of National Roads (except local roads which are under the responsibility of local
        governments) usingthe RoadFund; and
    (3) RoutineMaintenance of NationalRoads (except local roads) also funded by the RoadFund.

Accounting Function withinSRA

The Accounting Department has two divisions - The Financial-Economic Division and the Accounting
Division. The Financial-EconomicDivision has a staff of six employees and the Accounting Division has
five employees. The AccountingDepartment is headedby a Chief Accountant, who reports directly to the
General Director of SRA. The functions ofthe two divisions are as follows:

    Financial-Economic Division
    --  Accountingfor all transactions ofthe Road Fund
        Accountingfor capital constructions

   Accounting Division



                                                   37

   -    Accounting for (i)SRA's own revenues from carrying out road repairs, maintenance, and capital
        construction; and (ii)SRA's own generaladministrationexpenses, suchas salaries, rent, etc.
Financial Analysis of SRA

The main sources of receiptshevenue for SRA are:


    0   Budget transfers from the State budgettowards the RoadFund;
    0   Budget provisionin the MTRI for capital expenditure; and
    0   Own revenues in the form of the following three sources:
         (a) 4.7% of the value oftotal capital constructioncarried out by SRA on behalfof MTRI;
         (b) 1.4% ofthe value oftotal road repairs carriedout by SRA out ofthe RoadFund; and
         (c) Fixedamount received from the State budgettowards minor road maintenance.

The Road Fund is funded by transfers from the State budget supposedly out of excise paid on fuel and on
cars, road taxes, and taxes on transport. However, the annual transfers are not directly linked to the
amount of such taxes collected; the amount is instead fixed annually and stated in the State budget.

The major expenditures of SRA are:

   Capital Investments: Although expenditures are incurred by SRA, all capital expenditures are paid
   directly by the treasury to the contractors out ofthe State budget.

   Road Maintenance and Repairs: These expenditures are financed out of the Road Fund.The treasury
   transfers funds from the State budget to a bank account, owned and operated by SRA, as transfers for
   the Road Fund. The SRA then makes payments to the contractors from this bank account (SRA bank
   account at Banca de Economii).

   SRA Administration Expenses (salaries, administrativeexpenses, rents, taxes, etc): These expenses are
   paidby SRA from its own bank account.

BudgetingProcess

The annual and monthly financing planfor the three types of expenditures (described earlier) are prepared
by SRA, and submittedto MTRI for consolidation into the budget of the Ministry. As indicated earlier,
SRA's own expenditure i s funded out of its ownrevenues.

Road Maintenance (out of the Road Fund)

Road maintenance represents a separate budget code inthe State budget. The funds for road maintenance
are transferredfrom the treasury to the bank account of the SRA in Banca de Economii, generally on a
monthly basis, but periodicallythe transfers vary dependinguponthe availability of funds.

Capital Investments

Capital investment represents a separate budget code in the State budget. Capital expenditure payments
are made directly by the treasury by transferringthe paymentto the bank account of the contractor.

Payment Process

Paymentsfiom the Road Fund: SRA has a bank account in Banca de Economii.Treasury transfers budget
funds to this account and SRA makes paymentsto contractors directly.

Payments for Capital Expenditure: SRA prepares all payment documents and submits them to the
Ministry of Finance (Capital Investments department) for review and approval. After the approval of the
MoF, the documents are then transferred to the Treasury for payment. Treasury makes payments to
contractors directly.

Other Payments: SRA has a bank account inFinComBank, which is usedfor the payment of salaries.

Accounting Systems of SRA

SRA presently does not maintainone uniformentity-wideaccountingsystem for all its activities. Instead,
SRA has different accounting systems to record and process transactions in respect of capital
expenditures, road repairs and road maintenance from the Road Fund, and own revenues and expenses.
S R A uses a I-C accounting package for doing accounting in receipt of its own revenues and own
administration expenses. For capital expenditures and road repairs, SRA basically maintains records in
Exceland Word rather than in any particularaccountingsystem.

Financial Reporting

SRA prepares separate reports in respect of its own revenues and expenditures, and the expenditures
incurred on capital works and road repairs. The latter (capital expenditure and road repairs) are reported
in a format required by MTRI and MoF. These reports are manually prepared (using Excel). SRA does
not prepare any consolidated financial reports (such as Income and Expenditure Statement, or a Balance
Sheet). SRA regularly submits regular reports to MTRI, to tax authorities, and to the Department of
Statistics.

Audit



                                                   39

As SRA does not prepare a single consolidated financial statement, there is no audit of consolidated
financial statements of SRA. SRA is however subject to various forms of checkshspections and audits.
The Court of Accounts (SAI) performs regular audits of SRA's activities. In addition, SRA activities are
also subject to inspection by the "Center for Combating Economic Crime and Corruption", and by the
Tax authorities.

The latest review by the Court of Account indicates that SRA inappropriately financed certain small
expenditures of MTFU. Other than this observation there were no other major issues noted inthe CA audit
report.

Inspection by the "Center for Combating Economic Crime and Corruption" revealed that there were
several cases of non-compliance with the procurement legislation- in 2003-04; 41 contracts totaling 52.4
million lei were not procured accordingto the procurement law and these contracts were not registered
with the Public Procurement agency. Almost all of these are in fact the routine road maintenance
contracts with the 40 district road maintenance companies which are essentially owned by the State and
managed by personnelappointed by the SRA (see also Annex 1- Countryand Sector Issues).

Project Financial ManagementArrangements

This project will endeavor to use SRA's existing systems and staffto the extent possible. However, in the
case of identified weaknesses, existing systems and staff will be strengthened and supplemented to
providereasonableassuranceto the World Bank in respect ofthe use of World Bank funds.

Staffing

Current staff, though familiar with bookkeeping and government reporting, is not conversant with the
preparationof entity financial statements or the World Bank's FM requirements. The existing capacity
will need to be strengthened by hiring an FM specialist who will assist SRA in preparing consolidated
financial statements and also be responsible for preparation of quarterly FMR's and withdrawal
applications.

RequiredAction: SRA to hire FMspecialist under To& acceptableto the World Bank, by June 30th
2007.

AccountingSystem

Instead of establishinga separate projectaccountingsystem (and thus creatinganother accountingsystem
within SRA), SRA will upgrade the existing 1-C accounting package to cover all the activities of the
SRA, includingthis project.Separate account codes will be created to track project expenditures financed
by different donors. Although the special account will be operated by the treasury, SRA will maintain a
"memorandum" account in its general ledger to keep track oftransactions inthe special account.

RequiredAction
By March 25, 2007, SRA shall upgrade the 1-C accounting package capable of doing the entire
accounting for the SRA including road fund operations, capital expenditures, and project
accounting.Thus SRA will have only one uniform system for its accounting.
The SRA's hardware will also need to be upgraded and necessary provisionswill be made in the in
the project costs.

Internal Controls



                                                  40

The project will utilize existing internalcontrolswithin SRA andthe Treasury, and supplementthese with
additionalcontrols to ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently for the purposes intended. The
internal controls include (i)procurement controls World Bank procurement procedures will apply; (ii)
                                                    -
budgetary controls the projectwill form part ofthe MTRIbudget; (iii)Treasury controls paymentswill
                    -                                                                      -
flow through the Treasury); (iv) accounting controls       -  a computerized accounting package with
appropriate controls will be implemented; (v) quality controls - independent supervisionconsultants will
verify all bills before SRA/Treasury makes payments; (vi) management controls - an international
Management Consultant and program coordinator will be appointed to coordinate and provide general
oversight; (vii) audit controls    - an independent international audit firm will audit SRA financial
statements together with physical verification; and (viii) supervision controls (the World
Bank/EBRD/EIBteam will regularly carry out supervision ofthe project.

The following specific internalcontrolswill be requiredto strengthen the existingframework:
    (a) procurement would follow World Bank's requirements includingtenderingprocedures, setting up
        of bid evaluationcommittee, issuanceof donor's no-objectionon contracts;
    (b) all invoicesfrom contractors will be certifiedby the constructionsupervisionconsultant;
    (c) Treasury will perform ex-ante control over all payments; all payment orders will be verified with
        the contracts and authorized by SRA and signed by the Minister ofTransport;
    (d) program oversight will be provided by an independent international Management
        Consultantlprogramcoordinator;
    (e) annual financial statements audits will be carried out by international independent auditors; the
        scope of work would includephysicalverificationof quality of work on a test basis; and
    (f) SRA will performmonthlyreconciliationof own accountingrecords with the treasury records.

Procurement and ContractManagement

SRA will be responsible for the preparation of bidding documents, inviting bids, evaluation of bids, and
awardingcontracts. The contracts will be signed betweenthe director of SRA and the contractor.

SRA will technically supervise executionand implementationof all contracts. A constructionsupervision
consultant will be hiredto supervise the quality of construction.

SRA will maintain a contract management system, where all information related to contracts shall be
maintained:contract amount, contract terms, payments,etc. The systemwill eventually be linkedto the 1-
C accounting system, althoughthis link may be established at later stagesof project implementation.

Required Action: SRA will ensure that an appropriate contract management system is in place
before the Board date.

ProjectAccounting

Project accounting will be done in the upgraded 1-C system. Separate account codes will be created to
keep track of the project and funding from various sources. SRA will also maintain a "memorandum"
general ledger account to keep track of movement in the Special Account (which will be maintainedby
the treasury).

Required Action: By March 25, 2007, SRA will implement an entity-wide accounting system by
upgrading the 1-C system to cover capital expenditures,repairs, SRA expenses, and the project.


                                                    41

Project Reporting

SRA will prepare a single set of reports meetingthe World Bank, EBRD, EIB, and Government (to the
extent possible) requirements. Thus SRA will not prepare separate reports for the World Bank, EBRD,
and the EIB and donor reportingrequirements will be harmonizedto the maximum extent possible. The
World Bank will prepare formats for reporting and reach agreements with EBRD and EIB before
discussing the formats with the Government.

SRA will be requiredto submit reports (in an agreed format) to the donors on a quarterly basis within 45
days after the end of each quarter.

The 1-C accountingsystem will be modifiedin order to producethe requiredreports automatically.

Required Actions:
     0   The format of FMR's will be agreed with the donors.
     0   The 1-Csystem will be modified in order to producethe required reports automatically.

Auditing

SRA operations will continueto be reviewedby the Court of Accounts.

The consolidated financialstatements of SRA shall be audited on an annual basis by an internationalaudit
firm acceptable to the World Bank, starting with the financial statements for the year ending December
3 1, 2007. The first audit reports shall be due by June 30, 2008. SRA shall prepare its financial statements
following the nationalaccountingstandards. In view of limited capacity within SRA and the need to give
sufficient time to SRA to begin preparing consolidated financial statements, financial reporting under
IFRS will not be requiredimmediately6.

Audits shall be carried out in accordance with ISA.

The consolidated financial statements will includean annex providing project relatedfinancial statements
which shall also be subject to audit as part ofthe overall financial statements audit.



  The new Draft accounting law (approved by Government recently and pending approval of the parliament)
requiresall Public Interest Entities(PIE) to use IFRS.SOEs of such size will be classified as PIE; therefore, sooner
than later SRA will have to comply with IFRS. However, as not even NAS financial statements are prepared by
SRA, it will needextensivesupport to first prepareproper consolidatedfinancial statements.

DisbursementArrangements


The Treasury currently holds accounts in commercial banks and will open and manage segregated
Designated Accounts (DA) specifically for this project, in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The
ceiling for the Designated Account is set at US$2,000,000 for the credit. However in the early stages of
project implementation,the level of the advance requiredfor the account will be determined by projected
expenditures. Proceeds of the credit will flow as follows (i)from IDA to the corresponding segregated
Designated Account which will be replenished on the basis of SOEs and the necessary supporting
documentation; (ii)on the basis of direct payment withdrawal applications, or (iii)by Special
Commitments, if applicable.The minimum applicationsize for direct payments or for the issuanceof the
Special Commitments is US$400,000 equivalent. Withdrawal applications for the replenishments of the
DA will be sent to IDA on a regular basis - although monthly reporting is encouraged, or when the
balance of the DA is equal to about half of the initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever
comes first.

The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures provided in the IDA
"Disbursement Guidelines" and the additional instructions provided in the Disbursement Letter. The
disbursement arrangements are based on IDA'Sappraisal of the financial management capability at the
SRA, as well as the experience and lessons learned from the on-going projects in Moldova and
implementation arrangements within the SRA and at the Ministry of Transport and Road Industry. All
project expenditures will be reportedto IDA in a Statement of Expenditure (SOE.) In addition, the SOE
will be accompanied by reconciled bank statements and receipts and invoices for payments against
contracts valued at more than: US$l,OOO,OOO     equivalent for works, US$50,000 equivalent of goods,
US$50,000 equivalent for the services of consulting firms, US$25,000 equivalent for the services for
individual consultants. All supportingdocumentation for project expenditure will be retained by the SRA
and made available to the Association upon request and to the auditors for the project as part of the
financial statement preparation.

The Credit Closing date is June 30, 2011. The disbursement percentage for the credit proceeds is set at
100 percent (inclusive of Taxes, if no tax exemption or reimbursement is obtained) of Eligible
Expenditures, consisting of goods, works, consultants' services and training. Incremental operating
expenses could be included if requested by SRA and agreed with the World Bank. The disbursement
percentagewould also be 100%.

A. General

Notwithstandingthe fact that the project will be co-financed by the World Bank, EBRD and EIB, it has
been agreedthat procurement for the proposed projectwould be carriedout in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and revised in
August 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
dated May 2004 andrevisedin August 2006, andthe provisionsstipulatedinthe LegalAgreement.

The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general below. For each
contract to be financed by the Credit/Loan( s), the different procurement methods or consultant selection
methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are
agreed between the Borrower and the World Banks in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will
be updated at least annually or more often as requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneeds
and the improvements in institutionalcapacity.

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in March 2007 in the United Nations
DevelopmentBusiness (UNDB)and dgMarket, in the Official Journal ofthe EuropeanUnion (OJEU) and
the official web-sites of EBRD and EIB. The GPN will give a description of the goods, works and
consulting services contracts to be procured under the project and will invite all potential suppliers,
contractors and consultants to express interest and request additional informationfrom the implementing
agency. Specific Procurement Notices (SPNs) for InternationalCompetitive Bidding (ICB) procurement
packages and Expression of Interest (EOI) for consulting assignments estimated to cost US$200,000
equivalent (or more) per contract will be publishedin UNDB (on-line), dgMarket, in the Official Journal
of the European Union (OJEU), on the official web-sites of EBRD and EIB and in a nationalnewspaper
of broad circulation within Moldova as the corresponding bid documents become available. In addition,
the Procurement Plan (including all formal updates), SPNs and EOIs for all contracts above US$50.000as
well as results of contract awards will be publishedonthe website of UNDBonline and in dgMarket.

The SRA will follow the World Bank's general anti-corruptionmeasures and will not engage services of
firms and individuals debarred by the World Bank. The listing of debarred firms and individuals is
located at: http://www.worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/debarr.html.The SRA will further apply the
specific AnticorruptionAction Planpreparedfor this project.

Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project would consist of rehabilitation works of
about 300400 lane-km of road sections in various parts of Moldova. For bidding purposes, the works
will be divided into three individual lots. The individual base value of each lot will be approximately
US$11 million (before contingencies). The World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB will each finance one lot
on a parallel basis. Procurement will follow the World Bank's InternationalCompetitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures, with prequalification, and will be conducted on a slice-and-package basis to maximize the
economy and efficiency of the procurement process. Bidding documentation will be based upon the
World Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for Works (May 2005 edition). The Domestic
Preferenceclause will not be applied inthe evaluationof bids.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include equipment for an Axle Load
Control System, and IT hardware and software for SRA and MTRI. Other goods may be procured if
agreed between SRA and the respective donor agency. Procurement of the equipment for the Axle Load
Control System will follow ICB procedures and will be based upon the World Bank's SBD for Goods,


                                                    45

unless agreed otherwise. The IT hardware and software will be procured following Shopping procedures
on the basis of three written price quotations obtained from qualified suppliers.

Selection of Consultants: Consultant services requiredunder this project would include: a) services to
assist in developing a road maintenance financing system, b) services to assist in the design and
implementation of an axle load control system, c) assistance to the SRA in the areas of financial
management, environment, procurement and other areas related to the management of the Road Sector
Program, d) supervisionof constructionworks and, e) technicaland financial audits. Consultant's services
would be selected in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines issued in May 2004 and revised in
October 2006, and for this project, would includeQuality and Cost Based Selections (QCBS), Least Cost
Selection (LCS), Selection based on a Fixed Budget (FBS), Consultant's Qualifications (CQ) and
Individual Consultants (IC). QCBS and FBS selection over US$200,000 would be advertised in
DevelopmentBusiness (on-lineversion) and dgMarket(Gateway), in the Official Journal of the European
Union (OJEU), on the official web-sites of EBRD and EIB and in local media(one newspaper of national
circulationor the official gazette, and an electronic portal of free access (Moldovan NationalProcurement
Agency) for expressions of interest, from which a short list of six firms would be drawn. Individual
Consultants would be selected in accordance with Part V of the Consultants Guidelines. Consultancy
services estimated to cost US$25,000 and above will be subject to prior review by the World Bank.
However, all TOR for consultant services will be subject to prior reviewby the World Bank.

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as model
contracts for works and goods procured, are presentedin the ProjectOperationalManual.

B. Assessmentof the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

The project will be implemented underthe general supervision and responsibilityofthe Ministry ofTransport
and Road Industry(MTRI). MTRIwill execute the project through the State RoadAdministration (SRA) as
the direct executing agency. To strengthen SRA's capacity as the executing agency, the SRA will employ
local individual specialists with expertise in the areas of procurement, financial management, environment
and contract/program management. This should ensure that the project is delivered in accordance with the
World Bank's requirements.It is also planned that an international management consultant will be hiredto
support the implementation if the borrower's Road Sector Program; this consultant would be financed from
the EIB loan.

An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by World Bank Staff in September 2006. The assessment reviewed options
for the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's
staff responsible for procurement and management. It was revealed that the SRA staff does not have
enough capacity to add procurement under the proposed project to their existing workload; nor do they
have much experience in conducting international procurement. As a result of the findings and
recommendations of the CPAR dated June 2003 and this assessment, the overall risk for procurement
under the project is determined to be high. After one year of project implementationthe team will review
the procurement capacity of the SRA as well as the functioning of procurement with a view to making
adjustments as necessary.

The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project were identified as
follows (in September 2006):

(i)     The SRA staff lack capacity to undertake the proposedprocurement work under the project.They
        also do not have experience in internationalprocurement;



                                                      46

(ii)  The public officials who will be involvedin projectprocurement through tender committees, and
      the public officials of other related agencies at different levels of government who will be
       involved in procurement are not familiar with international procurement procedures, and may
      obstruct the procurement process;

(iii) The bureaucratic system creates opportunities for informal interference in procurement process
      by senior officials.

Based on the analysis made in September 2006, the following actions were recommendedto mitigatethe
above-mentionedrisks and are adopted under the project:

      Inorder to ensure that the overallcapacity ofthe SRA to conduct procurement is built up, and for
      procurement under the project to be conducted in a timely, economic and efficient manner, two
      full-time local procurement specialists (to be financed by the IDA credit) will be hired by the
      SRA;
      In addition to the above, an InternationalManagement Consultant (to be financed from the EIB
      loan) will be appointed. The IMC will provide advice and support to the SRA and its local
      procurement specialists in all aspects of the overall project management and procurement
      process. He will also provide on-the-job trainingto SRA staff and to its procurement specialists.
      By the time that the IMC completes its assignment, the SRA team is expected to be capable of
      implementing future projects with a minimal need for external procurement advice and
      assistance.
      The selected procurement specialists and the IMC will work closely with the technical staff of
      MTRIand SRA to foresee and reduce any potentialdelays inthe procurement process.
      A detailed Operational Manual will be prepared by the SRA. The manual will include
      procurement methodsto be used inthe project alongwith their step by step explanationas well as
      the standard and sample documents to be usedfor each method.
      Training of Borrower's fiduciary staff, customized to procedures and methods that would be
      requiredinthe next 12 months period.
      Prior review of procurement steps and close supervisionby World Bank procurement accredited
      staff. In addition, all contract amendmentswill be subject to prior approvalby the World Bank.
      The World Bank may review and comment on the qualifications and experiences of tender
      committee members selected by MTRVSRA to ensure that only persons with appropriate
      qualificationsand no conflict of interest are selected. The SRA procurement staffand all potential
      members of tender committees will attend a two-day project procurement launch workshop that
      will be organized by World Bank staff (with other IF1 staff) after the financing agreement is
      signed. Furthermore, the World Bank and IF1 team will help the SRA management identify
      suitable trainingcourses for its SRA existingstaff.
      Appropriate attentionwill be given to the needto ensure that debarred firms or individuals are not
      given opportunitiesto compete for World Bank-financedcontracts.
      All complaints by bidders will be diligently addressed and monitored in consultation with the
      World Bank.
      Contractors carrying out Road Works Contracts will be supervised by technically qualified
      supervisionconsultants and SRA engineers to ensure that specificationsare compliedwithquality
      specifiedinthe contract is deliveredin a timely manner.
      Contracts are requiredto be signed within the validity of the bids/proposalsand, in case of prior
      review contracts, promptly after the no objection is issued. The Procurement Plan format shall
      include informationon actual dates (of no objections and award) and will be monitoredfor cases
      of delay which will be looked at on a case-by-casebasisto identify the reasons.



                                                  47

    e   Monitoring Payments: all contracts shall include bank account information. The bank account
        shall be in the name of the same contractor /supplier /consultant that submitted the bid and
        awardedthe contract.Paymentsto local contractors suppliers -consultants shall be made in local
                                                             -
        currency only and paidto the accounts of banks locatedwithin the country.
    e   Timeliness of Payments: Payment to contractors, suppliers and consultants will be monitored
        through semi-annual interim unauditedfinancial reports (IFRs) to ensuretimely payments.
        The World Bank and IF1staffwill reviewthe efficiency of procurement under the projectand the
        improvement in the procurement capacity of the SRA team after one year of the loadcredit
        effectiveness, andwill make recommendations for further improvements as necessary.

OperatingCosts: The credit will finance the incrementaloperatingcosts ofthe team of specialists within
SRA (procurement, financial management, environment, etc.).

Anti-CorruptionAction Plan. The World Bank has prepared, and agreed with MTRI and the SRA, an
Anti-Corruption Plan (APAC) that will be implemented by SRA in order to minimize the potential for
fraudulent and corrupt practices to occur during project implementation.A copy of the ACP is attachedas
an Annex to this PAD.

The overall initial project risk for procurement is high. The risk will periodically be reassessed during
implementation.

C. Procurement Plan

The Borrower, with support from the World Bank, has developed an initial procurement plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods and timing. This plan has been
agreed between the Borrower and the Project Team on February 12, 2007. The Procurement Plan will be
updated in agreement with the ProjectTeam, at least annually or more frequently as requiredto reflectthe
actual project implementationneedsand improvements ininstitutionalcapacity.

D. FrequencyofProcurement Supervision

10.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from World Bank offices, the
capacity assessment of the ImplementingAgency has recommended initially four-monthly supervision
missions to visit the field and supervise project execution. Once SRA will enhance its capacity, the
procurement supervisionwill be carriedout every six months.

Summary

A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was carried out for the rehabilitationworks for all candidate road sections
considered for improvement under the project. The Highway Development and Management Model
(HDM4) was used, which simulates life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic decision
criteria for road constructionand maintenance activities. HDM4 estimates the net benefitsof each project
in terms of reduction in vehicle operating costs, passenger travel time, and road maintenance
expenditures.
The proposed rehabilitation works would improve ride quality leading to lower operatingcosts for road
users, guarantee structural soundness of the road for a prolongedperiod and prevent collapse, leadingto
lower life-cycle cost for the road asset. The economic analysis is carried out by comparing several
maintenance and rehabilitation alternatives (the "project scenarios"), to a base or "do minimum"
alternative. Several maintenance and rehabilitation scenarios were considered and the one found most
appropriate for this project is described below.
The projectscenario used inthe analysis consists o f

     0   The executionof minimummaintenance on a yearly basis, starting in 2008.
     0   The constructionof a 60 mm Asphalt Concrete (AC) overlay whenever IRIexceeds 4, starting in
         2008.
The "do-minimum" scenario is the deferred rehabilitation alternativewhich corresponds to executingthe
minimum maintenance on a yearly basis starting in 2008, but delayingthe constructionof the 60 mm AC
overlay by five years, i.e. in 2013 instead of 2008. The "do-minimum'' scenario is otherwise essentially
similar to the project scenario. The main difference lies in the fact that the construction of 60 mm AC
overlay can only start in 2013 or later. The rationale is that in the absence o f the proposed project,
adequate funds will not be available for the SRA until later in the future to carry out road rehabilitation
activities beyondthe minimumyearly routinemaintenance requirements.
The results of this CBA show positive Net Present Values (NPV) at a discount rate of 12 percent for all
road sections under the project, with a total NPV of US$177 million in 2005 if the whole corridor is
considered. The same HDM4 analysis shows that the proposed rehabilitation works will result in a
decrease in Road User Costs (RUC) on the road sections to be rehabilitatedby more than 11 percent on
average.

A. Assumptions and Inputs

Description of Road Sections and Traffic Composition
The candidate road sections considered under the project cover some 400 kilometers of main and
secondary roads on the North-Southcorridor in Moldova. The traffic ranges from 2,000 AADT for low
traffic road sections to about 15,000 AADT for hightraffic sections, and the traffic compositionvaries for
different sections and for different road classes. The defined sections along the North-South corridor, as
well as their respective length and traffic, are shown in table A9.1. The average AADT and traffic
composition is based on 2006 traffic counts carried out by the State Road Administration (SRA) in
Moldova. An annual 7 percent increase in traffic has been assumed for all vehicle types in this analysis,
basedon observedtraffic growth inMoldova during recentyears.

  Minimum          The minimum maintenance standard has been designed to reflect the current
  Maintenance      practice in the absence of major maintenance works. These include the following
                   items
                   Patching: Repair of surface distresses such as potholing, wide structural cracking
                   and raveling. It is carriedout annually.
                   Crack Sealing: This technique treats transverse thermal cracking and even wide
                   structuralcrackingwhen limited in area. It is carriedout annually.
                   Routine Works: Routineworks include all works, which do not have any effect on
                   pavement performance as modeled in HDM-4. These works include shoulder
                   repairs and routine miscellaneous works such as vegetation control, road sign
                   repairs and replacement, line marking, guardrail repair and replacement, etc.. .
                   Routineworks are carriedout annually.
                   Winter Maintenance: Winter maintenance includes all works carried out as part of
                   winter maintenancesuch as salt spreading; snow removal, etc. It applies to all roads.

  :onstruction     and to contribute towards the overall pavement strength. This maintenance activity
                   consists of constructinga 60 mm Overlaywhenever IRIexceeds 4.

Maintenance and Rehabilitation Costs

The financial unit costs for maintenance and rehabilitation are based on recent actual contracts in
Moldova and other SRA data. Average work unit costs were calculated for the different types of
maintenance and rehabilitationtreatment works adopted in this analysis. These costs are comprehensive
and includethe following: pavementworks as well as off-carriagewayworks such as shoulders, footpaths,
safety devices; road marking, land acquisition, etc. A summary of the work unit costs adopted for the
maintenanceand improvementstandardsdescribed above is shown inTable 9.4.

Financial costs are composed of market prices for materials, labor and equipment under country-typical
conditions(taxes, subsidies, limitations in currencyexchange, level of remuneration, etc.) for the types of
works being implemented. Economic costs exclude internal, such as taxes, custom duties, etc. On this
basis, conversion factors indicated in Table 9.5 have been assumed for the different maintenance and
rehabilitationworks applied in the present study. The economic costs are being assumed on average 80
percent of financial costs for any other costs not shown inthe table.

 Vehicle Fleet Characteristics and Vehicle Operating Costs

The characteristicsof the vehicle fleet, such as vehicle characteristics, utilization and loading, are detailed
in table 9.6. The vehicle operatingfinancial costs per vehicletype are presented in Table 9.7.

B. Resultsof Cost-BenefitAnalysis

Table 9.8 shows the result of the cost benefit analysis. The project scenario will result in an increase of
US$18.8 million in the discounted agency cost relative to the "do-minimum" scenario for the whole
corridor. This is essentially the cost for doing the overlays in 2008 instead of in 2013. For road users it
will result in a relative decrease of US$195.26million in the discountedcost. Therefore, the NPV at 12
percent from the project scenario relative to the "do-minimum'' scenario is US$177 million. The
economic internal rate of return (ERR) largely exceeds the 12% discount rate assumed in this analysis
justifying the appropriateness of the investments. All individual road sections result in a positive NPV
and an EIRR higherthan 12 percent under the project scenario, suggestingthat the proposedrehabilitation
scenario would yield benefitsto all the consideredsections alongthe North-Southcorridor.
The same HDM4 analysis used for the cost benefit analysis provides an estimate of the change in road
user resulting from the implementationof the project. The analysis was performed using the same data
and assumptions on traffic, road maintenance activities, and cost discussed above, and a discount rate of
12 percent. The analysis shows that the implementationof the project scenario would result in a decrease
in Road User Cost (RUC) per vehicle-kilometer by the end of the project period for all candidate road
sections. While the reductionin RUC varies depending on the road section, the average reductionin RUC
i s about 11.8 percent.

                                    Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues

                           Moldova: Road Sector Program Support Project


Introduction

Moldova's road network totals about 16,800 km, of which 3,666 km are classifiedas NationalRoads and
the remainder as Local Roads. Consideringthe size of the country and its population, the road network
size is mostly adequate, with little or no need for expansion. About 67 percent of national roads are
classified as poor, while for local roads the situation is worse, with at least 75 percent estimated to be in
poor condition. The Government is presently preparing a Road Sector Program with the following main
objectives: (i)to protectMoldova's core national roadnetwork from further deterioration; and(ii)to createan
adequate institutional and financial framework for the sustainable development of road infrastructure and
transport services. The World Bank, together with the EBRD and EIB, will support the Government's
Program through a Road Sector Program Support Project that will be the first World Bank-financed
operation in Moldova's transportsector.

Terms of Reference and Methodology

The main scope of the environmental assessment process is to: (i)ensure that environmental issues have
been taken into account in the design and implementation of the project; and (ii)ensure that country
capacity is increasedand that a regulatoryframework and procedures are established and will serve as the
basis for environmentalimpact assessmentsfor all future road sector rehabilitation.For the proposedroad
investment program involving future projects(still to be defined), it is necessaryto conduct: (i) a Sector
Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the overall program prior to the commitment of resources and the
finalization of subprojects; and (ii) a project-level Environmental Impact Assessment (EM) to provide
more detailed and subproject-specificanalyses once the subprojects are identified.Therefore, the overall
SEA goal is to try and determine the future potentialenvironmentaland social impacts of the program in
the road sector, to specify the needs for EA institutionalcapacity building, and to define the mitigation
and monitoringmeasuresto be undertakenduring project implementation.

The SEA study was conducted based on the following: (i)analysis of the existing national legal
documents, regulations and guidelines; (ii)SEA reports prepared for similar WJ3 projects in other
countries; (iii)WB safeguard policies, as well as guiding materials; (iv) results of consultations with the
representatives from all interested stakeholders; and (v) field visits on the potential road subprojects that
are under the considerationof the GoM for their inclusioninthe project.

Project Environmental Category

Although project activities supporting rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing roads are not
expected to generate significant adverse environmentaland social effects, they would present moderate
risks. In accordance with World Bank Safeguard Policies (OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment)
the project is rated environmental category B (limited and reversible environmental impact). For such
projects EMSand an EnvironmentalManagement Plan (EMP) would nevertheless have to be carried out
as part of project preparation and design. The EMPs would address the moderate adverse environmental
effects of the physical rehabilitationactivities of the project, would provide mitigation and monitoring
plans to ensure appropriate attentionto environmentaland social issues, and would monitor management
practices.

Environmentaland Social Safeguards Review Process

Evaluation of environment and social safeguards issues has been an integral part of project preparation
and of the selected road sub projects design. As the project will consist of several relatively similar road
improvement subprojects (to be identified at a later stage of project design), it was decided to apply a
phased approach to the EA. At the first stage it is necessaryto conduct the SEA. The SEA consists o f (i)
conducting an analysis of EA institutional capacities and preparing recommendations for improving the
EA process in the road sector; (ii)preparing an environmental assessment and management framework
(EAMF) that would establish safeguard procedures for selected road subprojects as well as guidelines
with the detailson potentialenvironmentaland social issues on how to prepareEMPs. This will serve as a
template to undertake an appropriate environmentalassessment of roadsubprojects once identified.At the
second stage, the EA will include: (i) screening of proposed subprojects and identifying those that needa
partialor full EIA study; and (ii)carryingout a specific EIA and preparingEMPsfor selected roads.

National E A Legal and Institutional Framework

Moldova has its own relatively well-developed legal and institutional framework for Environmental
Assessments.This framework is in line with the existing WB EA rules and procedures as well as with the
EU EIA Directives. The national EA legal basis is presented in two main laws: Law on Environmental
Protection (1993) and Law on Ecological Expertise and Environment Impact Assessment (1996). These
laws introducethe concept of state ecologicalreview (literally, state ecological "expertise" - SEE) which
seeks to examine the compliance of proposed activities and projects with the requirements of
environmental legislation and standards. The SEE precedes decision-making about activities that may
have an adverse impact on the environment.Financingof programs and projects is allowed only after a
positive SEE conclusionhas been issued.Proceduresfor conductinga SEE are contained in Guidelineson
Performing SEE (2002). They define, in detail, the goal, objectives, and principles of the SEE, and
stipulate the procedures for submittingproject documentation, as well as reviewing procedures. For the
road sector, the Ministry of Transport and Roads Industry (MTRI) has issued in 1997 specific
"Guidelines concerning environmental protection within the roads and bridges design, construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance activities". The Guidelines represent a comprehensive document that
contains all environmentaland social requirements necessaryfor designing, constructingand maintaining
different types of roads and bridges inthe country.

The responsible EEauthority in Moldovais the Division on SEE within the State EcologicalInspectorate,
a subdivision of the Ministry of Ecologyand NaturalResources (MENR).

Institutional Capacities to Perform Safeguards

The EA institutionalcapacity of the borrower was assessed during projectpreparation and concludedthat
MENR and SEE have relevant capacities to perform their duties concerning reviewing EA studies and
enforcingEMP provisions. At the same time, within the MTRI and the State RoadAdministration(SRA)
(the project implementing agency), there was not any special unit and/or especially designated staff
responsible for environmental issues in the road sector, as well as any analytical laboratoriesthat might
assist in ensuring compliance with the existing legislation, regulations and ecological norms. In this
regard it will be necessary to provide TA to the MTRI to strengthen its capacity and ensure the
environmentalrequirements will be fully integratedinto sectoral policies, and program design, as well as
into design and implementationofthe EIAs for subprojects.

Analysis of EnvironmentalImpactsfor the Road Sector

The nature and scale of impacts is determined by the type of interventions undertaken by the project to
assist the roadsector, which focuses on rehabilitationand maintenance of the existingroads. Generallyno
major project environmentalimpacts are expected. Most potential environmental and social impacts will
be limited mainlyto the effects associated with rehabilitationworks, such as dust and noise control, use of
bitumen, disposal of solid or hazardous waste, erosion control, and labor camp management (which will
be temporary with only minor and localized negative effects). After completion, the project will have
positive indirect impacts on human health and safety through decreased number of accidents and reduced
air pollution from more constant travel speeds on rehabilitatedroadsections.

In order assist in identifying all the types of impacts that may arise from a projectthat will be selected, a
checklist has been developed which highlights typical issues that need to be considered. The checklist
serves to summarize potential impacts and provide a simple and visual tool for conducting an impact
assessment, includingassessment of magnitude and significanceof the identified impacts.

EnvironmentManagementPlan

The SEA includes an EMP which covers different measures to mitigate any potential negative impacts,
together with the respective monitoring plan, budgets, responsibility, and schedules of execution. The
EMP consists of the following: (i)proposals for developing the regulatory framework for the EIA,
strengthening the EIA capacity in all institutions involved; (ii)an EA and EAMF that covers procedures
for environmental screening of subprojects and criteria for categorization; it also covers procedures for
conductingan EIA and/or preparingan EMP for selected subprojects; (iii)environmental guidelines with
the description of potential environmental and social impacts and suggested mitigation measures, based
on the most advanced international practices; (iv) a monitoring plan, including specifications for
supervisionas well as the basic environmentalperformance indicators,timeframe and responsibilitiesfor
proposed monitoring activities; and (v) implementingarrangements and a budget covering each step of
the implementationof all proposed measures.

The first section of the EMP outlines the results of a short analysis of EA policy and the institutional
framework, which is based on a series of recommendationsfor developingthe regulatorymechanisms for
EIA, and strengthening the EIA capacity in all institutions involved, i.e. in governmental road sector and
environmentalagencies and amongnationalcontractors.

The EAMF outlines how the national EA rules, procedures and WB requirements will be applied to the
civil works to be financed under the proposed project, and provides the tools to carry out the various'steps
required. It will be used as a guide and template by SRA to undertake environmentalanalysis and ensure
compliance with the World Bank's environmental safeguard policies, and the relevant provisions under
the Law on EE and EIS and associated regulations.DetailedELAsEMPsfor individual civil works will be
carried out (in accordance with the EAMF) by SRA consultants and when applicable, will be reviewed
and cleared by the SEE under prevailingnationalenvironmentallegislationin Moldovaand satisfactoryto
the World Bank.

The environmental management guidelines contained in the EMP describe the basic road maintenance
and rehabilitation activities, identify possible environmentalimpacts for each activity, suggest mitigation
measures, and designate responsibility for implementation. Implementation would be part of the road
works contract while their enforcement would be the responsibility of the SRA, supervision consultant
and ofthe State EcologicalInspectorate.




                                                      60

The Monitoring Plan includesmeasures that will be employed to track the effectiveness of the EMP, as
well as environmental indicators to be monitored, monitoring methods and frequency, and reporting
procedures. Furthermore, it also includes detailed recommendations concerning preparing and
implementingsubproject Monitoring Plans.

Main EMP provisions, especiallywith regardto EAMF, EnvironmentalGuidelines and Monitoring Plans
will be included in the Project Operational Manual and implemented by the SRA and contractors.
Furthermore, it is proposed the main stipulations of these EMP sections be included in the Contract
specificationsthat concern contractors' responsibilitiesfor civil works, and the mitigation measures to be
reflected in the engineering designs and bidding documents for each subproject. Among the most
important provisions to be provided to the contractors (though there are others) are the following: (i)
provisions on spill prevention and cleanup, dust and noise control, traffic management during
construction, safety enhancement, construction site cleanup and rehabilitation; and (ii)provisions
governing the sources of construction materials. Materials (e.g., asphalt, stone, sand, etc.) would be
supplied only from sources with approved licenses, permits, andor approvals for environmentandworker
safety; any equipment used during construction would meet internationally recognized standards for
environment and worker health and safety. The World Bank will review the initial contracts for roads
rehabilitation works in each subproject to ensure that these clauses and measures are incorporated as
proposed.

The EMP also provides details on implementing arrangements and capacity building activities. It is
proposed a full-time environmental specialist be appointed in the SRA to assist with the SEA and EMP
implementation, as well as to provide training on environmental management aspects of the project to
MTRI and MENR and their rayon offices. The project would also provide the MTRI and SRA technical
assistance for environment management and assessment, includingtraining workshops in: (i) integrating
environmentalprocedures, environmentalpolicies and management into the project cycle; (ii)reviewing
projects that would require the preparation of limited or full environmental assessment; and (iii)
implementingEMPs for selected road subprojects.Additionally the project will support trainingactivities
for SEE on supervisionofthe EMPs implementationandthe enforcement of provisions.

An amount of US$as yet to be determined will be allocatedfor institutional strengthening of the MTRI
and SRA, as well as to support training of SEE staff. The actual cost of implementingthe EMP for road
subprojects was not estimated, but is expected to be low. Providedthese are incorporatedinto the project
design and reflected in the works contracts then these costs would be borne by the contractors. No
additional funding will be providedto the State Ecological Inspectorate for monitoringcompliance with
agreed measures, enforcinglaws, regulationsand covenants; these costs would be borne by the institution.

Public Consultation

The SEA consulted with all major stakeholders. A description of those consulted is fully described in the
SEA report, Section X. The SRA has preliminarily disseminated the draft summary EMP to all relevant
state institutions for review and comment on January 16, 2007 and on January 17, 2007 a summary was
publicly disseminatedfor public access in paper copies and by the MTRI website. During the SEA study
meetings were held with representatives from the following stakeholders: MENR, State Ecological
Inspectorate,MTRI, Ministry of Health,Ministry ofAgriculture, Instituteof Geography and Ecology, and
from various environmental NGOs. The stakeholders agreed with the main SEA recommendations and
affirmedtheir commitmentto support the project in its environmentalobjectives.

The SEA was made publicly available in Moldovaand providedto the World Bank on January 29, 2007,
and will be used by the government agencies inthe implementationofthe project.A summary ofthe SEA
was translated into Romanian and was widely distributedamong all interested parties as well as postedon

the web site of the MTRI. A complete SEA (in English and Romanian) will be kept at the SRA in
Chisinau for review by interested parties. Furthermore, it was agreed that the SRA will proceed in the
same way with the EMP for all selectedsubprojects, organizingEMP disclosure and public consultations.
Indoing so, the SRA will take into account the relevantnationallegislationinplace (see: Law on EE and
EM; Regulation on public participation in environmentaldecision-making) as well as the World Bank
Guidelineson informationdisclosure and public participation.
