SU!iMARY
i,        The industrial sector represents one of the most dynamic sectors
of the Colombian economy. Manufacturing industry accounted in 1967 for
nearly 19.3% of the gross domestic product compared to 14.8% in 1950.
Average annual growth has been 6.3% since 1950. However, between 1962-
1967 the average was at a rate of 5.7% annually. In recent times the
Government of Colombia has pursued protectionist trade policies in order
to stimulate production. Nevertheless, in late 1965 the Government
relaxed its import restrictions with the objective, among others, of
bringing pressures to bear on high cost domestic manufacturers to produce
more efficiently or face competition from imported goods. As a result
imports increased rapidly.  In November 1966, Colombia experienced acute
foreign exchainge difficulties and import restrictions were re-imposed.
The fiscal and monetary countermeasures which the Government enforced
followring the difficulties had a detrimental impact on business activity
during the first half of 1967. However, this effect seems to have been
of a temporary nature and the private sector is now regaining confidence.
The future expansion of business is now mainly dependent on the still
emerging overall economic policy of the Government and the degree of
importance whlich the public sector is to play in the economic development
of the country.
ii.       The financieras have played a major role in the development of
the industrial sector in Colombia by providing medium- and long-term
financing as well as equity financing. On December 31, 1967, the aggregate
value of their portfolios amounted to Col$ 1.8 billion; their equity
investments :increased from a mere Col$ 13.0 million at the end of 1961
to Col$ 318.3 million at the end of December 1967.
iii.      The principal resources of the Colombian financieras have been
their own equity, credit lines with Banco de la Repdblica and foreign
commercial banks, the Private Investment Fund (PIF), the US$25 million
Bank loan granted in May 1966, local bond flotations and deposits. As of
December 31, 1967, the Banco de la Republica credit lines were fully
utilized, the Bank loan jlirist fully comaitted and total funds available in
PIF for the financieras and commercial bariks amounted to Col$ 66 million
in counterpart funds and US$3 million in foreign exchange funds.
Consequently, the financieras find themselves limited by a shortage of
long-term funds. The prospects for replenishment of PIF funds are at
the moment somewhat uncertain. The financieras should have no difficulty
in utilizing, for foreign currency expenditures, the full amount of the
proposed US$L2.5 million Bank loan:within a one-and-a-half year period.
iv.       In spite of certain weaknesses in the financieras noted in this
report, their performance can be considered satisfactory and the quality
of their management and staff generally high. In the utilization of the
first Bank loan it has been found that their appraisals have generally
been of a good standard.  Doreover, their financial position is satisfactory



- ii -
and business prospects are good. The financieras are, therefore, considered
creditwyorthy for, and suitable recipients of, the proposed second Bank
loan. The Banco de la Republica would be the borrower; funds would be
committed to each financiera on a project-by-project basis, after the Banco
is satisfiecl that the loan proceeds are being requested for projects of
significance to the economic development of Colombia. The Colombian
Government has agreed to give its guarantee to the loan and the Banco de
la Repdblica will carry the exchange risk, if requested to do so, blat the
ultimate borrower retains the option to shoulder the exchange risk himself.
v.        The loan would be allocated in advance among the financieras,
approximately in the following manner: Colombiana and Nacional 30% each,
Caldas, Norte and Valle 13-1/3% each. The individual and aggregate
limits for investments requiring the Bankts prior approval would be
US$250,0OO and US$1.5 million each for Colombiana and Nacional, and
US$100,000 and US$750,000 each for Caldas, Norte and Valle.
vi.       The loan recommended would have the form normal for Bank :Lending
to development finance companies. Banco de la RepCblica would charge
the financieras the rate applicable to the Bank loan plus a maximum of 1%
per annum to cover administrative costs. The financieras would charge
their borrowers a minimum of 3% per annum to cover operational costs and
profit.  To this total (10-1/4% at todayfs Bank lending rate), the Banco
de la Republica would add 8% to cover the foreign exchange risk, if the
ultimate borrower does not himself wish to assume it. Satisfactory
assurances have been obtained from each of the financieras that it wrould
add equity features to the loans it makes, whenever possible. Other
matters discussed during negotiations are spelled out in paragraph 107.



APPRAISAL OF FIVE PRIVtATE FINANCE COMPANIES
IN COLOMBIA
I, I TRODUCTION
1.        In }ay 1966 the Bank made a loan of US$25 million to the
Bz'nco de la Repuiblica, the central bank of Colombia, to be relent in
local currency to five private development finance companies (finan-
cieras) and to be used by them to finance investment projects in the
private sectorc The loan has been almost fully committed; as of March 31,
19683 US$24.9 million had been credited to the loan account for 72
projects.  At the same date, US$12.2 million had been disbursed.
2.        The Government of Colombia and the financieras have asked the
Bank for a second loan of US$25 million on a similar basis. The Bank
envisaged the possibility of a US$12.5 million loan, expecting other
external sources of capital to provide the additional finance which
Colombian enterprise could effectively absorb. This report assesses
the performance and prospects of the financieras with a view to deter-
mining whether they can effectively 'use the proposed new Bank loan.
It is based on missions to Colombia in November/December 1966 and
January/February, March/April and July 1967 and on information acquired
in the course of continuing and close contact with the five financieras.
II.  INDUSTRY AND THE FINANCING OF INDUSTRY
Economic Policy and Industrial Development
3.        The first industrial plants, as opposed to artisan shops, were
established in Colombia in the early. 1900s.  Industrial growth proceeded
fairly slowly for the first 50 years of the century, so that by 1950 the
industrial sector accounted for no more than 14.8% of the Gross Domestic
Product comprising mainly firms in textiles, clothing, beer, soft drinks,
cigarettes, and cement. These are industries that have a natural advan-
tage in that they produce the principal items of mass consumption in a
low-income country; their capital requirements are not unduly high, their
technology is not unduly complex, and they use mainly local raw materials.
These industries were established and developed by Colombians and they
continue under Colombian ownership and management.
4.        Until 1950, industry developed with little official protection.
As a result, tlhese older industries were and still are capable of meeting
foreign corpetition. However, they were not oriented towards export
markets.



5.        Industry has grown more rapidly since 1950, increasing its share
of Gross Domestic Product to over 19%.  Initially, this was the result of
the stimulus provided by the world coffee boom of 1950-56, which accele-
rated the general rate of economic growth in Colombia. In the decade
since then, manufacturing industry has grown at about 6.5%, even though
the rate of growth of GDP declined to 4.4%. The rate of industrial growth
since 1957 is accounted for mainly by the utilization of capacity created
by investments made in earlier periods.
6.        Nelw industries have developed in the last decade against a
background of official protection which was not part of a comprehensive
blueprint for industrial development. It was rather the by-product of
austerity policies designed to deal with the very serious balance of pay-
ment difficulties developing in 1957. The main instrument of protection
was the introduction of quantitative import controls, accompanied by
devaluation. In order to reduce the impact on the cost of living of the
reduced level of imports at a higher cost caused by the devaluation, a
system of adninistrative price controls was introduced. As a further
consequence of the balance of payments difficulties, the Government had
to assume the obligation of repaying rapidly a very large amount of for-
eign commercial arrears. The financing of this repayment required a
large increase in revenues which was obtained by imposing an excess pro-
fit tax and by prohibiting the revaluation of assets for the purpose of
calculating depreciation which in the inflationary setting increased the
income tax liability of private enterprises.
7.        These measures, initially undertaken to deal with the emergency
of 1957, have become more or less permanent features of economic policy
in Colombia. Administrative price controls have been employed during the
past decade with varying degrees of intensity, and have not in general
been used with enough consistency or effectiveness to damage industrial
development seriously, although they may have inhibited the potential for
development of certain industries, such as cement or steel, where effec-
tive price control has been applied for long periods. The prohibition of
asset revaluation persists, and by affecting the industry's ability to
maintain its real assets intact may constitute a severe restraint on
future development.
8.        However, among the measures introduced in 1957, import control
has had the greatest impact upon industrial development in the past decade,
because it has come to be employed as an instrument of protection.
9.        The machinery of import control relied initially, in 1957, on
prohibiting the importation of a wide range of items. Later, the restric-
tions were relaxed to free imports of raw materials and other intermediate
products. The remaining prohibitions covered mostly imports of manufac-
tures, many of which were already produced in Colombia. Thus, the control
machinery provided protection for the output of domestic industry while
permitting the import of its inputs.



10.       It is of course in the new industries established under
protection during the past decade, that the main effects of protection
can be detected. They tend to be industries with relatively small
markets and relatively high costs, dependent upon imports for their
essential inputs.   For instance, 60% of the inputs of the chemical
industry are imported, and in durabLe consumer goods and office machin-
ery a similar relationship exists. These industries got their start
when imports of the corresponding finished products were restricted,
which provided the foreign suppliers of these goods with the incentive
to preserve their market in Colombia by establishing local plants.
Recent Policy Developments
11.       In September 1965 the Government introduced a series of new
economic policies designed to remedr acute domestic and external
financing difficulties and to provid3e a basis for the resumption of the
development etffort (see Economic Reports NIH-172a dated May 23, 1967,
Appendix B and VH-177 dated February 14, 1968). Essential elements of
these measures were substantial adjustments in the exchange rate system,
the initiation of an import liberalization program jointly with a set
of tariff adjustments, and the relaxation of price controls. No changes
were made in tax legislation affecting the industrial sector, including
the prohibition to revalue assets. The program had a favorable impact
in the sense that it produced a general resurgence of economic activity.
However, exchange difficulties caused another relapse in November 1966,
and import liberalization, which by then was covering 80% of imports,
was put in reverse. Total import controls and a general freeze on
prices were reintroduced.
12.       The new exchange policies, established in March 1967 (see
Economic Reports No. WH-172a and WH-177) contain elements that promise
to reconcile the balance of paymentst prospects with Colombia's growth
objectives. They include a flexible exchange rate policy, that could
provide a more appropriate price structure for imported capital
equipment and intermediate products, as well as more adequate incentives
for the development of non-coffee exports.
13.       The new exchange policies also established a new system for
the treatment of foreign investments.  The Administrative Planning
Department has been endowed with authority to approve all new foreign
capital inves-tments in the country. Once approved by that Department,
new investments have to be registered in the Exchange Office and this
registration entitles the investor to (a) profit remittances up to



10% per year with possible exceptions for larger percentages, (b)
capital repatriation in cases of liquidation up to the amount actually
brought into Colombia, and (c) repatriation of moderate amounts in
cases different from (b). In two cases the authorized level of remit-
tances has been raised to'15%. After one year of operation of these
regulations, the National Council of Economic Policy recently acted on
a recommendation from the Administrative Planning Department, raising
the limit on profit remittances from 10% to 14% ner year. So f'ar, the
new regulations have been implemented in a flexible manner, and the
authorities have announced their intention to keen this line of policy
which wTill reassure foreign investors.
14.       The new exchange policies have started to work well, and the
economy is getting back into a renewed high level of activity. The
Government i-s aware of the need to improve the system of incentives for
industrial development and is now actively reviewing it.
Industrial Financing
15.        The principal outlines of the institutional framework for in-
dustrial financing in Colombiahave been described in a memorandum attached
(as No. 1) to the Presidentts Report No. IFCR/64-8 of March 17, 1964.
Later developments are reported in the "Appraisal of' Five Colombian -
Private Development Finance Companies", Report No. DB-28a of April 20,1966.
16.       Loan finance for the industrial sector was traditionally geared
to short-term needs, and capital expansion had to be financed mainly out
of' earnings and capital increases. Loan financing of exinansion became
more attractive as inflationary pressures worsened in the early tsixties.
At the same time long-term financing became more readily available with
the establishment of the financieras and of the Private Investment Fund.
Thus equity financing declined in imoortance.   The following data on the
composition of industrial financing from 1959 to 1964 show the direction
of this trend (figures in percent'of total): '
1959  1960  1961  1962  1963  1964
Retained Earnings  1/   39.0  26.0  31.0   24.3  38.5  32.2
Capital Increases       26.0  46.o  26.0  28.5  14.8   22.8
Loans                   35.0  28.0  43.0   47.2  46.7  45.0
Total      100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 lOOoO
Although more recent figures are not available, it may be assumed that
the relative use of loan and equity funds continued to depend on Govern-
ment credit policy and general financial conditions. Today, in the
1/ Reserves and undistributed profits.



light of the Government's general anti-inflationary policy, equity probably
looms larger as a source of industrial finance than it did a few years ago.
Equity Finance
17.       The principal source of equity capital continues to be retained
earnings. Outside sources are primarily insurance and allied savings
companies, which may within certain limits invest in industrial shares
and bonds, and the financieras, which are becoming significant in this
field. The combined value of the equity portfolios of the financieras
rose from Col$ 13.0 million at the end of 1961 to Col$ 318.3 million at
the end of 1967.
18,       The failure of shares to keep abreast of inflation has limited
their attractiveness to the public. For instance, the index of stock
prices on the Bogota stock exchange, calculated on an average basis, fell
16% from 1964 to 1966, while the cost of living index increased by about
26% during the same period. Total share transactions were 5% less in
1966 (only Col$ 287.6 million) than in 1965. In 1967, however, the pic-
ture has been different. The index of prices on the Bogota stock exchange
increased by 14% up to October 31, while the cost of living index increased
by only about 6% in the same period. Col$ 395.0 million changed hands
during this period, an increase of 60% compared with the same period of
1966. The revitalization that has taken place in the market in 1967 is
partly attributable to recent restrictions on speculation in the foreign
exchange market, the repatriation of Colombian capital from abroad and
the elimination of guarantees granted by financial institutions,either
directly or by endorsement, of local currency obligations.
Loan Finance
19.       At the apex of financial institutions providing loan capital in
Colombia is the Banco de la Republica, followed by the commercial banks,
several government and semi-government specialized credit and investment
institutions and the financieras.
20.       Banco de la Republica.  Banco de la Republica provides funds
mainly through discount facilities available to commercial banks, ancd
through special credit lines to the financieras. (These credit lines
started in 1963 in place of discount facilities previously provided to
the financieras). As of September 30, 1967, commercial banks had out-
standing Col$ 1.2 billion, and the financieras as of December 31, 1967,
Col$ 455.3 million of Banco de la Republica funds, including PIF funds.
21.       Each financiera's credit line, determined by the amount of its
subscribed capital and legal reserves and revised from time to time, is
scheduled for repayment over 1966-1969. However, the Banco de la Republica
has agreed to accept payment in ten-year bonds, thus considerably extending
the use of its funds. The credit lines are used for medium-term lendLing
for both working and fixed capital, and cost the financieras 6% p.a.
interest.



-6-
22.       Prlivate Investment Fund. The Private Investment Fund (PIF),
establisherLn March 1963 as a special account in the B,nco de la Repdblica
and managed by it, has become a vitally important source of finance to the
private sector. Total PIF resources as of December 31, 1967 amounted to
Col$ 743 milLion. This includes loans available for peso expenditures of
Col$ 489 miLlion from US AID and CoL$ 12 million from the Netherlands
Government. It also includes for foreign exchange expenditure a US$3
million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a US$10
million loan from AID and a US$5 million credit line from Kreditanstalt
ftir Wiederaufbau.l/ Up to  December 31, 1967, PIF had made 200 loans
totalling Col$ 695 million in pesos and US$15 million in foreign exchange.
23.       PIF' loans are made to private businesses through the commercial
banking system and the financieras. Up to five years are allowed for
agricultural, forestry, and fishing projects; and up to ten years, for
industrial projects. PIF charges the intermediaries 14% interest on all
loans whliose purpose is to increase exports, and 6% on other loans.
Relending rates are 12-14 1/2% p.a. on peso loans and 8-10% p.a. on
dollar loans. To the end of September 1967, 34% of all loans in pesos
and 73% of a2l loans in foreign exchange had been channeled through the
financieras. This fact reflects both their growing importance and the
developing differentiation between the commercial banks, which focus on
short-term leinding, and the financieras, which began that way but are
moving increasingly towards medium- and long-term investment.
24.       Coamercial Banks. Colombiats commercial banking system,
consistingof' 21 institutions, 16 of which are Colombian, has the
traditional role of supplying short and to some extent, medium-term
credit and is; the major provider of all credit in Colombia. As of
September 30, 1967, 76.5% of commercial bank loans were short-term, 15.9%
medium-term and only 7.6% long-term. Commercial firms have been the
main recipients of bank credit; but in recent years, industry has in-
creased its borrowings from commercial banks and in September 1967 had
around 34% of' total bank lending compared with 26% for commercial firms.
At the end of' September 1967, the industrial loan portfolio of the com-
mercial banks amounted to approximately Col$ 2,100 million, up 50% since
the end of 19>64. These activities are supported by the Banco de la
Repdblica through conventional discount facilities, as well as through
special credits designed to promote investment.
25.       Instituto de Fomento Industrial,(IFI).  IFI, created in 1940
and fully fianced by the Government, was set up to promote and finance
industries deemed of special importance for the country, which because
of the large investment involved, special risk or small initial return,
1/ The Dutch loan in the amount of $1.4 million was untied and freely
usable for local currency financing, while up to 20% of the German
loan was available for such financing,



did not attract private initiative. In 1963 IFI was given the status of
a government-owned financiera, which gave it access to PIF resources.
Also, in 1965, IFI was designated as the Government's financial agent
for the adm'inistration of AID counterpart loans to the Colombian Govern-
ment.
26.       It is the policy of the Government to enlarge IFI's role in
industrial clevelopment. A new management has been appointed and its
financial position improved by writing off bad debts. Its financial
resources have been greatly enlarged. The Government has increased IF2's
paid-in capital from Col$ 50.0 million at the end of 1966 to Col$ 79.1
million as of December 31, 1967; it has also made provision for a contin-
uing supply of new resources by malcing available to IFI, on an annual
basis, 40% of the increase of the reserves of the Colombian Institute of
Social Security (ICSS).j/ In 1967 IFI received Col$ 74.6 million in this
way. According to official estimates this amount will increase annually,
reaching Col$ 473.2 million in 1970 and Col$ 1.5 billion in 1974. IFI
also has access to rediscounting facilities of Banco de la Republica.
It has obtained from Spain a line of credit equivalent to US$ 10 million
to finance imports of industrial equipment from Spain and another loan of
US$ 2 million equivalent from the Netherlands; and it is negotiating
similar credit lines with IDB, France, Germany, Japan and Denmark. As
of October 31, 1967, IFI had 99 outstanding loans for an amount of
Col$ 117.3 million and equity investments in industrial enterprises of
Col$ 56.8 million.
27.       Thie revitalization of IFI changes in some ways the environment
in which the financieras work. They are faced for the first time with a
potential government competitor enjoying a continuing and large supply of
fresh capital and having govetmental support in other subtle ways.   IFI
will have no effect on the financieras' use of the proposed $12.5 million
loan:  the amount is small, the commitment period is likely to be fairly
short and Colombian entrepreneurs generally prefer to deal with a private
rather than a public institution. But in the longer run, IFI's impact
will depend on what the Government wants to make of IFI: the country's
principal source of finance for private investment, or a residual pro-
vider of capital others will not provide. IFI's present management con-
ceives the institution as primarily a promoter of enterprises of national
significance, a provider of capital for enterprises too risky for private
financial institutions to support, and a complement to, rather than com-
petitor of, the financieras, with which IFI relations are at the present
time close. How the relationship develops will also depend on whether
the financieras have access to adequate financial resources and on the
terms of IFl's loans to industry.'
1/ 80% of the annual addition to ICSS's reserve is lent to the
Government against the issue of "constant value bonds". 50% of
these fumds will then, in turn, be relent by the Government to
IFI.

28.       Semi-official Specialized Credit Institutions.  The Banco Cen-
tral Hipotecario, Banco Popular and Caja Agraria lend to private industry.
Banco Central "Iipotecario provides mortgage finance to all sectors.  The
Banco Popular lends to small-scale industry. The Caja Agrarials principal
activity is agricultural credit, but it also lends to the mining and man-
ufactur-ing sectors. In all, the roLe of these institutions is not very
significant in medium- and long-term industrial financing.
29.       The Financieras. The firgncieras have emerged, in the past five
years, as EIiEFnmain source of medium*- and long-term credit for industry.
As of December 31, 1967 the combined value of their total portfolios was
Col$ 1,799.0 million.l/ They have become important mobilizers of
domestic as well as of foreign capital, channels of official Colombian
finance to the private sector and innovators in industrial finance and
investment. They have already made an important impact on the development
of Colombials industry.
III. PERFORILUACE OF THE FINANCIERAS
General
30.       A detailed description of the emergence of the financieras
appears in Appraisal Report No. DB-28a of April 20, 1966. No important
changes have been made since that Reiport in the legislation which
authorized the establishment of the' financieras or in the regulations
which govern their operations.
31.       There are now nine private financieras in Colombia, three more
than when the first Bank loan wias made in May 1966.

32.       Of the new companies, Corporaci6n Financiera del Occidente
started in mid-1966, in Pereira, in the scame region in wnich the operations
of Caldas have been focussed. About 45%. of the stock is owned by local
Pereira interests and the rest by large institutional investors such as
banks, insurance companies and industrial enterprises. So far Occidente
has confined itself to provuiding short-term working capital to companies
in the region. Corporaci6n Financiera de Santander was established at
the same time, in Bucaramanga. Its three largest shareholders are
Ecopetrol, the Federaci6n Nacional de Cafeteros and the Fondo de Desarrollo
Industrial de Santander. Corporaci6n Financiera Central was organized
in August 1966 by the BPnco`de la Sabana. On February 1, 1967, the Banco
de la Sabana was bought out by the Grupo Grancolombiano, wihich consists
of the Banco Grancolombiano, Capitalizadora Grancolombiana, S.A., soele
warehousing companies, mutual funds, and two insurance companies. This
company is located in Bogota, the headquarters of Colombials largest
financiera, Corporaci6n Financiera Colombiana.
33.       Finally, Corporaci6n Financiera del Caribe was recently organized
and authorized to operate by the Superintendency of Banks. The company's
main shareholders are Banco de Colombia, two insurance companies ancd four
Dutch corporations.
34.       On the occasion of the first Bank loan, it was noted that
the multiplicity of development finance institutions ref-lected peculia-
rities of CoLombials history and economic development, particularly its
regional diversity and resulting competitive spirit.  However, each of
the institutions was developing staff and techniques, financial resources,
and a safe regional base for its activities.  Moreover, to some extent,
the edge was taken off the dangers of overcrowding by developing
cooperation among the institutions' The four new financieras now in
the field will inevitably have a harder time getting started than did
their predecessors; and, with the uncertainty about IFI's future role,
all the companies will need to watch closely the prospects of competi-
tion, cooperation and merger.

35.       Requests have been made by, or on behalf of, the new finan-
cieras for access to the proposed new loan. However, several consider-
ations suggest the need for caution. The new institutions lack oper-
ating experieince; their equity base is very small; in the enhanced com-
petitive situation among the financieras, the new ones are not now well-
equipped; the proposed loan is so small that it would be of little use
to any of the! companies if it is divided into too many parts. All things
considered, it would be best to adhere to the policy the World Bank group
has thus far followed in Colombia, of waiting until there was actual
operating eaxperience to evaluate, before providing capital to a financiera.
During negotiations the representatives of the Colombian Government and
the Banco de la Republica, although having requested the inclusion of two
of the new financieras as beneficiaries of the loan, agreed to limit this
loan to the five oldest financieras.
36.       Accordingly, this report is devoted to appraisal of the five
oldest financieras. which were the beneficiaries of the first Bank loan.
37.       IEJ is a shareholder of three of these five financieras:
Colombiana, Nacional and Caldas.

In the case of Colombiana, the increase in IFC's present holdings from
the original purchase amount by 165,960 shares was the result of a share
option exercised on a dividend on June 29, 1962, and an 8% stock dividend
declared on February 28, 1968. IFCts shares held in Caldas increased by
15,753 shares, representing successive 7% stock dividends (4,900 shares
on March 30, 1966, 5,243 shares on March 31, 1967, and 5,610 shares on
March 29, 1968). The decrease in IFC's holdings of Nacional of 710,909
shares resulted from the sale of 752,909 shares in 1964L, after a stock
dividend of 442,000 shares had been received on June 3, 1963.
Ownership
38.       Few changes of importance have taken place recently in the
ownership of the five financieras.  As can be observed in Annex 1, fin-
ancial institutions, foreign and domestic, continue to dominate Colom-
biana and Nacional. Governmental institutions and other investors hold
a more important place in the smaller financieras. The only significant
change in ownership in the past two years, which occurred in Colombiana,
accentuates this picture. There, in early 1967, a group headed by
Banco de Bogcta and Colombiana de Seguros, respectively the largest bank
and largest insurance company in Colombia, increased their combined
interests from 11% to 35%.



Resources
39.       The resources of the financieras total Col$ 2.4 billion, and
are derived principally from share capital and surplus, credits from the
Banco de la Repu'blica (and PIF), credits from foreign commercial banks
and the World Bank. The principal source of increase, since 1965, has
been the US$25 million of Bank Loan 451 CO,equivalent to Col$ 406.3
million. Other significant increases have been in PIF funds and lines
of credit from foreign banks. The following table shows the resources
of the financieras at December 31, 1967 with the whole of the first
World Bank loan included (in Col$ million):

Grand total      941.0      641.8   322.1   257.8  191.3  2,354.0
40.       Equity, credits from the Banco de la Republica and the World
Bank, and bonds are devoted largely to medium- and long-term loans and
investments. Credit lines from foreign banks are of a short-term nature
and have been largely devoted to a. lucrative export and import financing
business. Bonds and deposits have been of limited significance. Term
deposits are acceptable under the law, but prudence in their use has
kept them low in amount.
1/ The total for the five financieras amounts to the equivalent of the
total Barn loan. The portion for each financiera is estimated on the
basis of amounts credited on March 31, 1968 at an exchange rate of
Col$ 16.25 per US$1.00.



- 12 -
41.       It is notable that the financieras have received no long-term
subordinated funds from Government, of the kind available to some other
development finance companies financed by the Bank group. They haves had
facilities from the Banco de la Rep6blica and certain tax privileges.
These were, however, not subsidies or privileges designed for the finan-
cieras alone;.they were available to financial institutions generallr.
The financieras have had to work in the market, searching for resources
and competing for them, and energetically seeking out business while keen-
ing expenses to a minimal level in a manner companies in a more favorable
environment have not had to do. The financieras have thus had to use their
funds so as to prevent their being tied up for too long a period and to
assure an early return. In their first years, the stress was on short-term
lending and on the provision of a variety of financial services; the for-
mer gave place to medium- and lon -term investment as apnronriate resour-
ces were found. In general, the e:xperience of having to adapt themselves
to the market has made the financieras more resourceful and has reauiired
more initiative from them than has been the case with institutions lbased
on government finance.
Organization and Procedures
42.       Fundamentally the organizations of the financieras are similar,
as are their methods of work. Differences relate largely to the com-
petence and experience of the staff and to the "styles" of the manage-
ments, which reflect to a great extent differences in regional outlook.
43.       Colombiana. The Board of Directors is elected for a two-year
term. As a result of the changes in ownership that took place in early
1967, Banco de Bogota and Colombiana de Seguros obtained effective con-
trol of the financiera and the present board of 5 principals and their
alternates took the place of'a 10-man board that had served before.
Dr. Jorge Mejia Salazar, President of Banco de Bogota,' which together
with Colombiana de Seguros, dominates Colombiana, remained Chairman of
the Board; representatives of Colombiana de Seguros, Banco del Comercio,
Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Bank of London and Montreal also re*-
tained their seats. The alternate director representing the interest of
the German shareholders became adviser to the Board. IFC was offered
a seat (principal and alternate) but declined for the time being.   The
Board meets every second week. It has appointed an Executive Committee
consisting of the President, and the renresentatives of the Banco de
Bogota and Colombiana de Seguros. 'There is also a Credit and Invest-
ment Committee, consisting of three Board members and three vice pres-
idents, which meets once a week to make recommendations on all loan
and equity investment proposals to'be brought before the Board.
44.       The shift in Colombianats ownership was reflected in important
managerial and staff changes. I'r. Guillermo Herrera Carrizosa retired
from the presidency to become Honorary President and was succeeded by -
Dr. Ignacio Copete, respected lawyer, central banker and, most recently,
Financial Manager of the Inter-American Development Bank. Most of the



- 13 -
second echeLon of the company, all the v_ce presidents and several de-
partment heads, has also changed. There is a vice president in charge
of each of the promotion, technicaL and administration departments.
Price WIaterhouse has been contracted to prepare a study on a new system
of accounting and information for management.  There is also a Co-
ordination Committee consisting of the senior staff, whose main task
is to assist the President in the planning and execution of the re-
organization of the company. Colombiana is in the process of overhauling
and rationalizing its organization and procedures, which have not kept
abreast of the rapid growth of its operations.
45.       The procedure for appraisals and follow-up are well conceived
although in practice some wneakness in these services has been observed.
During negotiations the Company's President assured the Bank that this
is being corrected. He has organized a system of continuing and frequent
staff review of individual investments under his direct supervision.
46.       Nacional. The Board of Directors composed of ten principal
directors and ther alternates is 'elected for a one-year term and it con-
tains representatives of the principal shareholders, including three
foreign financial institutions. Seven principals representing the
major Colombian shareholders regularly attend meetings which are held
weekly,  The Comnrn;rls Chairman, Dr. Gabriel Angel, participated in the
founding of several important commercial banks, insurance companies and
industries, as well as of Nacional. He is one of Colombia's most
respected businessmen.
47.       Management consists of the President, Dr. Jose Gutierrez Gomez,
and a vice president.  Dr. Gutierrez Gomez, a lawyer by training, has
held important business and government positions, including presidency of
AON.D,I. and Ambassador to the U.S.A, He provides dynarmic leadership
to the corporation and is hiighly regarded both in Colombian private and
government circles and abroad.
48.       Although the second in terms of resources and volume of busi-
ness, Nacional's staff is'among the smallest of the five financieraso
The level of the personnel in the operational departments is among the
best to be found in the Colombian financieras. The quality of the cor-
poration's appraisal reports has been generally satisfactory, and loan
applications are adequately processed. During the construction period,
projects are closely watched to ensure funds are used by clients for
the purposes originally agreed upo., However, follow-up has been spor-
adic after construction is completed, It is not standardized to pro-
vide for regular periodic visits except in cases of projects financed by
PIF resources, Improvement of follow-up was discussed during negotia-
tions.



49.       Caldas. The Board of Directors consists of eleven principal
members and their alternates, elected by the General Shareholderst Meeting
for a one-year term. Four principal directors and five alternates
regularly attend meetings which are normally held once every two weeks.
These nine directors represent the coffee interest, local industrial
enterprises and three Colombian financial institutions. IFC has been
represented on the Board since March 1966 by Mr. A. G. Arango who attends
meetings about once every two months.
50.       The Companylts management consists of the President, Dr. Roberto
Ocampo Mejta, a recently appointed Executive Vice President and a Vice
President who is in charge of the BogotA office. The President is a
dynamic personality and has: been in office almost since the Corporation
began operations.
51L       Caldas has experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining
the services of qualified personnel. However, to cope with this problem,
the level of staff remuneration has been raised and, in addition to
the appointment of a new Executive Vice President;, the staff has been
reinforced with three new engineers and an economist; and a former Vice
President of the company, who was managing a consulting firm, was
brought back into the company, in charge of promotions. One of the
engineers recently appointed is in charge of follow-up and end-use
procedures. l'he Vice President in charge of the Bogota office is at
present attending the Industrial Projects Course at the EDI.
52.       In the reorganization now taking place, the Executive Vice
President (Dr., Mario Calderon) plans to establish new procedures and to
define more clearly the responsibilities of the department heads and
their staffs, and greater care will be taken with end-use supervision.
During negotiations these matters were discussed with Caldast representative,
and it is expected that the reorganization under way will greatly improve
the Company's performance.
53.       Valle. The Board of Directors consisting of nine principals
and their alternates is elected for a two-year term. The directors who
attend meetings regularly represent the main Colombian shareholder grDups.
The Board must meet at least twice a month, but does in fact hold weekly
meetings.
5h.       Considerable changes were made in the Company in 1966 and early
1967 following the resignation of its President. Dr. Benjamln Martènez
Moriones, formier Executive Vice President, became its new President.
Dr. Martfnez is well experienced and has a thorough knowledge of Valle
del Caucals business community.



- 15 -
55.       Loan applications are first reviewed by a management committee
which decides whether or not they should be studied by a technical
department. Then the appraisal is prepared by the technical department
and again reviewed by the Management Committee which may approve loans of
up to Col$ 200,000 and submits its recommendations to the Board in the
case of larger operations. Procedure for handling loan applications is
satisfactory. During negotiations, the Companyls President stated -that
the technical department has been recently strengthened: it now has
eight members including seven economists. The reorganization of the
technical department will ensure regular half-yearly visits to all
borrowing clients.
56.       Norte.  The Board of Directors composed of ten principals and
ten alternates is elected for one year. The directors represent two U.S.
banks whliich are the largest private sharelholders and the regional interests
of the North of Colombia, in accordance withi their economic importance:
Barranquilla (3), Cartagena (3), Santa I1Iarta (2). The Board meets once
or twice a month. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive is
Karl Parrish, a U.S. citizen and prominent businessman who has lived in
Barranquilla all his life. M4anagement is in the hands of the Presid3ent,
Dr. Alvaro Jaramillo Veng6ecllea, who has considerable business experience
as a member of the management of several important industrial and
commercial enterprises.  Ile is assisted by two Vice prosidents.  The
Company is organized into technical, administration and legal departments
and has offices in Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta.  Engineering
consultants are engaged from time to time. Project appraisals, elaborated
by the technical department, are first discussed in a Technic.:l Committee
and then writh a Credit Committee which rejects or endorses proposed
investments. Final approval of projects is given by tlhe Board, excepting
that of projects up to Col$ 0.2 million, which has been delegated to the
President. 'Subsequent follow-up on loans and investments are also handled
by the techn:ical department,
57.       Project appraisals by lIorte, the smallest of the fi7e financie-
ras, are generally of good quality, well organized and comparable to the
ones of the more experienced and larger Colombian finance companies.
Its follow-up reviews are made on scheduled visits and have been reasonably
up-to-date. During negotiations, the Comparnys President stated that
measures have been taken to make more frequent follow-up reviews. A
staff member, an industrial and meclhanical engineer, is in charge of
these proceduires. Norte also intends to engage a market specialist.
58.       General Evaluation.  The managements and Boards of Directors of
the financiexas are composed of successful bankers and businessmen who
have the respect and goodwill of government and private business circles
in Colombia and abroad.  Their staffs are reasonably well trained and are
gaining experience. All suffer from certain common weaknesses, chiefly
inadequate engineering advice and wieak follow-up procedures. Financial
analysis is generally well done; butr market studies are generally

deficient and conclusions tend to rely excessively on tariff protection.
However, they enjoy the strength deriving from vigorous chairmen, presi-
dents, and boards of directors whose members are familiar with the
business of the community. Moreover, their experience with the first
Bank loan has significantly improved the financieras' performance and
helped them not only to expand their operations but also to achieve
higher standlards of investment appraisal.
Policies and Operations -
59.       Policies.  The statements of operational policies of the five
financieras are-similar.  They contain most of the elements of statements
guiding the affairs of other private development finance companies. No
change has been made in them since the first Bank loan was granted. A
summary of the policy statements is attached as Annex 2.
60.       In general the five financieras have abided by the provisions
of their policy statements.  However, with respect to cash dividends in
light of the need to maintain provisions and reserves at a level appro-
priate to the size and condition of their portfolios, Colombiana, some-
what imprude!ntly, in 1967 declared a cash dividend of EL% representing
an 88% pay-out. To remedy this situation, the company in 1968 reduced
the size of the dividend to 8% and substituted shares for cash.  VaLle
in 1967 declared a 7% dividend to be paid either in cash or in shares
at the shareholders' option. Although this was done with the expec-ta-
tion that most of the dividend would be paid in shares, as was the case
in practice (95%), the altiernative decision on the part of the share-
holders would have resulted in a pay-out of over 100%. During negotia-
tions the Presidents of these two f'inancieras gave specific assurances
that their companies will annually allocate a suitable portion of their
net profits to provisions and reserves.
61.       Operations.  Loan and equity commitments made since the begin-
ning of 1966 have been substantial, despite the general slowdown of
business activity in late,1966 and in 1967. The principal rise has been
in medium- and long-term loans, primarily the result of the availability
of the Bank loan; equity investments also rose significantly. Although
a large proportion of the commitments made during this period has yet
to be disbursed, the following tabulation of the portfolios of the
financieras at the end of December 1967 shows an increase of 24% over
the comparable figures for the end of December 1965.

62.     The table reflects the contLnued trend which is away from short-
term lending and towards medium- and long-term operations as a result of
the greater availability of long-term resources.  The origin of the re-
sources at their disposal has been a principal determinant of the way in
which the financieras invest and the terms on which they make capital
available. Thus, PIF resources and credits from the Banco de la Republica
can be relenl; only for a period of one to 10 years; credits from foreign
banks are generally available only for 6-month periods; the Bank loan is
for medium and long-term use. The shifting mix of these and other f'unds
deeply affects'the composition of the portfolios of the financieras.
63.     The close link between the financieras, borrowing and lending
terms is also reflected in the differences in interest rates charged
under the various lines of credit, which in turn has led to a certain
stratification of terms. Thus, on all their own funds, including pro-
ceeds from bonds, the financieras generally charge 11-13%, plus a com-
mission of 1%. On proceeds from the Bank loan(cost, 9d) and on PIF
funds(cost, 6_) denominated in pesos, the financieras charge 12% on
loans repayable in up to five years, and an additional 1/2% for each
additional year up to a maximum of 14-1/25'. On dollar loans
1/ Mostly medium- and long-term. Thei proceeds of the Bank loan are in-
cluded in this category, because the foreign exchange risk is taken
by the Banco de la Republica.
2/ Mostly short-term.

made available through PIF (cost, 4-6%) the financieras charge 8% on
loans repayable within three years: 9% on loans repayable in five years;
and 10% on loans, for industry only, repayable in more than five years.
Interest charged on capital derived from the Banco de la Republica credit
lines (cost, 6%) is 11% plus 1% comndssion. On foreign exchange loans
(cost, around 6-8%) the interest charges are from 11% for export financing
and from 12-13% from import financing plus commission varying from 3/4%
to 1%. The linking of use and terms to the sources of capital is an
aspect of the general adaptation of the financieras to market conditions,
which has been referred to earlier.
64.     The financieras' loan operations show a lide diversification
and the distribution of loan portfolios by main economic sectors as of
December 31, 1967 was the following.(in per cent):

100          100        100       100    100
As of December 31, 1967, the distribution of the financieras' loan port-
folio was as follows: agriculture and livestock (Col$ 254.8 million),
textiles (0ol$ 175.7 million), metais and engineering (Col$ 171.0 million),
food and beverages (Col$147.4 million), paper and printirg (Col$ 124.2
million), chemicals (Col$102.2 million) and other sundry activities
(Col$177.5 million).  The average amount of these loans was less than
Col$ 0.5 million and were for a duration of five years or less.
65.     Except for Colombiana, where 60% of the loan portfolio is to
enterprises located outside its home state, the financieras tend to focus
1/ Including sugar.



- 19 -
their activities in the regions in which they are located. On the other
hand, there are cases in which two or more of them have joined in finan-
cing a project that proved too large a commitment for the one that ori-
ginated the project.
66.       The financieras' equity investments have risen steadily as a
result of their underwriting and promotional activities and the thinness
of the local capital market and its inability to absorb shares in new
enterprises. During 1966 and 1967, total equity investments of the five
financieras increased by Col$ 94.3 million (a 42% increase) from
Col$ 224.0 nillion as of December 31, 1965, to Col$ 318.3 million at
year-end 1967. CoWparative-expbsures in equity investments as of
December 31, 1967 and of December '31, 1965,were as follows:

Thus, aggregate equity investments of Co1$ 318.3 million in 1967 repre-
sented 21% of the combined loan and equity portfolios, ranging from a
low of 11% in the case of Norte (the newest and smallest of the five
financieras) to a high of 30% in the case of Colombiana (the oldest and
largest of the financieras); likewise, aggregate equity investments re-
presented 62% of the combined net worths, ranging from 26% in Norte, to
74% in Colombiana.
67.          The financieras' equity portfolios generally appear to be
sound. They have been made substantially in existing enterprises which,
with a few exceptions, have experienced managements and attractive pro-
fitability prospects. Accordingly, as shown in the following tabulation
(for details see Annex 3), at year-end 1967, three-fourths of the share
investments of the five financieras were in the shares of companies in
operation, and the remaining one-fourth in companies which had not
started operations because they were still under construction, were in
the promotional stage or were experiencing some kind of special market,
raw material supply or financial difficulty:

Not all the operating companies are making profits.   Among these are some
new enterprises just starting up. Noteworthy, also, is the fact that
Colombiana has' a large exposure in one non-operating enterprise (a cement
plant under construction and with prospective serious market problems)
amounting to Col$ 32.7 million in shares, or 23% of its equity investment
portfolio, plus Col$ 64.1 million in loans and guarantees.
68.       The financieras have been active in underwritings and prano-
tions; partly as a result, of this, their combined equity portfolios
have grown by 42% over the period 1966-1967 as mentioned in Paragraph
66. The greatest growth was that of Caldas (140%) followed by Norte
(93%), Valle (40%), Colombiana (39%) and Nacional, the most conserva-
tive of the financieras, (14%). Over-all, the most active financiera
with respect to promotions, has been Colombiana: as of December 31,
1967, 87% of its equity portfolio was in the shares of 15 companies
which had been promoted by Colombiana itself.   By contrast, Nacional,
with a more cautious approach, had only 46% of its equity portfolio in
its owqn promotions and, significantly, received in 1967 about three
times as much in dividend's (001$ 6.1 million) than Colombiana (Col$ 2.3
million), whose equity investments were nearly twice as large (Col$ 143.4
million vs. Col$ 80 million).  While the financieras intended to carry
some share investments in' the promoted companies, their actual interests
in these enterprises are larger than was originally estimated, primarily
because of higher-than-anlticipated investment costs resulting from local
currency devaluation and the difficulty in placing industrial shares in
recent years. Accordingly, while the promotional activity of the
financieras undoubtedly has been important for Colombia, it has thus far
proven demanding and risi& for the financieras.
Financial Results        I

Profitability of the financieras has varied from year to year and from
company to company. Net income before taxes, which had been reduced during
1966 in the case of Nacional and Caldas, again increased in 1967 to levels
slightly higher than in 1965. On the other hand, Colombiana, Valle and
Norte showed steady and substantial increases during the period. After-tax
results, however, are different: despite substantial increases in pre-tax
income registered in Colombiana and Norte, and modest increases in Nacional
and Caldas, after-tax net.income was substantially the same in 1967 as in
1965 for these four financieras. Valle was the only one that showed an
appreciable 1gain during the period 1965-1967. Such differences in before-
tax and afte:r-tax incomes is largely explained by a higher incidence of
taxation in 1967 resulting mainly from the fact that provisions for the

protection of portfolios are not deductible beginning in 1967, and because
Nacional and Caldas have a higher proportion of their total net income in
tax-exempt iltems, such as dividends from investments. Financial results,
as measured Ln terms of perrcentage of average equities, are somewhat less
satisfactory since net worths increased at a faster pace than net profits
did.  Finallr, the lower returns on average equity of Colombiana and
Caldas partially reflect these financieras& higher proportionate invest-
ment in equities, most of which do'not yet produce income, to the
financieras.  In the case of Norte, the lower ret-urn is mainly due to
the still higrh 'incidence of administrative expenises on gross income (30%
in 1967 and the highest for all finmancieras).
70.       The good profit record of the financieras results generally
from the substantial spreads which *bhey receive on the funds provided by
Banco de la Itepublica and PIF, proportionately low administrative costs,
substantial income for services of various kinds, and the active searching
out of any, and every, opportunity to do business, even if it is not the
kind of business an investment bank normally does. While seizing the
main chance in the interest of profitability, the financieras have not
lost sight of their objectives as developmental institutions.
71.       However, financial results are less than satisfactory, if
measured in real terms.  Over the five years ended December 31, 1967,
the cost of :Living in Colombia rose by about 15% per annum and the
exchange rate for the peso depreciated a total of about 83% from the
beginning to the end of the same period_l/. If one adjusts the rates of
net income on average equity shown :Ln Para. 69 by the rate of inflation,
the real rate of return to domestic investors is greatly reduced in 1965
and is actual1ly negative for 1966 and 1967.  When the same adjustments to
net income are made to ccmpensate for the depreciation of the peso, the
same results follow.
72.       This evidences the lack of protection against erosion in the
value of the peso afforded by convenTtional rates of profit and the need
for a sharp improvement in profitabiiity before the financieras will
be able to mobilize additional equity funds on their own. The finan-
cieras are expecting increases in profitability during the next few
years.  The Grovernment's initial successes durig 1967 in arresting
the rate of inflation and in progressing towards attainment of stability
in the balance of payments give some hope that the financieras' expec-
tations will be realized.  It is to aid the prcces3 of pr-ofit improve-
ment that the financieras have agreed to make it a policy to include
equity features, whenever possible, to the terms on which they lend to
their clientEs.

and on the effective average import rate.

73.       The financieras generally have followed a prudent dividend policy;
they have waited frao four to six years before declaring a dividend. Colombianaa,
starting in 1962 (its fourth year of operation) paid cash dividends at the
rates of 3%, 6% and 4% during 1962, 1963 and 1964, respectively, representing
an average pay-out of 56% of net income earned during the period 1961-1963;
during 1965 and 1966 its shareholders agreed to forego dividends to strengthen
the equity base; in 1967 an 11% cash dividend was declared, representing an
88% pay-out, and ii 1968 an 8% stock dividend was declared to resume increasing
the equity base. Nacional, while sgimultaneously allocating part of its net
earnings to the building up of reserves, has managed to pay an increasing cash
dividend since 1963 (its fifth year of operations) amounting to 6%, 8% and
9% during 15'63, 1964 and 1965, respectively, and to 10% since then. Nacional's
current. pay-out ratio is 53%. CalcLas, during 1966 (its fifth year of opera-
tions) declared a 7% stock dividencL, and in 1967 and 1968 has declared 7%
stock dividends plus 1% cash dividends, the latter dividends representing a
modest average pay-out of 9% of net income earned during 1966-1967. Valle
declared its first dividend in 1967 (its sixth year of operations) amounting
to 12%, to be paid in cash or in shares at the shareholders' option. This
dividend was declared with the cleELr expectation on the part of management
that the majior part would,be paid in shares; in effect, as of December 31,
1967, 95% of the dividend had been paid in shares.   An 8% dividend was
declared in 1968 with the same cashi or shares option and equal expectation
with regard to shareholderst 6hoice   Norte during the current year (its
fifth year cf operations) declared its first dividend of 6%, payable in cash
or in shares, at the shareholders' option. Nortefs management, as in the case
of Valle, has the understanding that most of the dividend will be received in
shares.  The dividend record of the financieras may be summed up in the
following table:

74.       Until the end of 1966, Colombian tax legislation permitted the
financieras to build up reserves for protection of their loan portfolios-
by tax-free appropriations from gross income, up to 10% of the loan port-
folio. The tax did not become payable until the reserve was reassigned
or actually distributed. This provision helped the financieras in their
policy of building up their reserves. Recently, as part of a general
tax revisioni mentioned earlier, the Government abolished this privilege

with the result that the financieras have lost part of their incentive for
a rapid build-up of reserves. This fact, taken together with the tendency
among the financieras to put more emphasis on establishing a good dividend
record as a means of attracting additional risk capital, creates a situa-
tion which warrants close attention.

76.       The financieras' debt-to-equity ratios are low and well within the
limits agreed upon with the Bank (five times for Colombiana and Nacional and
four times for'Caldas, Valle and Norte). Accordingly, there is ample room
for additional borrowing. Except for Valle's and Norte's, the current ratios
are on the low side. This is especially so in the case of Colombiana, whose
current ratio at the end of 1967 was 0.9 to 1. However, its immediate liquid-
ity was adequate; liabilities maturing within 30 days were covered more than
three times by cash and readily marketable securities. Colombiana's manage-
ment was aware of this situation and was taking appropriate measures.
77.       The financieras' loan portfolios are of a generally satisfactory
quality and are adequately backed by collateral, reserves and equity.
Arrears of principal as of December 31, 1967 in no case exceeded 2% of the
total loans outstanding, and represented a substantial reduction in the
levels recorded as of September 30, 1967, particularly in the case of Colom-
biana. The total loans outstanding to clients in arrears as of December 31,
1967 amounted to 2.4% of the loan portfolio in the case of Colombiana, 0.4%
in the case of.Nacional, 1.9% in the case of Caldas, 1.2% in the case of
Valle and 10.0% in the case of Norte.  During negotiations the President of
Norte stated that the high percentage of loans in arrears to clients was
due to a temporary situation and that collections since that date had
greatly improved the picture.
78.       In most cases the financieras' loans have been secured by adequate
collateral. The need for'adequate collateral was discussed with the finan-
cieras' reprasentatives during negotiations, specifically with Nacional and
Caldas which had some major credit operations with personal guarantees.
79.       As indicated earlier (para. 67) the financieras' equity irnvest-
ments have been mainly in existing'enterprises, generally with sound manage-
ment and favorable prospects. However, their investment portfolios contain
a large proportion of participations in new enterprises which have still to
prove themselves.  Of course, the financieras' equity portfolio must also
be viewed from the point of view of the financieras' primary function;
namely, to promote and develop new industrial activities, in which their
role has been important.
80.       There is no market value for the financieras' shares.   Only those
of Caldas and Nacional are listed on the stock exchanges, but they are not
actively tradied, and sales of shares of the other financieras are infrequent
and prices often reflect buying or selling objectives rather than real value.
At the end of December 1967 the unadjusted book values per share (before divi-
dends) were as follows: C'olombiana Col$ 16.27, Nacional Col$ 14.03, Valle
Col$ 1h.03 anid Norte Col$ 13.60, per share of Col$ 10.00 par values, and
Caldas Col$ 1l34.29 per share Col$ 100.00 par value. However, in Colombia,
dividends paid, rather than the value of equity, largely determine the prices
of shares; anad in all cases, dividend yields are still low. Moreover, as has
already been noted, the erosion of the'peso has been such that prospective
capital gains and past dividends would not make up for the depreciation in



- 26 -
value of local currency, especially for foreign investors. None of the finan-
cieras has yet solved the problem of maintaining the value of its equity in
an inflationary economy. Perhaps the recent changes in the relationship
between share price and cost_of_living trends referred to in paragraph 18
will improve ta.he situation. More likely, however, the value of their shares
will rise only over the long run, which suggests that they will be attractive
for the time being only to investors whose objectives include something more
than direct financial gain.
Evaluation
81.       The performance of the individual five financieras over the past
two years may be summarized as follows:
Colombiana has in general performed creditably. It is the oldest
and largest of the five financieras. Its total resources on December 31, -
1967 were 47% larger than' Nacional's and the amount of its loans and invest-
ments outstanding 92% greater. Of the five financieras Colombiana is the
one where investments are most widely distributed geographically:   most of
its loan portfolio is in enterprises located outside its home state. It has
a good staff and the quality of its appraisals is satisfactory. Notwith-
standing, it is faced with problems, in both organization and portfolio.- It
has had difficulties with staff andl procedures. Several enterprises, in-
cluding some in which Colombiana has a large exposure, are in difficulty.
However, its new President, a seasoned and experienced banker, is dealing with
the organizational problems, and shiould be able to solve them. The volume of
principal in arrears which on June 30, 1967 represented 11% of total loans
then outstanding was reduced by 90% during the second semester to an accept-
able level of slightly over 1% at year-end 1967. The portfolio problem is
less tractable. While the equity base is sufficient to reassure creditors,-
it is clear that reserves and provisions should be closely watched. Colom-
biana's profitability has been adequate and the company in general has ob-
served a prudent cash dividend policy. A sizable cash dividend was paid in
1967 (the first time since 1964), a decision which seemed imprudent in light
of the organizational and portfolio problems which became apparent at that
time.  However, the situation was corrected in 1968 when a stock dividend was
declared in lieu of cash, and durinig negotiations, the company has agreed
to set aside at least 40% of profits before considering a cash dividend.
ThLe soundest of the five financieras appears to be Nacional. It is
the second in resources, and loans and investments outstanding. The manage-
ment is conservative.  Its staff is competent and effective, and the quality
of its project appraisals is satisfactory. Its loan portfolio is sound and
the incidence of arrears is negligible.   Its equity investments, relatively
small in relation to the total portfolio, have been well selected and produce
a high rate of return. Nacionalls net income as percentage of average equity
has been the highest of the financieras, a fact which has enabled it to pay
cash dividends since 1963.



- 27 -
Caldas is making a signdficant contribution toward industrial
diversificatioMnin the Man'.zales region, hitherto largely confined to
coffee. As indicated earlier, it has found it difficult to retain suf-
ficient and competent staff which, to a large measure, has been respon-
sible for the poor quality of its appraisals until early 1967.   However,
management has taken steps to improve the number and quality of the staff,
and appraisals,have improved significantly during the administration of
Loan 451 CO. A considerable amount of Caldas' energies has been devoted
to promotional activities, more than that of other Colombian financieras.
One result has been that an unusually large number of its equity invest-
ment is not yet operational, and that its equity portfolio yields rela-
tively little. A high level of arrears a year ago, which has since been
brought down to a reasonable size, and other problems, persuaded the com-
pany to go a little more slowly in this regard. The presence of an IFC
director on Caldast Board has helped stimulate some of the recent improve-
ment both in Caldas' situation and in its relations with the World Bank
group. Regarding dividends, since 1966 Caldas has pursued the policy of
paying primarily stock dividends; cash dividends have been minimal.
Va'lle's performance to date has been satisfactory. It shcws the
greatest relative gain in volume of business during the period 1966-67 as
measured by increment in total assets; its growth of 84% in total assets
compares favorably with gains during the same period of 69% by Norte, 59%
by Caldas, 9i by Nacional and less than 1% by Colombiana. This impressive
increase in total business was achieved without comparable increases in
costs. One result has been the net, after-tax income, as a percentage of
average equity, was second only to Nacional's during 1967. While Valle had
the second largest proportion of equity investments in enterprises which
are not in operation, the impact on its over-all business is not serious,
since its total exposure in equities amounts to only 14% of its portfolio.
However, the quality of these investments still needs testing. The loan
portfolio is more'solid as evidenced by a sustained low volume of arrears
and negligible write-offs. In March 1967 the company declared a 12% divi-
dend; 95% of this dividend was taken in shares. In 1968, an 8% dividend
was declared. During negdtiations Valle reaffirmed its policy of allocat-
ing an appropriate portion of funds to reserves each year.
Norte is the newest and smallest of the five financieras. It
succeeded in quickly building up a well-knit staff which has resulted in
good project appraisals and follow-up procedures.   Norte's management is
sound and has followed a cautious policy with respect to equity invest-
ments. The proportion of these investments to total loan and equity port-
folios (11%) is the lowest for the financieras and, while 52% of total
equity investments by Norte was in the shares of companies promoted by
Norte itself, only 6% of its investments were in companies not yet in
operation at the end of 1967. Although the volume of arrears was low at
December 31, 1967 (1.9% of total loans then outstanding), the total value
of the loans outstanding to clients in arrears was 10% of its loan port-
folio, the highest percentage for the five financieras. While Norte's
profitability was the second lowest of the financieras during 1967, it is
expected to improve as its total volume of business increases and admini-
strative costs remain fairly constant.

Economic Impact
82.      The financieras have established their position in the Colombian
economy. They have concentrated their lending anid investment activities
in the dynamic sectors of the economy so that their importance is greater
than the volume of resources at their disposal would suggest. They have
tapped sources of capital that might not otherwise have become ava:ilable
to the Colombian economy and utilized this capital creatively in promoting
enterprises that without this timely assistance might not have been organ-
ized at all. They are serving as a conduit for transplanting modern meth-
ods of financing and of evaluatin'g financial opportunities from the indus-
trial economies in which they were developed, and in so doing they have had
an impact on the economy out of proportion to their actual size. Because
statistics are inadequate, this impact is hard to quantify. It wi:Ll become
more apparent in future years as more of the ventures promoted by -bhe finan-
cieras reach profitable operation and begin to make their own contribution
to industrial growth. The financieras estimate that up to June 1967, their
loans and investments had helped create industrial employment opportunities
for more than, 13,000 workers.
IV. UTILIZATION OF FIRST BANK LOAN
83.      The Bank Loan signed on NIay 31, 1966, became effective on
October 13, 1966. During the intervening period IFC informally received
project appraisals from the financieras and reviewed them pending the
effectiveness of the Loan and official receipt from the Banco de la Repu-
blica. The object of this work was to take advantage of the interval to
give guidan,ce in project appraisals to the staffs of the financieras and
to build upi a backlog of approved projects, so that, once the loan became
effective, it would be committed rapidly. Moreover, IFC staff visited
each of the financieras for several days, immediately after the loan was
signed, in order to discuss appraisal techniques with the staffs.  In a
larger numbcer of cases questions were raised which resulted in reappraisals
of projectsE, or their withdrawal or rejection.  These preliminary appraisals
afforded useful "dry runs" for the financieras.
84.      Projects were examined, and the proceeds of the loan credited on
a first-come-first-served basis. There was no prior allotment of -the loan
among the f'ive financieras, because it was felt that such allotment would
work to the disadvantage of the more active and efficient institutions. The
result, howrever, may have been to induce the financieras to submit projects
before they were adequately appraised, in the hope that, by doing so, funds
for them would somehow be earmarked. Certainly, the Bank staff was faced
with a flood of projects, a large portion of which (especially at first) had
to be rejected or questioned.  A total of some 74 projects were reviewed
between August 29, 1966 and September 1, 1967, some several times, as new
informatiorL or revisions were received. Some form of prior allotment among



- 29 -
the companies would have allowed them to proceed at a more deliberate pace,
and to spend more time on selecting the more desirable projects from the
large numLer of applications they received.
85.      The loan was virtually coimnited by the end of October 1967. Use of
its proceeds by the financieras is shown below as of March 31, 1968:

The only unexpected aspect of this distribution is the relatively small
amount credited to the account of Caldas, which is the third largest of the
financieras.
86.       Annex 4 shows a composite result of the utilization of the Bank
loan by size of project, 'economic activity and duration. The largest num-
ber of projects credited were for amounts between US$100,000 and U,S$250,000
but they varied in size from less -than US$50,000 to more than US$1 million.
About 68.7% of the total amount of the loan was utilized for projects of more
than US$500,000.  More than a quarter of the loan (27.4%) went to projects
in the textile and clothing sector; followed by food, beverages and tobacco
(14.1%), agriculture (10.8%0), non-metallic minerals (9,3%), chemicals (9.1%)
and metals and engineering (6.6%). This reflects the diversification of the
operations of the financieras. On the other hand, the Bank loan was used
for longer-term operations than was generally the case. Only 2.5% of the
total amount had been granted for'loans of 5 years' duration (the minimum
allowed under the Loan Contract), while 63. 5  had durations of between 5
and 10 years, and 34.6% between 10 and 15 years.  The Bank loan ulndoiibtedly
facilitated the financieras' efforts to extend the average maturities of
their loan portfolios.
1/ Projects shared by tw,o or more financieras have been counted as indi-
vidual projects for the participation of each financiera in the project.
The actual number of projects credited is 72.



- 30 -
87.       The most unusual aspect of the use of the first loan was the
speed with which it was credited. Expectations were that the financieras
would be able to commit more than $25 million in foreign exchange over a
two-year period. But commitment of the loan in 18 months, against a back-
ground of economic recession was startling.  The speed with which the Loan
was committed was the morle surprising, if one considers that the financie-
ras had thought of working capital, rather than capital to finance fixed
assets, as the most pressing need of Colombian industry and had warned
that a loan limited to financing payments for imports would not move
rapidly. Part of the explanation for the speed no doubt lies in the prepa-
rations made before the toan became effective and in the unexpecteci effect
of the first-some-first-served principle (see para. 84 above). But another
factor which must have weighed  heavily was the pricing of the capital.
The Banco de la Republica charged 3% in addition to the World Bank's inter-
est rate (a total of 9%), of whiich a large portion was designed to cover
the exchange risk. The relending rate of the financieras was supposed to
conforra to market rates, in this case the same rate charged for PIF funds,
and 12% to 14-l/2% .as cheap for financing capital imports without an
exchange risk. This fact was implicitly acknowledged in mid-1967, when
the Government, the Banco de la Republica and the financieras agreed that
8p would be an appropriate charge for covering the exchange risk under the
proposed second loan.  It is thus difficult to avoid the conclusion that
entrepreneurs might have sought to borrow from the proceeds of the Bank
loan in part at least as a hedge against inflation and devaluation with
resulting uneconomic or unnecessary investment. No amount of careful
screening of projects could completely eliminate such cases. Part:icular
care needs to be taken, in future, to assure adequate pricing in relending
the proceeds of Banlc loans.
88.       During negotiation of the first Bank loan, there was much discus-
sion of the role of the Banco de la Republica in screening projects submitted
for financing from the proceeds of the loan. It was understood that the
Banco de la Republica would limit its review to considerations of economic
priority, but would refrain ffrom looking into the projects' business merits.
However, with the worsening of the general economic and exchange situations
of Colombia, the extent of official examination was broadened. The Banco
de la Republica becam,e increasingly concerned with managing effectively the
over-all exchange resources of Colombia and occasicnally diverted projects
originally proposed for Bank financing to other sources of capital to which
no objection could be raised as lcong as price and terms were similar. Also,
the Superintendencia del Comercio Exterior, responsible for import licensing,
went deeply into the merits of individual proposals. One result was delay
in the submission of projects; another was an increasing examination of the
business aspects of projects. In judging an investment proposal, iLt is not
always easy to draw a clear line between general economic and specific
business aspects. During negotiation of the new loan, the Bank, while appre-
ciating the objective of'the Government's more careful review of the economic
aspects of projects, insisted that they steer clear of business decisions.



- 31 -
The representative of Banco de la Republica assured the Bank that, while
administrative delays occurred at first, they were in due course elimi-
nated and that the processing of sub-projects proceeded smoothly. These
views were shared by the representatives of the five financieras. In
addition, Banco de la Republica stated that it would expect the Bank
promptly to raise the question if it considered that the review of sub-
projects went beyond the limits prescribed in the loan documents.
89.       Experience with the first loan suggests that certain changes
be made in the terms of a second.
a.  The first-comie-first-served principle used in the
allocation4of Loan 451 CO would create problems
in dealing;with a loan as small as US$12.5 million.
Prior allocation among the financieras would assure
each financiera a proportion of the loan, which it
could then allocate to its projects after more delib-
erate study and careful choice of the best among them.
This matter was discussed with the financieras,
which were agreeable! to a prior allocation and, unable
to do so themselves, were prepared to accept IFC's
recommendation. IFC proposed $3.75 million each, for
Colombiana and Nacional, and an equal division of the
remaining $55.0 million among the other three finan-
cieras, a division which approximates the actual uti-
lization of the first loan. All five financieras
accepted this allocation.
b. During negotiations it was agreed that projects
exceeding the equivalent of US$254 000 would require
Bank approval for Colombiana and Nacional, and pro-
jects exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 will
need Bank approval before crediting to the loan
account for Caldas, Valle and Norte. The aggregate
total for projects not needing the Bank's approval
was agreed as follows: US$1.5 million each, for
Colombiana and Nacional, and US$750,000 each, for
the other three financieras.
c. As regards the interest rate at which the proceeds
of the loan would be lent to its ultimate benefi-
aries, the 'Government, the Banco de la Republica
and the financieras agreed in maid-1967 that the
Banco de la Republica would charge a maximum of 1%
for administration and 8/O to guarantee the exchange
risk; that the financieras would require a minimum



- 32 -
spread of 3%; finally, that the ultimate borrower
would have the option of taking the exchange risk
or of paying the 8% to have it covered. In later
discussions with the financieras they affirmed that
they could live with the 3% spread; that 8% was an
appropriate price for the exchange risk; that the
resulting total relending rate of 18-1/4% (assuming
a Bank rate of 6-1/4%), without risk of devaluation,
was not low under current conditions, would be felt
by the borrowers and would not stimulate unproduc-
tive borrowing. Nevertheless, it was felt by the
financieras 'that there was little chance any
borrower would elect to take the exchange risk at
a price 8% lower. During negotiations the repre-
sentatives of the Government and the Banco de la
Republica stated that the Government's policy was
at present that the cost to the ultimate borrower
should not be more than 18% per annum. Banco de
la Republica agreed to absorb the resulting excess
of 1/4% (assuming the present Bank rate of 6-1/4%),
by an equal reduction of the 1% maximum for admin-
istrative expenses. In case the Bank rate is
increased fiurther, the Banco de la Republica and
the Colombian Government will reconsider the pre-
sent policy w!ith a view to increasing the interest
rate to the ultimate borrower.
d. The more frequent addition of equity features to
loans made by the financieras has also been dis-
cussed with them. Doing so would enable the fi-
nancieras toabuild up a portfolio of securities
which could later be g6ld to the public, in accord-
ance with their corporate objectives. It would
also provide a' possibility for increasing the
returns to the financieras beyond the minimum 3%
they have agreed with the Government to charge
the ultimate borrower. Given the present economic
climate of the country, this would be a more pru-
dent approach to participating in the equity of
companies than the direct purchase of shares. The
financieras have agreed with this view and, more-
over, feel that, in the present environment of
capital shortage, equity features will be more
acceptable than they have been previously.  Dur-
ing negotiations the financieras agreed to change
their policy statements by stating that they would
add equity features to loans whenever possible.

V. PROSPECTS AND CREIETNURTHINESS
Prospects
90.     Annexes 5 to 9 contain detailed balance sheets and statements
of income and retained earnings for each financiera as of December 3:L, 1965,
1966 and 1967' (actual2/) and Decembeir 31, 1968 and 1969 (projected)0
91.     Projections are based on data supplied by the financieras and
revised by IEC to incorporate changes suggested at the time of negotiations.
In view of the present general economic situation, it would not be fruitful
to attempt more refined projections (detailed forecasts of demands and
resources).
92.     It is particularly difficult at this time to forecast the level
of private investment in Colombia, the corresponding demand for capital
and, thus, the prospective 'business of the financieras.  Although signifi-
cant improvements have been observed recently in the over-all investment
climate of the country, private confidence has not been fully restored yet.
This is due mainly to the fact that the Government is still shaping its
general econo:mic policy, including the implementation of a new exchange
system, the full impact of wihich is not easy to assess.
93.     The following table summarizes the projected changes in the port-
folio, as shown,in the balance sheets for the period 1968-1969, compared
with actual changes during the period 1966-1967 (in Col$ million) (decreases
are shown in parenthesis).

During the earlier period, loan and investment portfolios increased by
Col$ 306.6 million. A larger expansion of the financieras' business was
no doubt hindered in part'by shortage of funds, particularly of resources
suitable for medium- and long-term financing. While increased avail-
ability of suitable funds may be expected in the near future, the finan-
cieras' projections of loans and investments (Col$ 1,326.7 million in
1968-69, more than four times the increases registered over the period
1966-67) appear optimistic', given the continued uncertainties of the
future, the unclear prospects in the industrial sector and the volume of
funds likely to be available in the next two years.
94.       Resources are also difficult to forecast.   The following table,
however, sumnarizes the resources expected to be utilized by the five
financieras at the end of the forecast period (projected balance sheet
figures), conpared with actual resources utilized at the end of 1967

Grand Total          2,036.8       2,863.3       826.5     100
Of the total net increase in resources expected by the financieras
(Col$ 826.5 million), 70% is to come from net increases in loans, 18%
from gains in equity and the remaining 14% from increases in peso bonds
and deposits.. The main sources of new loan funds are the existing and
proposed Banlc loans, which alone represent 52% of the total increase.
1/ Amounts shown correspond to actual (December 31, 1967) and anticipated
(December 31, 1969) disbursements.   The amount of Col$ 521.8 million
shown for year-end 1969 represents 85.6% drawdown of the US$ 25
million Loan 451-C0 plus the proposed US$ 12.5 million second Bank
loan to the financieras.



- 35 -
While a significant increase in funds from the Banco de la Republica is
forecast based 'on current negotiations between this institution and the
financieras, increased funds from this source are expected to come mainly
from PIF. This anticipation is based on discussions held between the
Colombian authorities, Banco de la Republica and members of the consult-
ative group folLowing their meetings in Paris in June 1967. Discussions
have been held with Societe Generale de Banque (Belgium), Banque de Paris
et des Pays-Bas (France), Union Bank (Switzerland), Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (Italy), Bank of London and South America (United Kingdom), Banco
Urquijo (Spain), Svenska Handelsbanken (Sweden), Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (Germany) and the authorities of Japan, Denmark and the
United States., The size of bond issues will depend on the Government's
general policy toward expansion of the private sector, which at present
appears to be favorable; it is expected that flotations to finance pro-
jects in the public sector will not curtail the placing of private bond
issues.
95.       The proposed size of the Bank loan leaves little doubt of the
ability of the'financieras to put it to use in a relatively short time.
The financieras themselves have forecast the foreign exchange require-
ments of their business, after exhaustion of the first Bank loan, a-t about
us$35    million.  This estimate is based on projects at present under
study by the! financieras as well as projects to be received in the near
future. Taking into consideration the still uncertain outlook for the
replenishment of PIF and that financing under the credit lines with for-
eign commercial banks is of a short-term nature, the financieras should
be able to use long-term foreign exchange resources well in excess of
the proposedL US$ 12.5 million within the next one-and-a-half year period.
Creditworthiness
96.       As; indicated in Para. 81, the financieras have performed credit-
ably: their loans and equity portfolios are, in general, of a satisfac-
tory quality and protected by equity; their profitability record is
acceptable, particularly considering recent adverse economic circumstances,
and when compared with those of other development finance companies which
the World Bank group has helped to finance.
97.       The financieras' prospects of business appear favorable.  Their
total debt-to-equity ratios which, up to December 31, 1967, have remained
low, are projected to remain, with the exception of Norte and Valle,
within the :Limits provided in their statements of policy. Norte shows pro-
jected tota:L indebtedness of 4.1 to 1 in 1969 and Valle of 4.1 to 1 in 1968
and 4.6 to L in 1969. Both these financieras should be able to manage
their affairs'in such a manner as to conform to their contractual debt
limitations. Profitability of the five financieras also is expected to
increase satisfactorily. At the end of 1969, pretax profit as a percentage
of average equity will have increased as follows:



- 36 -
1967          1969
For Colombiana -          from    11.3    to    1h.8
For Nacional   -          from    17.1    to    17.7
For Caldas     -          from    12.1    to    14.8
For Valle      -          from    19.7    to    31.7
For Norte      -          from    13.4    to    19.h
Although the financieras' own estimates of future business may be on the
optimistic side, the projected interest coverage appears ample, as shown
in the followjing table:

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOM0ITENDATIONS
98.       The performance of the five financieras has been generally
satisfactory. The quality of their work has shown steady improvement.
They are playring an increasingly important role in the industrial develop-
ment of Colombia as sources of medium- and long-term capital, as promoters
of new enterprises and as disseminators of modern methods of financial
management; lihey have made a substantial impact on industrial development.
Their appraisal methods have improved steadily, particularly during the
period of conmmitment of thb Bank loan. Their profits are good, the
results of seizing every opportunity for useful revenue-earning business.
But rates of profitability have faiLed to keep ahead of the cost-of-
living and of deterioration of the peso; the shares of the financieras
are thus relatively unattractive both to Colombian and foreign investors.
99.       The financieras have been adversely affected by Colombia's
foreign exchange crisis and by credit restrictions and other actions
designed to strengthen Colombia's economic situation. This has reoulted,
in the case of some financieras, in clients in trouble, lower profits on
equity investments and a generally more difficult investment environment.
The impact has differed, depending on policies and portfolio. In general,
the companies most heavily invested in equities are the most seriously
affectecd. Despite these adverse fac:tors all the financieras are basically
creditworthy, taking into account thie weaknesses in their portfolios com-
pared with their equity and their earning power.



- 37 -
100.      Much of the difficulty of the financieras stems from their
vigor in promotion (one of their principal objectives), and the fact
that their main investments are in new companies which they have promoted.
In Colombia's environment, promotion means equity investment, and that
means being locked, for a significant period of time, into enterprises
which are not earning.
101.      The environment in which the financieras operate has changed.
Apart from the general economic and financial problems of the country,
the number of financieras has grown and they face the prospects of com-
petition from a revitalized government-owned development finance company.
102.      The financieras', prospects depend partly on the Goverrment's
general economic policy and particularly on its success in holding down
the rate of inflation. Measures taken over the past year reflect a
determined effort to deal with inflation and to bring the balance of
payments under control, and have achieved some success. Business confi-
dence appears improved.  Nevertheless, it is impossible to predict with
assurance the volume of business the financieras could do in the near
future, even if their resources were unlimited.
103.      Although business forecasts cannot be accurately made, the
financieras couild certainty commit foreign exchange resources in the
coming year in excess of the US$ 12.5 million that the Bank contemplates
lending at this time.
lO.      The financieras are suitable recipients for a new Bank loan.
Such a loan would help ensure continued improvement of their operations
and help strengthen their role in the economic development of Colombia.
105.      The loan would be made to Banco de la Republica.   Its proceeds
would be made available to the five Colombian financieras which were
recipients of the first loan for use in accordance with their statutes
and stated policies.
106.      The loan would have, in general, terms and conditions similar
to the first, except in the following respects:
(a) The interest rate and amortization schedule would be
flexible, as in the case of other loans to development
finance companies.
(b) The loan would be allocated in advance among the five
financieras., During negotiations, allocation was agreed
as follows: 30% for each, Colombiana and Nacional, and
13-1/3% for each, Caldas, Valle and Norte.
(c) As already agreed between the Banco de la Republica and
the financieras, Banco de la Republica would charge the
financieras interest at a rate equal to the sum of the
rate applicable to the Bank loan plus a maximum of 1%



- 38 -
to cover administrative costs. The financieras would
charge the ulltimate borrower a minimum of 3% p.a. to
cover their costs, risks and profits. Borrowers woulcd
have the option of taking the exchange risk; if they
did not wish to take it, the Banco de la Republica
would do so at a cost of 8%.
(d) The limit for projects not needing the Bank's prior
approval would be set as follows:   US$ 250,000 each,
for Colombiana and Nacional, to an aggregate total of
Us$ 1.5 million each; US$ 100,000 for the other
financieras, to an aggregate total of US$ 750,000 each.
107.      Agreements were reached during negotiations with the repre-
sentatives of Banco de la Republica and the financieras on the following
matters:
(a) The financieras agreed to add equity features to their
loans whenever possible.
(b) The Government and Banco de la Republica will continue
to restrict their review of sub-projects to matters of
economic priority. In case that interferences or delays
are observed during commitment of the loan, the matter
will be promptly called to the attention of the Government.
(c) The financieras agreed on strengthening their engineering
and follow-up services and their market analysis.
(d) The financieras will give particular attention to whether
their clients have adequate supplies of working capital
and of the peso requirements of their investment projects.

ANNEX 2-
Page 1
SUI-iARY OF THE STATEMENTS OF POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES OF THE FIVE FINANCIERAS
1.        As stated in paragraph 59 of the report, the statements of
operating policies for the five financieras contain most of the ele-
ments guiding the affairs of private development finance companies.
2.        The main provisions may be summarized as follows:
(1)  The corporations will invest principally in
manufacturiing enterprises although not to the
exclusion of agriculture, cattle raising, min-
ing, transportation, hotel and tourist enter-
prises and others authorized by Colombian leg-
islation. Except Valle the other four finan-
cieras are excluded from being engaged in real
estate or housing operations.
(2) The corporations will use a progressively larger
proportion of their resources for equity invest-
ments and,for loans with final maturity of five
years or more, especially loans with equity fea-
tures.
(3) The corporations will finance, invest in or guar-
antee operations only of privately controlled enter-
prises. In the case of Norte, as an exception, the
corporatioh will finance, invest or guarantee opera-
tions on enterprises in which the Government has a
controlling interest if the result of such actions
facilitates private sector production. For such
cases, a unanimous vote of the Board is required.
(4)  The corporations will conduct their operati ons so
as to assist in the growth on the capital market
in Colombia and to improve facilities for market-
ing shares and securities.
(5) The corporations will pursue a prudent dividend
policy that will enable them to provide sharehold-
ers with an adequate return of their investments,
while at the same ti:ie ensuring that their reserves
grow at a reasonable rate. The corporations will
annually appropriate a portion of their net income
to reserves.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(6)  Colombiana and Nacional will not incur, assume or
guarantee any debt if at the time, or as a result
thereof, the total amount of debt incurred, assumed
or guaranteed by the corporations and then outstand-
ing, exceeds an amount equal to five times the aggre-
gate of the corporations' equity. For Caldas, Norte
and Valle the amount of debt incurred, assumed or
guaranteed is limited to four times the aggregate of
the corporations' equity.
(7)  Barring exceptional. circumstances or circumstances
of a temporary nature, the corporations' equity par-
ticipation in an individual enterprise will not be
so great as to give it primary responsibility for
management of the enterprise. This means that the
corporations' participation will normally not exceed
25% of the enterprise4s subscribed capital.
(8)  The total amount of the corporations' equity invest-
ments will not exceed the value of the corporations'
net worth.
(9) The maturities of the corporations' assets will cor-
respond with or be shorter than the maturities of
its liabilities.
(10) The corporations wi.ll protect themselves adequately
against foreign exchange risks arising out of their
operations.
(11) The corporations will place constant emphasis on
enhancing and strengthening technical, commercial
and financial managements of enterprises that they
finance by furnishing them the advice and assistance
either of,their owm staff or suitably qualified con--
sultants or experts.
(12)' The corporations will build and strengthen their
managements and staffs so as to achieve well-
balanced 6rganizations capable of assuring proper
appraisal of projects, as well as proper follow-up
after loans and equity investments have been made.
These staffs will include specialists in engineering
and in financial and economic analysis.
(13) The corporations will retain independent public
accountants to conduct an annual audit of their bools
and accounts.



kNNEX 2
Page 3
(14)  In the case of Caldas, Colombiana and Nacional,
the corporations' managements will submit to
the Boards' of Directors monthly reports includ-
ing (a) investigation of new projects; (b) pro-
gress of investments already made; (c) financial
statements'; (d) arrears; (e) other matters of
