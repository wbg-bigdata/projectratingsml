                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An implementation supervision mission took place from April 2-16, 2013, and overlapped with the visit of Environmental & Social Advisory Panel (ESAP) during the same period. The
                         primary purpose of the mission was to take stock of the ongoing activities, and support the speedy completion before the project closing date of June 30, 2013. Following is the
                         status of different activities, in accordance with the Components under the restructured Project:

                         Component-A: Environmental Management and Social Mitigation:

                         1. Bumbuna Watershed Management Authority (BWMA) /Environment: BWMA has been performing its functions for about two years. It has full-time key professionals, and is
                         engaged in: (a) biodiversity studies; (b) Geographical Information System (GIS) training; (c) agricultural development; (d) community liaison and social development; (e) water quality

                         testing and fisheries assessment; and (f) eco-tourism. Options for long term sustainable funding of BWMA are being explored, but without any concrete results.

                         2. Loma Mountains National Park (LMNP) as environmental offset: LMNP was proclaimed a National Park in December 2012, but the parliamentary approval is still pending. The
                         following activities have been completed so far: (a) staff posted and trained; (b) equipment and materials provided; (iii) consultations on the Park boundary completed, boundary re-
                         surveyed and physically demarcated; (iv) Reserve Settlement Courts Sittings completed; (v) a Process Framework, including a socio-economic baseline study, completed; (vi) a
                         LMNP Management Plan (MP) developed; and (vii) a provisional budget for the five-year period developed. Civil works are underway, and activities relating to disclosure of the
                         LMNP Management Plan, introduction of farmer field schools, basic eco-tourism, and a desk review of existing biodiversity studies will be completed by June 2013.

                         3. Bumbuna Trust for funding safety, environmental and social mitigation actions: The Bumbuna Trust Deed is still with the Attorney General’s office for comments, and there is no
                         certainty regarding its establishment or potential funding by the Government of Sierra Leone.

                         4. Reservoir and Dam Safety Compliance: All the siren equipment (except the antennas - being airlifted) has arrived in Freetown and is awaiting customs clearance. Foundation
                         works for all 27 sites have been completed, but residual activities remain. Installation and commissioning of sirens is now on the critical path. A simulation exercise involving Project
                         Management Unit (PMU), Emergency Action Unit (EAU) and Office of National Security (ONS) is planned after the installation of sirens. The EAU continues to perform its functions
                         satisfactorily. Implementation of safety protocol and handling of dam-related emergency (abnormal water releases) by Salini has not been fully compliant with international practice in
                         the past, and environmental bypass has not been opened on some occasions during unplanned opening of turbines. Salini's O&M contract runs out in May 2013, and a new
                         arrangement is envisaged after May 2013.

                         5. Social Mitigation: Implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the dam, reservoir area, and 161 kv transmission line is almost completed, and draft RAP completion
                         reports are being finalized. Demolition of 17 buildings standing under the T-Line for which compensation has been paid, needs to be done in coordination with relevant entities such
                         as traditional authorities, the police, and others. Livelihood restoration activities to T-Line Project-affected Persons (PAPs) are underway, and anticipated to close by end-June, 2013.
                         A Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) is in place and complaints from communities in the dam/reservoir area and along the T-Line are being received and redressed.
                         Collaboration with National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) on Safety is continuing, and six community centers to support disaster risk management at the community level
                         and access infrastructure is completed. Supply of electricity to Bumbuna Town (to community level infrastructure, including schools, health centers, and streetlights) as 'benefits-
                         sharing' is continuing.

                         Component-B: Community Growth Poles

                         1. Electricity to Bumbuna Town is being continuously supplied after its restoration on December 7, 2011 (barring periods of maintenance / breakdown).
                         2. All social infrastructure (Health Center, Police Station, etc.) has been connected to the electricity network.
                         3. Mobilization of community labor through CfW and Food-for-Work (FfW) addressing gap in youth and women employment has been undertaken.

                         2. Work plans for the EAU, BWMA and PMU field staff have been developed for up to June 30, 2013.
