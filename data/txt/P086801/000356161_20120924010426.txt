 SIERRA LEONE BUMBUNA HYDROELECTRIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
                     MANAGEMENT PROJECT

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER



1. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to introduce changes to
   the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental and Social Management Project (BHP: P086801,
   approved in 2005 – the Project) for the Republic of Sierra Leone, as follows: (a) reallocate
   the proceeds of the IDA H6250 Grant – Development (GRTD) among different expenditure
   Categories to enable completion of outstanding activities; and (b) extend the Project Closing
   Date by nine (9) months from September 30, 2012, to June 30, 2013.
2. The proposed restructuring will affect neither Project Outcomes nor Project Development
   Objectives. The Project’s scope and output will remain unchanged.




3. The Bumbuna dam is located approximately 200 km from Freetown on the Seli River. It is
   designed to generate 50MW of electricity, and is connected to Freetown through a 200 km
   long high voltage (161 kV) transmission line (T-line). On June 16, 2005, the Board approved
   the Project, which consisted of a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) of up to US$38 million and a
   US$12.5 million IDA Grant (H170-SL). The PRG (under component A in the PAD) was
   designed to support a commercial loan whose proceeds would be used to cover some of
   Bumbuna's construction costs. The IDA Grant (under components B and C) was designed to
   support the implementation of environmental and social safeguard activities directly related
   to the construction of the dam, to facilitate impoundment of the reservoir, and to rehabilitate
   the Bumbuna-to-Freetown T-Line.
4. After approval of the Project, the IDA team engaged Bumbuna's construction contractor and
   the contractor's commercial bank in protracted negotiations to implement the PRG.
   However, when these negotiations failed to yield a commercial loan on acceptable terms, the
   Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) was able to mobilize over US$55 million in alternative
   donor funding to cover the remaining costs of completing the dam. As a result, in April
   2007, the Sierra Leone Minister of Finance requested cancellation of the PRG.
5. As part of the first restructuring undertaken in 2010, the PRG and associated activities were
   canceled, dropping dam construction activities previously planned under Component A. The
   PRG was supported by a financial amount of up to US$9.5 million, which was also
   reallocated to the IDA Grant to cover a funding gap in the implementation of critical
   safeguard activities under Components B and C. The restructuring also amended the Project
   Development Objective and associated indicators to reflect these changes, and extended the
   Project closing date by 24 months from September 30, 2010, to September 30, 2012, to
   complete the remaining Project activities under Components B and C.

6. The current restructured project is a US$22.0 million (SDR 14.6 million; original SDR 8.3m
   and additional SDR 6.3m) SIL. The Project Development Objective is to assist the recipient
   in satisfactorily addressing and mitigating the environmental and social impacts in the Project
   Area associated with the completion and initial operation of the Bumbuna hydroelectric dam
   and transmission line. The restructured project has the following components:
           a. Component A – Environmental Management and Social Mitigation:
               1. Carrying out of the environmental and social safeguard measures specified in
                  the Environmental and Social Management Plan, including: (i) establishment
                  and initial operation of the BWMA and implementation of the BWMP; (ii)
                  implementation of the Emergency Preparedness Plan; (iii) establishment and
                  initial operation of Loma mountains national park including the preparation
                  and implementation of the Process Framework for Loma mountains; and (iv)
                  establishment and initial operation of the Bumbuna Trust.
               2. Carrying out of the measures specified in: (i) the Dam and Reservoir
                  Resettlement Action Plan, including the Livelihood Assessment and Income
                  Restoration Program and the Stabilized Agriculture Program; and (ii) the
                  Transmission Line Resettlement Action Plan.
           b. Component B - Community Growth Poles:
               Carrying out of a community development program designed to ensure that
               eligible communities around the Bumbuna reservoir area share in the benefits of
               the Bumbuna hydroelectric dam in a sustainable manner, through carrying out of
               selected Subprojects for improved public services and infrastructure identified by
               eligible communities.
           c. Component C - Project Management, Communication, Monitoring and
              Evaluation:
               1.    Day-to-day administration, procurement, financial management, monitoring
                    and evaluation of the Project.
               2. Provision of technical and logistical assistance to the Dam Safety Review
                  Panel and the Environmental and Social Advisory Panel for the carrying out
                  of their functions related to the Project.
               3. Implementation of the Communication Action Plan.


7. All civil works on the dam, powerhouse and ancillary facilities, including remedial works
   have been successfully completed and the high voltage T-line between Bumbuna and
   Freetown is operational. The dam became operational on November 6, 2009, and has since
   delivered an average of 18 to 20 MW of power to the Bumbuna Sub-Station in Freetown and
   to Makeni since March 2012. While more power is available in Bumbuna during the peak
   water-availability months, limitations in the Freetown distribution network impose a
   constraint in delivering more than 33 MW at the present time.


                                                2
8. Implementation progress on the environmental and social management components of the
   project has been picking up in recent months and the following key achievements have been
   made: (i) BWMA is operational and most of its planned activities are expected to be
   completed by October 2012; (ii) establishment and initial operation of the environmental
   offset (Loma Mountains National Park) is anticipated by November 2012; (iii)
   implementation of the Emergency Preparedness Plan and establishment of the Emergency
   Action Unit is completed; however, the installation of sirens and conduct of safety drills in
   the downstream area are significantly delayed and not likely to be completed before February
   2013; (iv) establishment of Bumbuna Trust is expected by end-September 2012, but concerns
   persist regarding sustainable financing - option regarding financing by other donors is being
   explored; (v) Dam and Reservoir RAP satisfactorily completed, and T-line RAP
   implementation will be completed by November 2012; (vi) completion of the LAIR and SAP
   programs is in an advanced stage and the remaining schemes will be completed by end-
   September 2012; and (vii) community growth poles have been completed (with the exception
   of housing for the Chiefs), and Technical Assistance and capacity-building activities are on
   track. Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) made its final visit in July 2011 and found the dam
   to be safe after completion of remedial works. A final visit by the Environmental and Social
   Advisory Panel (ESAP) has been scheduled by GoSL in early-2013.
9. While most of the remaining activities are expected to be completed by year-end, installation,
   commissioning, and testing of sirens (being installed in accordance with the advice of DSRP)
   is expected to take place by February 2013. Two other factors that need to be considered: (a)
   due to delays in completing the procurement processes, civil works for sirens are taking place
   in the rainy season (July-October 2012), thus further delays could be anticipated; and (b)
   Sierra Leone is entering the national elections (November 17, 2012).
10. Based on the latest Implementation Status and Results (ISR) Report, implementation
    progress is rated moderately satisfactory, especially because of two important
    considerations: (a) inadequacy and absence of sustainable financing mechanism for
    undertaking safety, environmental and social management activities in Bumbuna on an
    ongoing basis; and (b) delays in the completion of the installation, commissioning and testing
    of sirens, including safety drills.




11. The proposed restructuring will affect neither Project Outcomes nor Project Development
    Objectives and the Project's scope, results framework and outputs will remain unchanged.
    The proposed restructuring is comprised of two changes: (a) reallocation of Additional Grant
    Resources (H6250-SL) of SDR 6.3 million among different expenditure categories to allow
    for the supply, installation, commissioning and testing of sirens, which was not envisaged in
    2010; and (b) extension of the Project Closing Date by nine (9) months from September 30,
    2012, to June 30, 2013 to allow for the remaining activities to be completed. Further, the
    extension of the Project Closing Date will also allow the Bank to engage with the
    Government of Sierra Leone to discuss and agree on a sustainable mechanism under the
    broader energy-sector dialogue to finance the Bumbuna safety, environmental and social
    management measures.
                                                3
12. The status of disbursement under different expenditure Categories on September 11, 2012 is
    given in Table 1. The contracted price for civil works for the sirens is US$621,022; and for
    the supply and installation of sirens is Euro 545,418 (US$760,095), which is in excess of the
    undisbursed balances for Goods and Works (Categories 1 and 2). On the other hand,
    efficiencies have been made in engaging consulting services, training, and community grants,
    and in the operating cost of the project (Categories 3, 4, 5 and 6). The Unallocated amount
    also needs to be suitably re-allocated according to the requirements for Goods and Works.

13. It is proposed to reallocate resources among different Expenditure Categories to allow the
    civil works for the sirens to be completed and to enable the procurement, installation,
    commissioning and testing of the sirens. The reallocation will ensure that existing resources
    are used more optimally without any impact on the project development outcomes. At the
    present time there is no need for additional resources.
14. The existing and proposed allocations are provided in Table 2, both in US$ and XDR (as of
    11th September, 2012). It should be noted that the exact re-allocation would be dependent on
    the exchange rate on the date of re-allocation:

15. Because of significant delays in the civil works for the sirens and establishment of the
    environment offset in Loma Mountains, activities are likely to spill over the third quarter of
    the current fiscal year (end-February 2012). These include procurement, installation,
    commissioning and testing of sirens, conducting safety drills and completion of the initial
    set-up and operation of the Loma Mountains National Park (LMNP). In both cases, there is
    considerable uncertainty on account of the advent of the rainy season, and the oncoming
    national elections in Sierra Leone on November 17, 2012. While all efforts would be made to
    complete the remaining activities as expeditiously as possible, it is prudent to budget a little
    bit of cushion in setting the new project Closing Date. Ministry of Finance and Economic
    Development, on behalf of the implementing agency, has requested an extension in the
    Closing Date by nine months.
16. It is proposed to establish the new Closing Date for the Project from the current date of
    September 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The proposed extension confirms that: (i) the PDO
    continues to be achievable, (ii) performance of counterparts is satisfactory and (iii) the
    government has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the
    project. There are no overdue audit reports or IFRs. FM risk rating is “Moderate? and FM
    ISR rating is “Satisfactory?. The Project remains compliant with safeguards policies and the
    counterpart implementing agency and local partners are currently finalizing implementation
    of the Environment and Social Management Plan (ESMP).1


17. No changes have been made in the results framework, and the existing arrangements for
    results monitoring and implementation progress are provided in Annexes 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D
    for information only. New targets have, however, been included to account for the revised
    Closing Date.

    The ESMP was updated prior to the first restructuring in 2010. This revised ESMP was disclosed in country and in
     the Bank’s InfoShop. Following good practice, a second update of the ESMP will be completed to include the
     activities in the LMNP and completion of RAP implementation.
