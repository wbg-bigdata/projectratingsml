                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With the extension of the project closing date to June 30, 2013, a technical visit was undertaken to review progress on the project. Following is the status of different activities:

                         1. Dam Safety: The Team visited some of the 14 sites under construction for the siren tower base and noted significant progress. Balance civil works would be completed once the

                         siren equipment is received and installed. There have been significant delays in the receipt of the siren equipment from the suppliers because of the inability of PMU to establish the
                         Letter of Credit (this was first due to restrictions in the Disbursement Letter; secondly due to the closing date of Sep 30, 2012 - this has now been extended till June 30, 2013; and
                         thirdly on account of protracted process with MoFED and AG Office). These issues are being resolved to expedite the delivery of the equipment at Bumbuna-site.. Also, it was noted
                         that discussions on a simulation exercise, once the sirens are installed, have not started. The PMU was asked by the Team to initiate the consultations with the Office of National

                         Security (ONS). In this connection, the PMU was informed about the GFDRR grant to ONS where provisions for such simulation exercises and relevant training and capacity building
                         programs could be organized.

                         2. BWMA/Environment: The following activities were reported by BWMA staff in Bumbuna:
                         - monitoring of biomass inside the reservoir is done on a daily basis (by five laborers who collect the pile of biomass debris and assemble them into bundles); BWMA will remove the
                         bundles from the shoreline. It is important to note that the volume of debris has declined during the year;
                         safe navigation channel in the reservoir has not yet been established and a low-cost, practical flotation device (like plastic bottles and rope) will be installed. This is important to avoid
                         accidents, similar to the one reported in the Waia area; BWMA will conduct a full investigation of the accident and submit a safety program, in addition to the demarcation of a safety
                         zone;
                         - water quality baseline, is generally established using four tests, which are to be completed per year to monitor reservoir water quality, but the BOD/COD profiles remain incomplete
                         due to delays in procurement of necessary chemicals and laboratory instruments;
                         fisheries assessment is ongoing, with initial surveys indicating that some 110 fishermen use the reservoir’s landing sites (which were cleared by BWMA);
                         - health assessment report is about to be completed; reported cases of increased incidence of malaria and other water borne diseases due to growth in population of black flies;
                         Ministry of Health (MoH) surveys established the health baseline, including seasonal incidence rates. The MoH field team also proposed prophylactic measures which have been
                         coordinated with the Life Skills Training and Sensitization campaigns under the Livelihood Assessment and Income Restoration (LAIR) program; and
                         - tree planning in the Bumbuna Conservation Area (BCA) has started in sections along the shoreline. Some 10,000 tree seedlings are in the tree nursery in Kasasi and by end-
                         October, 5,000 of these seedlings will be transplanted at various sections of the BCA.

                         3. Loma Mountains National Park (LMNP): The Department of Forestry (DoF) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Forestry (MAFFS) organizes a monthly coordination
                         meeting for LMNP. The Team participated in one of these meetings and noted that:
                         For LMNP boundary demarcation, there are 18 pillars that have to be constructed to complete the fence around the LMNP, which will be completed under the same cash-for-work
                         (CfW) arrangement with local women’s groups;
                         Tree planting of non-invasive species will commence in mid-October 2012 and the DoF will prepare a “tree maintenance plan? that maximizes community participation since these
                         would be productive trees that women’s groups, for example, can use as additional in come source) ;
                         Gazettement publication related to declaration of the LMNP is on track;
                         Civil works: office block, guards quarters and road/trail repairs will be started by end-October; and
                         LMNP Management Plan has been approved and disclosed, and in this connection, the social development consultant will organize the consultations and sensitization campaign to
                         discuss the Plan with local communities and other stakeholders.

                         4. Dam/Reservoir RAP: A draft of the Dam/Reservoir RAP Completion Report is under review and expected to be approved for disclosure by end-January 2013. The Report includes
                         the results of the shoreline resurvey and implementation progress of the Stabilized Agriculture Program (SAP) and LAIR.

                         5. T-Line RAP: The T-Line RAP was updated to reflect the critical segments along the T-Line, which comprise about 1.5 km of densely populated segments along the network. These
                         lie mainly in the Freetown and Makeni areas. There are 92 structures within the 30 m width of the right-of-way (RoW), but only 4 structures are within the 7 m allowed vertical
                         clearance from the lowest conductor. There are 3 houses in Freetown that are in the RoW, one of which has a wall or fence that is close to the T-Line and which has since been
                         demolished. In Madif village, the local leader said that some sacred sites were affected; in Safroko Chiefdom, there were 2 villages that complained that agricultural crops were
                         destroyed during the construction of an access road to the T-Line. The compensation payments for all project affected persons (PAPs) will be completed by end-October 2012.
