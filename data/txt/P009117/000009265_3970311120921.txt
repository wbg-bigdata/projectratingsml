MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO TIIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO UKRAINE
FOR A SEED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Ukraine for the equivalent of US $32.00 million to help finance a seed development
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years,
including five years of grace. About 75 % of the proceeds of the loan would be passed on to three private
seed processing enterprises for up to eleven years, including a maximum four years grace, at interest of
4.30 percentage points above the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Country/Sector Background
2.             With a land area of 0.6 million kM2 and a population of 52 million, Ukraine is the
second largest country in Europe (after the Russian Federation) in total area, and the fifth largest in terms
of population. GNP per capita was estimated at US $1,912 for 1993 down from US $2,635 in 1991.
3.           Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. It now faces
the immense challenge of creating the institutions of a sovereign state, and at the saene time securing the
transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. Until recently, efforts at stabilization and
structural reform had been piecemeal; under the newly elected government, Ukraine's first comprehensive
reforn program has been formulated in an attempt to restore macroeconomic stability and to restructure
the economy, including the transformation of the land tenure and enterprise structure in agriculture.
4.           In October 1994, the Ukrainian President announced Ukraine's first comprehensive
economic reforn program which has stabilization and structural reformn aspects. The stabilization
measures aim at bringing about a reduction in inufation by implementing tight fiscal and monetary
policies. The structural reform measures focus on promoting enterprise restructuring and competition by
removing the inhibiting role of the state towards the private sector and letting markets function by
transforming state enterprises into commercial entities, and by hardening the budget constraint on
enterprises. Specific reform measures include the lifting of most price controls, the unification of the
exchange rate, the elimination of most export quotas, the sharp reduction of subsidies on bread and public
utilities, the adjustment of imported energy prices to full cost recovery levels, as well as the
implementation of a targeted social safety net. The implementation of these reform measures is creating
a conducive environment for implementing reforms and privatization in the agriculltural and food sectors.
5.           Agriculture has historically been a significant sector in the diversified Ukrainian economy,
wbich also has a large industrial sector and a relatively small service sector. Agriculture contributes about
30% to Net Material Product (NMP), employs some 20% of the labor force, and provides for
approximately 30% to Ukraine's total merchandise trade. Given the country's abundant and fertile land
resources, agriculture should continue to play an important role in the country's economic development.
6.           Although agricultural production grew until the late 1980's at an average rate of about
2% per annum, factor productivities remained low, despite operating on some of the best land resources
within a temperate climate. Crop yields and conversion factors in the livestock industry are 25-50%
lower than in countries with comparable resource endowments. Inefficiencies in the system of central
economic management and collective agriculture, along with an increasingly outdated production



-2-
tuchnologies anid low-qualitv inputs - including seeds - and a poorly performing agricultural marketing
and processing system, prevented the sector from realizing its high potential.
7.            Ukraine has a long tradition in plant breeding and in supplying improved germplasmn to
Western and Eastern Europe. Prior to World War 1, most West European seed breeders operated in
Ukrainc because the dry weather at harvest time helped produce seeds of superior quality as compared
witlh those in Western Europe. After 1917, Western involvement in Ukrainian seed production came to
an end, and exports were confined to the republics of the Soviet Union, for which Ukraine became a
major supplier of germplasm and foundation seeds,' especially for maize and sugarbeet seeds, and to a
lesser cxtent for sunflower seeds. With the mounting economic difficulties since independence, plant
breeding suffered significantly, the production of quality seed declined, and with it the capacity to
maintain the level of crop production and exports of grains and seeds.
Proiect Objectives
8.            The principal objective of the project is to raise agricultural productivity and agricultural
export earnings by improving the national seed system's capacity to produce high quality seed efficiently.
In the short-term, the project aims at arresting the decline in domestic availability and exports of quality
seed by supporting the establishment of private production of high quality commercial seed on the basis
of domestic and imported germplasm. The project would facilitate the development of a competitive seed
system in the medium term, by demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of private seed production,
by improving the regulatorv framework for the seed system, and by assisting in the establishment of an
efficient system for germplasm maintenance and plant breeding. With the liberalization of pricing,
marketing, and exports (recently agreed with the Bank under the Ukraine Rehabilitation Loan), domestic
seed prices are expected to rise substantially over the medium term to reflect the contribution of quality
seed to crop yields, thereby allowing seed production and processing to become a financially self-
sustaining activity. The participating seed enterprises will also bolster their viability by exporting sizeable
shares of their output, mainly to FSU markets vwhere Ukraine has demonstrated ability to sell hybrid seed.
Proiect Descridtion
9.            To meet the project's short term objective, the project would provide financial and
technical assistance for: (a) the development of three private enterprises specializing in the multiplication
of domestic and imported hybrid seed for maize, sunflower, sugarbeet, and their processing and
marketing; and (b) the germplasm maintenance and development for three leading domestic suppliers of
hybrid maize, sunflower and sugarbeet germplasm. To help meet the project's medium term objective
of developing a competitive seed system, the project would provide financial and technical assistance for:
(a) improving the regulatory framework for the seed system; and (b) the development of an agricultural
research strategy and plan. In addition to these specific interventions in the seed system, the liberalization
of seed pricing, marketing, and trade, and the establishment of private seed production, implemented
within the context of the project, would enhiance the efficiency of the national seed system. To facilitate
efficient project implementation, the project would also support a Project Managemen: Unit (PMU) which
would report to a Project Steering Committee (PSC). The geographical location oL the proposed
investments are indicated in the attached map.
I      Foundati(on seed is the seed population used to produce the seeds planted by the fanner (commercial
seeds). Foundation seed is also known as parent seed, basic seed, or elite seed.



-3-
Project Implementation
10.          The project's principal component is hybrid seed production, which would be
implemented by three newly established private joint stock companies specializing in the production,
processing, and marketing of hybrid maize, sunflower, and sugarbeet seed.  Implementation of this
component would be monitored by the Ukraine Export-Import Bank (UkrExlmBank)), which would act
as the financial agent of the Government. UkrExlmBank would also monitor the accounting, financial,
and managerial performance of the three seed enterprises.
11.          The PMU, legally part of the Ministry of Finance, would be responsible for: (a) liaising
between the implementing agencies, the Government, and the Bank; (b) ensuring compliance with World
Bank requirements for reporting on implementation progress, financial control, and monitoring of project
impact; (c) determining eligibility of disbursements for project and loan funds; (d) providing assistance
to the implementing entities in matters of procurement and disbursements; and (e) administering the
proj_:ct's technical assistance and training component.
12.          The PMU is headed by a project manager who is supported by one assistant, one
administrative staff, and will have suitably qualified technical assistance for a total of It person-months.
The Bank has agreed on the qualifications and terms of reference for this technical assistance. The
project manager reports to a Project Steering Committee (PSC), composed of representatives of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOAF), the Ukrainian Academy of
Agricultural Sciences (UAAS). UkrExlmBank (as the Borrower's financial agent, Bank Ukraina (as the
principal supplier of working capital), and representatives of the Board of Directors of each of the three
seed enterprises. The Steerinlg Committee is chaired by a Deputy Minister of Finance.
13.          The shareholders of the new companies are private individuals, privatized collective
farms, private Ukrainian firms, and public entities involved in the seed industry. Agreement has been
reached with the Governmmnt that public entities would not hold more than 49% of the shares in each of
the companies. Statutes, shareholders agreements and feasibility studies have been prepared for all three
participating seed enterprises, and these enterprises have been legally registered. They will enter into
subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with the Ministry of Finance, as representative of
the Borrower. Foreign companies are expected to become shareholders in these companies. The
contributions of these prospective foreign partners to the companies' share capital, estimated at the
equivalent of about US $500,000 each, would cover part of the companies' working capi.al needs.
14.          The improvements in the regulatory framework for the seed industry supported by the
project would be the responsibility of the corresponding regulatory agencies of the MOAF, the State
Comrnission for Seed Quality Control (SCSQC), and the State Commission for Testing and Protection
of Plant Varieties (SCTPPV). These components would be supervised by the MOAF.
15.          The germplasm maintenance program, including the proposed review of the agricultural
research system, would be the responsibility of the UAAS, which would be supported by suitably
qualified consultants with terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Sustainability
16.          The project design includes three crucial aspects which provide for institutional, financial,
and economic sustainability of the project. First, the Government of Ukraine agreed to liberalize the
pricing, domestic m-;rketing, and foreign trade regimes regulating the three hybrid seed types covered
by the project. These policy reform measures facilitate the development of commercial seed production



-4-
by private enterprises and provide sufficient incentives for state-owned seed enterprises to reEtructure
themselves along commercial lines. This lays the groundwork for an efficient, competitive seed sector
in Ukraine. Secondly, the beneficiary seed enterprises under the project are all majority privately owned
and therefore adequately motivated to pursue financially viable production and marketing activities. This
will enable the enterprises to pay back the sub-loans to the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the
substantial tax revenue collected from the enterprise profits will be more than enough to finance the quasi-
budgetary outlays by public sector seed agencies and institutes under the project. Thirdly, by improving
the seed system's regulatory framework, seed quality, and potential for productivity increases, the project
yields high economic returns. By increasing crop yields through improved seeds, growth in the
agricultural sector would be achieved in an environmentally sustainable way.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvrement
17.          So far, Bank lending to Ukraine has ben confined to an institution-building loan, a
rehabilitation loan, and a hydropower rehabilitation loan Accordingly, there is only limited country and
sector-specific implementation experience on the Bank side and no exposure of the Ukrainian institutions
to the specific procedures governing the implementation of Bank investment operations. These factors are
reflected in the modest scope of the proposed project, the introduction of a PMU and the provision of
technical assistance to the implementing agencies, as well as to the PMU. The mutual lack of experience
in working with each other may require a supervision intensity exceeding standard Bank allocations.
&8.          The Bank's experience worldwide with seed development projects suggest that:
(a) interventions should embrace the whole seed system and be oriented towards long-term
growth as opposed to short-term, ad hoc involvement;
(b) seed sector policies should be conducive to the development of a self-sustaining seed industry
and the active participation of the private sector;
(c) the linkages between the seed system and agricultural research need to be reinforced;
(d) free-standing seed projects outperformed interventions based on a component approach; and,
(e) investments in institutional development, technical assistance, and training have generally
been decisive elements for good performing seed projects.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
19.    In developing private seed production, marketing, and exporting, as well as strengthening the
regulatory framework for seeds, the project would be consistent with the Bank's strategy of promoting
transition to a market-based agricultural system. The private sector approach of the proposed project is
a vehicle to test and demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of an alternative mod_-l of seed production
to the current public sector system. Bank involvement has already helped in the formation of private seed
enterprises as well as in the liberalization of seed pricing, marketing, and trade, and continued
involvement would be critical for the needed improvements in the regulatory framework. It would be
beyond the reach of the private sector to bring about and sustain changes in the institutional, economic,
and regulatory framework without formal agreement with the Government within the framework of a
Bank-supported project. Bank participation is also justified to help ensure effective implementation of
seed system reform within an environment of policy and administrative changes. This project is



-5-
consistenit witlh the limited Country Assistance Strategy as discussed with the Board of Directors during
the presentation of the Rehabilitation Loan (report no. P-6446 UA) on December 22, 1994.
Ag,reed Actions
20.   Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that:
(a) loan effectiveness would be subject to the Borrower's providing the Bank with (i) a Financial
Agencv Agreement signed between the Borrower and UkrExlmBank; (ii) Subsidiary Loan
Agreemcnts signed between the MOF and at least two of the three participating seed enterprises;
and (iii) evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the PMU and the PSC are established and staffed;
(b)   disbursements of Loan proceeds for investments in the Plant Variety Testing and
Protection System would be subject to receipt by the Bank of a plan (prior to March 1, 1996),
acceptable to the Bank for the rationalization and reorganization of this System;
(c) the MOAF and the UAAS would, following the review of the current seed legislation,
present a specific proposal to Parliament (by March 31, 1996) for amending or modifying the
existing legislation to implement the recomnmendations of the review;
(d) the GOU would in the context of its econom.c reform program, implement and maintain the
agreed liberalization of production, marketing anid trade without limitation to the seed sector as
specified in the Seed Policy Letter by the Minister of Economy dated September 9, 1994; and
(e)  the GOU and the Bank would determine whether loan funds provided for technical
assistance, training and the operation of the PMU would be reallocated to other categories or
cancelled in case bilateral grant funds would become available for these purposes.
Poverty Category - Not Applicable
Environmental Aspects
21.          The proposed project would not create any substantive environmental hazard. The
potential occupational hazards in seed plant through the generation of dust and handling of hazardous
chemicals would be mitigated by including appropriate dust removal systemns and storage facilities for
chemicals in design of the seed plants. Inclusion of such systems was agreed upon during negotiations.
22.          The project has been classified as a category B project. No separate environmental
analysis was deemed necessary, but design criteria and operational procedures covering potential
occupational hazards have been included in the specifications for the plants in the bidding documentation.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that evaluation of bids and awards for the supply and
creation of cht: seed plants will take these criteria into account. Moreover, the plants are subject to
existing regulations permitting environmental supervision by the Ministry for Environmental Protection.
Program Objective Categories
23.   The project primarily aims at Private Sector Development (PV). It would also contribute to
improved Economic Management (EA).



-6-
P'arficipatory Approach
24.    The UAAS seed institutes, Ministry of Agriculture seed commissions, and thc participat.ng private
sced enterprises have all actively participated in the preparation, appraisal, and negotiation of the project.
At the same time, the UAAS and the Ministry of Agriculture are the implementing agencies for the
germplasm maintenance and regulatory framework project components. The potential profitability of seed
production and processing should provide sufficient incentive to the private seed enterprises to efficiently
implement the seed production componenit.
Project Benefits
25.           The project benefits would be, first and foremost, the contribution to safeguarding the
supply of improved seeds for both the domestic and export markets and the resulting favorable impact
on productivity, production. and foreign exchange earnings. The production of hybrid foundation and
commercial seed by the project at full development is estimated to reach about 2,100 tons and 10,400
tons. Of this, approximately 60% is expected to be utilized domestically and 40% is expected to be
exported. The incremental commercial seed produced by the project and used domestically would be
equivalent to 10%, 35%, and 2% of the current demand for sugarbeet hybrids, sunflower hybrids, and
maize hybrids, respectively. The annual foreign exchange earnings from exports of project foundation
and commercial hybrid seeds are projected at an equivalent of US $18 million at full development.
26.           Second, the project is expected to demonstrate the viability of financially sustainable seed
production systems. In so doing, it would pave the way for increased private sector participation in seed
production and a corresponding freeing of Government resources, as well as an increased foreign
participation in the establishment of a modern seed production system.
27.           The project is also expected to enhance the international competitiveness of Ukrainian
seed through: (a) improved access to high-quality foreign germplasm and foundation seed by Ukrainian
breeders and seed producers; (b) improvements in seed legislation, including plant breeders' rights; and
(c) improved plant variety registration and seed testing.
28.           The financial benefits of the three seed plants are sufficiently robust to provide for the
plants' viability in case of implementation delays, reduced output levels, and unfavorable cost and price
developments. In the base scenario, which includes a foreign exchange surrender of 50 %, a value added
tax of 20%. an import tax rate of 10%, and a profits tax of 30%, the after-tax financial rate of return
(FRR) is estimated at 29% for the sugarbeet seed enterprise; and 25% for both the mnaize and the
sunflower seed operations. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the sugarbeet seed enterprise would remain
viable2 if costs increased by 15%, if sales fell by 11%, or if implementation were to be delayed by one
year. The corresponding switching values3 for both the maize and sunflower enterprises are about 15%
for cost increases and 10% for sales reduccions.
Risks
29.           The technical aspect of producing seeds is not a major risk. The technology involved is
quite straightforward and well known in Ukraine, and there are sufficient suitably qualified technicians
available. The modern seed production and processing equipment to be procured under the project, along
2FRR equal to or greater than 15%.
3Switching value - the level at which the FRR drops below 15%



-7-
with the private business involvement of the seed enterprises, will provide for the technical efficiency and
for the attention to details required for high-quality seed production. Ukraine is less well equipped to
effectively handle the managerial, financial, and marketing functions of comrnmercially-oriented seed
enterprises, but these potential problems are expected to be reduced by the private nature of the
enterprises, the participation of foreign firms, and by the provision of technical assistance and training.
30.    Success in demonstrating the viability and replicability of a system of private seed producers
depends considerably on reaching and maintaining a reasonable degree of macroeconomic stability. It
also depends on continued Government support for the liberalization of pricing, marketing, and trade of
agricultural inputs in general and seeds in particular. Such a supportive macroeconomic and sector policy
framework will only develop over time. However, the financial attractiveness of hybrid seed production
will demonstrate the feasibility and viability of private seed production in the medium term, even in an
imperfect macro and sector policy enviroment. The favorable and robust economics of seed production
as indicated by the ERR would further justify taking the implicit risk.
31.           Other risks for the proiect are the timely availability of key production inputs, and the
uncertainties about the level of the domestic demand for improved seeds. This would greatly depend on
the profitability of crop production, which is dependent on successfully resolving pricing and trade
problems in agriculture. Under this scenario, the domestic demand for improved seeds may decline in
the short run. However, this risk of reduced demand would appear manageable considering that: (a) the
project would concentrate on the production of hybrids, which farms need to be replace annually; and
(b) the sale of produced seeds can be reoriented to the export market.
32.           A final risk factor affecting project implementation is the borrower's unfamiliarity with
procedures and regulations associated with the implementation of Bank-supported projects. This risk has
been taken into account by projecting an implementation period longer than technically necessary for
commercial turn-key projects of this size and by providing for a PMU and the needed technical assistance
to support its functions.
Recommnendation
33.    1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
