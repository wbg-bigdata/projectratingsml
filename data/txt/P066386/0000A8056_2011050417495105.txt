                         capacity of public sector institutions have remained sustained and seem to be on track to achieving the project development objective.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Progress in Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms remain satisfactory as evidenced by the 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment. This is
                         mainly facilitated by a highly committed high-level PFM Steering Committee. The establishment of a PFM Secretariat properly staffed has made a huge difference. Donor
                         engagement through a pooled mechanism has contributed to keeping the efforts focused and ensuring technical rigor throughout the process.

                         The same focused approach is now observable in the area of civil service reforms as well as in how government is attempting coordination of public sector reforms.
