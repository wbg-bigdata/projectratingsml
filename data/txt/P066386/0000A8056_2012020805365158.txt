                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With just one month to go until the project closes, the project is delivering on a number of activities across the components. Overall, the reforms supported by the project are on-track
                         to be delivered by the December 31, 2011, with the risk that a few activities will not be completed before project closing. The project restructuring of 2010 and adequate and
                         dedicated staffing of the components are having a positive impact of achievement of outputs and contributing to achieving the project development objective.

                         Progress is being made across all of the components, albeit unevenly. The Public Financial Management (PFM) component remains satisfactory and is exceeding some targets.
                         The civil service reform component is making progress following restructuring and equipping the CSR Unit within MIFOTRA with a dedicated coordinator. Progress has been made in
                         rolling out the IPPIS, and a number of reform policies have been developed, including a new Pay and Retention Policy, which is before Cabinet and MIFOTRA is likely to exceed its
                         targets for the development of citizen charters. But the sustainability of these reforms by the Government following the end of the project is uncertain. The component is rated as
                         moderately satisfactory based on activities completed at the time of mission.
