1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. Over the period 1961- 2003, the Philippines had a high
average annual population growth rate of 2.6 percent (compared to 1.7 percent in the
region). Over the same period, the Philippines had had a correspondingly modest 1.4
percent average annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. This
compared to an average increase of 5.4 percent in per capita GDP for other East Asian
countries over the same period. In 2004, the GDP of the Philippines was estimated at
US$84.6 billion up from 6.1 percent in 2003. The GDP per capita in 2004 was estimated
at US$1,025. The major economic sectors included agriculture and industry, especially
for processing, textiles, garments, electronics and automobile parts. The economy was
dominated by the service sector, representing 54 percent of GDP and over 37 percent of
workers were self-employed. The unemployment rate in April 2005 was 7.5 percent.
Inflation was on the rise and in 2005 it was 7 percent, up from 5.5 percent in 2004.

2.     There was a lack of social inclusion in the Philippines. Inequality was high and
when coupled with low growth over the longer term, it translated into slow progress on
poverty reduction. The richest five percent of households accounted for nearly one third
of national income, while the poorest 20 percent accounted for only six percent. The
poverty incidence, based on household consumption, had declined marginally from 27.6
percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2003, after an increase of two percentage points
between 1997 and 2000. Poverty severity remained about the same between 2000 and
2003 which meant that the living standards of those who remained poor had not
improved.

3.      Sector Context. In 2005, the total Department of Education (DepEd) budget
represented approximately two percent of GDP and 18.5 percent of the total Government
of the Philippines (GOP) budget net of debt service. Spending on teachers’ salaries and
other personnel services made up 89 percent of the DepEd budget. An additional four
percent was spent on educational infrastructure, which left seven percent of the DepEd
budget to cover other recurrent costs such as operating expenses, teacher in-service
training and the purchase of instructional aids. At the time of project appraisal, DepEd,
with support from the World Bank, had prepared a spending plan that showed a
worsening fiscal pressure over time, which would limit the country’s ability to achieve its
2015 Education for All (EFA) targets. The three factors influencing the fiscal pressures
were: (i) the high fixed costs of salaries and personnel benefits; (ii) rapid growth of the
school aged population, requiring the system to expand rapidly at the expense of quality
improvements;; and (iii) the need to increase the number of public high schools to
accommodate private high school students following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

4.      Education outcomes in the Philippines were low compared to the rest of the East
Asia region. The 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies (TIMSS)
showed that the Philippines ranked 34th out of 38 countries in Grade 8 Mathematics and
43rd out of 46 countries in Grade 8 Science. For Grade 4, the Philippines ranked 23rd out
of 25 participating countries in both mathematics and science. In addition, there was poor


                                            1
internal efficiency in the system. Participation rates in 2003 at the elementary level were
higher than high school level, 94.02 percent and 63.88 percent respectively. However, the
dropout rates were 7.34 percent for elementary and 13.1 percent for high school, which
meant that approximately 50 percent of students beginning elementary school graduated
from high school. The high population growth rates and the tight fiscal situation
contributed to these outcomes. There were also several teacher related concerns: (i)
teacher qualifications, particularly at the high school level, were low in mathematics and
science; (ii) no performance-related pay structure which made it difficult to reward top
teachers; (iii) quality pre-service teacher training was poor, and (iv) teacher deployment
to hard- to-reach areas was difficult due to provisions in the 1967 Magna Carta for Public
School Teachers, allowing teachers to refuse transfer.

5.      To combat these problems, the GOP developed a poverty reduction strategy that
was defined in the Government’s Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan
(MTPDP) 2004-2020, which gave high priority to achieving universal basic education.
The country’s education strategy was guided by the National Education for All (EFA)
2015 Plan and was intended to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). While remaining committed to the overall development
and poverty reduction strategies, the Government also acknowledged the particular
challenges for basic education. Important initiatives on rationalization were introduced by
DepEd administration following the passage of the Governance of Basic Education Act
(Republic Act RA 9155) in 2001 with its emphasis on decentralization and its declaration
that schools should be the heart of the formal education system. The reform proposals
were progressively refined, and by 2005, consensus emerged on the need for urgent
sector-wide strategies, placing schools first and empowering local communities to
achieve school improvement. The strategies were articulated in a policy called the
Schools First Initiative (SFI) and translated into policy actions under the Government’s
Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA).1

6.      The overall objectives of BESRA encompassed universal access to basic
education schooling and success for children in that age group, with community support
enabling effective school-based management, and the provision of universal functional
literacy for adults using alternative learning schemes. The policy actions of BESRA were
collected under five key reform thrusts (KRTs): (i) school-based management (ii) teacher
standards; (iii) quality assurance; (iv) complementary early childhood education,
alternative learning systems and private sector participation; and (v) organizational
development.

7.     Project Context. Building on the lessons of the past and aligned to the
Government’s MTPDP, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006-2008 sought to
achieve economic growth and promote social cohesion. While improving education in
general would contribute to this overall objective, support for BESRA had a strategic

                                                       2
focus since it tackled two key challenges: fiscal reform in the short-term and making
public institutions more effective in the long-run. The strategy was designed to support
the Government’s overall, coherent reform agenda and in particular to align Bank
assistance to those strategic priorities in the existing national budget that address reforms
to achieve fiscal stability and improved governance. The National Program Support for
Basic Education (NPSBE) was the first Bank operation in the Philippines that adopted a
National Program Support (NPS) approach. This approach required a shift from financing
discrete projects towards support for coherent programs. The project was designed to
support strategic elements and key thrusts of the country’s basic education reform
program. It was a move toward a program-based approach which provided more support
to sector-wide type operations focused on core mandates, functions and service delivery
improvements within the budget. As such, the project adopted the program objective of
the BESRA as well as government targets. These targets are considered the higher order
outcome targets given that Bank assistance was only 1 percent of the annual budget of
DepED.

8.      The Bank assistance through the NPSBE facilitated implementation of reforms
furthering decentralization and rationalization of the system of basic education in ways
that improve equity, quality, governance and financing of basic education services.
Project financing was targeted to selected budget line items that are strategically
important for reforms (see Table 4 in Annex 3). With its program approach, the NPSBE
provided the impetus to launch system-wide reforms by targeting strategic policies and
monitoring their implementation such that there was greater effectiveness in the use of
existing resources focused on implementing targeted reforms. It also sharpened the
Government’s policy framework for coordination of donor assistance and provided a
roadmap for subsequent additional financing from the donor community for
implementation of the reform agenda. The sector wide program approach of NPS also
helped mobilize resources not only from donor partners but also among local private
sector-partners to support sector-wide reforms. It also allowed the Bank to provide advice
on a broad range of issues given the Bank’s broad involvement and engagement in the
country through the fiduciary work, governance and anti-corruption agenda, PEM, among
others.

9.      Project financing represented approximately 1 percent of the yearly DepEd budget
and 5 percent of the line item support for one year. While the project resources were a
small portion of the overall government budget, it was viewed as important for leveraging
additional resources for the government’s education policy reforms. In addition, the
BESRA provided the government with the first opportunity to coordinate donor
assistance in an effort to meet the reform goals. The government worked with the donors
to ensure that donor assistance did not overlap and that all aspects of the reform agenda
could be covered based on the needs of the government. Related to this donor
coordination, AusAID provided trust fund money to be administered by the Bank for the




                                             3
Support to Philippine Basic Education Reforms (SPHERE) 2 project, which mainly
financed the needed technical assistance (TA) for critical areas of BESRA that were not
supported under the NPSBE. This project ran in parallel to the NPSBE and was
instrumental in supporting the necessary studies to assess the governance issues as well
as studies needed to ensure the impact of the NPSBE resources. The SPHERE recipient
executed grant: (i) mobilized experts and experienced practitioners for the BESRA
technical groups responsible for implementing the various components of the reform
agenda; (ii) provided SBM grants; and (iii) constructed classrooms in high need areas in
Southern Philippines.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     The project development objective is to improve quality and equity in learning
outcomes for all Filipinos in basic education. The key indicators selected to measure
progress toward the PDO were: Elementary Participation: (i) participation rate, 6-11
years; (ii) cohort survival; (iii) completion rate; and (iv) dropout rate. High School
Participation: (i) participation rate 12-15 years; (ii) cohort survival; (iii) completion rate;
and (iv) dropout rate. Quality and efficiency: (i) Grade 6 Achievement in mathematics,
Filipino, English, science, and Hekasi (social studies); (ii) inter-quartile ratio 3 for
elementary schools; and (iii) inter-quartile ratio for high schools

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.     The PDO was not revised during project implementation, and the key
development indicators remained the same throughout the life of the project. However, in
2011, DepEd adjusted the PDO targets. These adjustments were made based on the 2010
census data, which showed a decline in population growth and the recognition that the
targets were too ambitious. The government only officially validated the new end targets
in December 2012. The Bank team was not able to restructure the results framework
given that the project was closing December 31, 2012. Since the revised targets provide a



2
  The recipient-executed SPHERE project will close November 30, 2013 and at that time a separate ICR
will be prepared to assess its impact. The recipient executed grant implemented by DepEd consists of: (i)
mobilization of experts and experienced practitioners for the BESRA technical working groups; training of
teachers, regions and divisions on various areas of the reform; provision of teaching and learning materials
and construction of Learning Resource and Management Development Centers; (ii) provision of SBM
grants; and (iii) construction of classrooms in high need areas in Southern Philippines. There were two
Bank-executed grants, one for incremental supervision costs and another provided demand driven
analytical work, which includes: (i) ESC program review; (ii) mobilization of technical assistance in
various areas of the reform such as on SBM, organizational development, ICT in education, financial
management, teacher development, etc.; (iii) complementary resources for the development of the medium-
term expenditure framework; (iv) development of the Special Education Fund budget manual; and (v)
policy review of all DepEd policy issuances from 1970 to date with the end view of improving policy
formulation, identifying policy gaps and eliminating policy overlaps.

more realist picture of the education system, the ICR will use the adjusted targets to
assess system improvement and measure project achievement.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.    The targeted beneficiaries in the project consisted of: (i) the schools and their
communities, encompassing individual parents, the Parent-Teacher-Community
Association (PTCA), local government, the private sector, and non-government
organizations (NGOs); (ii) basic education teachers; and (iii) basic education learners.

1.5 Original Components4

13.     Component 1: Strengthened School-Based Management (US$71 million).
This component aimed to: (i) develop school-community partnerships; (ii) establish a
structure of support and accountability; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) ensure quality and
equity at the school-level. The project-related outcome was enhanced learning outcomes
for all, resulting from improved efficiency, transparency, fairness, accountability and
responsiveness in the local delivery of education services.

14.    Component 2: Improved Teaching Effectiveness (US$23 million). This
component supported: (i) the development of professional standards for teachers; and (ii)
teacher deployment. The project was to finance: (i) the development of policy on the
refinement and use of competency-based standards for teachers and training on the use of
such standards; and (ii) a hardship allowance for teachers moved too hard to-staff
schools, as currently committed within the 2006 DepEd budget.

15.    Component 3: Enhanced Quality and Equity through Standards, Assessment
and Support (US$96 million) aimed at developing: (i) a National Standards Framework;
(ii) a Quality Assurance Framework; and (iii) an ICT Policy. In addition to policy
development, the project financed Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses grants
(MOOE), key textbooks and learning materials, training, database hardware and software,
advocacy and technical assistance related to quality assurance, and provided funds for the
school building program to help schools meet minimum standards.

16.     Component 4: Effective Resource Mobilization (US$2 million). This
component supported the enhancement of: (i) financing framework and budget process;
(ii) demand-side financing; and (iii) private sector participation. Financial support was
provided for policy formulation and its application to options for the delivery of demand-
side interventions (e.g., school feeding) and public/private partnerships (e.g. government
assistance to students and teachers in private education or GASTPE) in a decentralized
environment.



4
  Original project financing by component also included US$7.5 million for unallocated, and the Front End
fee of US$.5 million.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised during the implementation period.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     On July16, 2009 project funds were reallocated to increase the funds available for
classroom construction because the principal led construction program was highly
successful. The allocation was increased from US$26 million to US$97.5 million. The
additional US$71.5 million was taken from the allocation for school feeding, training,
textbooks, hardship allowance and school MOOE. While there was reallocation across
categories to support additional classroom construction, this did not affect the amount of
allocation provided by the Government through DepEd for these important components
of the NPSBE.

18.    On December 13, 2011, the Bank, at the request of the government, granted a
twelve month extension of the original project closing date from December 31, 2011 to
December 31, 2012 in order to complete the procurement and delivery of the English,
mathematics, and science and technology textbooks financed under the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Project Preparation. In 2005, the Government of the Philippines and the Bank
decided to support the BESRA with a Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan (SIML)
which aimed to bring sector expenditures, policies and performance in line with the
BESRA. This decision was based on an agreement with the government on the 2005-
2010 sector investment program that was predicated on the medium-term expenditure
framework and sector policy reforms necessary for the program to succeed. In addition, it
was based on the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006-2008 that called for a
graduated response to policy reforms that enabled public institutions to be more effective.
The Bank preparation and appraisal teams consisted of technical experts that were
appropriate for the development of the project. Project preparation was also spread over
several months, which allowed for the development and continuation of a sector-wide
dialogue with the government, DepEd and the donor community on the project support
for the BESRA. This was done in an effort to engender strong and sustained political
leadership, championship and ownership, which the team felt were important for the
success of the project. On the government side, DepEd held meetings and workshops, to
build consensus around the BESRA and the development of the NPSBE among donors,
the rest of government and civil society. DepEd also created technical working groups
(TWGs) to focus on the KRTs and help develop the four project components and to
ensure effective communication with the DepEd on project preparation. The project
preparation process was thoughtful, collaborative, and technically sound and to the extent
possible, based on lessons learned from previous operations.




                                            6
20.     Project Design. The NPSBE project design fit squarely into the government’s
BESRA (2006-2010), MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS. They shared the common
objectives of fostering economic growth and social inclusion through improved
governance, together with fiscal reform. The NPSBE project underwent a thorough
quality at entry (QER) process: The project design took into consideration comments
from the November 2005 project preparation review (PPR)5, which included the need to
provide: (i) more details on the level of government commitment; (ii) clearer terms on the
budget items to be financed; (iii) an enhanced economic and financial analysis; (iv) a
more in-depth financial management and procurement assessment; and (v) a review of
the National Government Accounting System (NGAS). The preparation team also
incorporated lessons learned from past specific investment loans (SILs), such as: (i) for
SBM to promote school effectiveness, schools require adequate and appropriate
resources; (ii) clear delineation of roles and responsibilities within a decentralized
environment is critical to the success of a reform strategy; and (iii) participation of local
stakeholders in school improvement planning and implementation is critical to achieve
desired learning outcomes and to mobilize needed resources.

21.     The project design included the appropriate activities to assist the government in
reaching their reform agenda goals of: (i) continuous school improvement facilitated by
active involvement of local stakeholders; (ii) better learning outcomes achieved by
improved teacher standards; and (iii) desired learning outcomes enhanced by national
curriculum strategies, multi-sector coordination, and quality assurance. The PDO of
improve quality and equity in learning outcomes for all Filipinos in basic education was
appropriate since this was the objective of the BESRA. The key indicators in the results
framework were national in scope and derived from the BESRA and, again, this was
appropriate given the NPSBE’s direct link to the BESRA. The project design also
included 26 intermediate indicators all of which were appropriate for measuring
implementation of the project components. It should be noted that the PDO indicator
targets were the BESRA targets, which were adopted by the preparation team at the
request of DepEd since the project design was supportive of the BESRA. In addition,
government asked the preparation team to include all 26 intermediate indicators to ensure
that important project reform activities would be continuously monitored. The budget
items of: (i) classroom construction; (ii) SBM grants; (iii) textbooks; (iv) training, which
included teacher and capacity development training; (v) MOOE support; (vi) school
feeding; (vii) hardship pay and (viii) policy development were selected to ensure that the
BESRA reforms related to decentralization received adequate and sustained support. This
was an appropriate design decision. The preparation team identified project risks and
proposed adequate mitigation measures. To support the implementation of the NPSBE, it
was decided to mainstream implementation within the DepEd units that were ultimately
responsible for meeting the objectives of the BESRA at the central, regional, division
offices and schools as mandated in the Governance of Basic Education Act (RA 9155).

 The PPR was the equivalent of a Quality at Entry Review as indicated in project preparation
documentation.




                                                    7
This structure was appropriate to ensure continued ownership of the NPSBE project and
the BESRA. The preparation team conducted an in-depth institutional capacity
assessment at all levels, which gave the team confidence that DepEd had built the
foundations required to implement the reforms and NPSBE.

2.2 Implementation

22.     Implementation began with workshop sessions for theme groups responsible for
implementing particular reforms, as well as for officers responsible for handling
procurement, financial management, disbursement and monitoring and evaluation. The
DepEd continued the TWGs with the mandate that they would be responsible for the
implementation of the reform agenda and the NPSBE activities. While there were initial
capacity concerns, the implementing units, through their daily work, were able to
ultimately implement all project activities. Where there was a need for support, technical
assistance was provided as well as capacity training.

23.      During the first 12 months of project implementation, disbursements were low
due to limited financial management capacity at the regional and division levels.
However, by April 2008 disbursements had increased from US$3.55 million to US$28.12
and by June 2008 to US$56.21 million. This was mainly due to the strong
implementation of the principal led school construction and procurement of textbooks.
Since the school led construction was so successful, the government, in July 2009, asked
the Bank to restructure the project to reallocate an additional US$71.5 million of project
funds to school construction. Because there was an independent evaluation of the
principal led construction that showed the quality of construction was high, the Bank
team felt that the reallocation was appropriate for the project. The government also
indicated that they would increase the allocation for school feeding, training, textbooks,
hardship allowance and school MOOE, which they were able to do. (See Annex 3 for
increased budget allocations for these line items.) By October 2009, the project had
disbursed US$108.01 million and in November 2009, there was a mid-term review of the
project and, at that time, disbursements were in line with the original disbursement
profile.

24.     There were substantial successes in the implementation of project activities. The
SBM TWG developed an SBM manual and an equitable and formula based MOOE
allocation. The SMB TWG also: (i) developed SBM standards and framework that were
rolled out across the country, (ii) provided training on the development of school
improvement plans and their utilization; (iii) introduced school report cards nationwide;
and (iv) developed and provided guidelines on school-community partnerships. While the
systems are in place there is still some work to be done in terms of the strengthening of
the roles of the governing councils specifically as they relate to accountability as well as
increasing community participation. Further impact of SBM is likely to be realized as
these roles get strengthened. Although challenges remain, SBM, through training,
capacity development, and socialization activities has shown that: (i) 90.76 percent of
schools have school improvement plans; (ii) 84.54 percent of schools have school
governing councils; (iii) 97.85 percent of schools have school report cards; (iv) 97.27



                                             8
percent of school heads have been oriented to SBM; and (v) 88 percent of schools have
been oriented to simplified accounting procedures. This is a considerable achievement.

25.    The BESRA with support from the NPSBE also: (i) introduced the National
Competency Based Teacher Standards Assessment (NCBTS) and a teacher self-
assessment tool, which informed teacher hiring guidelines and in-service training
programs respectively. These standards were also incorporated into teacher support
materials, teacher professional development, and the national assessment. The
government also: (i) universalized kindergarten, making it officially part of the basic
education cycle, hiring and training kindergarten teachers 6 and the development of a
kindergarten curriculum; (ii) revised the entire basic education curriculum content and
framework to accommodate the new Kindergarten to Grade 12 program (“K – 12?); (iii)
revised Alternative Learning Systems (ALS) programs; (iv) revised the grades 1–10
learning competencies, (v) developed an assessment framework; (vi) piloted mother-
tongue based-multilingual education (MTB-MLE) in 20 national languages in 921
schools nationwide, and developed supporting materials for teaching and learning in the
12 main languages, 7 and (vii) distributed approximately 16.5 million textbooks and
teachers manuals for English, mathematics, social sciences and science and technology.
The project also has supported the rehabilitation of 13,659 classrooms and constructed
4,813 new ones. (See Annex 2 for more highlights of implementation.)

26.     There were also challenges during implementation. The NPSBE had a goal of
developing a 5-year staffing plan to facilitate the equitable distribution of teachers to
remote disadvantaged schools. Although this plan was not developed during the life of
the project, DepEd did have a color-coded scheme that designates needy schools, which
was used in lieu of the staffing plan. There were systemic delays with teacher deployment
that were identified through a governance study conducted by the Bank. The study’s
findings led to policy changes that ultimately reduced deployment time from one to two
years to six months. As a result, DBM has allocated an additional 61,000 teacher
positions for fiscal year 2013. There continue to be a small number of schools that are not
collecting or receiving the full amount of MOOE.8 To address this issue, one of the steps
DepEd took was to start posting MOOE allocations on the DepEd website. This has



6
  During FY 2011 and 2012, approximately 8,000 new Kindergarten teachers were hired, 42,880 trained as
part of the Kindergarten Volunteer program, 13,962 as part of the 2011 summer program, 633 as trainers of
the summer or the 40-week Kindergarten curriculum program, 471 received scholarships to attend the
summer Institute-Based training for kindergarten teachers, and there was a 20-day training program offered
by the State Universities and colleges for the equivalent of a 9-unit course for a Master’s degree in Early
Childhood and Development. Although not financed by NPSBE, the project served as a catalyst for
mobilizing additional support to develop and roll out these reforms and activities.
7
  The 12 languages include Tagalog, Ilokano, Pangasinense, Kapampangan, Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon,
Waray, Maranao, Maguindanao, Yakan and Chavacano.
8
  Some of the reasons for not receiving or collecting the full MOOE amounts include: (i) technical and
capacity constraints (division retaining funds; insufficient MOOE budget especially for small schools;
human resource and workload constraints; etc.); (ii) divisions resistant to decentralizing funds management
to schools; (iii) few institutional incentives to comply with full downloading; and (iv) lack of effective
monitoring of MOOE downloading or awareness of school heads regarding MOOE amounts.



                                                    9
increased schools’ and communities’ awareness of their allocation, which has improved
distribution, collection, transparency and accountability related to the MOOE. The
overarching implementation challenges were related to: (i) financial management; (ii)
capacity constraints at the division and regional levels; and (iii) procurement of textbooks.
NPSBE was the first education project to be mainstreamed and to use country systems for
implementation. The preparation team had identified financial management as a risk due
to weak government systems and limited financial management capacity with appropriate
mitigation measures. However, they still presented problems related to withdrawal
applications which slowed the reimbursement process. Some capacity constraints at the
local levels were encountered during the roll out of SBM and the implementation of its
different components. However, DepEd remained responsive and supported the
decentralized structures through training and capacity building activities. The
procurement issues were related to the quality/completeness of bidding documents for
textbooks and some books not meeting the required technical specifications. These delays
required the government, in December 2011, to request an extension of the project
closing date from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The textbooks were
procured and delivered and by project closing 100 percent of the loan was disbursed.

27.    There were nine Bank review and implementation support mission from the
period September 2007 through March 2012, with a final BESRA review mission in
August 2012. The makeup of the Bank’s teams was well balanced with financial
management staff well represented on missions, along with procurement, monitoring and
evaluation specialists, both Bank staff and consultants as well as technical specialists9
where necessary. The US$200 million was fully disbursed by May 22, 2013.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     Design. As stated previously, the results framework was appropriate for the
project design and reflected the goals of the BESRA. The indicators were linked to the
PDO and were adequate to measure achievement of the PDO. The targets for the PDO
indicators were projections based on the 2000 census. At the time of design, the QER
panels suggested that the target might be overly ambitious. However, after discussions
with the government, the targets were kept since they were based on the official
government targets. The intermediate indicators were also linked to the components and
were appropriate to measure intermediate level achievements. The results framework
included 26 intermediate indicators. While this is a large number of indicators, they were
included in the framework at the request of DepEd to ensure that important project and
reform activities would be continuously monitored. In addition, the indicators were
included to ensure that other partners, both local and international, would provide
technical and financial resources to support the achievement of the BESRA results
indicators. The design also included support for: (i) a web-based Enhanced Basic


9
 The missions included SBM specialists, teacher development experts, quality assurance practitioners, and
data management experts when appropriate for review of project activities.




                                                   10
Education Information System (e-BEIS) to enable performance reporting in real-time as
well as to inform planning, resource allocation, and performance reporting; and (ii) a
Quality Assurance and Accountability Framework (QAAF) to lay the foundation for
redefining school input standards including textbooks, school infrastructure, teacher
training materials, etc.

29.     Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation. The roll out of
the e-BEIS nationwide has allowed central offices to upload the school data they receive
onto the website, allowing schools to access the information directly or for divisions to
download and share the information with their respective schools. This has had the
intended impact of being able to provide real-time information at all levels of the
education system. In 2010, the government adopted the QAAF, along with the roll-out of
the Philippines Accreditation System for Basic Education (PASBE). PASBE is a unified
schools standards assessment tool that is applicable to both elementary and high schools,
and facilitates measuring their level of compliance with service standards. The QAAF
and PASBE did lay the foundation for re-defining school input standards and all schools
are now using these standards. DepEd, with support from AusAID, developed a learner
information system (LIS) that includes a learner reference number for each student
irrespective of whether enrolled in the formal or non-formal education system. This
system currently holds information on approximately 20 million learners and is providing
DepEd with valuable information on each learner and allows it to make informed
decisions for the planning and budgeting process.

30.     Under the BESRA as a whole, the M&E system includes: (i) a learning resources
materials development system that is being used to upload learning materials; (ii) an asset
management system which is operational at the central level and will be expanded down
to the regional and division levels; (iii) a Training and Development Information System
(TDIS) being piloted in Regions 6, 7 and 8 and which includes an inventory of training,
research and development activities conducted at the regional levels; (iv) the ongoing
development of a project monitoring system being developed under the Philippines’
Response to Indigenous Peoples’ and Muslim Education (PRIME) program, which
created a system of providing demand-driven grants to respond to indigenous people (IP)
education needs; and (v) the ongoing development of a human resources information
system, which has been put on hold pending the government’s plan to roll out a
government human resources information system (GMIS).

31.     The DepEd provided Bank missions with data and information that allowed the
teams to make judgments on progress toward achieving the PDO and the project’s
implementation progress. This information was regularly reported on by the Bank in
aides-memoire and ISRs. As mentioned, the targets for the PDO level indicators were
adjusted and are being used to measure project achievement. It should also be noted that
26 intermediate indicators were monitored and reported on over the life of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Safeguards. The environmental rating of the project was “C? based on the fact
that no environmental risks were foreseen and construction would comply with national


                                            11
environmental laws for environmental impacts. Therefore, OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment was not triggered and no environmental assessment tools were developed as
part of the project. The project did, however, conduct a review of the environmental
safeguards at mid-term and determined that there was compliance with local regulations.
At the time of project closing, again all environmental safeguards were in compliance
with local regulations.

33.     The project did trigger the Indigenous Peoples OP 4.20 because the reform
agenda was to address both quality and equity especially for the poor and disadvantaged
groups, including indigenous peoples. The project was satisfactorily carried out in
accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework – IPPF and the
government’s Philippines Indigenous People’s Rights Act – IPRA. Although
encountering initial delays, the government approved and disseminated the National
Indigenous Peoples Education Policy Framework in August 2011. The framework is to
ensure that IP’s basic education concerns and needs are taken into consideration as part of
BESRA implementation. DepEd supported several activities related to the promotion of
indigenous peoples education, which were: (i) piloting MTB-MLE in 20 languages; (ii)
dissemination of the National Indigenous People’s Education Policy Framework; (iii)
issuance of guidelines on the use of PRIME grants, which created a system of providing
demand-driven funding to respond to IP education needs; (iv) creation of an indigenous
peoples education office (IPsEO); and (v) with AusAID support, conducting a baseline
survey on the educational situation in IP and Muslim households in PRIME priority
divisions and regions. The other IP activities included: (i) review of standards for the
recognition and accreditation of private schools for IPs; (ii) development of a national
curriculum framework on IP education for kindergarten, elementary and high school
levels; (iii) guidelines and standards for the development of indigenous learning
materials; and (iv) an IP education training plan for teacher and education managers.
School visits have shown that interventions through the school SIPs to support IP
students are designed but are often separate rather than an integral part of the plans. The
next steps are to fully integrate them into the SIPs. Safeguards compliance is rated
satisfactory.

34.     Financial management. As discussed previously, the project was designed to use
the government accounting system. In October 2001, the Commission on Audit (COA)
introduced the new government account system (NGAS) that followed international
public sector accounting procedures. The bookkeeping segment of NGAS was
computerized and was referred to as eNGAS. The NGAS updated and replaced the
government accounting and auditing manual, which had been in use since the 1940s and
was viewed to be a milestone in the government accounting procedures. While the system
was viewed as a significant step forward, the implementation of the system proved to be
problematic for project implementation and financial management (FM) performance.
The FM challenges were: (i) establishment of an Internal Audit Service (IAS), which
only became fully operational in early 2011; (ii) DepEd central, regional and division
offices had to be adequately staffed and trained to carry out the high volume of FM
transactions, which took time; and (iii) the eventual roll-out of the eNGAS after it was
suspended in December 2008 in an effort to harmonize the Philippines general
accounting standards with the international public sector accounting standards. This led


                                            12
DepEd to consider developing its own web-based financial management information
system (FMIS), which is being finalized with AusAID support. Since all the
computerized systems were either put on hold or are still being finalized, the project FM
activities were carried out manually.

35.     Manual accounting for the central office staff was a challenge because they were
understaffed for such a large task. Given the large volume of financial transactions, weak
capacity and inadequate staff, the central office was unable to cope with the work load.
This led to: (i) delays in meeting loan covenants (i.e. timely submission of financial
reports, SBM validation reports or supporting documentation for auditing purposes); (ii)
timely liquidation of cash advances; (iii) the absence of physical inventory reports and
non-maintenance of “Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards? in the case of school
construction; and (iv) funds having to be returned due to non-compliance with
procurement or disbursement rules. In addition, COA re-instituted a selective pre-audit of
cash advances and school construction expenditures in 2009, which added to the
transaction processing delays.

36.     Despite these difficulties, DepEd was able to, after a slow start: (i) significantly
increase disbursement levels from 11 percent in March 2008 to 54 percent by November
2009 and 100 percent by project closing; (ii) encode a substantial number of 2004 – 2010
financial transactions in eNGAS once COA lifted its suspension in 2011; (iii) partially
mitigate the staffing issue by using FM staff from the division offices to assist with FM
responsibilities; and (iv) by 2011, significantly improve its compliance with time-bound
financial statement submissions, submitting all outstanding audit reports and school grant
validation reports. Efforts on DepEd’s part to address COAs comments on the 2007
Agency financial statements led the COA to modify its opinion from “adverse? to
“qualified? in 2010. While DepEd worked to improve their FM, they were not able to
fully address COA’s recommendations on FM staffing issues. This, coupled with the
overall weak record keeping and the qualified audit for CY2011, resulted in a final
project rating of moderately unsatisfactory for financial management. Despite the
unresolved staffing issues and MU rating, DepEd still exerted its best effort towards the
application deadline date to collate all disbursement documents for submission to the
Bank resulting to full disbursement of the loan proceeds.

37.     Procurement. Procurement performance of the project is considered satisfactory.
Shortly after effectiveness, the project had been able to contract US$26 million for school
construction, and conducted a school-mapping exercise to ensure schools are
built/rehabilitated in the most critical areas. One of the most remarkable achievements
was the use of the “principal led approach? to construction, where the school principal
oversaw progress of classroom construction or rehabilitation.10 This procurement method
was consistently rated satisfactory due to the fact that construction was of better quality
to other government led construction programs. The approach was so successful that it
required an increase of funds allocated to school construction from US$26 million to

10
  Prior to each construction/rehabilitation, DepEd would sign a “Statement of Interest? with the LGU that
established the level and type of contribution to the works (cash or in-kind), and ensured community buy-in.



                                                    13
US$97.5 million in July 2009. By August 2010, all civil works had been completed and
dedicated funds disbursed, leading to the rehabilitation of 13,659 classrooms and
construction of 4,813 new ones. The project was also able to purchase and distribute
approximately 16.5 million textbooks. However, there were delays in procuring some of
these books due to the quality/completeness of bidding documents and some books not
meeting the required technical specifications (i.e. paper weight, etc.). There were also
minor infractions for civil works (i.e. incomplete record keeping, inclusion of small
ineligible activities, etc.) but overall, the project carried out its procurement according to
the legal agreement and operations manual.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     A new lending operation and a series of analytical works are currently being
prepared. The Learning, Equity, Accountability Program Support (LEAPS) provides a
US$300 million loan to continue to support the gains made under BESRA and NPSBE.
LEAPS is expected to: (i) look at ways to improve teaching and learning in early grade
reading and math through teacher capacity building, and develop and use mother-tongue
based reading and math assessment tools; (ii) strengthen accountability, which is a major
part of the SBM approach, especially at the school level while also strengthening
DepEd’s financial management capacity; and (iii) improve program designs targeting
disadvantaged groups by expanding the knowledge base on selected programs targeting
disadvantaged groups, such as ALS, and improve program design and implementation
capabilities. Furthermore, LEAPS will use disbursement-linked indicators, which will
reduce the number of required financial transactions and documentation and help with
project implementation.

39.     A proposed series of analytical works will support the CAS objective of
improving access to quality education services. The analysis will be centered around the
following strategic pillars: (i) Efficiency and Equity of Education Finance and School
Funding, analyzing DepEd’s education finance policies for more equitable and better
quality of service delivery; (ii) Quality of Service Delivery Analysis, which aims to take
a comprehensive look at the determinants of effective education service delivery; (iii)
School to Work Transition: Skills Demand and Supply in order to shed light on skills
gaps/mismatches as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the basic education system;
and (iv) Basic Education Reforms Dissemination and Communication. The result of these
pieces of analysis is expected to provide DepEd with valuable information and facilitate
their efforts to sustain and expand the BESRA goals.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives were highly
relevant to the country’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The objectives
fit squarely into the government’s BESRA, MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS.
They shared the common objectives of fostering economic growth and promoting social
cohesion. Like the 2006-08 CAS, the new CAS (2010-12) also focuses achieving more


                                             14
inclusive growth by supporting the Philippines increased access to better public services
for the poor by deepening the reform agendas in key public services sectors and
expanding basic service delivery directly to the poor. The project and BESRA continued
to fit into the 2010-2012 CAS objectives. There is a new CAS currently under
preparation that is expected to continue the focus on supporting the Philippines reform
agendas in key public services sectors. In addition, it is expected that the government will
continue its education reform agenda through the BESRA.

41.     Relevance of Design. The relevance of the project design is substantial. The
project was appropriately aligned with the BESRA PDO and PDO indicators, and it
included appropriate activities to assist the government in reaching their reform agenda
goals. The mainstreaming of project implementation was also appropriate to foster
improved capacity within the system. Furthermore, the project risks and mitigation
measures were also appropriate given the government systems in place at the time of
design. While the PDO level indicators were appropriate, the targets for the indicators
proved to be overly ambitious. The preparation team discussed this issue during the QER
however, as indicated earlier, the decision was made to keep the DepEd targets since they
were based on the 2000 census and the government made a strong request to keep the
project targets the same as the government targets. Achieving the targets year over year
presented challenges for the project and it was not until 2011 that targets were revised
downward.

42.      Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of project implementation is
judged to be substantial. As indicated above, implementation of the majority of project
activities was highly successful: SBM has been institutionalized, system-wide monitoring
systems are in place and will continue to be expanded, NCBTS has been institutionalized,
and MOOE allocations have been institutionalized. The substantial rating is mainly based
on the persistent FM implementation issues. While the project was able to disburse 100
percent of the project funds, DepEd still has to produce required FM documentation and
reports manually. This is a slow and cumbersome process and the project audit reports
reflected these problems. Since DepEd could not resolve these issues in a timely enough
way to satisfy the COA audit, they issued a final qualified audit and the project
completed with an MU rating for financial management.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

43.     The overall achievement of the project development objectives is moderately
satisfactory. The project contributed to a number of positive outcomes for the
Philippines education system. As indicated, the targets were revised downward, which is
new information provided at the time of the ICR. Therefore, this section evaluates the
outcomes against the results based on the new targets. The project development objective
was to improve quality and equity in learning outcomes for all Filipinos in basic
education and the PDO level indicators selected to monitor achievement of the PDO were
as follows:

44.    Elementary participation. The participation rate for 6-11 year increased from
the baseline of 88.58 percent in 2003/04 to 97.3 in 2011/12 percent exceeding the revised

                                            15
target of 90.09 percent. The overall enrollment numbers have also increased from 13
million to 14.4 million from 2003/04 to 2011/12. These are both substantial increases for
the system. Although the 2010 census reports a decline in population growth over the
period 2000-2010, the increase in enrollments seems to be attributed to the fact that more
children of elementary school age are going to school even though population growth has
declined. Enrollment increases have also been larger for the poorest households. For
example, between 2004 and 2011 attendance rates for 6 to 11 year old children increased
by 7.5 percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of households compared to a less than
1 percentage point increase for children in the wealthiest 30 percent of households.11
Increases in enrollment may be attributed to: (i) improvements in the alternative delivery
modes which are allowing children, particularly boys, to participate even though they
have to work and (ii) the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that provides resources
directly to poor households to enable their children to attend school and avail of health
services. The CCT program currently covers children ages 6-14. Cohort survival rate
increased from 63.57 in 2003/04 to 73.46 in 2011/12 percent, missing the 2011/12
revised target of 76.46 percent. Although the cohort survival rates did not meet the targets,
the rates did improve which implies that the system has been able to sustain a level of
quality even under such a rapid expansion. Completion rate increased from 62.06 percent
in 2003/04 to 70.96 percent in 2011/12 missing the revised target of 75.13 percent. Again,
the completion rates did not meet the targets, but improvements overtime implies that the
system has been able to sustain a level of quality even under rapid expansion.12 This is a
substantial achievement. The dropout rate has declined from 8.9 percent in 2003/04 to
6.38 percent in 2011/12. While this is an appropriate trend, the original target of 4.3
percent was missed.

45.    High school participation. The participation rate for 12-15 years increased from
the baseline of 61.16 percent in 2003/04 to 64.8 in 2011/12 percent slightly missing the
revised 2011/12 target of 65.16 percent. The overall enrollment numbers for high school
have increased from 6.3 million to 7 million between 2003/04 and 2011/12. While these
numbers do not mirror the increases in elementary enrollments, there have been some
improvements in equity in school attendance between poor and wealthy households. For
example, between 2007 and 2011, school attendance among 12-14 (15-18) year olds
increased by 5.5 (5.1) percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of households
compared to only 1.1 (0.6) percentage points for the wealthiest 10 percent of households
(Reyes, Tabuga, Mina and Asis, 2013). However, gaps between older children aged
between 15 and 18 widened slightly over the same period. The government continues to


11
     Reyes, Tabuga, Mina and Asis, 2013.

12
  The completion rate in the Philippines is measured by the percentage of first year entrants in a level of
education who complete the level in accordance with the required number of years. However, the
completion rate formula being used by the Bank and UNESCO, which measures the grade/year level of all
completers, shows that elementary completion rates have already reached 91 percent at the elementary level.
The achievement of this indicator is attributed to the improvements in the delivery system and the increase
in the demand-side interventions to improve participation of children from poor households.




                                                   16
develop policies to try and improve the enrollment numbers. As of 2013, the government
is finalizing its policy to extend the CCT program coverage to children up to age 18. This
policy change is being made in an effort to provide over-aged children entering the
system with the means to continue their education through high school as well as to
respond to the additional years of schooling in high school as a result of the
implementation of the K-12 program. Cohort survival rate increased from 63.11 percent
in 2003/04 to 78.83 in 2011/12 percent barely missing the revised target of 79.35 percent.
Completion rate increased from 58.22 percent in 2003/04 to 74.23 percent in 2011/12
again, barely missing the revised target of 74.25 percent. Drop-out decreased from 14.3
percent in 2003/04 to 7.82 percent in 2011/12. Again, this trend is positive.

46.    Quality and efficiency. The measure of quality at the elementary level was
measured based on the Grade 6 achievement test for mathematics, Filipino, English and
science, for both elementary and high school.

*The National Education Testing and Research Center test equated to allow valid comparisons across years.
**The 2010/11 scores are being used for actuals due to the fact that for SY 2011/12 the high school test was
administered to year 4 students. Since 2011/12, the national achievement test has assessed Year 4 high school students
instead of Year 2 students. In order to provide a meaningful time trend at the high school level, 2010/11 scores for
Year 2 students are compared with 2006/07 test scores.


47.     Test results at the elementary level have shown improvement in all subjects. In
the case of high school, test results have shown improvements in mathematics, Filipino,
and Hekasi (social science) with some declines in English and science. These
improvements are impressive considering the elementary and high school net enrollment
rates increased and approximately 2.2 million more children were attending school in
2011 than in 2005. In addition, a large proportion of these children are likely to have
come from poorer households where support for education is more limited and factors
associated with dropout and repetition more prevalent. This could explain why there was
some decline in the English and science test scores. Additional evidence for improved
achievement come from the recent SBM impact evaluation, which confirms the


                                                        17
significant and positive impact of SBM on education performance (World Bank and
AusAID 2013). The study measured the impact of SBM on learning outcomes by looking
at the differences in the roll-out of SBM and associated grants between 2006 and 2009.13
The study found that, over three years, the introduction of SBM and the provision of
grants improved scores on the National Achievement Tests (NAT) by 4 to 5 percentage
points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations). In that the NPSBE provided
considerable support to the roll-out of SBM, this is a significant impact for the project
and the BESRA.

48.    Project efficiency indicators selected were measured using the inter-quartile ratio
of pupil to teachers, using the school as the unit of analysis.14 The inter-quartile ratio for
elementary schools decreased from 2.05 in 2003 to 1.95 in 2011 missing the target of
1.50. The inter-quartile ratio for high schools also decreased from 2.53 in 2003 to 2.19 in
2011 missing the target of 2.00.

49.     Although the targets were missed, a study estimated that there were 83,000 excess
teachers in the basic education system (68,000 at elementary and 15,000 at high school)
in 2003/04 (Department of Education, 2005). A follow up study, using 2009/10 data and
the same methodology, showed that the number of excess teachers had declined to around
35,512 basic education teachers (Department of Education, 2012). Assuming this had the
effect of reducing the need for new teachers by an equivalent amount, this would have
reduced the overall salary bill by approximately 10 percent or PHP 12.4 billion.15
While there is no current study available to assess improved distribution of teachers, there
is some evidence that suggests that the allocation of the hardship allowance provided for
multi-grade teachers has ensured that these teachers remain in hardship posts. In addition,
all the new teaching items for multi-grade teachers were the first to be filled by DepEd.
This seems to imply that the hardship pay is having the intended effect of keeping
teachers in remote or difficult-to-reach rural schools as well as encouraging new teachers
to take positions in these ‘hardship’ areas. All these factors combined show the system
has made substantial progress in dealing with the rational distribution of teachers.

50.    Despite reductions in the number of excess teachers, increases in enrollment have
meant that teacher shortages remain. The rapid growth, since 2005, of basic education
enrolment has given rise to an increased need for new teachers. This growing demand has
been filled by shifting excess teachers to schools with deficits as well as by recruiting
additional teachers. These measures have managed to keep student-to-teacher ratios in
elementary and public high schools relatively stable over the NPSBE implementation


13
   Propensity score matching techniques are used to develop an appropriate control group for the study.
14
   This indicator was defined as the proportion of teachers available to most favored 25 percent of students
among individual schools/proportion available to least favored 25 percent. This indicator is based on the
assumption that Improvements in the efficiency of the system can arise if excess teachers are redeployed to
deficit schools or are used to accommodate increased student numbers in new schools/classrooms. This was
to not have any effect on the national student teacher ratio but the expectation was that differences in
school level student teacher ratios would narrow.
15
   This assumes the average teacher salary of PHP 261,376 reported in the latest medium term expenditure
framework (Department of Education, 2012).



                                                    18
period. However, student-to-teacher ratios remain above the level associated with
existing staffing norms. Coupled with rising enrollment, this has meant that the absolute
size of teacher shortages has grown. In 2005, it was estimated that schools had a deficit of
approximately 38,000 teachers but this had grown to 122,000 by 2009. Much of the
increase in the deficit of teachers was at the high school level, where 84,000 teachers
were estimated to be needed to ensure that existing staffing norms were met.

3.3 Efficiency

51.     The reform program introduced in 2006 was underpinned by significant increased
public education spending. Prior to the introduction of BESRA in 2006, public education
spending had been on a downward trend. In real terms, overall spending on education
declined from PHP 155 billion in 2003 to PHP 140 billion in 2005 (constant 2011 prices).
Over the same period, per student spending at the basic education level also fell by 10
percent in real terms (from PHP 7,998 (US$185) to PHP 7,285 (US$168)). However, in
2006, significant increases in public education investment began to reverse these declines.
Between 2005 and 2013, public education spending almost tripled in real terms while
spending per basic education student increased by around two-thirds. This increased
investment had some positive effects on education outcomes; elementary and high school
net enrollment rates increased and approximately 2.2 million more children were
attending school in 2011 than in 2005.

52.     The NPSBE encouraged increased investment in areas that were important to the
success of the reform agenda (e.g. the rolling out of school based management reforms,
classroom construction and textbook provision). As intended, the budget lines that
NPSBE focused on showed significant increases over the implementation period. For
example, maintenance and other operating expenses provided to schools more than
doubled between 2005 and 2012. The analysis reported in Annex 3 shows that support
provided to school based management (e.g. SBM grants) raised learning outcomes in a
cost-effective way. Evidence also shows that the efficiency of the education system is
likely to have been improved through better teacher deployment. In particular, NPSBE
implementation was associated with a decline in the number of ‘excess’ teachers which
reduced system costs. The program also provided significant cost savings in the provision
of textbooks. School construction costs under the program were comparable with other
government-led programs but project construction was assessed to be of higher quality.
Based on the overall efficiency analysis in Annex 3, project efficiency is rated
substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

53.      An overall outcome rating of the project is moderately satisfactory based on the
analysis above, which shows that: (i) the relevance of design and implementation was
substantial; (ii) the PDO was achieved as measured by the significant improvements
related to PDO level indicators and overall upward trends in the education system; and
(iii) the project was implemented efficiently.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     Education participation among poor households in the Philippines lags behind
wealthier households significantly. For example, in 2007, high school net enrollment
rates for children from the poorest 10 percent of households were 87 percent compared
with near universal enrolment for the wealthiest 10 percent. Elements of the program
sought to address these inequalities by expanding access to basic education in
underserved, poor and remote areas. The program also sought to improve the distribution
of teachers to ensure that schools serving poorer sections of the community are
adequately staffed. While the school feeding program, improved during NPSBE, is still
small, it focuses on areas where levels of malnutrition are high. Other efforts by
government are also addressing education deficits of poor households. An impact
evaluation of the national CCT program showed that elementary enrolment and
attendance rates of poor children had improved significantly as a result of the program.
However, the program had a more limited effect on older children partly because its age
limit prevented high school aged children from being supported fully. Efforts are now
underway to raise the age limit to ensure a better fit with high school enrolment patterns.
The overall outcome of these efforts has been a more rapid improvement in school
attendance for the poorest. For example, between 2004 and 2011 attendance rates for 6 to
11 year old children increased by 7.5 percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of
households compared to a less than 1 percentage point increase for children in the
wealthiest 30 percent of households.16

55.     As mentioned, there was a study that found that, over three years, the introduction
of SBM and the provision of grants improved scores on the National Achievement Tests
(NAT) by 4 to 5 percentage points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations).
Interestingly, the mathematics score is more responsive to the education reform than are
other subjects. The analysis also finds that textbooks, instructional training of teachers,
and new classroom construction particularly contributed to these outcomes. The study
also compared students who graduated from schools located in adjacent treatment and
control areas before and after a school intervention, which showed significant differences
in subsequent schooling investments, migration, and labor market earnings between

females and males. That is, females study more (relative to males) and tend to migrate
and earn more if they receive high-quality educational investments at an early stage. The
above results are consistent with females’ greater incentives to study, driven by their
higher returns to schooling, especially after high school completion, observed in the labor
market. 17 The NPSBE has had a positive impact with its support for the
institutionalization of SBM.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

57.     There were six issues identified as risks during project preparation with an overall
rating of moderate. The ratings primarily were related to the reform process
sustainability and commitment; capacity constraints in a decentralized environment and
governance. These risks remain pertinent. Positive developments to mitigate these risks
include the following: (i) DepEd with support from various stakeholders was able to
strengthen capacity, improve overall school-based management and institutionalize a
decentralized system; (ii) government commitment has remained strong as evidenced by
continued improvements to and expansion of the BESRA as well as increased budget
allocations for basic education in support of the reforms; (iii) significant increases within
the education budget for existing programs such as the MOOE, which are critical for
supporting SBM and improved school functioning; (iv) financial management
performance and good governance have improved by the end of the project and are
expected to continue to improve with the introduction or extension of the various
financial, materials and human resource management systems; and (v) stakeholder, donor
and private-sector participation in support of the BESRA continues which is a clear
indication of their support to the reform agenda.

58.    The government remains committed to continuing the BESRA reforms through
the consolidation of the lessons learned and expansion of the system with the K to12
program. The Bank will continue to support the BESRA, at the request of the government,
with a new loan, the Learning, Equity and Accountability Program Support (LEAPS)

project. The LEAPS project will build on the successes of the NPSBE by providing
resources to further support the government’s efforts to improve reading and math skills
with a focus on disadvantaged groups. The main risk for future operations remains the
financial management system. While the government has made progress by re-instituting
the eNGAS, the institutionalization of the program will take time. To mitigate the risk,
the project will reimburse based on achievement of results (Disbursement-Linked
Indicators or DLIs) and not SOEs. Based on these factors, the risk to the development
outcome is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     The project preparation team ensured that the project design was closely aligned
with the BESRA (2006-2010), MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS. Project
preparation started with a pre-identification mission in February 2005, followed by two
additional missions prior to the project’s approval in June 2006. During preparation the
Bank team also used a PHRD grant to conduct studies to inform project design which
included: (i) a review of the SBM framework implemented in earlier projects, (ii) an
assessment of FM, and (iii) a review of teacher competency standards. The PHRD grant
was also used to inform the BESRA by supporting several analytical pieces including: (i)
a Medium Term Spending Plan; (ii) four Education Policy Notes on improving quality,
improving teacher development, SBM, and improving equity; and (iii) a retrospective on
education reform – which looked at why education reforms failed in the past that were
eventually incorporated as lessons learned in the BESRA. BESRA was also supported by
the Bank’s extensive AAA work such as the Retrospective Analysis on Philippine
Education Reforms and the Education Policy Notes which analyzed major issues in the
sector and undertaken in collaboration with key stakeholders. Key innovations like SBM
and systemic reforms including procurement also provided the base for the formulation of
the system wide reform program. The design team organized a series of workshops for
and with the Government (including DepEd, DBM, NEDA and DOF) to formulate the
BESRA. Once BESRA was finalized, the NPSBE components were then selected based
on the BESRA key reform thrusts, hence the project was aligned with the BESRA
components.

60.     The Bank team included the appropriate technical specialists to develop the
project. The team also actively engaged the Technical Coordinating Team of DepED
through workshops and discussions on the design, content, and implementation
arrangements of the project. Consultations were held with oversight agencies of the
government as well as other donors, who expressed interest in re-aligning their projects
with the BESRA and explore opportunities for co-financing and technical assistance. The
development objectives, monitoring indicators and line items to be financed by the
project were also discussed and agreed upon, and were in line with the overarching
objectives of the BESRA. The Bank, working with the government, incorporated
mainstreaming of project implementation into the daily responsibilities of DepEd’s


                                          22
central, regional and division staff. It also incorporated the use of country systems of
procurement and financial management, which was initiated in our SEMP projects.
These projects were implemented by DepEd using regular/organic staff and DBM
ensuring the institutionalization and mainstreaming of policies/programs, and building
implementation capacity and management oversight of implementing agencies.          The
project underwent a thorough QER process and the project team included the
recommendations. The results framework was aligned with the BESRA but the initial
targets established were too ambitious.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    As previously mentioned, there were nine Bank review and implementation
support missions from the period September 2007 through March 2012, with a final
BESRA review mission in August 2012. The project team was actively engaged in
supporting the government in its efforts to implement the project. The country-based
team comprised the appropriate technical experts and missions always included fiduciary
and safeguards staff, as well as civil works, data management, teacher development and
school-based management consultants when appropriate.

62.     In July 2007, AusAID gave an AUD 41 million trust fund (Support to Philippine
Basic Education Reforms – SPHERE), in support of BESRA and to complement the
NPSBE activities. The trust fund was to be administered by the Bank. Once the trust fund
was provided, all subsequent missions were conducted jointly with AusAID
representatives and technical experts. Other donors such as GTZ, ADB, JICA, UNICEF
and USAID also participated in select missions. This attests to the efforts made by the
Bank supervision team to implement the project in a participatory and inclusive way, and
which ultimately helped streamline donor interventions in the education sector in support
of the BESRA. The team also used the SPHERE trust fund and the Bank’s programmatic
budget to help the Government address challenges in implementing the NPSBE
components as well as the BESRA through several just-in-time technical assistance and
analytical work. Key to the project’s ultimate achievements is the task team’s presence on
the ground, which allowed for a constant and open dialogue with government
counterparts and donors. The access to the Bank’s expertise and technical assistance was
repeatedly mentioned by the government as having had an important impact on their day-
to-day work. The Bank team based in the country proved particularly crucial to resolving
bottlenecks and accelerating implementation during project start-up and led to the project
being 100 percent disbursed by the closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.   Based on the Bank’s quality at entry, the supervision discussion, and project
outcomes above, overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.




                                           23
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.      The government, through its various departments and commissions, provided the
necessary technical and financial support to DepEd to ensure implementation, and
showed its commitment to and comprehension of the project’s objectives. The
Department of Budget and Management, through the General Appropriations Act,
maintained the budget line items of SBM, the school accreditation program, hardship
allowance, ALS, and policy formulation, program planning and standards development
for elementary education. The COA reviewed DepEd’s financial statements regularly and
provided its opinions in a transparent way. The National Economic and Development
Authority prepared the 2011-2016 “Philippine Development Plan? that included support
for ALS and CCT. While the various government agencies supported the NPSBE and
BESRA, some decisions hampered project performance such as: (i) delays in implanting
eNGAS after its development in 2001, culminating in a temporary suspension in 2008;
(ii) re-institution of selective pre-audits of cash advances and school construction; and
(iii) delays in Special Allotment Release Orders or Notice of Cash Allowance for some
key budget items. Based on this, the government’s performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     DepEd, through its various bureaus and technical working groups, continued its
support for the implementation and operationalization of the project and the BESRA. As
mentioned previously, DepEd was able to address bottlenecks that hampered
implementation and reached 100 percent of disbursement by project closing. As part of
the BESRA, it was able to roll out and institutionalize school-based management,
promote teacher quality and standards development, significantly increase the teacher
workforce to deal with the influx of new students, and promote all-inclusive education for
minorities (see Annex 2 for complete list of achievements). These are impressive
accomplishments. However, throughout implementation financial management and
procurement issues slowed implementation, and adherence to reporting requirements was
delayed during the first half of project implementation. Based on these implementation
issues, DepEd’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.    Based on the implementation analysis above, overall Borrower performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Lesson 1. The institutionalization of reforms requires a long-term commitment on
the part of government and the donor community to support the reform agenda.


                                           24
DepEd has remained committed to BESRA for eight years. The sustained commitment
has allowed for the key areas of decentralization, professional development, learning
strategies, access to education and organizational development to move forward. It
addition, it has allowed the government to coordinate donor support around the BESRA
which has also contributed to the continuation of the reform agenda. DepED has gathered
lessons learned from implementation of the reform programs related to the five KRTs and
is now integrating those lessons into the BESRA. These lessons are now paving the way
for DepEd to take a more integrated approach to the reform agenda outlined within the
BESRA.

Lesson 2. SBM is an important tool for decentralizing an education system and
improving learning outcomes. SBM has had a substantial impact on the improvements
at the school level throughout the Philippines. Schools are now systematically preparing
SIPs, schools have governing councils and school report cards; and they have been
oriented to simplified accounting procedures. There is solid evidence from the recent
SBM impact evaluation that schools with SBM experience improved achievement. While
SBM systems are in place there is still some work to be done in terms of the
strengthening of the roles of the governing councils specifically as they relate to
accountability as well as increasing community participation.

Lesson 3. Public private partnerships are important for ensuring the long-term
availability of adequate resources to support community schools. The introduction
and institutionalization of school-level planning and decision making has had positive
effect on their ability to raise funds from the private sector in support of their school
needs. Especially in cases where government assistance is not sufficient to address all the
needs of a school, securing additional funds to leverage government assistance can have a
positive effect on school functioning and performance. Schools now have their SIPs to
keep communities informed of school needs. Again, it will take more time for the private
sector to become fully engaged but systems are now in place through the support of the
NPSBE.

Lesson 4. Solid analytical studies on system reforms during the implementation
period are essential for making appropriate decisions on the elimination of
bottlenecks to the reform agenda. With support from the NPSBE, SPHERE, Bank,
AusAID and other donors, there was an on-going attempt to provide real time evaluations
and studies to inform the implementation of the BESRA. Joint supervision missions
identified problems and then mobilized the resources to study the issues and provide
recommendations to DepEd on needed policy changes to improve the system. In many
instances DepEd made the needed changes that led to improved implementation.

Lesson 5. Strong financial management systems are critical for ensuring the efficient
use and accounting of resources. Lack of a fully functioning financial management
system led to reporting delays and audit problems for the BESRA and NPSBE. Once the
eNGAS is fully institutionalized the reporting problems should improve. However, there
is still need for increased utilization of the eNGAS system.




                                            25
Lesson 6. A report-based disbursement system is more efficient than a Statement of
Expenses disbursement system for a large education bureaucracy. The DepEd covers
approximately 46,000 schools, 500,000 teachers, 19 million students, and 200 divisions.
The use of statements of expenditures for withdrawal application was cumbersome and
slowed implementation. The new Bank-supported LEAPS project will use disbursement
linked indicators in an effort to reduce the number of required financial transactions.

Lesson 7. Bank support can play an important role in leveraging money for
government policy reforms. The NPSBE project was a small percentage of the overall
education however, it was very important for leveraging other donor assistance for the
BESRA and moving the reform agenda forward. The drawback to developing projects
that support a national level program is that often the projects need to adopt the national
targets which could be too ambitious for an individual project. This was the case for the
NPSBE.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Strengthened School-Based Management (SBM) (US$71 million).

1.     This component is designed to support the implementation of school-based
management (SBM), legislated in The Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001
(known as RA 9155), with the primary target group being the school and its community.
Four subcomponents were developed to support component 1: (i) develop school-
community partnerships; (ii) establish a structure of support and accountability; (iii)
capacity building; and (iv) ensure quality and equity at the school-level.

2.       Sub-component 1.1: Develop school-community partnerships. The following
activities were to be supported: (i) fostering mechanisms for forming school-community
partnerships18 for all schools/school clusters; (ii) developing corresponding policies and
guidelines to support the new mechanisms; (iii) providing School First Initiative grants19
to help schools establish SBM; and (iv) establishing mechanisms to pursue enhanced
school representation on local school boards with the intention of influencing and
monitoring the use of the Special Education Fund (SEF).20

3.      The following indicators were used to track progress: (i) schools/clusters with a
SIP; and (ii) schools/clusters meeting SBM criteria, which were both exceeded.
Schools/clusters with SIP stand at 90.76 percent compared to the 80 percent target, while
81 percent of schools meet SBM criteria compared to the 75 percent target. The
achievement of the outputs is as follows: (i) the government has put in place an effective
way to establish a participatory mechanism that involves School Governing Councils,
Parent-Teacher Associations, local government officials (i.e. Barangay captains, mayors,
municipal counselors etc.) and student council members; (ii) school first grants were
provided for the establishment of SBM and now 90.76 percent of schools use SIPs, which
is an indication of the institutionalization of SBM; and (iii) SEF funds are collected and
allocated to schools albeit with uneven practice. The SEF funds are to be distributed 100
percent to schools to fund activities included in the SIPs. However, local governments
and communities are not completely active in the development of SIPs, which limits their
understanding of school needs and impacts the distribution and use of the funds. Local
governments also have, in some cases, not distributed the funds only to schools. To
clarify the utilization of SEF funds, an inter-agency committee, which included DepEd,
drafted a joint memorandum circular on the proper use of SEFs which should remedy this
issue. Furthermore, the SBM approach continues to be strengthened and is expected to
improve over time, leading to increased proper use of SEFs. In 2011, 13,025 schools had
received SBM grants and by project closing, 100 percent of the US$25 million allocated


18
   For instance School Governing Councils or Parent-Teacher-Community Associations, use of School
Improvement Plans (SIPs), schools reporting to their communities, etc.
19
   “School First Initiative? grants were renamed after project approval to become “SBM grants?.
20
   The SEF funds are earmarked for education from the local taxes. This fund is designed to be 1 percent of
the annual taxes collected at the local level.




                                                    28
for SBM had been disbursed. Further achievements under this sub-component included
the establishment of the SBM mechanism and SIP implementation.

4.       Sub-component 1.2: Establish a structure of support and accountability. This
sub-component focused on: (i) supporting a guaranteed School-level Maintenance and
Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) allocation to schools with progressive increases
based on school needs, equity, and performance 21 against SIPs. To be eligible to manage
MOOE funds schools had to meet prescribed readiness criteria. 22 Indicators to track
progress were: (i) proportion of schools receiving an MOOE allocation at the school
level; (ii) schools/clusters eligible to receive school grants; and (iii) schools/clusters with
adequate FM systems.

5.      The targets for the outputs were exceeded: (i) all high schools considered to be
implementing units (i.e. who have FM staff) and all elementary schools and the rest of
the high schools (released through the divisions) received the school MOOEs. In an effort
to make the MOOE allocation more equitable, in 2012, DepEd implemented an equity-
based formula formulated in 2011.23 At the same time, the DepEd allocation for MOOEs
had more than tripled. In 2013 alone, the MOOE allocations have increased from Php 9
billion to Php 12 billion. This was the result of the project having successfully mobilized
additional analytical support that showed the importance of MOOE to schools.
Beneficiaries indicate that MOOEs are a critical element to ensuring proper functioning
of their schools. There are a small number of schools that have indicated they are not
collecting their MOOE allocations. To mitigate any potential distribution issues related to
MOOE, DepEd is now listing MOOE allocations on its webpage for full transparency.24
Other indicators show that 76 percent of schools/clusters are eligible to receive school
grants, exceeding the target of 65 percent. Furthermore, 88 percent of school heads have
been trained in Simplified Accounting Procedures (SAP), and have adequate financial
management systems in place, exceeding the 65 percent target. In additional to these
achievements, DepEd received technical assistance and financial support from AusAID
to develop a Financial Management Information System (FMIS). This system had to be
put on hold pending the development of the government wide FMIS.



21
   This statement does not reflect the reality on the ground: MOOE were never allocated based on school
performance, but could be utilized to finance activities included in the SIP. Therefore, the ICR is not
including the project’s compliance with “MOOE allocation based on school performance? in its analysis.
22
   For instance, a mechanism for partnership and shared decision-making with the community, a functional
SIP, an acceptable system for financial accountability, a school head trained in SBM, and a strategy for
reporting to the community.
23
   The study on the equitable allocation of MOOE considered the variables that will capture the size of the
student clientele (i.e., school population), the socio-economic status of the locality (e.g., the level of SEF
extended to basic education) where geographical and income concerns can be taken into account, and the
education performance of the locality (e.g., a composite index of participation, completion and
achievement)
24
     Beneficiaries have reported a few reasons for not collecting or receiving the MOOEs. These include: (i) capacity
constraints with the liquidation of funds, (ii) insufficient MOOE allocations for small schools making travel
to collect the funds more expensive than the actual MOOE allocation; (iii) divisions resistant to
decentralizing funds management to schools; etc.



                                                          29
6.     Sub-component 1.3: Capacity building. Funding was meant for: (i) training to
develop the capacity of school heads to operate effectively in a decentralized and self-
managing school environment; and (ii) capacity building at regional and divisional levels
through formal and on-the-job training.

7.       Progress was measured through the indicator “schools/clusters where school
heads have been trained on SBM?. The target was exceeded with DepEd reporting that
96.61 percent of school heads were trained on SBM surpassing the target of 85 percent.
Capacity building activities on SBM implementation have been successfully carried out
at the different levels of the education system through trainings and orientations to
strengthen their ability to effectively play their respective roles in a decentralized
environment. This is a remarkable achievement. However, there exists a need to continue
to clarify the SBM approach and provide technical assistance to all school heads, teachers
and other stakeholders to maximize the benefits of this tool, and to avoid it becoming just
another processing step.

8.      Sub-component 1.4: Ensure quality and equity at the school-level. This sub-
component aimed to: (i) devising a mechanism (e.g., a School Report Card - SRC) for the
school to report to its community on levels of inputs and outputs/outcomes and help
ensure progress toward nationally defined standards; (ii) tracking and assisting students at
risk, based on strategies developed and tested in the Philippines by UNICEF’s Child
Friendly School (CFS) Program; and (iii) using feedback on national assessment data to
improve teaching and learning.

9.      The indicators used to track progress were: (i) schools/clusters using SRCs and
(ii) divisions engaged in tracking students at risk. These indicators have also been
exceeded, with 97.85 percent of schools using the revised SRCs against the 75 percent
target, and 90.21 percent of divisions tracking students at risk compared to the 33 percent
target.25 In addition, the National Achievement Test is being used to inform teaching and
learning practices through in-service teacher training, classroom observations and the
Teacher Strengths and Needs Assessment (TSNA).

10.     Although the targets have been exceeded, there are still some areas for
improvement as DepEd begins to consolidate lesson learned from implementation of
SBM. SBM components are interlinked with schools developing a SIP, a SRC and
receiving training in SAP. While SBM has made great progress, some schools still have a
limited understanding of how these components are interlinked. Without the SIP and
SRC, schools experience limitations in their ability to respond to the community and
stakeholders about school performance. It also affects their capacity to make well-
informed, evidence-based school management decisions. It will take more time for the
full institutionalization of SBM and its components, however, as the indicators show,
there has been much progress under the NPSBE. There has also been an increase in the



25
 The indicator combines “students at risk of dropping out – SARDO? and “pupils at risk of dropping out –
PARDO? to capture both formal and non-formal learners.



                                                  30
number of schools tracking students and pupils at risk of dropping out. This improved
system has provided the government with relevant information to allocate appropriate
resources to schools and programs that support at-risk students and pupils. This process is
expected to be greatly facilitated by the government’s introduction of the “Learner
Reference Number?, a unique number assigned to each learner whether enrolled in
formal or non-formal education programs.

Component 2: Improved Teaching Effectiveness (US$23 million)

11.     This component focused on improving teaching effectiveness by refining current
work on teacher competency standards, and then applying the standards to performance
appraisal, training needs, promotion, hiring practices, pre-service training and licensing.
A second aspect was to achieve a more equitable distribution of teachers by applying
principles identified by DepEd for their deployment. The target group for Component 2
comprises basic education teachers, including those working in the Alternative Learning
System Program (ALS). Two sub-components were developed: (i) pilot implementation
of professional standards for teachers and (ii) teacher deployment.

12.     Sub-component 2.1: Professional standards for teachers. A framework for
defining national competency-based teacher standards had been developed by the
DepEd’s Teacher Education and Development Program (TEDP). The NPSBE was to
support: (i) the trial of these professional standards for teachers and their application to
performance appraisal at a local level; and (ii) the application of professional standards to
division hiring practices, and to bring pre-service teacher training into line with
competency-based standards.

13.     Indicators to track progress included: (i) percent of teachers by division meeting
defined competency-based standards; (ii) teacher performance standards developed and
agreed; (iii) divisions where CBTS is used in at least 50 percent of schools; (iv) CBTS
applied to pre-service training; (v) CBTS used in promotion and hiring; and (vi) number
of training materials delivered to schools and numbers of in-service programs delivered
by region to achieve competency-based standards for teachers. This sub-component has
been partially achieved: (i) 100 percent of teachers have been assessed against
competency-based standards, and assessment results used to develop the “Individual Plan
for Professional Development? (IPPD) and the School Plan for Professional Development
(SPPD); (ii) teacher performance standards have been developed, agreed and rolled out,
including a three-year training and development plan for all regions; (iii) 175 divisions or
38,033 schools reported that they actively apply NCBTS-TSNA as well as the IPPD
toolkit; (iv) approximately 90 percent of teacher education institutions have included
NCBTS in their curriculum; and (v) DepEd has issued an order mandating the use of
NCBTS for hiring and promotion purposes, including recognition of on-the-job
experience by Mobile and ALS teachers.

14.    To facilitate the collection and analysis of competency data in the future, DepEd
has piloted the “Competency-based Performance Appraisal System for Teachers – CB-
PAST?. Even though no specific data exists on the number of training materials and in-
service programs having been delivered, field interviews and discussions with local

                                             31
DepEd officials confirm that numerous trainings have been carried out and materials
provided. 26 Given the recent introduction of NCBTS and TSNA, the utility and
application of these two tools is yet to be fully institutionalized. Some teachers are still
not preparing individual professional development plans based on the competencies and
some school development plans do not include teacher training needs. While the NCBTS
has been developed, there is a need to ascertain the extent to which teacher training
institutions follow the competency-based approach in their classrooms. At the time of the
ICR, the national information system that could track resources and trainings provided
has yet to be put in place. This hampers DepEd’s ability to track activities and collect
valuable information resulting from such trainings. DepEd, with AusAID support, has
piloted a “Training and Development Information System? (TDIS) in Regions 6, 7 and 8,
which includes an inventory of training, research and development activities conducted at
the regional levels and features an e-consolidation tool to align the TSNA with this new
information system.

15.     Sub-component 2.2: Teacher deployment. This component aimed at addressing
factors that hinder equitable deployment of teachers especially to hard-to-reach areas and
limited mobility in the education system. Despite DepEd’s efforts to remedy the
deployment issue through specific orders, significant imbalances remained and more
aggressive deployment decisions were needed. The project sought to: (i) develop
guidelines for five-year rolling plans for staffing within divisions (including the option of
using a refined formula-based GAA teacher allocation system); (ii) finance hardship
allowances (already in the DepEd budget) for teachers required to move to designated
hard-to-staff schools; (iii) eventually cover transfer costs or support incentive schemes to
attract teachers to hard-to-staff locations and also to attract teachers in hard-to-staff
subjects such as Mathematics and Science; and (iv) support the development of policy
changes so that new teacher appointments and transfers are no longer tied to schools.

16.     Indicators to track this component were: (i) 5-year staffing plan devised for
allocation and redeployment of teachers; (ii) percent reduction of teachers in excess and
percent reduction in schools with teacher shortage, by division; (iii) improved equity in
pupil/teacher ratios; and (iv) strategies devised for teachers’ compensation, incentives
and benefits. This sub-component has been partially achieved: (i) a 5-year staffing
plan has not been developed; (ii) no data was available at the time of the ICR but overall
number of excess teachers have decreased (see paragraph 18); (iii) the mean pupil/teacher
ratio in SY2011/12 was at 37:1 for public schools, and data shows an improvement of the
pupil-teacher ratio of the top 25 percentile point of the respective distribution, which
showed a decreased pupil-teacher ratio from 43:1 to 40.37:1 in elementary and from 45:1
to 42.03:1 in high school; and (iv) incentive schemes have been developed, including the
revision of hardship allowance guidelines and amounts.




26
  DepEd did carry out an inventory of in-service training programs having been provided but no detailed
information was available at the time of the ICR.



                                                   32
17.      Although a 5-year staffing plan was not developed, DepEd continues to use a
color-coded scheme and the results of the NCBTS-TSNA to identify staffing needs and
hire additional teachers. In fact, all teacher positions provided by the DBM in 2012 have
been filled and an additional 61,000 have been allocated for the 2013 fiscal year.
Furthermore, the project helped mobilize support to identify causes for deployment
delays, which found political interferences and non-DepEd related administrative delays
as some of the main reasons. This analysis led to policy changes and ultimately a
reduction in the time it takes to send a teacher to his/her posting from a maximum of two
years to six months, which is a substantial efficiency gain. However, some regions
continue to report difficulties in filling teacher vacancies. To address these issues, the
government has increased the hardship allowance amounts, and introduced a transfer
allowance on a pilot basis. As a result, the percent of excess teachers has decreased from
approximately 78,000 in SY 2003/04 to 35,500 in SY 2009/10. Another step was the
revision of its incentives schemes, which included merit increase criteria, performance
incentives and hazard pay. These revisions, together with the CBTS, have positively
contributed to the application of merit-based hiring, promotions and compensation;
facilitated the transfer of teachers; and promoted the application of quality standards.

Component 3: Enhanced quality and equity through standards, assessment and
support (US$96 million).

18.     First, the NPSBE aimed to support the development of nationwide standards for
key learning areas based on the Revised Basic Education Curriculum (RBEC). Standards
would also be set for inputs (such as classrooms, textbooks, student readiness,
community participation, and MOOE). Second, under the Quality Assurance framework,
support was to be provided to assist achievement of the standards through financing
teacher in-service training, key textbooks, teaching materials and classroom construction
and rehabilitation. Third, a comprehensive Information Communications Technology
(ICT) framework was to be developed to encompass, for example, teaching and learning,
management information, financial accounting, human resource management and results
of student assessment.

19.    Sub-component 3.1: National Standards Framework: National strategies
would be developed and implemented to support the teaching of English, the Filipino
language, and mathematics and science, and standards developed based on the Revised
Basic Education Curriculum. These standards were to be incorporated into existing
teacher support materials, teacher professional development, and the national assessment.

20.     Indicators used to measure progress were: (i) national strategies and action plan
(including teaching materials) implemented; (ii) English proficiency for teachers
improved; (iii) student achievement standards defined; and (iv) schools receive feedback
from the national assessment. This sub-component has been met: (i) the government
has developed teaching and learning strategies in English, mathematics and science as
well as introduced the following three major strategies affecting basic education: (a) the
universalization of Kindergarten through the introduction of the “Kindergarten to Grade
12 Program (K to 12)?, making it officially part of the basic education cycle, hiring and
training teachers and the development of a Kindergarten curriculum; (b) the revision of

                                           33
the entire basic education curriculum content and framework to accommodate the K to12
and revised ALS programs, the grades 1 – 10 learning competencies, and the
development of an assessment framework; (c) the piloting of MTB-MLE in 20 national
languages in 921 schools nationwide, accompanied by the development of supporting
materials for teaching and learning in the 12 main languages, basic literacy materials for
indigenous peoples as well as training programs for 2,557 Kindergarten and grade 1
teachers in MTB-MLE teaching methodology; and (d) the distribution of approximately
16.5 million textbooks and teachers manuals for high school English, mathematics, social
sciences and science and technology (financed under sub-component 3.2); (ii) the
administration of the “English Proficiency and Process Skills? for teachers to inform in-
service teacher training and strengthen their English language skills; (iii) a policy is in
place that defines student achievement standards, which was revised as part of the K to
12 program to include the additional two years of high school; and (iv) schools receive
feedback through their division offices or can access the results of the National
Achievement Test (NAT) on the National Educational Testing and Research Center’s
(NETRC) website. The different test results and assessment outcomes are also used to
adjust DepEd’s annual in-service teacher training programs, adjust teachers’ TSNA
results as well as update/complement instruction materials.

21.     In addition to these achievements, the government introduced a unified schools
standards assessment tool that is applicable to both elementary and high schools
(Philippines Accreditation System for Basic Education – PASBE), facilitating the level of
compliance with service standards by schools nationwide. The government has also
increased financial and technical support for its equity-based interventions (Alternative
Learning Modes and Alternative Learning Systems) to keep at-risk children from
dropping out.

22.     Although school feedback is being provided, there still exist some difficulty in
fully aligning test results with teacher improvement and capacity strengthening activities.

23.     Sub-component 3.2: Quality Assurance Framework: The NPSBE was to
finance the development of explicit national standards for (a) inputs including physical
infrastructure, staffing (see 2.2), curriculum, textbooks, instructional materials, school
management, student readiness, community partnership, and financial support; and (b)
outcomes including participation, completion and student achievement as measured by
national assessment tests.

24.     Indicators to track progress were: (i) all regions monitor performance and report
to DepEd on performance improvements; (ii) annual report from regional offices
summarizing their work with divisions and supervisors to support schools not achieving
outcome targets; (iii) national standards framework developed for inputs (minimum
service standards) and outcomes (participation, completion, achievement); and (iv)
divisions and schools received feedback from EMIS.




                                            34
25.      This sub-component has been met: (i) performance reporting is made available
in real-time through the enhanced Basic Education Information System (e-BEIS), which
includes school-level data;27 (ii) all 17 regions provide progress reports to DepEd on their
regional performance as well as technical assistance provided to their own divisions;28
(iii) the adoption of the “Quality Assurance and Accountability Framework – QAAF? in
2010, along with the roll-out of PASBE, laid the foundation for re-defining school input
standards (including textbooks, school infrastructure, teachers, teaching materials etc.).
Output standards have also been developed as part of the Education for All National Plan
for Action and the Millennium Development Goal commitments of the government, and
revised during the preparation of the 2011-2016 Philippine Development Plan; and (iv)
the roll out of the e-BEIS nationwide has allowed central offices to upload the
information they received from schools on enrollment, dropouts, graduates etc., allowing
schools to access the information directly or for divisions to download and share the
information with their respective schools. This exceeds the target of 75 percent of
divisions receiving EMIS feedback. Furthermore, the project has supported the
rehabilitation of 13,659 classrooms and constructed 4,813 new ones, and financed the
acquisition and distribution of approximately 16.5 million textbooks and teachers’
manuals in social science, English, mathematics and science and technology.

26.      To support the tracking of adherence to the established standards, DepEd 29 is
setting up a harmonized monitoring and evaluation system to combine the different
systems that were developed by different donors and government agencies. The
government, with AusAID support, has also embarked on an effort to harmonize the
different performance frameworks to come up with a unified outcomes framework to
facilitate DepEd’s ability to evaluate its products and services and lead to a “National
Policy for Monitoring and Evaluation?. In addition to the e-BEIS, the government is
developing additional information systems30 in the areas of human resource management,
learning materials and financial management, which is expected to further support the
government’s ability to make informed policy and resource allocation decisions.

27.    Sub-component 3.3: ICT Policy. The NPSBE aimed to support the further
development, communication, and application of the framework to cover uses of ICT in


27
   Regions use “Budget Execution Documents – BEDs? and Budget Accountability Reports (BARs), which
report on the financial versus physical outputs of each government entity, and is used to inform/adjust
financial and physical targets (as reported in the annual Agency Performance Monitoring Framework).
28
   A mechanism for systemizing the provision of technical assistance by regional offices to divisions has
been established and is expected to contribute to the improvement of the “Regional Education
Development Plan – REDP. Three pilot regions (Region 6, 7 and 8) have institutionalized a “Regional
Monitoring Evaluation and Adjustment – RMEA? process, which feeds into REDP and which is expected
to be rolled out nationwide.
29
   The World Bank provided training to 48 DepEd central office staff in impact evaluation and 181 DepEd
central and regional staff on how to set up a proper M&E system.
30
   The additional systems are: (i) “School Information System?, which will be integrated into the “Learner
Information System? and which currently holds information on 20 million learners nationwide; (ii) “Human
Recourses Information System?, currently on hold due to plans to roll out a different system; (iii) “Learning
Resource Materials Development System?, (iv) “Asset Management System? and (v) “Project Monitoring
Information System?



                                                    35
ways that promote the BESRA, including teaching and learning; student assessment and
feedback; professional development including e-learning modules for school heads and
teachers; management information; human resource management; communication
including e-mail, DepEd orders and other DepEd website information; QA monitoring;
document tracking; and financial monitoring.

28.    Progress was measured by: (i) ICT policy framework developed; and (ii) policy
implemented. This sub-component has been met: an ICT policy was developed and in
place by year 1 of the project, and subsequently updated in 2011. This was done as part
of DepEd’s push to maximize the potential of ICT for attaining the country’s basic
education goals (teaching and learning, student assessment, human resource management,
professional development, etc.). Part of the revised ICT framework is the
development/implementation of the information systems mentioned under sub-
component 3.2, as well as the “ICT for Governance? system to facilitate collecting,
archiving and analyzing data for a more transparent and efficient bureaucracy.

29.     Component 4: Effective Resource Mobilization (US$2 million). NPSBE
provided support to policy development on strategic budget planning through multi-year
estimates for a simplified budget encompassing' fixed and recurrent costs plus financing
for key sector-wide reforms.

30.     Sub-component 4.1: Financing framework and budget process. The NPSBE
supported: (i) a follow-up of work already completed under the Spending Plan to provide
a rational and realistic appraisal of education system needs in line with the BESRA
reform agenda; (ii) the promotion of strategies to expand the LGU contribution to basic
education and to link it with local priorities and assessed needs as defined by schools and
their communities in their SIPs.

31.     This sub-component was tracked through the following sub-components: (i)
percent increase in SEF and increased proportion flowing to school-led priorities; (ii) cost
sharing between GOP and LGU applied to classroom construction, including equity
factors; and (iii) financing framework developed. This sub-component has been met: (i)
even though no recent data was available, 2001 – 2008 information shows that SEF funds
have steadily increased by an average of 8.5 percent annually, and beneficiary feedback
confirms that funds are being transferred to schools to finance school improvement
activities; (ii) project-financed classroom construction was done with buy-in and
contributions (in-kind or cash) by the local stakeholders and based on the “Statement of
Interest?; and (iii) in line with the BESRA/K to12 Program, the 2012-2017 “Medium-
Term Spending Plan for Basic Education? was finalized, which provides a realistic initial
assessment of the education system needs and includes an analysis on cost requirements
for the K to 12 program. As part of its financial management strengthening initiative, the
development of a “Financial Management Information System? (FMIS), was initiated
and is being funded by AusAID.

32.     Although there is evidence that SEFs are being transferred to most schools, some
report these funds are not always being provided in full or in line with the school’s
priorities. Therefore, an inter-government agency circular in 2011 was formulated and is

                                            36
currently being discussed, which would provide for the use of the SIP as basis for
resource allocation and reporting on the utilization of the SEF. This would also represent
an important addition to the support already being provided through SBM grants and
MOOE. Furthermore, delays in developing the FMIS and Financial Management
Operations Manual have hampered improvements in the control environment of DepEd.

33.      Sub-component 4.2: Demand-side financing. DepEd currently administers a
few national programs to support needy communities and to encourage student
participation, retention and completion in basic education. In other cases, local
communities respond to demand-side financing through corporate, NGO or other support.
The project aimed at supporting: (i) a review of current schemes on demand-side
financing; (ii) development of guidelines for effective demand-side financing of basic
education in the Philippines; and (iii) finance school feeding programs or similar
initiatives at a later stage.

34.     The following indicators tracked progress of this sub-components: (i) demand-
side financing mechanisms introduced to support needy students and their families; and
(ii) percent of schools by division providing assistance for needy students from (a)
national programs; and (b) local sources.

35.    The sub-component has been met: (i) the government, with donor support,
conducted reviews of several of its demand-side financing schemes, which led to: (a) the
elimination of the “Food for School? program;31 and the subsequent development of a
revised, government-led school feeding program, which was approved for reimbursement
under the project and which provided guidelines for all future school feeding programs;
(b) the expansion of the “Education Service Contracting - ESC? scheme – see sub-
component 4.3; and (c) the introduction of new programs such as the “Conditional Cash
Transfer - CCT? program32 , which is the government’s flagship program in terms of
demand-side financing and provision of support to needy students and families; and (ii)
42 percent of public schools participate in the CCT program.

36.   The project also ensured a strong link and coordination existed between the
demand-side interventions provided under the CCT program and the supply-side


31
   In its place, the NPSBE supported a small school feeding program pilot that worked through schools and
supported school based management reforms. The pilot, in 3 provinces, provided grants to schools to
organize a school feeding program and was focused on areas where levels of malnourishment were high.
The pilot gradually expanded and the number of beneficiaries increased from approximately 23,000 in 2010
to 40,000 in 2013.
32
   The program is also referred to as the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program, or “4Ps program?, which
provides financial incentives for students to stay in school and also includes a school-feeding component as
well. The age eligibility criterion to benefit from the 4Ps program has been adjusted upwards to reflect the
fact that many beneficiaries include overage children and therefore graduate at a later age. The program
was developed on the basis of extensive Bank technical assistance to the government and analysis, leading
to the piloting and subsequently nationwide expansion of the CCT program. DepEd has also committed
Php 988 million for 2012 for the construction of 1,452 classrooms and the hiring of 600 teachers in the 4Ps
areas.



                                                    37
interventions provided under the project. Although no information is available on the
percentage of schools supporting needy students from local sources, DepEd has expanded
the use of SBM grants for school-feeding purposes if included in their SIPs. Furthermore,
DepEd has reintroduced its own school-feeding program targeting food-poor schools
through the “Vegetable Gardening in the School - Gulayan sa Paaralan? 33 program.
Although no new guidelines for effective demand-side financing of basic education were
developed during the life of the project, existing ones such as the ESC were reviewed and
subsequently improved.

37.     Sub-component 4.3: Private sector participation. This sub-component focused
on private sector participation in basic education initially through expansion of the
existing Education Service Contracting (ESC) scheme at the high school level, and
subsequently through extension of the scheme or an alternative option to include
elementary schooling, pre-schooling, and Alternative Learning System (non-formal
education) for those who have not completed a full cycle of basic education. The project
was to support: (i) the financing of a review of Government Assistance to Students and
Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE) and alternatives; (ii) assistance with the
development of a policy and regulatory framework for local private sector involvement;
and (iii) expansion of PPP schemes of various types, including ICT partnerships

38.     Only one indicator was used to track progress: “private sector participation policy
reviewed?, which was achieved: A “Roadmap for Basic Education? was developed by
the private sector led by the League of Corporate Foundations in collaboration with the
DepEd and the WB which has helped align private sector support for basic education
with the BESRA key reform thrusts. This is an organic document and being reviewed and
refined on a regular basis. Furthermore, the ESC scheme, which is under the “Public-
Private Partnership? (PPP) umbrella, was reviewed in 2010 and found to be cost effective.
This resulted in an increase of the ESC program budget allocation from Php 5.8 billion in
2010 to Php 6.3 billion in 2011 to Php7 billion in 2013, and an increase in the subsidy of
Php 6,500 (up from Php 5,000) per student in high school for SY 2012-2013. Based on
M&E data, DepEd was able to assess the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its service
contracting programs in the different levels and adjust funding for less effective and cost-
efficient programs.

39.    Furthermore, support was mobilized for: (i) the government to review the
Education Service Contracting Program under the GASTPE, which guided the
formulation of a new DepEd order on GASTPE for SY 2010-2011 and 2011-2012; (ii)
the expansion and/or improvement of some of the Alternative Delivery Mode schemes
including the “Open High School Program? (an alternative learning program) for SY
2012-2013, (iii) the government to establish a regulatory framework on private sector
involvement; and (iv) the expansion of the number of PPP such as the “Adopt a School
Program? for Php 921 million worth in pledges, the “Ten Moves!? program to help build
10,000 classrooms and the “PPP for School Infrastructure Project? to build 9,332 new


33
     This program was developed by DepEd and in partnership with the Department of Agriculture.



                                                    38
classrooms under a Build-Lease-Transfer program. Apart from infrastructure PPPs,
DepEd is currently working with the Asian Development Bank on schemes to support the
delivery of the Senior High School program. These PPPs are ongoing and have resulted
in a very significant increase in resources available for schools.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic rationale for the NPSBE is based on the expected payoffs of
support to BESRA reforms in terms of accelerated economic and social development,
improved efficiency and lower inequality. These payoffs will result from increased access
to good quality basic education which has been shown to raise economic growth rates and
improve other development outcomes. The NPSBE contributes to the broader BESRA
reform agenda by supporting a number of measures to increase basic education access
and quality as well as strategies aimed at making public education investments more cost-
effective.

2.      The economic and financial analysis in the original PAD did not contain a
calculation of the overall project economic rate of return. The economic and financial
analysis of the ICR focuses on assessing the extent to which public investment in
education increased and how the efficiency of the system has changed. It also compares
project costs with a number of alternatives and where possible assesses the cost-
effectiveness of the reforms that were supported.

3.      The reform program introduced in 2006 was underpinned by significant increased
public education spending. This reversed a decline in public education investment in the
early 2000s and supported a significant expansion in basic education enrolments.

4.      The NPSBE encouraged increased investment in areas that were important to the
success of the reform agenda (e.g. the rolling out of school based management reforms,
classroom construction and textbook provision). The analysis reported in this annex
shows that support provided to school based management (e.g. SBM grants) raised
learning outcomes in a cost-effective way. Evidence also shows that the efficiency of the
education system is likely to have been improved through improved teacher deployment.
In particular, NPSBE implementation was associated with a decline in the number of
‘excess’ teachers which reduced system costs. The program also provided significant cost
savings in the provision of textbooks. School construction costs under the program were
comparable with other government-led programs but project construction was assessed to
be of higher quality.

1. Trends in public education spending, 2002-2013

5.      The education system in the first half of the 2000s was characterized by declining
access to basic education and falling levels of public investment. Between 2002 and 2006,
elementary net enrollment rates (NERs) fell by 7 percentage points and the number of
children attending elementary school stagnated. Drop-out rates remained high particularly
in the first grade where 15 percent of students dropped out annually (World Bank and
AusAID 2010). Over the same period, high school NERs remained relatively stable and
enrollment increased in line with population growth (World Bank and AusAID 2010;
Department of Education, 2012). Poor education performance was partly the result of
underinvestment in the education sector (Figure 1). In real terms, overall spending on
education declined from PHP 155 billion in 2003 to PHP 140 billion in 2005 (constant



                                           40
2011 prices). Over the same period, per student spending at the basic education level also
fell by 10 percent in real terms (from PHP 7,998 (US$185) to PHP 7,285 (US$168)).

series from World Development Indicators online database.

6.      In 2006, significant increases in public education investment began to reverse the
declines in the education sector seen in the first half of the decade. In 2006, the Basic
Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA) was developed and at the same time public
investment into the education sector began to increase. Between 2005 and 2013, public
education spending almost tripled in real terms while spending per basic education
student increased by around two-thirds (Figure 1). This increased investment had some
positive effects on education outcomes; elementary and high school net enrollment rates
increased and approximately 2.2 million more children were attending school in 2011
than in 2005. Test results at the elementary level have also shown improvement across all
subjects. At the high school level, trends in achievement have improved in mathematics,
Filipin, and Hekasi (social studies) with some declines in English and science(World
Bank and AusAID 2010; Department of Education, 2012).

2. Cost savings arising from changes in internal efficiency

7.     Internal efficiency. Improvements in the internal efficiency of the basic
education system have the potential to realize significant cost savings over time. For
example, reductions in repetition rates can reduce the time children take to complete
elementary schooling and hence reduce the costs of elementary provision. BESRA and
NPSBE were designed to raise the quality of basic education and improve the efficiency
of the education system through reductions in drop-out and improvements in overall
school completion. However, internal efficiency indicators did not change significantly
over the period of NPSBE and as result did not lead to any significant cost savings. Table
1 provides information on trends in the main internal efficiency indicators of elementary
and high schools. While efficiency has remained relatively stable at the elementary level

                                                 41
there have been some minor improvements at the high school level. For example, dropout
rates have fallen by approximately one percentage point and have improved the survival
and completion rates. However, these trends are unlikely to have resulted in significant
cost savings over the period of NPSBE implementation.

Note: The cohort survival rate is the percentage of a cohort of students in the first grade in a given school
year that are expected to survive to the last grade. Completion rate is the percentage of first year entrants
who complete/finish their full term. Repetition rates are for public schools only.
Source: Repetition rates calculated from BEIS-NT. All other data from Department of Education (2012).

8.      These relatively minor efficiency improvements need to be seen in light of
NPSBE objectives to increase access and narrow inequality. Approximately 2.2 million
additional children have enrolled in basic education since 2005. A large proportion of
these children are likely to have come from poorer households where support for
education is more limited and the factors associated with dropout and repetition more
prevalent. A survey conducted in 2004 showed that completion rates for the poorest
household quintile were half those of the wealthiest quintile. This would suggest that as
poorer children entered school for the first time the efficiency of the system would
deteriorate. It is striking therefore that internal efficiency indicators remained relatively
steady over this period.

9.      Cost savings associated with better teacher deployment. A key aspect of the
project was to improve teacher deployment to:

        Ensure that all schools had the required number of teachers according to staffing
         norms
        Speed up the establishment of new teaching positions to fill school teacher
         deficits
        Establish effective systems (e.g. hardship allowances and transfer policies) to
         redeploy existing teachers away from schools that had too many teachers

10.    Improvements in the efficiency of the system can arise if excess teachers are
redeployed to deficit schools or are used to accommodate increased student numbers in
new schools/classrooms. This will not have any effect on the national student-teacher


                                                      42
ratio but there would be an expectation that differences in school level student-teacher
ratios would narrow.

11.    Calculations based on reductions in the number of excess teachers point to large
cost savings. In order to understand fully whether the distribution of teachers has
improved, analysis of teacher surpluses and deficits at the school level is required. A
study estimated that there were 83,000 excess teachers in the basic education system
(68,000 at elementary and 15,000 at high school) in 2003/04 (Department of Education,
2005). A follow up study, using 2009/10 data and the same methodology, showed that the
number of excess teachers had declined to around 35,512 basic education teachers
(Department of Education, 2012). Assuming this had the effect of reducing the need for
new teachers by an equivalent amount this would have reduced the overall salary bill
by approximately 10 percent or PHP 12.4 billion.34

12.     Despite reductions in the number of excess teachers, increases in enrollment have
meant that teacher shortages remain. The rapid growth, since 2005, of basic education
enrolment has given rise to an increased need for new teachers. This growing demand has
been filled by shifting excess teachers to schools with deficits as well as by recruiting
additional teachers. These measures have managed to keep student-to-teacher ratios in
elementary and public high schools relatively stable over the NPSBE implementation
period (Figure 2). 35 However, student-to-teacher ratios remain above the level associated
with existing staffing norms. Coupled with rising enrolment, this has meant that the
absolute size of teacher shortages has grown. In 2005, it was estimated that schools had a
deficit of approximately 38,000 teachers but this had grown to 122,000 by 2009. Much of
the increase in the deficit of teachers was at the high school level, where 84,000 teachers
were estimated to be needed to ensure that existing staffing norms were met.

   This assumes the average teacher salary of PHP 261,376 reported in the latest medium term expenditure
framework (Department of Education (DepEd) 2012).
35
   The pattern of regional student teacher ratios have also not changed significantly over time.

increased in these areas. It also explores the potential effect, efficiency and cost
effectiveness of the major items of spending supported by NPSBE.

3.1 Component 1: Strengthening school based management

15.     Public education spending on strengthening school based management increased
significantly after the start of NPSBE (Figure 3). Maintenance and other operating
expenses (MOOE) allocated to elementary and high schools doubled in real terms
between 2005 and 2012. This also translated into significantly more resources per
student; MOOE at elementary (high school) increased from PHP 153 (PHP 447) in 2005
to PHP476 (PHP 772) in 2012 (constant 2011 prices). Overall allocations to grants for
school based management grants introduced as part of NPSBE doubled in size in 2011. In
contrast, allocations to the school feeding program have remained relatively low and
constant in nominal terms.

16.     School based management grants and maintenance and other operating
expenses. School based management is expected to lead to improvements in school
performance by placing decision-making authority and control over resources in the
hands of schools and the communities they serve. It is expected that this will raise
performance because local actors have better information to base their decisions on and
that the participation of local communities will improve transparency and strengthen
existing accountability mechanisms that govern resource use.

17.    World Bank studies of an earlier pilot of SBM demonstrated the potential benefits
of school based management in the Philippines. The Third Elementary Education Project
(TEEP) piloted the implementation of school based management in 6,000 elementary

                                                     45
schools in the Philippines in 2003 to 2005. A study of this initial pilot showed that
schools that had introduced school based management had been successful at raising
levels of learning at a faster rate compared to control group schools (Khattri, Ling et al.
2010). Another study also pointed to the importance of textbooks, instructional training
of teachers and new classroom construction in explaining these improved learning
outcomes (Yamauchi and Liu 2013). Improvements in education quality brought about
through school based management and associated interventions have also been shown to
have positive long-term development impacts for women. The improved levels of
learning associated with the earlier TEEP project were found to have significant pay-offs
for women relative to men in terms of increased educational attainment, a greater chance
of migration and higher earnings (Yamauchi and Liu 2012).

18.    NPSBE expanded the coverage of school based management and a recent impact
evaluation confirms its significant and positive impact on education performance (World
Bank and AusAID 2013). To assess the impact of SBM on learning outcomes the study
exploited differences in the roll-out of SBM and associated grants between 2006 and
2009.36 The study found that, over three years, the introduction of SBM and the provision
of grants improved scores on the National Achievement Tests (NAT) by 4 to 5
percentage points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations).

19.     Simple comparisons with other common interventions to improve education
quality tentatively suggest that the SBM reforms have been cost effective. The impact
evaluation estimated simple education production functions using the same sample of
schools. For rural schools, reductions in pupil-classroom and student-teacher ratios were
both associated with better student performance on national achievement tests and these
results were statistically significant (see Appendix 2 World Bank and AusAID 2013).37
The point estimates suggest that a reduction of 10 students in each classroom would lead
to an average improvement in test scores of approximately 0.5 percentage points. Using
NPSBE costs, an improvement of this magnitude would cost around PHP 140,000. 38
Given the size of SBM grants are considerably smaller (PHP 50,000 per school) and their
impact on learning much higher (i.e. 4-5 percentage points) it seems as though they are
more cost-effective. Similar conclusions can be made by comparing the cost-
effectiveness of reducing student teacher ratios with SBM reforms. These calculations are
not intended to give precise estimates but they do suggest that SBM reforms are cost-
effective when compared with some other common interventions.

20.     SBM grants have covered approximately a quarter of all basic education schools
(Table 3). The criteria used to select schools for SBM grants have varied across the years.
Findings from a small and non-representative survey of schools suggested that it was
more likely for grant recipients to be in poorer municipalities. However, the indicators
laid out in DepED guidelines to select schools for inclusion in the program (e.g. drop-out

   Propensity score matching techniques are used to develop an appropriate control group for the study.
37
   Coefficients for urban schools were not statistically significantly different from zero.
38
   This assumes that classrooms have an average of 45 students.

AusAID 2013).

21.     Grants provided as part of the school based management reform have also raised
overall levels of school financing. The impact evaluation found that SBM grants did not
displace other sources of funding. Schools receiving SBM grants were found to improve
their overall resource position and were successful at raising more resources from parent
teacher associations than in previous years.

22.     Recent improvements in the size and financial management of maintenance and
operating expenses have also contributed to a rise in the share of education resources
controlled at the school level. A small survey of 150 schools in 3 provinces showed that
the resources available at the school level had increased significantly since 2005 (World
Bank and AusAID 2013). For example, average per student resources managed at the
school-level had increased, in real terms, from under PHP 200 in 2007 to nearly PHP 400
in 2010 (constant 2005 prices). These increases have partly been the result of increased
DepEd funding in the form of MOOE but also in improvements in the ‘downloading’ of
funds to schools. In 2007, only 13 of the 150 surveyed schools reported receiving DepEd
funding while in 2011, 115 schools reported receiving this funding. These trends are
encouraging given that better school financing in combination with the implementation of
school based management is associated with better learning outcomes.

23.     Despite recent increases, overall resources that flow to the school level are still
very low and efforts to target these resources more effectively have only just begun.
School based management grants and MOOE at the school level represented only 4
percent of the overall DepEd budget in 2013. This is equivalent to approximately
PHP495 ($11.4) per student and is very low in comparison to programs in other East
Asian countries. For example, the national school grants program in Indonesia that
supports school operating expenses has provided approximately $65 per elementary and
junior high school student since 2012. During the lifetime of NPSBE, operating expenses
have been allocated to divisions on a per student basis which has the potential to
reinforce existing inequalities in education performance. However, a new funding
formula developed during NPSBE has recently been introduced and addresses differences
in school need across the different regions and divisions of the Philippines.



                                                 47
24.    School feeding program. School feeding programs have the potential to increase
education access and improve health and education outcomes (Bundy, Burbano et al.
2009). In the Philippines, recent analysis showed that a key factor in explaining school
dropout was poor health pointing at a need to raise levels of nutrition to raise education
outcomes. Prior to 2010, the largest school feeding program was the nationwide school
for food program which provided 1 kilogram of rice to poor children in school. A review,
undertaken under the auspices of the NPSBE, highlighted considerable weaknesses in the
program and it was discontinued in 2010.

25.    In its place, the NPSBE supported a small school feeding program pilot that
worked through schools and supported school based management reforms. The pilot, in 3
provinces, provided grants to schools to organize a school feeding program and was
focused on areas where levels of malnourishment were high. The pilot gradually
expanded and the number of beneficiaries increased from approximately 23,000 in 2010
to 40,000 in 2013.

26.     The unit costs of the school feeding program are similar to the costs of programs
in other countries. The costs of providing school feeding to one child amounted to PHP
1,920 (US$45) per year which is similar to the average cost ($40) of programs in a
sample of other countries (see Bundy, Burbano et al. 2009).39 However, the costs of the
government’s school feeding program appeared to be higher than programs run by local
non-governmental organizations and private foundations. Average costs for these
programs were around PHP 1,320 (US$31) although direct comparison is difficult
because they tend to be smaller in scale and frequently focus only on the early grades
where the costs of providing adequate nutrition are smaller. In the absence of detailed
analysis of the benefits associated with school feeding it is not possible to compare the
cost effectiveness of school feeding with other interventions. However, school feeding
costs are currently much higher than levels of school funding provided through SBM
grants or MOOE (e.g. approximately PHP 495 per student).

3.2 Component 2: Improved teacher effectiveness

27.    Spending on teacher training has increased substantially since the introduction of
NPSBE in 2006 (Figure 4).40 Relatively little teacher training was centrally funded before
the development of BESRA and NPSBE which raised public spending on training to an
average of PHP 1.1 billion a year. Overall allocations to hardship pay have increased but
remain small.


39
   These costs are based on PHP 16 (PHP 15 for commodities, PHP 1 for management) per day and the
program running for 120 days. Information provided by the Health and Nutrition Center, Department of
Education.
40
   The appropriations covered for teacher training are in-service training and Human Resources Training
and Development including Teacher's Training, Scholarship & Fellowship Grants and Capacity Building
for Non-Teaching Personnel. This does not fully encompass all publicly funded training conducted in the
education sector as other budget lines are also likely to include training. It does not also include efforts by
the government to mobilize private sector support for training (e.g. Adopt a school program).

28.     Increases in the size of hardship pay were incorporated into NPSBE to improve
the distribution of the teaching force by encouraging teachers to teach in remote areas.
Evidence on whether hardship pay has had this effect appear at best mixed. A new
transfer policy has been developed which provides teachers with funds to cover the costs
of transfer but implementation has only just begun. In addition, overall allocations of
hardship pay and per-teacher allowances seem at odds with the scale of the challenge. For
example, in 2013 hardship pay could be paid up to a maximum of 25 percent of a
teacher’s basic pay. Only 3 thousand teachers, less than 1 percent of total basic education
teachers could be covered at this maximum level of hardship pay. Alternatively, if 20
percent of all basic education teachers received hardship pay the average payment per
teacher would be approximately PHP 1,700 which is only 1 percent of the average annual
teacher salary.41


3.3 Component 3: Enhanced quality and equity through standards, assessment and
support

29.    Investments in classroom construction and rehabilitation have risen rapidly since
the middle of the 2000s (Figure 5). These investments have led to a considerable increase


41
     Average teacher salary taken from Department of Education (2012).



                                                     49
in classrooms allowing for greater levels of access to basic education (see below).
Between 2007 and 2013, on average 6 percent of the overall Department of Education
budget was devoted to classroom construction and rehabilitation. In line with government
commitments to eliminate all classroom shortages by the end of 2013, there has also been
an uptick in spending on classrooms since 2011. Textbook purchases also increased with
the introduction of BESRA and since then have remained relatively stable.

30.     Textbooks and teacher guides. Textbooks and teacher guides are a vital input
into the teaching and learning process. Prior to NPSBE there had been significant efforts
to improve the supply of textbooks. For example, between 1999 and 2002, the Second
Social Expenditure Management Project provided 110 million basic education textbooks
and 67 million teacher manuals. This provided a set of core textbooks to nearly all
elementary school children and improved the high school student textbook ratio
significantly (World Bank 2008).

31.     The NPSBE continued these improvements in textbook provision and between
2007 and 2011 purchased 30 million elementary and 16.5 million high school textbooks
in a range of subjects (see Table 4). This is equivalent to approximately 1.5 textbooks per
student at the elementary level and 2 textbooks per high school student. In many cases,
this new provision allowed schools to eliminate the use of multiple textbooks in a single
class and removed significant challenges faced by teachers from the need to teach to
more than one textbook in a class. The NPSBE also purchased approximately 900
thousand teacher guides to support the use of these textbooks.

elementary and high school are based on weighted averages of all textbooks procured. Textbook costs

to high schools and education offices in divisions for elementary schools.

32.     The unit costs of textbooks purchased under NPSBE appear to have been low
compared with previous projects in the Philippines (see Table 4). While the structural
costs of textbook provision may have changed significantly over time this provides some
indication that the costs of textbook provision were relatively low under NPSBE. Simple
calculations suggest that savings in the order of PHP 2 billion (US$ 42 million) were
made under NPSBE when compared with previous projects.

33.    Market prices of textbooks in Manila were approximately 10 times higher than
books procured under the NPSBE. Textbooks purchased in the market also had a life of
one year compared to the five year life of NPSBE procured books.42

34.     Classroom construction. Increasing the number of classrooms and improving the
quality of the existing stock was central to the NPSBE objective of improving the quality
and equity of basic education. Previous research in the Philippines showed the
importance of reducing the pupil classroom ratio for improved learning outcomes (World
Bank and AusAID 2010; World Bank and AusAID 2013; Yamauchi and Liu 2013). As
part of the program, 4,813 new classrooms were constructed and 13,659 classrooms were
repaired and refurbished at a total cost of US$97.5 million.

35.    Classroom construction has facilitated the expansion in education access that has
occurred since 2005. Between 2005 and 2010, an additional 41,000 classrooms were


42
  The average costs of textbooks have been estimated to range between US$2 and US$8 by two relatively
recent reviews (World Bank 2008; DFID 2010)



                                                     51
constructed (11 percent of the total stock in 2005) and this allowed the accommodation of
an additional 1.6 million basic education students (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Classroom construction and student classroom ratios

36.     Despite a significant amount of construction over the last few years, pupil-
classroom ratios declined only marginally between 2005 and 2010 (Figure 6). This small
decline may point to a rather limited impact on the overall quality of the education
system from the NPBSE classroom construction. However, at this level of aggregation it
is not possible to assess the extent to which the declines have led to smaller class sizes
and improved learning environments. The rehabilitation of approximately 4 percent of the
existing stock of classrooms, undertaken as part of NPSBE, is likely to have improved the
learning environment and led to improvements in access and learning in existing schools.

DPWH construction programs.

37.   The costs of classroom construction carried out as part of the NPSBE were
comparable to the costs of the public works department construction contracts (Table 5).
NPSBE largely built large classrooms of 63m2 and costs of the principal-led construction




                                                 52
were similar to the costs of public works construction.43 While not strictly comparable the
costs of classroom construction are higher in the Philippines compared with a study that
reviewed the costs of classroom construction in Sub-Saharan Africa (Theunynck 2009).

38.     The NPSBE utilized the principal-led classroom construction and rehabilitation
approach which had some significant benefits beyond cost savings. Constructing and
rehabilitating classrooms in this way put control of the process in the hands of the school
principal and had the effect of reinforcing ongoing school based management reforms.
Evidence from a small monitoring study of school building projects also suggests that
principal-led construction were of better quality than public works construction. For
example, a greater proportion of public works projects had discrepancies with the
program of works than the principal-led projects reviewed (Government Watch 2010).
The review also visited two construction projects developed through the KALAHI
community driven development program. Classrooms built under community programs
were generally not comparable with government programs. For example, classrooms built
through the KALAHI program were generally of smaller size. While it is not possible to
draw general conclusions the review found that the two community construction projects
were the highest quality and most cost efficient of the various programs reviewed.

3.4 Component 4: Increased resource mobilization

39.    The main budget line that was supported under this component was policy
development. Spending by the government on policy development in the education sector
has remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2013. On average, the DepEd has spent
approximately PHP 47 million per year on policy development. Many of the studies
underpinning the reforms undertaken as part of BESRA were underpinned by studies and
evaluation work that was supported by DepEd policy resources as well as additional
development partner financing.

40.     NPSBE has provided resources for policy analysis that have contributed to the
introduction or adjustment of major policy reforms. Analytical work has supported the
implementation of school based management reforms which have been an effective way
of raising learning achievement despite their infancy. Policy analysis also supported the
evaluation and subsequent dropping of the inefficient food for school program saving
considerable resources for the Philippines government.

41.     An evaluation of the government’s Education Service Contracting under the
GASTPE program, which is intended to support students and teachers in private
education (GASTPE), led to a significant expansion of the program and subsequently to
levels of high school enrollment. The 2011 study found that the ESC program was
effective at raising high school enrollment and generated considerable cost savings for
the government (World Bank 2011). In 2009, approximately 9 percent of all high school



43
  Costs were comparable to the earlier Second Social Expenditure Management Program (see World Bank
2008)



                                                53
students and a third of all private school students were part of the program. The study
also found that the unit costs to the government of the grants were considerably less than
the unit costs associated with public high school provision. It concluded that the program
was cost-effective and generated considerable cost savings. Partly as a result of these
findings government support to the program has increased between 2005 and 2013 from
PHP 1.8 billion to PHP 7 billion in real terms (2011 constant prices). These increases
have financed both an expansion in coverage as well as a higher grant per-student.

Introduction and Background

1. NPSBE provided assistance to the Department of Education in its implementation of
the Basic Education Reform Agenda (BESRA) by financing priority initiatives within the
budget items of the Government. The over-arching objective of NPSBE is to improve
quality and equity in learning outcomes for all Filipinos in basic education.

2. The total Loan proceeds of US$200 million was spread across three major categories
of the Project which directly funds specific BESRA Key Reform Thrusts (KRTs).

3. NPSBE took effect on 01 January 2007 with 31 December 2011 as the original
closing date. Project implementation was extended for one year or until 31 December
2012 to complete the printing and delivery of remaining textbooks in Science, English
and Mathematics. The Project was successful in achieving its targets on time for
classroom construction (completed in 2011) and Schools MOOE (100 percent loan
drawdown in 2010).

4. The implementation arrangements of NPSBE and other foreign-assisted projects of
the Department directly supporting the Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA)
was used as the mechanism to regularly discuss progress, issues and concerns and
recommendations to improve the implementation of the reform agenda as well as the
FAPs supporting the thrusts of the Department.

5. This report provides a summary of overall performance of the Project in terms of key
outcome indicators, immediate results and physical and financial accomplishments by
component.

6. Five years after the implementation of NPSBE, the Department substantially
achieved its targets with moderate to significant improvement in the delivery of basic
education resources and performance outcomes. This is based on the specific Project
Development Objectives (PDOs) and component targets of NPSBE.

7. Significant contributions of the Project was funding classroom construction
(US$97.5 million) for 4,813 new classrooms and repair of existing 13,659 classrooms;
and, purchase of textbooks and teacher guides (US$ 38 million) or 30 million elementary
and 16.5 million high school textbooks.

8. The Department was successful in communicating and advocating BESRA to
stakeholders at all levels and initiated efforts to fully operationalize the reform agenda
especially at the school level funded through NPSBE’s project components on policy
formulation and trainings. There is visible integration of reform initiatives and practices
across BESRA KRTs such as school accreditation (PASBE)44 in the assessment of SBM
level of practice and teacher education and development (through capacitating NEAP-
Regions 2) in the formulation of the schools’ SIP.

9. In terms of the financial accomplishments of NPSBE, the Department posted 100
percent Loan Drawdown. Overall accomplishment viz. Project targets across major
components of the project were either achieved or exceeded. In June 2009 and 2010, the
World Bank approved the Department’s proposal for a budget re-allocation of the
Project’s funds to favor the fast-moving components of NPSBE such as the Civil Works
(School Building Program) and SBM Grants.

I.      Detailed Progress in NPSBE Implementation

10. The objectives of the National Program Support for Basic Education (NPSBE)
contribute to the accomplishment of the Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda
(BESRA). Specifically, it aims to contribute to the improvement of the quality and equity
in learning outcomes for all Filipinos. Progress for each component is measured through
a set of key performance indicators.


44
   The Philippine Accreditation of Schools for Basic Education (PASBE) is a BESRA initiative under the
sub-TWG on QAA/M&E (DO # 64, s. 2012). It is an accreditation process which looks into the operations
of public and private elementary and high schools if they meet the quality standards as established by
stakeholders of basic education.

  Supported by DO issuances numbers 32, s. 2011 on the adoption of the guidelines of the Training and
Development System; 30, s. 2009 mandated NEAP in the operationalization of the T&D system; and, 111,
s. 2009 on the establishment of NEAP in the Regions.




                                                  60
A.     Outcome Indicators: Progress Against Targets
11. Based on the set objectives of NPSBE, six performance indicators are being used to
measure progress towards improvements in the education system such as: (i)
Participation Rate (PR); (ii) Cohort-Survival Rate (CSR); (iii) Completion Rate (CR);
(iv) Drop-Out Rate (DR); (v) Achievement Rate (as mentioned by the NAT MPS); and
(vi) Inter-Quartile Ratio (IQR) which compares the proportion of teachers available to the
most favored 25 percent learners.

12. Elementary: The participation rate for elementary posted modest improvement based
on the revised target value of 90.09 percent to actual value achieved – 97.3 percent.
Completion rate, however, is below the revised target value of 75.13 percent viz. actual
data of 70.97 percent. This is even below 3.3 percent points as reported in the
Department’s Mid-Term implementation report in 2009 for NPSBE. Drop-out rate posted
6.38 percent as compared to 6.02 percent in 2009. The CSR in 2009 was reported as 75
percent as against the current result of 73.46 percent.

13. High School: For secondary education, participation rate modestly improved from
60.7 percent in 2009 to 64.8 percent in 2012. Completion rate posted 74.23 percent for
2012 while drop-out rate was reported 7.82 percent compared with 7.45 percent in 2009.

14. The Department in its efforts to reduce the rate of drop-out and increase the rate of
completion continues to implement the Drop-Out Reduction Program (DORP) which
tracks Pupils at Risk of Dropping-Out (PARDOs)/Students at Risk of Dropping-Out
(SARDOs). The total number of schools implementing this program has reached 26,609
or 87.86 percent as against the current total number of schools. Region XI registered 100
percent implementation.

B.     Progress by Component
15. To measure progress of the various components of NPSBE, nine intermediate
indicators are being monitored regularly. In general, the progress towards the attainment
of the intermediate outcomes is varied across all components.

Component 1. School-Based Management
16. This component aims to achieve higher quality and greater equity in the outcomes of
basic education by enabling school/schools clusters to be more effective in taking
responsibility for learning outcomes through School-Based Management. In 2011
government recognized the value and impact of SBM Grants for schools to achieve its
desired change and improvement by increasing the Department’s SBM budget to PhP1
billion. To achieve this objective, the following are the sub-components implemented
with the corresponding accomplishments:

17. Sub-component 1.1: Developing School-Community. Mechanisms for forming
school-community partnerships (e.g. School Governing Councils or Parent-Teacher-


                                           61
Community Associations use of SIPs and schools reporting to their communities) in all
schools/schools clusters were supported under the Project.

        a.      Schools/Schools Clusters with SIPs. The School Improvement Plan is the
blueprint for reform actions at the school level. By 2012, a total of 36, 044 schools
(Elementary – 30,230 and high schools – 5,814 have approved SIPs. Region XI posted
100 percent implementation. SIP formulation continues to encourage visible participation
of external stakeholders (SGC and the local school board). To ensure 100 percent support
of the schools’ improvement the policy issuance on Schools MOOE in 2011 (DO no. 60)
allowed as eligible expenditure activities in the school’s approved SIP.
        b.     Schools/Clusters of Schools Meeting SBM Criteria. A review of a
policy issuance on the SBM assessment framework (DO no. 83, s. 2012- Implementing
Guidelines on the Revised SBM Framework, Assessment Process and Tool) by members
of the Technical Working Group for SBM, SBM Secretariat (OPS) and the Core group
for the Philippine Accreditation System for Basic Education (PASBE) was completed in
2012. As a result, a simplified SBM assessment tool using a scoring matrix for SBM is
currently implemented. All SBM stakeholders nationwide were trained on Document
Analysis-Observation-Discussion which is a process to determine a school’s level of
SBM practice.
18. Sub-component 1.2: Structure of Support and Accountability. NPSBE funded a
portion of the Department’s allocation for School-level Maintenance and Other Operating
Expenses (MOOE) with progressive increases in line with (i) equity based on school
needs; and, (ii) incentives based on performance against SIPs. In 2010, the Project’s
allocation for Schools MOOE was increased and allowed 100 percent of all schools
nationwide to directly receive their MOOE allocation (compared with 70 percent in 2009).

19. The Department was able to secure support from the Executive Branch for the
increase in the budget for Schools MOOE to PhP3.0 billion in the FY 2013 National
Expenditure Program. The 30 percent increase in school MOOE was derived using the
partial application of the equity-based formula (developed by the team of former
Secretary Emilia Boncodin), which takes into account not only enrollment but also
factors affecting school effectiveness such as availability of classrooms and teachers. The
equity-based formula assumes a minimum fixed amount based on average historical
spending of public elementary and high schools or PhP20,000 per year for elementary
schools and PhP40,000 per year for high schools.

   a. Schools/Schools Clusters eligible to receive school grants. A total of 29,153
elementary and high schools nationwide received SBM Grants supported by NPSBE.
20. In 2012, the policy issuance on a multi-year approach for allocating and distributing
SBM grants was issued (DO no. 69, s. 2012 Multi-Year Guidelines for SBM Grants FYs
2011-2013). Under the multi-year SBM Grant guidelines, the same set of schools will
receive the same allocation for three years. This approach was to ensure continuity of
approved activities based on the school’s approved SIP. Prioritization of school
recipients based on the income class of its Division and a set of performance indicators


                                            62
(Participation Rate, Cohort Survival Rate, Completion Rate, School Leaver Rate, and
National Achievement Rate) was the mechanism adopted.

    b. School clusters with adequate Financial Management System. To support the
policy on downloading of funds to schools (MOOE and SBM Grants) especially schools
without separate book of accounts or non-implementing units, the Department of
Education in collaboration with the Commission on Audit (COA) has adopted the
Simplified Accounting Procedures for Non-Implementing Units. DepEd has trained
trainers in all Division Offices and 37,102 or 88 percent of school heads were trained on
the said Simplified Accounting Procedure (SAP) for Non-Implementing units. This
surpasses the target of 40 percent.
21. Sub-component 1.3: Capacity-Building. In effectively implementing SBM
capacity building among the primary change agents (school heads and community
members) was required. NPSBE financing under this sub-component covered trainings of
school heads to operate effectively in a decentralized and self-managing school
environment.

        a.      Schools/Schools Clusters where School Heads have been trained on
SBM. A total of 38,988 or 96.61 percent of (exceeded target of 65 percent) School Heads
were trained by NEAP on the Basic Courses for SBM. In prior years of Project
implementation trainings on SBM practice and SBM assessment separately conducted by
the SBM TWG has totaled to 4,752 School Heads in 31 Divisions. These figures however,
do not include the training programs conducted by the regions and division funded
through local funds and other foreign-assisted projects (TEEP, SEDIP, BEAM, Project
STRIVE, GOS-IQPE). NEAP has yet to establish the database of SBM training programs
as part of the full operationalization of the Training and Development System.
22. Sub-component: 1.4 Quality with Equity at the School Level. To ensure progress
toward nationally defined standards, a mechanism such as a School report Card was
devised for the school to report to its community on levels of inputs and
outputs/outcomes, assisted by comparative feedback to the division, region and national
norms drawn from the BEIS database. This report card will the school’s barometer of its
accountability in terms of student outcomes as against targets set in the school’s approved
SIP.
        a.     Schools/Schools Clusters Using School Report Card. The use of the
School Report Card has been linked with the implementation of PASBE. A review and
further refinement of SRC were jointly initiated and conducted by the TWGs of SBM and
PASBE prior to pilot-testing of the school accreditation in 12 schools within 11 regions.
Total number of schools implementing the use of School Report Card reached 40,149 or
97.97 percent (exceeded target of 40 percent).
       b.      Divisions engaged in tracking students at risk. As of the Project’s
closing, 25,630 schools or 73 percent of schools in 75 Divisions (or 37 percent of
Divisions) are using the Student Tracking System (STS).
23. Component 2: Improved Teaching Effectiveness. The objective of this component
is to improve teaching effectiveness through the implementation of two policy


                                            63
interventions: I) refine current work on teacher competency standards and apply them to
performance appraisal, training needs, promotion and hiring practices, pre-service
training and licensing; and ii) achieve a more equitable distribution of teachers across
schools through the application of principles identified by DepED for improved teacher
deployment. NPSBE financed the development of policy on refining and using
competency-based standards for teachers through: (i) trainings on the use of such
standards; (ii) provision of hardship allowance to teachers transferred to hard-to-staff
schools; and, (iii) provision of transfer allowance for teachers required to move and other
incentives to enhance equity in deployment. To attain the objectives of this component,
the following are the progress of the two sub-components, to date:

24. Sub-component 2.1: Professional standards for teachers. Teacher qualifications
and teacher appraisal was based in terms of competency-based performance. The Teacher
Education and Development Program (TEDP) a standards framework was developed
through extensive consultation and involvement of key stakeholders such as teacher
representatives, CHED, teacher education institutions, principal and division
superintendent associations. NPSBE supported the trial of these professional standards
for teachers and the use of these standards in performance appraisal at the sub-national
level.
        a.      Teacher performance standards developed and agreed. The National
Competency-Based Teacher Standards-Teachers Strengths and Needs Assessment
(NCBTS-TSNA) and the Individual Performance and Professional Development (IPPD)
Toolkit were adopted both by DepED (through DepED Order No. 32, s. 2009) and CHED
as basis for reforms in teacher education and development. Results of this Teachers’ self-
assessment toolkit went through validation at the sub-national level to determine specific
training needs of the teachers.
       b.      Divisions where CBTS is used in at least 50 percent of schools.
Through the issuance of DepED Order No. 32, s. 2009 the NCBTS-based T&D System
and the use of the TSNA and IPPD templates for teachers have been adopted. The TED
TWG spearheaded the training of trainers in all regions and selected divisions in the use
of the NCBTS-based TSNA and IPPD templates as part of the school improvement
planning process. All Regions and Divisions were oriented and provided with NCBTS-
TSNA (funded under SPHERE). Out of 203 total Divisions only 175 or 86 percent
reported use of the NCBTS-TSNA and IPPD toolkit to more than 50 percent of its
schools (No data available from ARMM).
         c.    CBTS applied to pre-service training. As reported by the Teacher
Education Council through the TED TWG, 90 percent of the public Teacher Education
Institutions (TEIs) have implemented the NCBTS-enriched pre-service curriculum and
the Experiential Learning Courses.
       d.     CBTS used in hiring and promotion. The Department issued several
policy issuances on the hiring of teacher position/items that have been based on the
NCBTS-TSNA. There are on-going discussions on the adoption of the draft Central
Office-performance and professional development assessment tool at the sub-national
level.


                                            64
25. Sub-component: 2.2 Teacher Deployment. To correct the lack of equity in staffing
specifically for those schools in remote locations, DepED issued several policies to
deploy teachers in hard-to-staff schools as well as subjects like Mathematics and Science.

        a.      5-Year Staffing Plan devised for allocation and redeployment of
teacher. While the OPS has continued to monitor the deployment of teacher items
through the Basic Education Information System (BEIS) using the color-coded scheme,
the five-year projections for teacher staffing have yet to be prepared.
        b.     Improved equity in pupil/teacher ratios. The overall national level
pupil-teacher IQR remained 1.95 as reported in 2009 while high school-teacher IQR was
reported 2.19. Based on the latest data, the national elementary PTR is 40:1 while high
school STR registered at 42:1.
       c.     Strategies devised: Teachers compensation , incentives and benefits.
Strategies to address teachers’ compensation, incentives and benefits have been
formulated. Specifically, the teacher localization policy and provision of hardship
allowances, including additional hardship allowance for multi-grade teachers have been
adopted.
26. Component 3: Enhanced Quality and Equity through Standards, Assessment
and Support. The component aims to reduce inequities in the outcomes of basic
education, ensuring all learners are provided with a standard quality of basic education.
To attain this objective, the following are the progress of sub-component:

27. Sub-component 3.1 National Standards Framework for Learning Outcomes
National strategies will be developed and implemented to support the teaching of English,
Filipino, Mathematics and Science. Standards will be developed based on the Revised
Basic Education Curriculum and will be incorporated into existing teacher support
materials, teacher professional development, and national assessment.

      a.    National Learning Strategies and Action Plan. Target policy issuances
and implementation strategies were met such as adopting the MTB-MLE standards,
LRMDS implementation and more recently with the enactment of K to 12.

        b.    English Proficiency for Teachers. Prior years implementation (until
2010) showed that NEAP trained 5,446 teachers in certificate programs in English
proficiency for Regions IX, X, XI and ARMM through the implementation of the
National English Proficiency Program (NEPP) trainings.


       c.      Student Achievement Standards defined. DepED revised the Basic
Education Learning Competencies which is measured through the National Achievement
Tests for elementary and high school education levels for the recent enactment of K to 12.
       d.     Schools receive feedback from national assessments. NETRC continues
to provide each school through the Division Offices results of the national assessments
for elementary and high school. Processed results of NAT are used as basis for


                                           65
implementing interventions from central to school levels to address the least mastered
skills.
28. Sub-component 3.2: Quality Assurance Framework. The Project financed the
development of explicit national standards for (i) inputs including physical infrastructure
and staffing; (ii) curriculum, textbooks, instructional materials, school management,
student readiness, community partnership, and financial support; and, (iii) outcomes
including participation, completion and student achievement as measured by national
assessment tests.

       a.      National Standards Framework for Inputs and Outcomes.
               Target policy issuances on the National Assessment Framework and QAA
               Framework were issued in prior years.

        b.     Divisions (with schools) Receive Feedback from EMIS. The Enhanced
BEIS (e-BEIS) database was implemented nationwide. Schools are now able to access
their school data via the Department’s website.
29. Sub-component 3.3: Enhanced Access to Information through ICT Policy
Implementation. The Department implemented an ICT master plan which supported its
MDG/EFA commitments. Currently, this ICT policy is being implemented and actively
reviewed in line with the continuous development or improvement of ICT systems.

30. Component 4: Effective Resource Mobilization. This component aims to improve
budget planning and management and resource mobilization. To date, the progress of the
following sub-components are:

31. Sub-component 4.1: Financing Framework and Budget Process. Currently the
Department developed a Budget Monitoring System as part of its continuing bid to
improve its budget preparation process. The Bank provided training assistance with the
on-going development of an electronic financial management information system through
DBM.

32. Financing Framework developed. With World Bank’s technical assistance a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework was developed for 2011-2016. Prior to MTEF a
Medium-Term Expenditure Plan or MTEP was developed which already covered cost
estimates for the implementation of key K to 12 Reform initiatives such as Universal
Kindergarten Education and the Senior High School Program.

        a. Cost-sharing between the GOP and LGU applied to classroom
        construction, including equity factors. A statement of interest is drawn up
        between DepED and the concerned LGU prior to classroom construction, to
        obtain the latter’s commitment and support. Over 100 LGUs were given
        recognition for actively initiating the building of new public classrooms. These
        LGU-initiated SBPs, which were completed in 2011 and 2012, had an estimated
        cumulative total of PhP9.4 billion or equivalent to 5,000 new classrooms built.


                                            66
33. Sub-component 4.2: Demand-Side Financing. Under this sub-component, NPSBE
financed a review of current schemes on demand-side financing and the development of
guidelines for effective demand-side financing of basic education in the Philippines.

       a. Demand-side financing mechanisms introduced to support needy students
          and their families.
           The Project funded (US$1 million) the successful implementation of the
              Breakfast Feeding Program initiated by the School Health and Nutrition
              Council. Currently, the School Feeding Program is implemented (based on
              the best practices of BFP) at the school level.

             About 42 percent of elementary schools are participating in the 4Ps
              Program. For CY 2012 about PhP 988 million is committed for the
              construction of 1,452 classrooms and the hiring of 600 new teachers in the
              4Ps areas. Initial analysis of the program’s impact showed positive
              improvement in school enrollment - in 4Ps schools increased by 2.2
              percent and in non-4Ps schools increased by 0.77 percent.

34. Private Sector Participation. This sub-component focused on private sector
participation in basic education initially through expansion of the Education Service
Contracting (ESC) scheme at the high school level, and subsequently through extension
of the scheme or an alternative option to include elementary, pre-school and Alternative
Learning System.

35. Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE),
Improvements in the implementation of the GASTPE were applied in School Year 2011-
2012. The tuition subsidy for students outside the National Capital Region (NCR) was
increased from PhP 5,000 to PhP 6,500 per student per year. There was also an
improvement in the computation of the amount of teacher salary subsidies, i.e. for PRC-
licensed teachers handling Education Service Contracting and Education Voucher System
classes. Each teacher now receives PhP 12,000 per year, when previously the subsidy was
computed based on PhP 250 per student per year.

36. In School Year (SY) 2012-2013, DepEd increased the GASTPE ESC tuition subsidy
for non-Metro Manila Gr.7 students from PhP5,500 to PhP 6,500 per year. The increase
will be applied progressively, with Gr.7 and Gr.8 students enjoying a tuition subsidy
increase in SY 2013-2014, Gr.7 to Gr.9 students in SY 2014-2015 and Gr.7 to Gr.10
students in SY 2015-2016.

37. The Department also introduced an Open High School Program under GASTPE for
SY 2012-2013 to expand access to high school education. A full tuition subsidy of
PhP6,500 per year will be awarded to students under this program (Private high schools
are not allowed to impose additional tuition fees to these students).

      Education Service Contracting (ESC) is implemented based on existing
       laws/guidelines and has covered 2,655,614 students in 1,948 participating schools
       and a total grant amount of PhP13.677 billion.

                                          67
        Education Voucher System (EVS) The Department provided PhP2.192 Billion to
         a total of 418,730 students nationwide.

        Tuition Fee Subsidy (TFS) was provided to 1,574,527 grantees with a total
         cumulative grant of PhP586.962 million.
38. Other Initiatives. The Department successfully bid out the Private-Public
Participation for School Infrastructure Project (PSIP) which seeks to provide 9,301
classrooms (with toilets and seats) in Regions I, III and IV-A under a Build-Lease-
Transfer contract for 10 years. It is now proceeding with the next phase of the PSIP,
which will be implemented in the Visayas-Mindanao regions.

39. Apart from infrastructure PPPs, the Department is working with ADB on other PPP
schemes for the delivery of the Senior HS Program.

C.       Lessons Learned and Recommendations

        Continuous strengthening and re-defining/improving the support system (M&E
         processes on both financial and physical inputs of basic education services) from
         division, regional and central levels so that schools continue to improve their
         performance is also imperative.

        It is recommended that a separate report on the Department’s implementation of
         BESRA be commissioned to gauge and assess the reform program’s levels of
         intervention.
         The BESRA Implementation and Accountability and Advocacy and
         Communications Plans was re-formulated and finalized in 2010. However, this
         should be re-visited to integrate K to 12 thrusts in the reform agenda.
