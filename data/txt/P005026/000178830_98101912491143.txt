EGYPT
THIRD POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources 1/
1.01      Egypt's indigenous energy resources are hydropower, natural gas and
oil, coal and oil shale. Egypt has also a vast potential of solar energy
averaging about 5.73 kWh/day/square meter, which is about 41% more direct
insolation than the sunniest region in the United States.
1.02      Egypt's total hydropower potential is about 12,000 GWh/a, of which
9,000 GWh/a were harnessed with the completion of the Aswan High Dam. The
hydro component of the Project (Aswan II) would exploit an additional 1,100
GWh/a, and the remaining 1,900 GWh would be exploited by installing generating
units at Nag Hammadi, Esna and Assiut and other Nile barrage sites. Potential
sites for pumped storage schemes exist at the Gulf of Suez. There are also
several sites on the various irrigation canals of the Nile which are suitable
for small hydropower schemes (mini-hydro).
1.03      According to an estimate made in 1978 by the Egyptian Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC), Egypt's proven recoverable oil reserves are in the neigh-
borhood of 300 million tons.  Oil production in 1979 was 25 million tons.  The
proven recoverable reserves of associated and non-associated gas are estimated
to be about 7.1 trillion cubic feet. The current average daily production
potential of associated and non-associated gas is about 300 million cubic feet
per day (cfd) against a demand of 150 million cfd.
1.04      Coal deposits were discovered in the early sixties in Sinai and a
few localities west of the Gulf of Suez. Very little information is available
on the deposits west of Suez except that their development would be uneconomic
at present. As for the Sinai Peninsula, coal deposits have been found at
Maghara, Ayun Musa and Wadi Thora. The deposits at Maghara, located about
150 km northeast of Suez and 70 km south of El-Arish, have the highest
potential for development. Its estimated net proven reserves are about 27.8
million tons with an average calorific value of about 6,000 kcal/kg, suitable
for use in power generation (para. 1.10). Exploitation of these reserves
would require mining facilities which have a gestation period of about 4
years. Exploitation of the deposits at Ayun Musa and Wadi Thora would not be
economic at present.
1/   The information on the oil and gas subsector is discussed in more detail
in the Cairo Gas Distribution Project being presented concurrently.

1.05      Uranium and thorium occur in a number of places in Egypt but they
are usually associated with other metals, minerals and black sands from which
their extraction is uneconomic.
1.06      Non-commercial fuels in the form of crop and animal waste are used
extensively in Egypt; however, reliable data on their contribution to the
overall energy needs of the country are not available at present. Preliminary
studies indicate that non-commerical fuels contribute between 20%-30% of the
total energy needs of rural Egypt. Detailed investigation by the Ministry of
Agriculture of the different uses of non-commercial fuels is currently under-
way. The Government is also intensifying its efforts to exploit solar and
wind energies. Cooperative programs with France and West Germany have ini-
tiated pilot projects for assessing the potential uses of solar energy in
low-head irrigation pumping, crop drying and residential water heating.
Energy Balance
1.07      The main sources of primary commercial energy in Egypt are hydro-
power, petroleum and coal. Based on information provided by EGPC on the
current and projected production and consumption of energy resources, a crude
balance of energy for 1978 and 1985 is presented below.

According to the Government's forecast, total supply is expected to increase
from 27.6 million tons in 1978 to 52.7 million tons in 1985, representing an
annual increase of about 9.5%. Although the production of hydroelectricity
would increase from 2.6 million tons in 1978 to 2.9 million tons in 1985,
reflecting the addition of Aswan II (1,100 GWh), its contribution to the total
supply would decrease from 9% in 1978 to 6% in 1985. The Government also
expects that during the same period, crude oil would increase from 24.40
million tons to 46.50 million tons which represents an average annual increase
of about 9.6%. Natural gas is expected to contribute about 6% of the total
production of hydrocarbons in 1985 as compared to 2% in 1978. On the consump-
tion side the total domestic consumption is expected to grow from 14.77
million tons in 1978 to 28.40 million tons in 1985, which represents an annual
increase of 10%. The total consumption of petroleum products is expected to
increase from 10.1 million tons in 1978 to 19.8 million tons in 1985, remain-
ing practically a constant percentage (68% to 70%) of the total domestic
consumption.
1.08      Government projections anticipate a sharp upswing in petroleum
production. Against the current production of 25 million tons, Egypt antici-
pates reaching a production level of 35 million tons by 1982 and 47 million
tons by 1983, a production level it hopes to maintain thereafter. The Govern-
ment projections are bieng made, despite the fact that major oil fields,
especially El Morgan, Ramadan, July, etc., which currently account for almost
50% of Egypt's oil production, are likely to peak by 1981. Attainment of a
production rate of 47 million tons is therefore concommitant on new discoveries
being made, which will not only double the current level of production, but
would also make good the shortfalls in production arising in the Gulf of Suez
oil fields. It is very probable, that the assumed discovery ratio, which is
the basis for these projections, may not materialize resulting in significant
shortfalls. In any case on account of lags which are inherent in the develop-
ment of an oil field, it appears extremely unlikely that Egypt would be able
to achieve targets stipulated for 1983-85.
Energy Development Policy
1.09      While Egypt's energy outlook has consistently improved over the
last decade, its medium and long term outlook is not clear. A fast growing
domestic demand for oil stimulated by prices well below the international
level, decreasing productivity in some of Egypt's major oil fields, slackening
in exploration activities are areas of concern. On the other hand there are
large areas in the Western Desert, Delta Basin, and the Nile Basin which have
not yet been explored. An American group of experts reviewed the potential
for oil and gas in Egypt and concluded that an intensive exploration and
drilling program could significantly increase the known reserves within
Egypt. 1/ In order to assist Egypt in this area, Bank is currently financing

an exploration study which, inter alia, would attempt to reorganize, collate,
and reinterpret the existing geological, seismic and drilling data. It would
also cover the past production data and assess whether it would be viable to
go in for secondary and enhanced recovery. Significant gas discoveries have
been made in Egypt over the last few years. Presently the production potential
of natural gas is greater than demand, but the situation is likely to reverse
itself over the next few years. Egypt would therefore need to place greater
emphasis on gas exploration since its ability to develop and utilize gas
instead of oil within the economy increases its exportable surplus of oil.
Again, in order to assist Egypt in this area, Bank-financed consultants are
carrying out seismic interpretation of structures in the Western Desert and
offshore Alexandria which are reported to hold potential for gas. In parallel
Egypt would need to rapidly delineate and develop a recently discovered gas
field north of Alexandria.
1.10      Coal.  If a mine were opened at the Maghara coal deposits, it could
yield enough coal to fuel a 600-MW power plant for about 20 years. The basic
issue at present is to determine whether it is more economic to construct the
plant at the mouth of the mine and transmit the power to the main load centers
or to transport coal by pipeline to a plant either at Suez or El-Arish. A
feasibility study for the construction of a coal fired plant is expected to
start shortly. Meanwhile, the Government is in the process of initiating an
extensive coal exploration program.
1.11      Power.  The bulk of future electric energy would be generated by
thermal power plants (oil, gas, coal and nuclear fueled stations) because
the remaining hydropower potential that would be tapped from the construction
of few small dams between Aswan and Cairo is small relative to the expected
growth in demand for electricity. Use of coal and increased utilization of
small scale renewable energy schemes such as solar pumping, mini-hydro, and
improvement in the use of non-commercial energy would postpone the need to
construct nuclear power plants until the early nineties (para. 1.23). During
the eighties, therefore, Egypt would continue to rely on conventional thermal
power plants (oil, gas and coal) and the more intensely utilized hydro power
potential.
Energy Pricing Policy
1.12      Domestic prices for energy are set at levels which are unrealis-
tically low relative to world prices. The Government subsidizes the prices of
petroleum products and electricity tariffs. In the case of Egypt, the subsidy
is economic rather than financial in nature, with the exception of some
financial subsidy which is extended to a few large industrial consumers of
electricity. Economic subsidy is the difference between the domestic prices
and the average revenue foregone by diverting oil and petroleum products from
the export market to the domestic market. In January 1980, in a move to
improve energy pricing, the Government increased the prices of petroleum
products by about 20%, with the exception of the prices of LPG and fuel oil,
which remained unchanged. Electricity tariffs for residential and small
commercial consumers were also increased on the average by 20% (para. 1.31),
Table 2 summarizes the relevant information on pricing, consumption and
subsidies that pertain to petroleum products.

The bulk of the economic subsidy (difference between world and domestic
prices) is extended to industry through the domestic price paid for industrial
fuels; mainly fuel oil, natural gas, diesel oil and gas oil. These products
account for 76% of the total hydrocarbons consumed and receive about 74% of
the economic subsidy. Although the overall level of all prices for petroleum
products is low, the price for premium gasoline is the closest to the inter-
national level (66% of the international prices). By contrast, the price
level for fuel oil and equivalent natural gas (considered essential for
Egypt's effort to industrialize) is only 6% of the international price.
Sector Organization
1.13      Egypt's energy sector is managed by the Ministry of Electricity
(MEE) and the Ministry of Petroleum (MOP). MEE controls the power subsector
through four entities (Annex 1.1): (a) the Egyptian Electricity Authority
(EEA) a publicly owned enterprise responsible for almost all of the elec-
tricity generated and transmitted in Egypt. The distribution of electricity
is entrusted to seven publicly owned distribution enterprises under the
supervision of EEA; (b) the Qattara Hydropower and Renewable Energy Resources
Project Authority (QPA) responsible for the construction of hydro projects in
coordination with the Ministry of Irrigation; (c) the Rural Electrification
Authority (REA) responsible for the construction of the distribution network
in the urban and rural areas; and (d) the Nuclear Power Plants Authority
(NPPA) responsible for planning and construction of nuclear plants. EEA is
the only assets-holding entity, although MEE plans to change the present
arrangement (para. 2.05). The other three are only concerned with project
execution and have no operational responsibilities. Once completed, all
project facilities are turned over to either EEA or one of the distribution
companies.



- 7 -
1.14      The Government-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC)
functions as a holding company under the control of MOP. Its activities
are guided by the Supreme Petroleum Council, chaired by the Minister of
Petroleum. EGPC is responsible for managing and operating all exploration,
production, refining, transportation, distribution and marketing of oil and
gas in Egypt through fourteen affiliates. Four of these affiliates are
partnerships in oil production with foreign companies, seven (totally owned by
EGPC) are involved in refining, transport, marketing and distribution of oil
and gas, and the remaining three are joint ventures in engineering, construc-
tion and drilling.
Bank Group Participation in the Sector
1.15      The Bank Group has made two loans for power in Egypt.  The first
loan (Loan 1453-EGT) was made in 1977 for regional electrification. It pro-
vided for rehabilitation and extension of electric power networks servicing
about 6 million people in 13 urban centers and 19 rural zones outside Cairo
and Alexandria. The second loan (Loan 1733-EGT and IDA Credit 935-EGT) made
in 1979, cofinanced the first two units of Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power
Plant (2x300 MW). Progress on both projects is satisfactory. The Bank has
also acted as Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed study for a survey of the
Power Sector carried out in 1976-1978 and would continue the same role for a
follow-up UNDP project for the improvement of EEA's operation and maintenance
of boilers and combustion turbines. Although slow at times, institutional
progress in the power subsector under Bank guidance continues to be positive.
1.16      The Bank has also made a loan (Loan 1732-EGT) to gather, treat and
transport associated gas from offshore fields in the Gulf of Suez to the
cities of Suez and Cairo. A second loan that would finance the distribution
of natural gas for domestic uses in four suburban areas of Cairo and two small
generating plants (2x25 MW each) is currently being processed (Cairo Gas
Distribution Project).
1.17      Bank lending for energy in Egypt has not only provided foreign
exchange needed for the projects but more importantly it has contributed
to several institutional changes: (a) improved planning for the development
of power subsector including the formulation of a least cost program for
extending electricity service to the rural areas; (b) adoption of a system of
indicators for monitoring the technical and financial performance of the power
entities; (c) improvement of financial reporting and cost accounting systems;
and (d) implementation of various training programs.
Access to Electricity
1.18      Though Egypt's per capita consumption of electricity is relatively
low, it exceeds that of all North African countries (see Table 3 below).

1.19      As a result of the recent acceleration of the Government's national
program for rural electrification and with the assistance provided by bilateral
aid donors or loans from the Bank Group and other development agencies, about
65% of the urban population and 23% of the rural population have now (1980)
access to electricity.
Existing Power Facilities
1.20      EEA owns and operates 17 generating stations with a total capability
of 3,404 MW.  Of these 1,151 MW are in steam electric plants, 647 MW in com-
bustion turbines and 1,606 MW in hydro (Annexes 1.2 and 1.3). Peak demand in
1979 was 2,814 MW with a total net generation of 16,808 GWh.
1.21      The system comprises a 500-kV interconnection between the hydro
plants in the south (Aswan) with the load centers and thermal plants in the
northern part of the country (Cairo and the Nile Delta). A 220-kV network
serves the Northern Egypt loads and 132-kV transmission lines generally
paralleling the 500-kV link, serve the loads in the Nile Valley and nearby
areas.
1.22      Utilization voltage is 380/220 volts and system frequency is 50 Hz.
EEA's general service facilities include general office buildings in Abbassia
(Cairo), a high voltage research center and two training institutes (also in
Cairo), and various other installations throughout the country.
Power Development Program
1.23      EEA's development program is formulated with the assistance of the
Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP) model.  The model is designed to
select the mix of new power plants which would minimize the sum of the present
value of capital cost of all the new plants and the operating cost of the
entire power system.  Both costs are expressed in terms of their opportunity
cost to the economy.  This formulation is revised periodically to reflect the
latest planning data. EEA's long term program for the development of the



- 9 -
power subsector until 2000 takes account of the potential for using coal for
power generation. The inclusion of coal among the possible options allowed
postponement of a 600 MW nuclear power plant planned for commissioning in
1988, replacing it by a coal-fired plant of the same capacity. Programming of
coal-fired plants will continue so long as the relative prices of coal and
fuel oil and the current uncertainties concerning the access of Egypt to
nuclear power remain unchanged.
1.24      The latest least-cost program calls for the early exploitation of
the remaining hydropower potential. At the Aswan dam, the generating capab-
ility would be increased by installing 270 MW additional capacity (Aswan II).
An additional 190 MW could be developed at Esna (89 MW), Nag Hammadi (48 MW),
and Assiut (53 MW) and about 270 MW more at other Nile barrage sites not yet
identified (para. 1.02). According to present plans also, about 4,500 MW of
additional generating capacity would be installed between now and 1987 (more
than double the existing capacity). Of those, 600 MW are included under the
Second Power Project (Loan 1733-EGT), 270 MW of hydro and 300 MW of thermal
are part of the proposed Project, and 300 MW of additional combustion turbines
and 3,000 MW of steam electric capacity are already committed (see Annex 1.2).
1.25      Concurrent expansion in transmission and distribution brings the
total power sector investment program for 1980-1987 to LE 5.7 billion (US$8.2
billion) including escalation and contingencies. The Project makes up about
7% of the total. Details of the investment program are shown in Annex 1.4.
This is a sizable demand on the Government's budget (see para. 4.16) and will
require careful review during preparation of the next five-year plan, par-
ticularly in view of the improvements in power use efficiency and conservation
expected as a result of the energy audits and load management study being
conducted by EEA (para. 1.35).
Rural Electrification
1.26      The Bank's first loan for regional electrification contributed to
the formulation of a least-cost program for the extension of electricity
service to rural Egypt through the National Rural Electrification Plan (NEP).
The principle objective of the NEP is to extend electricity service to the
rural population and rehabilitate the networks around urban areas where the
urban poor tend to concentrate. Upon completion of the program, electricity
would be available to about 28 million inhabitants, of which 40% (about 11
million) would be beneficiaries of the rehabilitation of distribution net-
works. The Bank's involvement in Egypt's rural electrification has attracted
additional assistance from other concessionary sources principally because of
the availability of a national least-cost program through which all regions
in Egypt were ranked on the basis of socio-economic criteria. Ample foreign
financing is available to maintain adequate stocks of equipment and materials,
but REA is faced with an acute shortage of local contractors to implement
REA's large scale program. The regional electrification component of this
Project would overcome this bottleneck by providing financing to cover the
foreign cost of civil works contracts (construction and erection) and enable
REA to achieve its objective through international competitive bidding (para.
3.14).

Electricity Tariffs
1.27      Industrial and commercial consumers with controlled prices:  The
levels of electricity tariffs in Egypt are substantially below the levels that
would convey to consumers the relative scarcity of the resources used in the
production of electricity. The tariffs continue to be subsidized like most
other goods and services in the economy. The subsidy is two-fold: an economic
subsidy and a financial subsidy. All consumers of electricity enjoy an
economic subsidy principally through the low price paid by EEA for inputs
(residual oil, diesel oil and natural gas). To give an example, EEA pays
about LE 7.5/ton (US$11/ton) of fuel oil and natural gas while EGPC could earn
about LE 122/ton (US$180/ton) by exporting the product. This subsidy is in
turn passed on to the electricity consumers.
1.28      In addition to the economic subsidy, a financial subsidy is extended
to the two largest industrial consumers namely, the Kima fertilizer plant and
the Aluminum complex which accounted for 26% of EEA's total sales in 1979 and
which pay 3.33 milliemes/kWh and 2.58 milliemes/kWh respectively as against
EEA's cost of supply of 5.07 milliemes/kWh. The loss suffered by EEA on this
account amounted to LE 7.2 million in 1979 and is expected to reach about LE
8.3 million in 1980.
1.29      At the high and medium voltages, the tariffs are regulated by old
agreements based on EEA's cost structure in the past which is out of step with
the present cost structure. For example, at the time the contract with the
Kima plant was signed there was surplus hydropower, which is no longer the
case. In an effort to improve electricity tariffs, the Bank financed a tariff
study for the high voltage consumers (Phase I) under Loan 1453-EGT. The study
has been delayed about 18 months because of inadequate technical and financial
data. EEA has agreed, however, to: (i) complete Phase I of the tariff study
by March 31, 1981; (ii) submit to the Government and the Bank, by June 30,
1981, a draft plan and implementation schedule to increase electricity tariffs
charged to high voltage consumers based on the recommendations of the study;
and (iii) finalize and implement such plan by December 31, 1981.
1.30      The Ministry of Electricity has also agreed to initiate Phase II of
the tariff study to cover the medium and low voltage consumers. To avoid the
delays experienced in Phase I, the consultant will be responsible for super-
vising collection of the required data, training EEA staff in tariff work,
advising EEA on the establishment of a Tariff Department and completing the
study according to a specific timetable. Consequently, EEA has agreed to:
(i) complete Phase II of the tariff study by December 31, 1981; (ii) submit
recommendations from the study to the Government and the Bank by March 31,
1982; and (iii) implement such recommendations by June 30, 1982. The Govern-
ment, in turn, agreed to enable EEA to comply with above undertakings.
1.31      Residential and small commercial consumers:  As an interim measure,
the Government has introduced as of January 1, 1980, a new tariff structure
for the domestic and small commercial consumers. The new structure is essen-
tially an increasing block rate (higher tariffs for higher consumption). It
provides a minimum level of electricity needed for lighting estimated to be



- 11 -
about 80 kWh/month at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is more than recovered
from the large domestic and small commercial consumers. The new structure is
expected to generate about LE 8.0 million of extra revenues for 1980. It
would also induce conservation in the use of electricity for consumptions
above 150 kWh/month, a badly needed measure in light of the increasing demand
for air conditioning in the principal cities.
1.32      The impact of the new structure on some selected levels of domestic
consumption is as follows: I/
Total Bill Under      Total Bill Under
Level of Consumption        Old Tariffs             New Tariffs        % Change
40 kWh/month           LE 0.66/month         LE 0.60/month          - 9.1
80 kWh/month           LE 1.06/month         LE 1.20/month          +13.2
100 kWh/month           LE 1.26/month         LE 1.60/month          +27.0
200 kWh/month           LE 2.26/month         LE 3.85/month          +70.4
300 kWh/month           LE 3.23/month         LE 6.35/month          +94.8
1.33      Other consumers:  The petroleum and gas subsector charges the
international price for bulk sales of petroleum products to firms with equity
in foreign currency. To move towards a consistent pricing philosophy through-
out the sector, EEA also charges the same firms tariffs that reflect the cost
to the economy of all the resources used in meeting their demand for electri-
city (long run marginal cost). Similarly, EEA's tariffs will be adlusted to
reflect changes in the price of fuels supplied to EEA by EGPC (para. 1.36).
Sectoral Issues
1.34      The price system in Egypt is still characterized by a great deal of
centralized control and involves substantial explicit and implicit subsidies
on many goods and services. The prices of energy supplies are set at levels
that are substantially below their opportunity cost (border prices) to the
economy. The Government has deliberately kept the overall price of energy low
relative to the rest of the domestic prices to foster industrial growth through
publicly owned enterprises. At present, close to 58% of all petroleum products
is consumed by industry and the power sector, and about 82% of the electricity
generated is consumed either by industry or Government-related activities.
The low prices for energy continue to hinder the ability of the entities in
the energy sector to generate sufficient revenue to finance thp capital
investment necessary to meet future needs. An additional shortcoming of the
present pricing philosophy is that the relative scarcity of the various
competing energy products is not reflected in the prevailing subsidized
system.
1/   Old Tariffs:  16.5 milliemes/kWh for the first 45 kWh and 10 milliemes/
kWh thereafter.
New Tariffs:  15 milliemes/kWh for the first 80 kWh, 20 milliemes/kWh
for consumption from 80 kWh up to 150 kWh and 25 milliemes
thereafter.



- 12 -
1.35      Moving domestic prices of energy resources to the international
level should be the goal of any national pricing policy. This however, is a
long-term objective, whose time horizon differs from country to country. The
time horizon is primarily determined by the ability of the country to struc-
turally adjust and absorb the new higher prices. This adjustment is partic-
ularly difficult in economies like Egypt's with extensive systems of subsidies,
price controls and quantity rationing which also make the assessment of the
impact of large increases in the price of a widely used good, such as energy,
difficult to determine. In such cases, changes in the prices of energy should
be implemented through a series of short-term adjustments to avoid sudden
shocks that could disturb all other prices throughout the economy. The Bank
is financing a pricing study for petroleum products and another study for the
formulation of electricity tariffs (paras. 1.29 and 1.30). Both studies aim
at proposing changes in both the prices of petroleum products and the tariffs
of electricity that would result in the improvement of the overall pricing of
energy in Egypt while having the least possible adverse impact on the economy.
The implementation of the results of these studies would require continued
Bank involvement in the sector. In this regard, Government has agreed to
implement regulations to be proposed by EEA in line with energy audits in
major industrial installations being carried out by EEA as part of a load
research and management study under loan 1733-EGT, to determine suitable plant
and process modernization programs leading to lower specific energy consump-
tion through improved utilization efficiency.
1.36      Any strategy aimed at improving energy pricing in Egypt should make
use of the strong linkage between the power subsector and that of oil and gas.
Since about 62% of the total production of electricity is consumed by indus-
trial consumers, increases in the prices of hydrocarbons used for power
generation could be introduced into the productive sectors of the economy via
the electricity tariffs. The Bank's efforts are being directed, therefore, as
a first step, towards improving the prices of fuels used for power generation,
and the integration of these prices in the electricity tariffs. Consequently,
Government has agreed that whenever it shall approve any change in the price
of fuels supplied to EEA by EGPC, it would take simultaneously appropriate
action to enable EEA to adjust its tariffs accordingly. EEA, in turn, agreed
to adjust its tariff as necessary to pass on the full fuel price increase to
its consumers.
II. THE BORROWER/BENEFICIARY AND PROJECT ENTITIES
General
2.01       Three MEE agencies (EEA, QPA and REA) would be involved in carrying
out the Project. EEA would be the Borrower under the proposed Bank Loan. EEA
would also be the Beneficiary under the proposed IDA Credit. The IDA Credit
would be made to the Government who would, in turn, onlend it to EEA on the
same terms as the Bank Loan (para. 3.10). The terms and conditions for



- 13 -
onlending of the IDA Credit would be the subject of a subsidiary loan agree-
ment. Execution of this subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of
credit effectiveness. EEA would delegate on QPA and REA execution of the
hydro and distribution components respectively. Specific Project Agreements
would be entered into between the Bank and REA/QPA.
2.02      QPA has been reorganized under strong leadership (para. 2.06) and
reinforced with experienced technical and administrative personnel transferred
over from other MEE agencies. In addition, QPA counts on close support from
the Ministry of Irrigation including the working group responsible for the
Water Master Plan Project financed by UNDP under Bank supervision. REA has
also developed strong project management capability in the Project unit
established at the request of the Bank under the first power loan. In summary,
both QPA and REA are well organized and capable of carrying out their respec-
tive assignments under the proposed Project.
Legal Structure
2.03      EEA was established as the sole public electric utility in Egypt in
early 1976 as part of a general reorganization of the power sector by MEE.
Additional details covering EEA's organization and management are given in the
SAR for the Second Power Project (Report No. 2445-EGT). EEA also controls
the distribution of electricity throughout Egypt through majority ownership
in seven subsidiary distribution companies established January 1, 1979.
2.04      Prior to the establishment of these distribution companies, EEA was
directly responsible for distribution (at 11 kV and below) in the Cairo and
Alexandria zones, and the municipalities in the other zones. The companies
commenced operations on January 1, 1979 as separate entities with their own
budgets and with staff transferred from EEA and the municipalities. While all
the seven companies were responsible for distribution in their respective
jurisdictions, the five distribution companies operating also in rural areas,
i.e., those other than Cairo and Alexandria, were also responsible for super-
vising REA's construction projects within their areas. It was envisaged that
EEA would exercise overall management control over these companies and would
continue to provide certain specific services to them including research,
training, foreign procurement, foreign borrowing, major maintenance, approval
of work standards and specifications and long-range planning, to be provided
on a reimbursable basis.
2.05      Experience of one year in 1979 has shown that the present set-up of
the distribution companies needs to be changed for two main reasons. First,
with its ever-increasing generation and transmission activities, EEA has been
unable to provide any guidance to the distribution companies or to exercise
effective control over them, and their relationship has deteriorated to a mere
supplier/client relationship for electricity supply. Secondly, working rela-
tionships are also not satisfactory in the case of the five rural distribution
companies (other than Cairo and Alexandria) owing to their being accountable
to EEA for distribution activities and to REA for supervision of its rural



- 14 -
electrification projects. The Ministry therefore proDoses to transfer control
of the five distribution companies from EEA to REA, which apart from integrst--
ing both construction and operation of distribution facilities under one
authority might also promote economies by permitting the surplus labor of tl:e
companies being utilized for executing REA's projects presently executed by
outside contractors. Such a change would require the following:
(a) Government should provide the legal basis for the change either
through legal enactment or through a ministerial decree;
(b) REA should be reorganized and its managerial capabilities
strengthened to enable it to discharge its new responsibilities
for operations;
(c)  in the event of non-payment of electricity bills by the five dis-
tribution companies, a possibility in view of their weak financial
position, REA and Government should assure EEA of prompt payment
of the dues;
(d) REA should assume EEA's obligations under existing loan covenants
insofar as they relate to distribution companies in particular
regarding rate of return, accounts receivable for electricity supply
and debt service coverage; and
(e) EEA should continue to be responsible for preparation of con-
solidated financial statements with appropriate help from the
distribution companies and REA.
These aspects have been discussed with Government, EEA and REA and satisfactory
solutions would be reached in due course.
2.06      QPA was established originally under Law No. 14 of 1976 to carry
out investigations related to the development of the Qattara Depression
Generating Scheme 1/, under the name Qattara Depression Authority. Recently,
QPA under the new name Qattara Hydropower and Renewable Energy Resources
Project Authority has been given the task of identifying, preparing and
implementing all hydroelectric projects in Egypt (para. 1.13). The Aswan Dam
redevelopment (Aswan II) included in this Project would represent the first
hydro project undertaken by QPA.  Other major hydro projects being studied by
QPA in addition to Qattara itself 2/ are pumped storage hydro along the
western shore of the Gulf of Suez and hydro power development at the Nile
barrages at Esna, Nag Hammadi and Assiut.  In addition, QPA is also respon-
sible for developing solar energy, biomass, geothermal and other renewable
energy resources.
1/   Water from the Mediterranean is to be channeled to the Qattara Depression
about 160 km southwest of Alexandria.
2/   The Qattara project as originally proposed (excavation using nuclear
explosives) has been abandoned. A new approach using conventional
explosives is being studied with assistance from Sweden.



- 15-
2.07      REA would be responsible for execution of the distribution component
of the Project as part of REA's National Rural Electrification Plan (para.
1.26). This would be the second Bank-financed project with REA participating
as Executing Agency. REA is also Executing Agency for the Regional Electrifi-
cation Project being financed under Loan 1453-EGT.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01      The Project would help meet the 1986 load of EEA's interconnected
system. In addition, on the institutional side, it would strengthen project
management capabilities in EEA, QPA and REA, provide a framework for the
improvement of energy prices and continue the institution building measures
initiated in EEA under the two earlier loans.
Project Description
3.02      The proposed project would consist of:  (a) a hydro power redevelop-
ment (4x67.5 MW) in upper Egypt (Aswan II); (b) the third 300-MW steam electric
generating unit to complete the Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station near
Cairo (Shoubrah No. 3); and (c) rehabilitation and extension of distribution
systems in urban, suburban and rural areas outside Cairo and Alexandria (about
6,990 km of 11-kV and 380/220 volts lines and 250 MVA of distribution trans-
former capacity).
Hydro Power Redevelopment
3.03      The hydro power component of the project would add 4x67.5 MW of
Kaplan turbine generators at the old (1902) Aswan irrigation dam to obtain
about 1,100 GWh/a additional generation from programmed irrigation water
releases from Lake Nasser, behind the High Dam (Map IBRD 14794). The new
installations would operate interconnected with the national grid system.
Thermal Plant
3.04      Addition of the third unit at Shoubrah El Kheima, north of Cairo
(Map IBRD 14795), would complete the development of this site to its full
capability (3x300 MW). This portion of the project would round out the work
being financed by Bank/IDA and EEC Special Action Fund through Loan 1733-EGT
and Credits 985/20-EGT.
Distribution
3.05      Rehabilitation and extension of distribution in outlying towns and
suburban and rural areas (Maps IBRD 14796/97) would improve service to a
population of about 1 million and bring electric service for the first time
to another 2 million inhabitants. Because of a chronic lack of foreign
exchange funds upgrading has been less than adequate and service extensions
to new consumers greatly curtailed. The Project would tend to remedy these
deficiencies.

3.07      For the hydro generation component, the cost estimate was based on
the revised Aswan II cost estimate prepared by QPA's consultants (SWECO-Sweden)
in October 1979, as modified to take into account possible cost reductions
attainable through minor design changes proposed by the Bank. The cost esti-
mate for the thermal generation component was based on the figures in the
feasibility study by Sanderson & Porter, Inc. (US) for the first two Shoubrah
El Kheima units after a joint review with EEA personnel assigned to the
construction of the first Shoubrah stage (Loan/Credit 1733/935-EGT). Cost
figures for the distribution component were developed with data from the First
Regional Electrification Project (Loan 1453-EGT) and planning figures devel-
oped by REA and its distribution consultants, Harza/Sabbour (US/Egypt).
Man-month costs of engineering and project management for the hydro component
are estimated at $8,420, based on SWECO's contract for QPA (para. 3.13).
Similarly, Bechtel's contract with EEA for the thermal component and Harza's
contract with REA for the distribution component show $8,500 and $7,390 per
man-month, respectively. Above figures include salaries, social costs, over-
head and fee, but no reimbursables.   On the above bases, the resulting
project cost estimate is considered reasonable.
3.08      A physical contingency of 15% was applied to the hydro generation
cost estimate to take account of pending design data refinements involving
underwater excavations, which are to be optimized based on firm bid prices.
Lower physical contingencies were assumed for the thermal generation (7%)
and distribution (5%) estimates to reflect availability of better site data.
Price contingencies of 10.5% for 1980, 9.0% for 1981, 8.0% for 1982, 7.0%
for 1983-85, and 6% for 1986 were applied to both equipment and civil works
estimates in line with the best available data on expected price escalation.
Custom Duties and Taxes
3.09      In accordance with usual Government practice, all items specifically
imported for Government projects would be exempt from custom duties and taxes,
including payments made to foreign consultants. No custom duties or taxes are
therefore included.
Project Financing Plan
3.10      The proposed Project would be financed from the following sources:

/1   Excludes interest during construction.
The Bank/IDA financing would cover about 22% of the total cost.  The Bank loan
would be for 20 years including a 5-year period of grace; the IDA credit would
be subject to normal IDA terms and be repayable over 50 years including a
10-year period of grace. The IDA credit would be onlent to EEA under the same
terms and conditions of the Bank loan (para. 2.01) and would be disbursed
first, ahead of it (para. 3.15). The contributions from CIDA, OECF and the
Netherlands would be grants to REA through the Government. They would be tied
to procurement under specific regulations of the donor countries. The CIDA
and Dutch contributions have already been negotiated and signed. The balance
of the financing (OECF and Export Credits) would be processed after negotia-
tions on the Bank Group funding. The bidding documents for both the hydro and
thermal components require interested suppliers to submit a financing proposal
with their offer. As evidenced in a recent meeting in Paris (March 13-15,
1980) to discuss cofinancing, all indications are that there will be no
difficulties in obtaining export credits. Nevertheless, completion of a
satisfactory financing plan for Aswan II would be a condition of loan/credit
effectiveness. In addition, completion of the financing plan for the Third
Shoubrah Unit would be a condition of disbursement for that portion of the
loan/credit. Agreement would be sought with major cofinanciers on a Financial
Administration Agreement to provide for mutual cooperation during execution
and supervision of the Project. Cross default clauses are also envisaged with
major cofinanciers with a view to assure a reasonably complete financing plan
for the Project at all times. The Government would provide, as necessary, all
funds required to close the foreign exchange gap.
3.11      All local loans would be furnished to EEA by the Government subject
to interest at 5% p.a. and repayable over 12 years after a 3-year grace
period. The Government is expected to provide for local costs in its annual
budgets, and under Government's budgetary procedures, budget allocations are
made available to EEA every month so that adequate local funds would always



- 19 -
be available to meet local currency expenditures. The Government would also
provide EEA with funds to meet interest during construction on the various
loans and the service charges on the Credit estimated to be about US$102.0
million and to cover any possible cost overrun on the Project. EEA would bear
the foreign exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan and on the subsidiary loan
related to the IDA Credit.
Project Implementation
3.12      The project would be implemented in about five years (see Annex
3.3) starting with the hydro and distribution components in early 1981. The
expected completion date is December 1986 when the third Shoubrah unit is
scheduled for commercial operation. Table 5 lists the agencies involved in
the implementation of the different project components. Once commissioned all
components would be operated and maintained by EEA or one of the EEA's distri-
bution subsidiaries (para. 1.13).

Distribution Companies
A Project Unit for each of the project components has established within
each participating agencies. The Project Units, in turn, report to a Project
Coordinating Committee established March 29, 1979, under the Ministry of
Electricity.
Design and Supervision
3.13      Under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, consultants have been
engaged for the design, preparation of bidding documents and specifications,
and management and supervision of construction for each of the three project
components. (SWECO-Sweden for Aswan II, Bechtel-US for Shoubrah III, and
Harza/Sabbour-US/Egypt for Rural Electrification.)
Procurement
3.14      Procurement under the proposed loan/credit  (primarily civil works
for all three project components) would be through international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's procurement guidelines. Civil
works contractors for all three components would be subject to prequalifica-
tion. Bid documents for Aswan II civil works were issued February 15, 1980.
Proposals are due May 17, 1980. Bids for Shoubrah No. 3 civil works will be



- 20 -
invited by mid-1981 together with the civil works for the first two Shoubrah
units being financed under the second power loan (Loan 1733-EGT et al).
Although the civil works contracts for the distribution component will cover
widely scattered areas throughout the country, bids will be invited for large
enough contract packages to attract reputable international firms (para. 1.26).
A tentative bidding schedule is shown in Annex 3.4.
Disbursement
3.15      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against
100% of the foreign cost of imported items, 70% of the civil works contracts
for the hydro component, 72% of the civil works contract for thermal component,
50% of the civil works contracts for the distribution component (estimated
foreign exchange portions of such civil works contracts), and 100% of the cost
of engineering services. A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown in
Annex 3.5. The closing date would be June 30, 1987.
Environmental Aspects
3.16      The hydro component includes only minor structures on the downstream
face of the old Aswan irrigation dam. The environmental impact therefore will
be insignificant. Even from an esthetic point of view, the old dam will
remain the dominant factor of the area's landscape. Care would be exercised
in the architectural design of the forebay and the power house to present an
unobtrusive blend with the existing massive stone structures of the old
dam.
3.17      Measures to attenuate the effects of burning heavy fuel oil (mazout)
at Shoubrah El Kheima and other environmental aspects of the plant's opera-
tion are discussed at length in the SAR for the first two units (Report No.
2446-EGT). No particular environmental problems are envisaged in relation to
the extension of the Shoubrah project to accommodate the third unit to bring
the site to full capability (3x300 MW). As agreed under Loan 1733-EGT at
least one of the three units will be operated on gas.
3.18      The distribution component involves work consisting entirely of
rehabilitation and extension of overhead and underground distribution. The
overhead lines would be built mostly in agricultural areas. No significant
environmental impact is expected.
Risks
3.19      Difficult underwater excavations in the hydro component for which
additional field surveys are being made (para. 3.08) are the major physical
risks. On the institutional side, the major risks are inadequate performance
of EEA under existing covenants in Loans 1453-1733-EGT and the yet unsecured
cofinancing for electrical and mechanical equipment of the hydro and thermal
components. However, as a result of the ongoing discussions on energy pricing
with the Government and EEA, early agreement on acceptable measures to over-
come EEA's financial difficulties is foreseen. Also, provisions for adequate
safeguards in the loan/credit documents would ensure adequate financing
throughout project execution (para. 3.10). Other risks are also manageable
and no major implementation problems are expected.

IV. FINANCE
Budget
4.01      Since its formation in 1976, EEA has prepared its own annual budget
and 5-year plans which are submitted through the Minister of Electricity for
approval by Parliament. With the formation of the seven new distribution com-
panies, EEA's budget is prepared separately from those of the distribution
companies; however, they will be consolidated for the Bank's purposes. EEA's
5-year plan (the current one for 1979-83) is now updated each year by dropping
the current year and adding a further year. Inclusion of a project in the
5-year plan represents Government's approval and agreement to commit funds
over the 5-year plan period without prescribing specific amounts for each year
of the plan.
Accounts
4.02      Although EEA planned to establish its own chart of accounts when it
was formed, it still follows and is bound by the chart of accounts and the
accounting principles described in the Government's "Standardized Accounting
System." This system does not serve EEA's needs as a utility and is geared
more to furnishing statistical information for Government. Some of its more
serious weaknesses are:
(a) poor property accounting;
(b) poor control of subsidiaries' accounting practices and
non-reconciliation of accounts with the subsidiaries;
(c) improper accrual of revenues and expenses leading to distortions
in earnings;
(d) unsatisfactory cost and budgetary control; and
(e) lack of a proper management information system.
Although some progress was made in removing the deficiencies in the accounting
system during the implementation phase of a study by Sanderson and Porter
(S&P), Inc., New York, management consultants, that ended in August 1979, much
remains to be done to establish an appropriate accounting system in EEA and
the distribution companies. This work, with special reference to the distribu-
tion companies, to be completed in 26 months, has now been entrusted to NRECA
International (US), the consultant appointed for the purpose in December, 1979.
The systems developed for the distribution companies would be coordinated with
those of EEA.
4.03      S&P had also been developing the management information system
(MIS) concept within EEA with the full support of EEA's management. However,
the work could not be completed by the firm in the time available. The new
consultant (NRECA International) is handling the work of modification of the



- 22 -
existing accounting system and the establishment of a management information
system. EEA would establish a revised accounting and management information
system based on the recommendations of the consultant, in consultation with
the Bank and by a date to be agreed with the Bank.
4.04      Following up on the work of S&P, EEA has carried out a joint study
(by Harza Engineering Company, International (US) with a foreign cost of
about $165,000 financed under Loan 1453-EGT) with REA of their combined needs
for a commercial computer. Procurement action for a suitable computer (cost:
$350,000) to be financed under Loan 1453-EGT is underway.
Revaluation of Assets
4.05      Loan 1453-EGT required EEA to complete the valuation of its existing
fixed assets and to establish a formula acceptable to the Bank for revaluation
of the assets to reflect price changes. S&P, the consultants appointed by EEA
for this purpose, recommended the valuation of EEA's gross fixed assets at
about LE 601 million as of December 31, 1977 as against the historical cost
of LE 492 million, an increase of about 22% in the recorded values. The
valuation of LE 601 million (US$864 million or $318/kW of installed capacity)
for a system with a total effective generating capacity (1977) of 2,721 MW
(919 MW in steam electric plants, 236 MW in combustion turbines and 1,566 MW
in hydro) along with associated transmission and distribution facilities
appears rather modest, and is significantly below S&P's estimate of US$4
billion for the replacement value of the system in November 1976. However,
the Bank and EEA agreed to the valuation as an acceptable starting point for
several reasons: (i) many of the assets are new, and there was no better
valuation to go by; (ii) since the object of the proposed revaluation exercise
was not to compute the replacement value of the assets but rather to restate
the historical cost to reflect the price level changes, a 22% increase need
not necessarily be inadequate; and (iii) considering the magnitude of the
assets expected to be brought into service in future compared to the existing
assets, establishment of appropriate principles for revaluation in future
would be relatively more important than a precise determination of existing
values. Under Loan 1733-EGT, EEA and the Bank have agreed to the following
revaluation principles.
4.06       In view of the difficulty of having a single index reflecting price
inflation of all capital goods (both imported equipment as well as local con-
struction costs), it would be appropriate to use two different indices for
valuing foreign and local expenditures. The consultants recommended that for
revaluing the local cost component, the Construction Material Cost Index as
periodically issued by the Egyptian Center for Mobilization and Statistics be
used. For revaluing the foreign cost component, an index for the prices of
machinery and equipment exported by developed countries such as the one pub-
lished by the United Nations (Annex 4.1) will be used. Using such index for
foreign cost and the Construction Material Cost Index referred to above for
local cost, EEA would revalue its fixed assets and those of the distribution
companies beginning with the fiscal year 1978 and every year thereafter. Pend-
ing an acceptable determination of foreign and local costs from 1978, the



- 23 -
assets shown in the financial forecasts in Annex 4.3 have been revalued through
1987 using the valuation established by the consultants for the assets as of
the end of December 1977 and applying the above-mentioned indices for subse-
quent revaluations as of the end of December of each year.
Past Performance and Present Position of the Borrower
4.07      The income statements and balance sheets of EEA for the years 1977-
1987 are given in Annexes 4.2 and 4.3. In 1977, EEA's second year of opera-
tion as an independent electricity authority, it earned a modest profit of
LE 11.9 million. The results produced a rate of return of 10.0% in 1977 on
unrevalued assets. In 1978, EEA is estimated to have earned a return of
5.8% on revalued assets. EEA's internal cash generation, which is a better
measure of performance considering the valuation of its assets, was nil in
1977 and 7% of expansion requirements in 1978.
4.08      While the rates of return achieved appear to be reasonable, they
have been obtained in a period when EEA has reaped the benefits of cheap
Aswan hydro power, and subsidized fuel oil at LE 7.50 a ton (US$10.80/ton)
compared to the recent world market price of fuel oil of about $180 a ton
(January 1980). In addition, salaries and wages were very low averaging about
LE 380 per annum per employee (US$550 equivalent), although this advantage is
offset by considerable overstaffing. With the growth in demand for electric
energy to be met in the next 5-6 years from fossil-fueled plants, the possi-
bility of Government reducing the fuel oil subsidy and the likelihood of
large increases in salaries and wages (e.g., 1978 salary and wage increase of
30%), the future outlook is for much higher electricity rates. The 20%
increase in electricity rates for the industry in 1975 had met with strong
resistance from the large Government-owned industrial consumers who use about
60% of all electricity sold and it was only in January 1978 that the increase
was ratified. (Domestic rates were unchanged through December 1979.) Disputes
over the legality of the increase helped increase the total unpaid electricity
accounts to LE 60 million (US$84 million equivalent) as of August 31, 1978;
the disputes have since been resolved.
Earnings Review
4.09      The Agreement under Loan 1453-EGT provided for a review by December
31, 1978 of the timing of tariff action and other measures necessary to
achieve the rate of return objective. This review was to take place as part
of a general review of provisions related to EEA's financial performance
agreed with the Bank and other aid donors. EEA was not able to furnish this
plan because of the uncertainties in the sector following the establishment of
the distribution companies and delays in the ongoing tariff study. However,
under Loan 1733-EGT, revised financial targets were set for EEA for the period
from 1980 onwards, and as part of the effort to make the loan effective,
Government, EEA and the Bank have had under constant review since mid-1979
the measures required for EEA to achieve the minimum 5% return required for
1980. In view of the importance of such a review EEA would submit to the
Bank for its review, by November 30 of each year, a forecast of the combined
earnings of EEA and the distribution companies for the next year and the



- 24 -
measures proposed to secure the required rate of return for that year and, by
December 31, establish in conjunction with Government, a plan of action satis-
factory to the Bank to secure such rate of return.
Collection of Electricity Supply Bills
4.10      EEA has always had difficulties in collecting its electricity supply
bills from entities in the public sector such as municipalities, public utili-
ties, Government buildings and Government industrial companies. In the case
of Government industrial companies, the failure to pay is often the result of
a genuine lack of funds on account of the prices of their goods and services
being controlled by the Government (para 1.34). EEA's collection problem was
addressed under both Loan 1453-EGT of July 1977 and Loan 1733-EGT of September
1979. Under Loan 1453-EGT, Government agreed to take all measures necessary
on its part to enable EEA to reduce its accounts receivable to not more than
three months' sales by December 31, 1978. Under Loan 1733-EGT, EEA agreed to
ensure that its accounts receivable for the sale of electricity would at no
time exceed the equivalent of three months' sales, and Government further
agreed to take all measures necessary on its part to enable EEA to achieve
this and to cause its agencies at all times to pay EEA all amounts for elec-
tricity sales that are outstanding for more than three months. As a result of
vigorous action by Government and EEA in pursuance of these undertakings,
EEA's receivables for the sale of electricity, which amounted to eight months'
revenues at the end of 1975, were equivalent to only four months' revenues at
the end of August 1979 (breakdown given in Annex 4.4). Of the sum of LE 40.325
million outstanding at the end of August 1979, a sum of LE 9.021 million repre-
sents outstandings from municipalities for 1978, the responsibility for the
payment of which has been accepted in principle by the Ministry of Finance.
If this amount were excluded, the net receivables would be the equivalent of
only 3.1 months' revenues. Thus as of August 1979 Government and EEA were in
compliance with the covenants under Loan 1733-EGT. However, since the collec-
tion problem is a continuing one and prompt collection of bills is so essen-
tial for EEA's liquidity, the covenants under Loan 1733-EGT would be repeated
under the proposed loan.
Interest During Construction
4.11       In 1976 and 1977, EEA did not charge interest to construction but
charged the total interest expense against revenues. Since then, however,
EEA has started capitalizing interest on funds borrowed for new investments.
Liability for Income Tax
4.12      EEA has prepared its income statements assuming that it is not
liable for income taxes. This position may change since Government is review-
ing the question as to why EEA and the distribution companies should not pay
taxes on their profits. If it is finally determined that income taxes are
payable by EEA including the distribution companies, EEA has agreed to include
the taxes in operating expenses for determining its rate of return under the
loan covenants.



- 25 -
4.13      EEA's debt equity ratio improved marginally from 74/26 at 1976-end
to 72/28 at 1977-end based on its historical balance sheet figures. With the
revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1977 resulting in the creation of a
revaluation reserve, the debt/equity ratio improved to 63/37 at the end of
1978. However, long-term debt has not been valued to reflect current rates of
exchange. EEA has agreed under Loans 1453-EGT and 1733-EGT to revalue its debt
each year on the basis of current exchange rates. This current value would be
recorded in a footnote to its balance sheet. EEA's debt/equity ratio may be
expected to strengthen further with the increased earnings assumed in future
for compliance with the rate of return covenant and as it makes use of grant
funds from USAID, other donors and Government and also revalues its gross
fixed assets and depreciation. The bulk (90%) of EEA's existing long-term
debt is owed to Government and is repayable over 12 years subject to annual
interest of 5%. The remainder comprises USSR loans for the Aswan project and
short-term suppliers' credits.
4.14      EEA's debt service coverage (times annual debt service is covered
by internal cash generation) in 1977 was only about 0.7 due mainly to the
abnormally high repayments made on its loans to Government. It improved to
1.1 in 1978 and further improved to a satisfactory 1.3 in 1979. The current
ratio which was 1.3 at 1977-end fell to 1.0 at 1978-end reflecting a tight
liquidity position, but improved to a comfortable 1.9 at 1979-end.
Financing Plan
4.15      The forecast of sources and applications of funds of EEA for the
period 1979-87 assuming the tariff increases indicated in para. 4.19 is given

4.16      It will be seen from the above table that EEA's investment program
for 1980-87 will require about LE 6,199 million (US$8,926 million) which is
expected to be financed 12% from net internal cash generation, 16% from grants
from USAID and other donors and Government, and 72% from borrowings. After
allowing for debt service but before providing for working capital increase,
the internal cash generation would be about 21%, which is adequate considering
that the cash generation during 1980 would be nil. Since the bulk of the
borrowings of LE 4,475 million (US$6,445 million) have not been arranged, the
financing plan is subject to uncertainty, which calls in question the realism
of the program in the light of the resources available. The program itself
is by no means unrealistic. Although it forms 20% of Government's total



- 27 -
investment program, it is an acceptable share for power sector investments
in a developing country. It is expected that reasonably assured financing
arrangements would be made for the Project itself (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
Also, since Egypt has in the past secured all financing necessary for its
power sector investments, it would be reasonable to accept the planning
assumptions underlying the investment program. If resource constraints
develop, the program would be pruned to fit the available resources.
Future Performance
4.17      On the basis that Government wishes to establish EEA as a financially
viable entity with a level of earnings which will provide some of its future
expansion needs from internal resources after meeting its operating expenses
and debt service obligations, Loan 1453-EGT required EEA to earn a rate
of return of at least 9% on average net fixed assets in operation as revalued
from time to time. This followed a similar covenant agreed earlier (July
1976) by EEA with USAID in the loan agreement for the Helwan-Talkha combustion
turbine projects. It was, however, envisaged when the loan was approved that
the target for 1979 might be difficult to achieve and that the plan to be
submitted by EEA at the end of 1978 would afford all parties an opportunity to
exchange views on this target. In the course of subsequent reviews of EEA's
earnings prospects, it was clear that it could not earn the required 9% return
in 1979 without an unconscionably high tariff increase (110% if effective
July 1, 1979) and that considering the environment in which EEA operates, a
gradual achievement of the target over a period of time was all that was
realistically possible. Furthermore, it was recognized that the appropriate
time for any tariff action would be after Government and EEA have had time to
review the recommendations of the tariff study, which was underway. Therefore,
the following plan was agreed under Loan 1733-EGT:
(a) EEA to achieve a minimum return of 5% in 1980, 6% in 1981,
8% in 1982 and 9% in 1983 and thereafter;
(b) as a condition of loan effectiveness, Government and EEA
would agree with the Bank on the measures to be taken,
including their timing, for achieving the proposed minimum
5% return in 1980;
(c) as required under Loan 1453-EGT, EEA would submit to the
Bank by the end of November each year a suitable financial
plan for meeting the agreed rate of return in the follow-
ing year; and
(d) the results apply to the consolidated operations of EEA
and distribution companies.
4.18      The measures to be taken to enable EEA to achieve a minimum 5%
return in 1980 on revalued assets have been under review between Government,
EEA and the Bank since mid-1979. Effective July 1979, Government introduced
special tariffs based on international fuel prices for certain specific
industries having collaboration arrangements with foreign firms selling goods



- 28 -
in the export market. Although the resulting revenue increase is less than
LE 1 million p.a. at present, it will be much more when the 120 or so firms
in question commence payments under the new tariffs on becoming fully opera-
tional. Effective January 1980, Government also revised the tariff structure
of domestic consumers after more than a decade so as to induce conservation in
the use of electricity and also to raise EEA's annual revenues by about LE 8.0
million (para. 1.31). Since it is estimated that at the current level of costs
and revenues EEA would earn the required 5% return in 1980, Loan 1733-EGT was
made effective in April 1980. Government has two other tariff measures also
under consideration: (i) raising the tariffs for incremental sales to the
aluminum industry from the existing contract rate of 2.58 milliemes/kWh to
the normal tariff rate of 5.072 milliemes/kWh (LE 1.1 million in 1980); and
(ii) raising the tariffs for the larger hotels from 23 milliemes/kWh to 42
milliemes/kWh. Cost reductions through more efficient operation of EEA's
thermal power stations, rehabilitation of transmission and distribution to
cut down line losses, and improvement of administrative procedures would
complement any tariff action toward fulfilling EEA's financial objectives.
4.19      During the discussions with Government on the measures for securing
for EEA the covenanted rates of return it has become increasingly clear that
setting narrow financial objectives for EEA in isolation without regard to the
system of subsidies and controlled prices that pervades the Egyptian economy
with interlocking relationships between the entities in the large public
sector would be unrealistic. The Bank strategy should rather be to recognize
the present constraints, to avoid abrupt and drastic price adjustments that
would be disruptive socially and economically and to help move the entire
economy, and not merely the power sector, to a better system of management and
of pricing policies, which would increasingly provide the correct signals for
sound investment decisions and would in due course require the ultimate
consumers to pay the full economic cost of the goods and services provided to
them. Based on such an approach and in view of the considerations mentioned
in paras. 1.35 and 1.36, agreement was reached with Government and EEA as
follows:
(a) in order to provide adequate time for decisions to be taken
on the recommendations of the petroleum products pricing study
and the tariff study, EEA's financial target be frozen at the
present level of a minimum 5% return during 1981-1983. The
level of net internal cash generation during these years would
be 3.9% in 1981, 8.1% in 1982 and 10.7% in 1983;
(b) whenever Government approves changes in the prices of fuel
supplied to EEA, it would also simultaneously take action to
enable EEA to revise its tariffs accordingly. This would
enable EEA to promptly recover increases in fuel costs from the
consumers; and
(c) that revised targets as appropriate would be set for the period
from 1983 after agreement is reached between Government and the
Bank on the implementation of mutually agreeable proposals
resulting from the pricing and tariff studies.



- 29 -
In order to maintain the minimum 5% return in 1981-1983 simultaneously with
a 200% increase in fuel prices during 1981-1983, EEA would have to raise
its electricity sale price an average 37% from January 1981, 31% from January
1982 and 26% from January 1983, a cumulative increase of 126% averaging 42%
p.a. Other possible options for financial targets for EEA are: (i) EEA to
maintain a minimum 5% return in the years from 1981 onwards without any fuel
price increase (Annex 4.7); (ii) EEA to earn the covenanted returns of 6% in
1981, 8% in 1982 and 9% in 1983 (para. 4.17) with fuel prices remaining
unchanged (Annex 4.7); and (iii) EEA to earn the covenanted returns of 6% in
1981, 8% in 1982 and 9% in 1983 with a 200% increase in fuel prices during
1981-83 (Annex 4.8). Alternative (iii), the most onerous one for EEA, would
require raising the electricity sale prices about 168% over the period 1981-
1983, which in the Egyptian situation is an unrealistic expectation.
Debt Service Covenant
4.20      Under Loan 1453-EGT and 1733-EGT, EEA agreed to obtain the Bank's
prior consent to any borrowing it plans to undertake whenever its internal
cash generation is not sufficient to cover its debt service at least 1.5 times
in any future year. In calculating amortization of long-term debt, EEA agreed
that it would revalue all foreign debts at the end of each year in accordance
with the current rate of exchange obtainable by the borrower. This covenant
would be extended to the proposed loan so that EEA and the Bank could keep
under review EEA's assumption of debt liabilities.
Audit
4.21      EEA's accounts are audited by the Government's Central Auditing
Organization. The audits are comprehensive and thorough. However, timely
completion of the auditors' report has been a problem due mainly to delays in
stock-taking and to difficulties in reaching agreement between EEA and the
auditors on actions required by the latter before finalizing the report. The
audit reports contain much criticism of EEA's accounting records and proce-
dures, many of them on defects which have been continuing uncorrected for a
long time, ranging from irregularities in stock records to improper accrual
of revenues and expenses and lack of coordination between technical and
financial departments which affects stock, work in progress, and fixed asset
accounts. In order to ensure action within an acceptable time frame, EEA
agreed under Loan 1733-EGT to initiate by October 31, 1979, and thereafter
promptly complete, corrective action on the Audit Report for 1977 in accord-
ance with a plan of action prepared in consultation with the auditors. Such
action has been satisfactorily completed in respect of all matters except the
accounting of assets transferred from REA and identification, and reconcilia-
tion of the accounts, of some imported materials and equipment. The outstand-
ing matters would continue to be pursued by EEA until finalization. With the
expected improvement in its inventory management and accounting, EEA considers
that the past delays in the submission of the audited financial statements
and Audit Report to the Bank would be eliminated within about three years.
Accordingly, under Loan 1733-EGT, EEA agreed to submit to the Bank its audited
financial statements and Audit Report for a fiscal year within six months of
the close of the year beginning with the years commencing with the fiscal year



- 30 -
1981. For the years 1978 and 1979, EEA agreed to submit the audited accounts
and audit report to the Bank within nine months, and for the year 1980 within
seven months. The accounts and audit report for 1978 are expected in May
1980, about eight months late. The covenant under Loan 1733-EGT would be
extended also to the proposed loan.
Insurance
4.22      EEA insures through a Government-owned insurance corporation to
cover business risks normally covered by Government and public authorities
in Egypt, e.g., motor vehicles and stores and materials. It does not, however,
provide insurance coverage against certain business risks normally covered
by public utilities, e.g., fire, machinery breakdown and public liability.
The Government and EEA explained that the risks in EEA's operations are wide-
spread and that provision is made in EEA's annual budgets to meet normal
losses arising from exposure to these risks. In the event of catastrophic
losses, EEA, being a 100% Government-owned authority, relies on the Government
to meet major losses. As agreed under Loan 1453-EGT, EEA appointed consul-
tants (Hartford Boiler Insurance Co. of the USA) to undertake a review of
existing safety and inspection practices for operation and maintenance of
power equipment and facilities on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. EEA is now formulating proposals for safety and inspection practices
based on the recommendations of the consultants. As agreed under Loan 1733-
EGT, EEA would exchange views with the Bank on these proposals and would there-
after establish appropriate safety and inspection practices not later than
September 30, 1981.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. The Power Market
Past Trends
5.01      The Project forms part of the proposed development program to meet
the future demand for electricity on the EEA system. The past trend of demand
on the system is shown in Annex 5.1. Maximum demand rose from 987 MW in 1969
to 2,814 MW in 1979 (11.0% p.a.) and sales from 5,580 GWh to 14,675 GWh (10.1%
p.a.). The average growth rates for the whole ten-year period conceal very
divergent trends within the period. As shown by the detailed figures in
Annex 5.1., the annual growth rates followed a markedly downward trend early
in the period, declining from 6.6% in 1969 to -0.8% in 1972 for sales, and
from 6.1% to 1.4% for maximum demand, the average annual growth rate over the
period being 4.2% and 6.1% respectively. These low growth rates reflected
the relatively lackluster performance of the economy in these years, during
which the growth of GNP averaged only 3% p.a. Since 1972, there has been
a sharp reversal of these trends, with economic growth of 7.8% p.a. and
power demand growing at over 16% p.a.



- 31 -
5.02      The key factor in the much higher growth rate of power market over
the last few years has been the demand of major industrial consumers. Sales
to large industrial consumers grew at over 29%/a over 1974-79 (Annex 5.2).
Sales to other consumer categories grew much less rapidly, ranging from 16%
p.a. for residential/commercial consumers to 0.4% p.a. for irrigation/agricul-
ture. As a result, the share of industrial in total electricity sales rose
from 55% to 65%. This high proportion of industrial sales also accounts for
the relatively high load factor (68% in 1979).
Load Forecast
5.03      The projection of EEA's future sales (Annex 5.2) is the aggregate
of forecast of demand for each consumer category. Total sales are expected to
grow at an average annual rate of 13.1% between 1980-1985. The rate of growth
will drop to 8.6% after 1985 and up to 1990 and then will drop further to 7.5%
thereafter. Historically (1974-79) the annual rate of growth of sales to the
large industrial consumers was 29.2%. This rate of growth is expected to
taper down to about 12.5% by 1984 and to 7.8% by 1992. The rate of growth of
demand by the small industrial consumers is expected to grow at 11% for 1980,
declining by 1.2% per year to 1985, and remaining constant thereafter. The
sales to residential and commercial customers is assumed to maintain the
historical growth rate of 16% p.a. through 1985 dropping thereafter to 12%
p.a. up to 1990 and stabilizing to 8% p.a. beyond this year. Although past
electricity sales for irrigation and agriculture shows an annual rate of
growth of only 0.4% it was assumed that this rate would increase and be
maintained at an annual rate of 5.5%. The volume of sales to Government
buildings is assumed to maintain its declining trend reaching a rate of 2%
p.a. by 1984 and leveling off thereafter. Finally, the combined sales to all
other sectors are projected to grow by 4.8% p.a. in 1980 and thereafter
stabilize at 2.6% p.a. The load forecast implies that by 1995 the per capita
consumption will be around the level reached by Portugal in 1976 (1,230 kWh).
For sensitivity testing, "low" and "high" forecasts were also made (Annex
5.3). These assume annual incremental sales of 10% lower and 10% higher than
the probable forecast.
B. Comparison of Alternatives
Generation
5.04      With the help of a recently adopted digital computer model, EEA is
now able to update periodically the least-cost expansion program (para. 1.23)
based on the best available load growth projections, cost estimates, and
technical data. The latest output of the model (November 1979) shows that in
addition to the Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station (3 x 300 MW) identi-
fied in connection with processing of the Second Power Loan (Loan 1733-EGT)
the least-cost program to 1986 includes also the proposed Aswan II hydro
development. The technical options included nuclear power plants in addition
to hydro and conventional thermal stations. In selecting the optimum hydro
solution, two possibilities: bulb units and vertical Kaplan-turbines were



- 32 -
investigated by the consultants, SWECO (Sweden). The bulb-unit layout would
cost LE 28.6 million more than the Kaplan-turbine solution, compared to a
present worth of only LE 4.0 million in increased benefits at 8%/a discounting
rate. The Kaplan-turbine layout proposed by SWECO's design implies, therefore,
a decided economic advantage and is the preferred solution.
Transmission and Distribution
5.05      Supply alternatives to the consumers included in the distribution
component of the project were compared in the first Regional Electrification
Project under Loan 1453-EGT. Central station service was justified as a
function of distance from the interconected system and density of the load.
Further refinements in the selection of areas included in the electrifica-
tion construction program were introduced through a ranking study financed
under Loan 1453-EGT and carried out by consultants, Harza Engineering Inter-
national (US), on the basis of economic criteria acceptable to the Bank.
C. Return on Investment
5.06      The return on the project was calculated using border prices f?
costs and revenue from the sale of electricity valued at domestic prices-
as benefits to assess the adequacy of electricity tariffs in conveying to
consumers the economic cost of electricity (Annex 5.4). The rate of return
thus calculated was 6.1%, which supports the Bank's contention that electri-
city tariffs in Egypt are substantially undervalued relative to the opportu-
nity cost of the resources used in the production of electricity (Para. 1.12).
5.07      The Government has recently introduced new tariffs for the sale
of electricity to the new high and medium voltage industrial consumers
operating in the uncontrolled segment of the economy (Para. 1.33). The
new tariffs are based on the long run marginal cost which reflects the
value to the economy of the resources (in border prices) used in delivering
electricity to these consumers. At present, only 20 such firms are paying
the marginal cost-based tariffs. If these tariffs were taken as a proxy
for the willingness to pay of all high and medium voltage consumers (about
30% of the total sales), the rate of return on the project would be 11.5%.
l/ The conversion factors required to express the domestic-price
revenues into equivalent border prices are not available.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01       Government will:
(a) implement regulations to be proposed by EEA in line with energy
audits in major industrial installations being carried out by
EEA under Loan 1733-EGT to determine suitable plant and process
modernization programs leading to lower specific energy consump-
tion through improved utilization efficiency (para. 1.35); and
(b) take simultaneously appropriate action to enable EEA to adjust
its tariffs accordingly whenever it shall approve any change in
the price of fuels supplied to EEA by EGPC.
6.02      EEA will:
(a) complete Phase I of the tariff study according to a revised time-
table (para. 1.29); and
(b) complete Phase II of the tariff study according to new terms of
reference and a revised timetable (para. 1.30).
6.03       EEA will:
(a) establish a revised accounting and management information system
based on NRECA's recommendations for itself and for the distribu-
tion companies in consultation with the Bank and by a date to be
agreed with the Bank (para. 4.03);
(b) submit to the Bank, by November 30 of each year, a forecast of the
combined earnings of EEA and the distribution companies for the
next year and establish, by December 31, a plan of action satis-
factory to the Bank and Government to comply with the rate of
return covenant for the next year (para. 4.09).
6.04      The following covenants under Loan 1733-EGT would be extended to the
proposed loan/credit:
(a) the covenant on collection of bills (para. 4.10);
(b) the covenant on debt service coverage (para. 4.20); and
(c) the audit provisions (para. 4.21).
6.05       As supplementary conditions of loan/credit effectiveness, the
Government would execute a subsidiary Loan Agreement for onlending the IDA
Credit to EEA (para. 2.01); EEA would execute subsidiary agreements with QPA
and REA and would submit a satisfactory financing plan for Aswan II (para.
3.10).



- 34 -
6.06      Completion of a satisfactory financing plan for the Third Shoubrah
Unit would be a condition of disbursement for that portion of the proposed
loan/credit (para. 3.10).
6.07      In view of the agreement on the issues set forth in this report, the
Project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$7 million to EEA and an IDA Credit
of US$120 million to the Government for onlending to EEA. A Bank Loan of 20
years, including a 5-year period, would be appropriate. The IDA Credit would
be subject to normal IDA terms. The loan/credit would become effective within
five months of signing.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
EGYPTIAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. General
Formation of Distribution Companies - The distribution companies
started operations on January 1, 1979 under the overall control of EEA. The
loan documents stipulate financial covenants for the sector as a whole, i.e.,
for EEA and the distribution companies combined. Therefore the financial
forecasts in Annexes 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5 are consolidated forecasts of EEA and
the distribution companies. The Minister of Electricity proposes to place
five of the seven distribution companies, i.e., those excluding the Cairo and
Alexandria companies under REA instead of EEA from a date to be determined.
If this change takes place, appropriate changes in the covenants would be made.
B. Income Statement
1.        Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by EEA
as modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of
4.3% in 1979, 22.6% in 1980, 13.0% in 1981, 13.9% in 1982, 15.1% in 1983,
13.2% in 1984, 10.2% in 1985, 8.9% in 1986 and 9.1% in 1987. The average
revenue per kWh sold for 1980 is based on: (a) the average revenue per kWh
applicable to 1979; and (b) a tariff increase for domestic consumers from
January 1, 1980 resulting in an increase in revenues of about LE 8.0 million
p.a. Further tariff increases are assumed as shown in Annex 4.2 so as to
maintain the 5% return in 1981-1983 and to secure returns of 6X in 1984,
8% in 1985 and 9% thereafter.
2.        Connection and Maintenance Charges are assumed to increase by the
same percentages as annual kWh sales of electricity.
3.        Other Operating Revenues are assumed to increase by the same per-
centages as annual kWh sales of electricity.
4.        Fuel and Lubricants are based on estimates of generation from
steam units and combustion turbines using fuel prices and heat rate as
follows:



ANNEX 4.6
- 60 -                                Page 2 of 3
(a)       (a)  Fuel Prices
(i) For 1979 and 1980
Treated diesel fuel used by EEA - LE 3500/ton (combustion
turbines)
Fuel Oil                          - LE 7.50/ton (steam turbines)
Natural Gas                       - LE 7.50/ton equivalent as
per EEA's existing contract.
(ii) From 1981 Onwards
The forecasts assume a 200% increase in fuel prices during
1981-1983 to be reached in three equal installments effective
January 1 of each of these years.
(b) Heat Rates
Combustion turbines - 15,000 Btu = 1 kWh
Steam turbines       - 12,000 Btu = 1 kWh (1979 and thereafter)
5.        Salaries and Wages are based on EEA's 1978 salaries and wages
escalated by 15% each year through 1987. No specific increases in staff
are assumed since EEA is overstaffed now and its present staff will be adequate
through 1987.
6.        Purchase of Materials and Services and Other Operating Expenses
are assumed to increase roughly in proportion to the increase in net fixed
assets in service.
7.        Depreciation is computed at an average annual rate of 3%/a of the
gross fixed assets in service at the beginning of the year.
8.        Non-Operating Income is based on the average of actual non-operating
income and expense for the years 1973 through 1978.
9.        Interest is calculated at the rate of 5%/a on all loans from the
Ministry of Finance. Interest on all existing foreign loans is based on EEA's
actual calculations. All new borrowing from the Ministry of Finance is
assumed to be at an average interest rate of 5%/a and future foreign borrowing
except the identified loans, e.g., IBRD, EIB, etc., for which the specific
rates would apply, is assumed to be at 8% (for presently committed generating
plants) and 8-1/2% (future expansion facilities). Suppliers' Credits for
the Project amounting to LE 303.6 million have been assumed for a period of
10 years including 2 years' grace with a rate of interest of 7.5%. Interest
has been added to construction costs at 6.5% in 1978-79, 7.5% in 1980-82 and
8.5% in 1983-87.
B. Balance Sheet
10.       Gross Fixed Assets in Service are valued at historical cost through
1977.  They have been revalued as of the beginning of 1978 using the con-



- 61 -                                ANNEX 4.6
Page 3 of 3
sultants' valuation of LE 601 million for gross fixed assets and LE 199
million for accumulated depreciation. Thereafter, they have been revalued
as of the end of each year beginning with 1978 assuming an average annual
price increase as given in Annex 4.1.
11.       Inventories -  The estimates assume disposal of some surplus stock
in 1980. Thereafter inventories are estimated to increase roughly in line
with the increase in net fixed assets in service.
12.       Accounts Receivables -  The forecasts assume receivables to be the
equivalent of three months' sales, the limit prescribed in the loan documents,
as of the end of 1980 and thereafter.
13.       Reserves are increased each year by proposed contributions from
the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction, Ministry of Finance and proposed
grants by donors such as USAID, CIDA, OECF and the Netherlands.
14.       Accounts Payable and Deferred Liabilities are estimated each year
roughly on the basis of annual capital expenditures and cash operating expenses.
15.       Consumers' Deposits are assumed to increase in line with the increases
in kWh sales of electricity.
D. Sources and Applications of Funds
16.       Contributions from the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction and
Ministry of Finance are based on EEA's 5-Year Plan estimates.
17.       USAID Grants of $127.8 million are assumed.  Disbursements are
based on USAID estimates furnished to the Bank.
18.       Borrowings -  All foreign borrowings are converted to Egyptian
pounds using the parallel market rate of exchange of LE 1 = US$1.44. EEA's
planned borrowing program has been adjusted to meet the needs of the construction
program as revised by the Bank and taking into account EEA's internal cash
generation and expected grants.
19.       Construction Requirements are based on EEA's estimates as revised
by the Bank and escalated using the following percentages for price contin-
gencies corresponding to expected conditions in Egypt:
1979   1980   1981   1982   1983-1985   1986-1987
Equipment and
Civil Works        12.0   10.5    9.0      8.0      7.0          6.0
20.       Amortization of Long-Term Debt - Ministry of Finance loans are
assumed repayable over 12 years after 3 years' grace.  Amortization of other
existing foreign loans is based on EEA's calculations.

/1Based on the official rate of exchange and excluding the outlays prior to 1980 -which are considered sunk cost in this
analysis. Only 46% of the capital cost of the rural electrification component has been included because capacity
saturation will be reached in 1993.
12 Operation and maintenance cost for the hydro generation plant is assumed to be 1.0 milliemes/kWh, for the thermal plant
1.9 milliemes/kWh and for the R.E. component 2% of the capital cost.
/3 The average incremental cost for transmission and distribution is estimated to be about 12 milliemes/KWh and is based
on EEA investment program for 1980-1986.
4 Based on local price for residual oil of about LE 7.5/ton (US$11/ton) and plant efficiency of 0.28 kg/ton.
D Volume of sales in rural areas where first block of tariff structure (15 milliemes/kWh) is applicable.
Volume of sales to other customers where the average tariff (26.54 milliemes/kWh) is applicable.
The f-el savings from hydro generation are calculated on the basis of the assumptions of (4) above and secondary
reneration of 765 rWh.  The fuel savings from the R.E. component are based on an average consumption rate of
0.75 It/day/consumer, for lighting purposes of 300,000 newly connected consumers, and local price for kerosene of
LE 38/ton (US$56/ton).
/ Salvage value is based on our assumed life of 30 years and straight line depreciation,

'1  Based on the official rate of exchange and excluding the outlays prior to 1980 which are considered sunk cost in this
analysis only 46% of the capital cost of the rural electrification component has been included because capacity
saturation will be reached in 1993.
'2  Operation and maintenance cost for the hydro generation plant is assumed to be 1.0 milliemes/kWh, for the thermal plant
1.9 milliemes/kWh and for the R.E. component 2% of the capital cost.
/3  The average incremental cost for transmission and distribution is estimated to be about 12 milliemes/kwh and is based
on EEA investment program for 1980-1986.
/4  Based on a border price for residual oil of about LE 122/ton (US$180/ton) and plant efficiency of 0.28 kg/kWh.
7   Volume of sales in rural areas where first block of tariff structure (15 milliemes/kWh) is applicable.
7   Volume of sales to uncontrolled customers (30% of the remaining incremental generation, i.e. after subtracting the
sales to the rural customers from the incremental generation) where the 1985 marginal cost based tariff for medium
tension consumers (41.14 milliemes/kWh) is applicable.
/7  Volume of sales to controlled customers (70% of the remaining incremental generation, i.e. after subtracting the sales
to the rural customers from the incremental generation) where the 1985 average tariff of (26.54 milliemes/kWh) is
applicable.
/8  The fuel savings from hydro generation are calculated on the basis of the assumptions of (4) above and secondary
generation of 765 GWh. The fuel savings from the R.E. component are based on an average consumption rate of 0.75 lt/day/consumer,
for lighting purposes of 300,000 newly connected consumers, and border price for kerosene of LE 248.2/ton (uS$365/ton).
/9  Salvage value is based on our assumed life of 30 years and straight line depreciation.
