FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (VOJVODINA)
FIRST PETROLEUM SECTOR PROJECT (LOAN 2596-YU)
PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Note for the components of the First Petroleum Sector
Project in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that were located in the
Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.' These components were financed separately by Loan 2596-
YU, in the amount of US$35.0 million. This loan was approved by the Board on June 27, 1985
and became effective on Sept 9, 1986.
The total loan amount for the First Petroleum Sector Project, including Loan 2595-YU
for project components in the Republic of Croatia in the amount of US$65.0 million and Loan
2597-YU for project components in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the amount of
US$2.5 million, was US$92.5 million 2
At appraisal project implementation was scheduled to be completed by March 31,1990.
This was delayed until June, 1992 by late effectiveness of the loan and delays in procurement
arising from the hostilities during the later part of the project. Of the loan amount of US$35.0
million an amount of US$2.6 million was cancelled. Loan 2596-YU was closed on
September 30, 1992 (at which time US$32.4 million had been disbursed).
This ICR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and HI) was prepared by Mr. Anton
Smit (Consultant), and reviewed by Messrs. Richard Hamilton (Senior Energy Economist,
EC2ET), Hans. J. Apitz (Division Chief, EC2ET) and Franz Kaps (Project Advisor, EC2DR).
Preparation of this Note was delayed by the embargo on contacts with the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. It was started in September 1996 both by the Borrower and the Bank. It
is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, Loan and Guarantee Agreements, Supervision
Reports and information supplied by the Borrower.
Vojvodina became subsequently a part of the Republic of Serbia.
2  A Project Completion Report was issued for the Croatia component in August 1993.
A Project Completion Note is being issued simultaneously with this note for the Bosnia and
Herzegovina component.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (VOJVODINA)
FIRST PETROLEUM SECTOR PROJECT (LOAN 2596-YU)
PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    The major objective of the First Petroleum Sector Project (see Part I, Section 3) was to
assist Yugoslavia in the development of indigenous energy resources, thereby reducing its
dependence on imported energy. In Vojvodina this objective was to be achieved by Loan 2596-
YU, which supported a time slice of the exploration and of the well repair and testing programs
in that province.
2.    The project components in Vojvodina were implemented by Nafta-Gas (Radna
Organizacija za Istrazivanje i Proizvodnju Nafta i Gasa) at Novi Sad, the sole company with
responsibility for oil and gas exploration and production in that province.
3.    Before the start of the project, a project management team was formed comprising senior
company operating and administrative staff. This team started its activities right at the start of
project implementation. Application for export credits to Yugoslavia proved to be more complex
than expected. After mid 1991, some project components became progressively delayed due to
hostilities between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia so that not all
objectives of the project were reached.
4.    The composition of the project remained very much as designed at appraisal. However,
in 1987 it was agreed between Nafta-Gas and the Bank to include engineering services and
equipment for underground gas storage up to an amount of US$0.7 million. As is normal
practice in petroleum operations, a final selection of drilling locations for deep wells for
hydrocarbon exploration was made only as results from new seismic surveys, the reprocessing of
older seismic data and wells become available and carefully interpreted. All amendments and
modifications of the project were made in full agreement between the Bank and the Borrower
until 1990, after which, as a result of the sanctions, the contacts with the Borrower became
sporadic.
5.    Nafta-Gas, being a fully operational petroleum exploration and production company,
proved to have the required experienced staff for an efficient technical implementation of the
project. Under the project, training on advanced technologies was provided by suppliers and
specialized training consultants.
6.   It was not possible to rate the project outcome since some activities have not yet been
completed because of the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia by the UN Security Council.

FIRST PETROLEUM SECTOR PROJECT (LOAN 2596-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.            PWject Identiy
Name:          First Petroleum Sector Project
Loan Number:  2596-YU
RVP Unit:      Europe and Central Asia
Country:       Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Vojvodina)
Sector:        Energy
Subsector:     Petroleum
2. Background
2.1   During the two decades prior to the appraisal of the project, hydrocarbon (oil and gas)
energy in Yugoslavia progressively replaced the use of coal in the industry, transport and
domestic sectors. During that period coal (mostly lignite) consumption, although its energy value
nearly doubled, fell as a percentage of used primary energy from 63% to 43%. Percentages of
gas and oil consumption, during that same period, rose from 2% to 12% and from 20% to 40%
respectively. This trend was foreseen to continue in the coming years. As a consequence of the
increased use of hydrocarbon energy, the country was becoming rapidly more dependant on the
import of large quantities of gas and oil. As a combined effect of the increased volume of
imports and the steep increase of international crude oil prices over that period, the country's
costs for imported oil rose from US$20.0 million in 1965, to US$ 2 billion in 1982. In addition,
in 1983, a volume of 2.9 billion m3 of gas at a total cost of US$450 million was imported.
2.2  In March 1983, the Federal Assembly of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
adopted an economic program for restructuring the economy. Since the energy sector was
considered critical to these structural adjustments, the commission advising the Government on
the economic program, formulated a long-term strategy for its development. This strategy
contained two major elements: first, expanding production from domestic energy resources, such
as lignite, coal, hydroelectricity and petroleum; and second, improving the efficiency of energy



2
consumption, distribution and transformation mainly through reforms in pricing. At the appraisal
of the project in 1984, the Bank reviewed and endorsed the Government's strategy and made
specific recommendations for the development of indigenous energy resources, rationalization of
investment programs, changes to the basis and levels of energy pricing and energy conservation.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The major objective of the project was to support the Government in its strategy for
enhancing domestic petroleum production in two republics and one autonomous province, which
at that time were part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: Croatia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Vojvodina. This would be done by a project consisting of four major elements;
(i) exploration/appraisal; (ii) exploration promotion; (iii) testing and appraisal of existing
discoveries, and (iv) underground storage of gas to balance winter and summer demand/supply
patterns. The components of the above four major project elements located in Vojvodina were
covered by Loan 2596-YU.
3.2   In Vojvodina, the exploration/appraisal element aimed at assisting the state owned oil
company, Nafta-Gas,to continue, after its geological exploration in the shallow layers where
most of the more clearly recognizable structures had been produced, with exploring wedges and
other secondary traps in the vicinity of the known fields, which are more difficult to locate. Also
deeper layers, which were thought to offer challenging possibilities, had not been adequately
tested. Mapping and testing of these deeper layers required technology and equipment which was
at that time unavailable in the country.
3.3   The second project element was exploration promotion.  However, in view of the
relatively mature stage of oil and gas exploration in Vojvodina, it was not considered opportune
to promote the remaining possibilities to the foreign oil industry. The third project element
concerning testing and appraisal of existing discoveries was directed at the large number of deep
wells in which Nafta-Gas had encountered shows of oil and gas, but where it was subsequently
unable to determine whether theses could be produced commercially, due to the lack of sufficient
high grade testing equipment. The project supported procurement of sufficient equipment and
materials for the testing of about 20 of these wells.
3.4   The last project element relates to the highly seasonal gas demand in a country with cold
winters and where much of the gas is used for household heating. The resulting oversupply of
gas in summer could be balanced by curtailing production from the domestic gas reservoirs, but
the shortages in winter often resulted in interruptions of deliveries to a number of factories,
which consequently had to cease production during the shortfalls. At project appraisal, Nafta-Gas
did not propose funds for the construction of underground gas storage facilities, which store
excess gas during summer for later winter delivery. However, in 1987, a request for an
allocation of US$0.7 million for technical assistance and equipment to develop additional storage
was made and agreed to by the Bank.



3
3.5   The above mentioned project components for Vojvodina, as defined between Nafta-Gas
and the Bank, were included in Loan 2596-YU for the amount of US$35.0 million equivalent.
This was expected to be supplemented by US$35.0 million in export credits. It consisted in
essence of a time slice of Nafta-Gas's petroleum exploration/development program. Originally
the main physical components covered by this loan were:
(a) ExpQration, comprising about 2,100 line-km of seismic surveys and the drilling of about
10 deep (3,500 - 5,000 m) exploration wells.
(b) Well Workover and Testing of about 20 previously drilled wells where oil and gas had
been encountered which could not be tested due to the lack of critical equipment.
(c) Trainin abroad and also through seminars organized by international consultants in
Yugoslavia for Nafta-Gas technical personnel in modem geophysical exploration, drilling
and well completion techniques and special reservoir engineering subjects.
3.6   The total cost of the project, also including the components in Croatia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, .was estimated at appraisal at US$607.9 million. The foreign cost was $268.4
million. Financing for this amount included funds from internal sources (US$78.1 million), from
export credit financing (US$97.8 million) and from IBRD loans (US$92.5 million). The total
foreign cost of the components in Vojvodina (without interest) was US$83.4 million, and the
local cost was US$83.7 million (at the 1985 exchange rate of US$1.0 = Dinar 200) for a total of
US$167.1 million (Part III, Table 5). As several of the project components were of a purely
exploratory nature, no rate of return calculation was made at appraisal. The Borrower for the
project components in Vojvodina was Nafta-Gas, which was founded in 1949 as the organization
responsible for petroleum exploration and production. Nafta-Gas, as an independent legal entity,
was one of the 12 Work Organizations of the Kombinat Nafta-Gas covering the whole sector of
oil and gas supply, refining, distribution and marketing. The Bank loan to Nafta-Gas was
guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The strategy of the Government to increase domestic production of oil and gas, in order
to reduce imports, was fully agreed to by the Bank. There was also full agreement on the way of
implementing this strategy by strengthening the technical capabilities of Nafta-Gas. During
project appraisal, a full technical and financial agreement had been reached on the size and
composition of the project, based on the then available data.
4.2  It was agreed that the overall management of the project would be the responsibility of
the Nafta-Gas project manager. His task would be the supervision of different project task
groups, each of these being responsible for project components in their department. The project
manager's task would also include the coordination between these task groups and the
organization and coordination of training as well as the monitoring and reporting of progress to



4
the Bank. Most of the implementation of the project would be by Nafta-Gas staff, benefiting
from training in using special technologies that had not been applied before in Vojvodina. Bank
project financing was primarily for the transfer of new technology and for providing Nafta-Gas
with the equipment and goods required for the application of this technology in its oil and gas
operations.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1    Due to the time involved in the ratification of the loan documents by the Yugoslav
Federal Assembly, the loan was late in becoming effective, and, right at the start of the
implementation, the project incurred a delay of about one year (Part III, Table 1). These delays
were augmented by a slow start of the acquisition procedures for equipment for a major
component of the project, the drilling and testing of deep exploration wells. Delays for this
component accumulated to over two years and then further increased when UN Security Council
sanctions against Yugoslavia prevented equipment from reaching the project area and the
economic blockade necessitated a change in drilling priorities.
5.2   The other parts of the project were essentially implemented as designed at appraisal.
Early during implementation it was agreed to include technical assistance and equipment for
underground gas storage in the project (see Para 3.4). The seismic surveys and reprocessing of
earlier recorded data were carried out by the Geophysical Institute at Belgrade. A modern
seismic instrument was provided under the project and used efficiently by the crews from the
institute on regular and three dimensional surveys. Results from the reprocessing of the earlier
recorded data were reviewed by regular Bank missions. This reprocessing was found to be
carried out in accordance with current practices applied by the international geophysical industry.
5.3   Of the 10 scheduled exploration wells, only seven were drilled, five for the younger
Pliocene and Miocene objectives and two for the older Mesozoic objectives. Drilling of these last
wells ceased in 1992 when hostilities within the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
interrupted the supply of essential drilling consumables. Starting in that year, geophysical and
drilling equipment and material already procured from the loan were used to locate and drill
wells at more directly prospective locations near the already producing oil and gas fields.
5.4   Due to the sanctions by the UN Security Council on Yugoslavia, some equipment
procured under the loan could not be delivered to or be fully commissioned by Nafta-Gas. This
concerns mainly well testing and logging equipment the absence of which has prevented the full
implementation of the project objectives (see para 6.4 and 6.5). Discussions with the related
suppliers are still ongoing.
5.5   The Nafta-Gas staff was found to be fully capable of implementing the project. The tasks
of the project manager and his project implementation team, as agreed between the Bank and



5
Nafta-Gas at appraisal, were well carried out. There were initial delays in procurement because
of the complex arrangements for obtaining export credits to Yugoslavia at that time.
5.6   Rapid inflation in the country during project implementation complicated accounting of
local costs. The Dinar decreased in value against the US$ by a factor of about 10,000 from 1985
to 1992. Therefore local costs for the project are only presented in US$ (Part III, Table 4). The
project cost and financing data (Part III, Table 5) show that export credits that could be used for
the project came close to the expected amounts. The data on loan utilization (Part III, Table 3)
show that no disbursements were made for Category 1 (field and exploration services). As was
agreed with the Bank, these funds were used for disbursements under Category 2 (materials and
equipment).
5.7   Following the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia, the Borrower's special project account
with Jugobanka (New York) was blocked, delaying final payments for essential material for the
testing and workover of wells. The special project account was still blocked at the time of
preparation of this Note.
6.    PrQJect Results
6.1   The newly recorded seismic survey lines provided strongly improved data quality. The
reprocessing of older data also revealed much clearer geological information than was available
on the previous versions. This combined data package formed a solid base for the structural and
stratigraphic interpretation in search of locations for the exploration wells to be drilled under the
project.
6.2    Of the seven exploration wells drilled, two were found to be potential oil and gas
producers. However the sanctions against Yugoslavia has prevented Nafta-Gas from obtaining
the special production equipment required to put these wells into production. Of the other five
wells, drilling of three had to be interrupted before attaining the targeted depth, also because of
lack of equipment. As several of project's drilling objectives have not been reached, it is too
early to make an evaluation of this subcomponent. It is the intention of Nafta-Gas to complete the
drilling of these exploration wells once sufficient equipment and material become available.
6.3   The workover and testing of wells drilled by Nafta-Gas before the beginning of the
project was a partial success. Thirteen wells were treated with special production enhancing
chemicals supplied from the project. Consecutive testing of these wells found five to be potential
producers. In the other wells, the composition of the oil and gas bearing formations was found to
be too tight to allow extraction of fluids at an economic level.
6.4   The efficiency of testing wells was reduced since the well logging equipment purchased
from a foreign supplier, after its delivery in December 1989, was found to malfunction. In
agreement with the warranty provisions, this equipment was sent back for repairs to the UK in
March 1992. However, it had not been returned at the time this Note was prepared. Nafta-Gas



6
may decide to enter into arbitration against the supplier. The amount under the contract which is
still not paid by Nafta-Gas is US$ 423,757.00. Claims regarding equipment delivered by another
foreign supplier and extension of the warranty periods have recently been discussed with this
company and the outstanding issues are believed to have been settled satisfactorily.
6.5   Another pending issue concerns the delivery of two lots of oil field equipment by another
foreign supplier, of which the first lot (value US$ 273,912,00) was received while the second lot
(value US$ 447,603.90) was confiscated in Croatia as it was being shipped via the port of
Rijeka. Unfortunately the received equipment cannot be used without this second shipment. The
funds for this yet unpaid contract are in the blocked special account at Jugobanka in New York
(see para 5.7).
6.6   A study by TCA HOUSTON on the possibilities of Enhanced Oil Recovery by steam
flooding the oil bearing formations showed that this technology, under the prevailing conditions
in the Nafta-Gas area, cannot be expected to be economically  productive. This project
component was then discontinued. A study on Underground Gas Storage was conducted by
Sofregas (France) and Pritchard (USA), and, as a result, the B.Dvor field will be converted to an
underground storage facility.
6.7   Training was mostly in technologies used in exploration and production and connected
with major project components such as well testing, porosity analysis, fractured reservoir
performance, well stimulation and mathematical reservoir modeling. The training component
supported Nafta-Gas in efficient implementation of the project, and the acquired knowledge and
skills continue to be used with very good results in the company. Training was both by courses
given by foreign experts to Nafta-Gas staff in Yugoslavia and by sending staff to training centers
abroad. A good example of the application of new knowledge was the survey of three producing
oil fields with 3D seismic technology using specialized equipment procured under the loan. On
all three fields, significant extensions of the productive areas were found. By using the same
technology a new gas field (ZitiOte) was discovered in 1988, which, on the basis of the high
quality of the recorded 3D seismic data, could be economic. Out of the seven wells drilled on
this field, six are producing.



7
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1   As is normal in oil and gas production, the discovered fields, if well managed, will
produce some 35% of the oil and some 70% of the gas originally present in the underground
reservoirs. These percentages, which depend on several factors such as the porosity and
permeability of the underground reservoirs and the viscosity of the oil, will thus determine the
sustainability of the production established by the project. From the wells drilled by Nafta-Gas
with assistance of project financed equipment after 1992, a total of 366.000 cubic meter of oil
and 17 million cubic meter of gas had been produced up to April 30, 1996, with an estimated
commercial value of some US$ 38 million. As the normal economic life of a producing well can
be taken to be some 10-15 years, the ultimate yield from these wells can be taken to be
considerably higher.
7.2   Future benefits from the project cannot be fully assessed because, as mentioned above,
some of the required equipment is not yet operational and, because of the former hostilities some
of the exploration drilling objectives were not reached. However results from completed wells
have shown that deep exploration faces geological and physical obstacles so that a very prudent
approach will be required in order to avoid wasting of resources. Discussions by the missions
showed that application of modem economic tools in exploration and oil field development
drilling resulted in lower consumption of drilling material and consumables by Nafta-Gas.
7.3   The shortage of foreign currency and the embargo have caused difficulties in obtaining
sufficient spare parts and servicing for the equipment purchased under the project. This interferes
with project sustainability in the short term.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1   Bank identification of the project was in August 1983, followed by appraisal from March
1984 to mid 1985. Due to several delays, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements did not become
effective until September 1986 (Part III, Table 1). The Bank's appraisal missions were composed
of well balanced staff in the economic, financial and technical disciplines. However, since this
project was the first in the energy sector of former Yugoslavia, and since discussions had to be
held with the implementing oil exploration and production company as well as with the ministries
of the central government, the preparation of the project took longer than planned. A very good
understanding was reached early between the Borrower and the Bank missions. The main
constraint on Nafta-Gas' operations, namely lack of proper material and, to a lesser extent, lack
of experience with modem technologies, was readily identified and the main project priorities
determined. In hindsight, the Bank could have been more cautious in its advice on the deep
exploration program, allowing more time at the start for exploration studies and longer periods
of analysis between the wells.



8
8.2   Bank supervision was at about six monthly intervals in the early part of project
implementation, but diminished to intervals of over one year during the period 1987-1990 (Part
III, Table 2). There were also frequent changes of Bank staff on the supervision missions during
these years. In order to maintain a good dialogue with an implementing agency facing the use of
new technology, regular supervision at six monthly interval, preferably by the same staff, would
have been more appropriate. During the period 1990-1992, supervision was interrupted due to
the hostilities in the country.
9.    Boffower Perfonmance
9.1   Although the project required application of many technologies unavailable at the start of
the project, Nafta-Gas proved fully capable of handling the implementation of the project.
Consultants were supplied with adequate information and operational assistance to be able to do
their work in an optimal way. Nafta-Gas project management and technical staff were at all times
of high quality and capacity.
9.2   Nafta-Gas complied with the reporting covenants in the Loan Agreement by submitting
regular quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the project. Audited financial
statements, forecasts and project accounts have been received and, according to information
predating 1990, the requested financial ratios were being met. The covenant in the Guarantee
Agreement requesting the Government of Yugoslavia to increase the domestic gas price to the
level of imported gas had, notwithstanding some price increases, not been met. At the time of
writing of this Note insufficient information was available to determine whether all covenants in
the legal documents have been complied with by the Government of Yugoslavia and Nafta-Gas
during the remaining timespan of the project.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1  The relationship between the Bank and Nafta-Gas on this project has been good. This was
also sustained by the high level of professionalism and efficiency of the implementing staff.
There has always been a climate of good discussions between the Bank and the Borrower and
decisions on the implementation of the project have been in full mutual agreement. Relations
with cofinancing and export credit agencies were difficult at the start of the project because of
their unfamiliarity with conditions in the country.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1  The transfer of advanced technology for the use of the modern equipment and goods
purchased from foreign suppliers, constituted a major element of the project. Suppliers provided
opportunities for on-the-job training of Nafta-Gas staff. Consultants performed well and reached
the objectives specified in their terms of reference on time.

12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The Loan and Guarantee Agreements for this loan were adequate as a legal basis for the
cooperation between the Government, Nafta-Gas and the Bank. The appraisal report gave a clear
description of the agreed objectives and composition of the project and provided valuable
guidance during implementation.
13.   Evaluation of Project Outcome
13.1  It was not possible to rate the project outcome since some activities have not yet been
completed because of the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia by the UN Security Council.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The First Petroleum Sector Project was financed by the World Bank and cofinancers in
equal shares of 35,o mill US$, and from local sources in US equivalents of 81,25 mill US$,
making a total of 1511,25 mill US$.
I1.   Initial Objectives
1.1  Identification of different types of subtle traps and determination of potential oil and
gas reserves.
1.2  Improvement of oil and gas production from  tight reservoir rocks within the
Neogenecomplex and its immediate basement.
1.3   Regional exploration of the Mesozoic complex, or of the oil and gas potential in deep
Mesozoic horizons.
2.    Other Objectives
2.1   Procurement of Equipment and Materials: The basic objective was to buy new
equipment, amend and revitalize the existing NaftaGas equipment in the field of geophysics
(including computer center), drilling, geological monitoring of drilling, logging measurements
and workover interpretation, special services, laboratory and well tests. Considerable funds
have been planned for the procurement of well equipment, tubular goods, drilling and mud
material as well as different assortment of additives which an oil industry, used for production
stimulation
2.2   Advanced Training and Training:  Advanced training was included the experts of
renowned foreign companies in the field of geophysics, geology, designing and technology of
deep well drilling, electric logging processing and interpretation, well test data interpretation
and application of stimulative methods on formations. Significant advanced trainings have also
been planned in the field of well tests and laboratory research works. The conception of
advanced courses in the Country for larger number of attendants and after that courses for the
most successful ones abroad, should contribute to more systematic and continual transfer of
knowledge.
2.2.1 Since different experts were included, the project, beside engineers, also anticipated
courses for lawyers and economists.
2.3   Consultant Services: Consultant services included the engagement of foreign experts to
solve the problems in the field of drilling, drilling mud, cased in completion, cementation,



11
electric logging diagram interpretation, stimulation works, estimation of the Mesozoic
potentials.
2.4   Studies:    Foreign companies were engaged in the elaboration of studies on oil and
geology potentials of the Mesozoic sediments for oil and gas exploration and production.
3.    Physical Volume of works
3.1   Geophysical Works
3.1.1  The Neogene and a Part of Basement:    The survey of about 700 kms of CDP
profile was performed including processing and interpretation for the purpose of defining traps
at the contact of the Neogene sediments and basement.
3.1.2 It was also necessary to perform reprocessing and reinterpretation of the existing
seismic profiles in the range of 2000 kms.
3.2   The Mesozoic Complex:    Seismic field works were anticipated on 1400 kms of the
profile with the possibility to extend this quantum for additional 400 kms. Gravimetric and
geomagnetic surveys were also anticipated along this seismic profile for the purpose of
complex geophysical data interpretation.
3.3   Exploration Drilling (for Neogene and a Part of Basement):  Six exploration wells
were to be drilled to the designed depth of 3000 - 3600 m. Four of six wells were to be
purely exploration, while the remaining two were to be drilled in already explored structures
with tight reservoir rocks in which hydrocarbons had been discovered.
3.4   Exploration Drilling (Mesozoic):  Four wells were drilled to the designed depth of
4000 - 5000 m. in the Mesozoic localities in Central Banat, South Backa and South Banat.
3.5   Well Testing Program:    According to this Program, 21 wells were designated, 6
of which new ones and 15 previously drilled or partially tested.
4.    pro.ject Results
4.1   Geophysics
4.1.1  Neogene and a Part of Basement:  According to the designed scope of works, until
1993, 1030 kms of seismic profiles were performed or 147% comparing the plan. Regional
surveys were performed for 813 kms and detailed for 217 kms. Existing seismic profiles were
reprocessed on 4044 kms. representing in such a manner double the scope of the previous
plan, 202%.



12
4.1.2 Mesozoic:   According to the plan, 2000 kms. of the seismic profile or 111% of the
plan, were performed until 1993. Along 2000 kms. of the profile, gravimetric measurements
were carried out in the scope of 16.421 points. All regional seismic measurements were
completed in accordance with the program. Detailed seismic measurements in Central Banat
were completed in the range of 132 kms, and in South Backa in the range of 70.48 kms. On
the basis of these detailed seismic works we could locate drilling of exploration wells KRMZ-1
and BPMZ-1 in the fields of Central Banat and SouthBaka .
4.2   Results of Exploration Drilling Under WB Program
4.2.1 Exploration Drilling of Neogene and a Part of Basement: Note that not the full scope
of the Pliocene Program has been implemented. Field acquisition of seismic data and their
interpretation supplied sufficient groundwork for setting the locations for a number of wells.
However, their drilling is behind schedule. Two wells, MKz-1 (Micron Zapped) and MKV-1
(MokrinVrbica) were spudded: the drilling of the former was discontinued, the latter was
abandoned as dry before reaching design depth. It is too early for a meaningful evaluation of
this Program mostly because of the small number of wells which were expected to confirm the
regional models yield some results and thereby allow definition of the traps, their fluid
contents and, ultimately, the evaluation of reserves.
4.2.2  Tight Reservoirs Testing:   MAJ-X-1, NCS-1 and MN-2 wells were drilled under this
program. The first two wells are producers, the last mentioned a dry hole.
4.2.3 The Mesozoic Exploration Drilling: The preparations for the implementation of this
Program were thorough and on schedule. Seismic data acquisition and data interpretation are
over. The geologic model has been recognized and wells KRMZ-1 (Krajisnik mezozoik) and
BPMZ-1 (Backi Petrovac mezozoik) located.
4.2.4 The wells were to confirm the regional development of the Mesozoic deposits, and
their generating and accumulating potentials. KMRZ-1 was not drilled to the design depth of
5800 m. Its TD at 4647 m. contains Mesozoic deposits from 2023 m. The well tested no
hydrocarbons.
4.2.5 Although two wells for testing hydrocarbons in the Mesozois formations, were not
drilled to the designed depth (discontinued due to sanctions), they yielded precious information
on the thickness and depth of the Mesozoic occurrences, geochemical characteristics and
reservoir rock potentials.
4.2.6 Although commercial quantities of oil and gas have not been achieved, all the
information represent good starting point for the Mesozoic exploration continuation.
4.3   Workover and Test Results Using the Equipment Procured from WB Loan



13
A.    First Petroleum Project Wells
MAJ-X-1 (3725 m) - Bringing-in results: oil, condensate, gas containing CO2 and
H2S. Waiting for provision of corrosion-proof equipment
to start trail production.
NC2-1      (3600 m.) - Producer, however, not in operation.
B.    Old Wells included into testing Program with equipment purchased from WB Loan
(See Table 2)
A number of old wells like KIS-1, KIS-2, KIS-3, Cbj-2, Mn-1, Vst-3, Vst-5 and Vst-6,
producing from tight reservoirs has been tested under this program. The tests have
demonstrated that, notwithstanding the promising results in the exploration phase, these
poor porosity and permeability or tight reservoirs produce with marginal commercial
effects. RUS-5, RUS-6, RUS-12 and RUS-13 on the Rusanda field exhibit good test
results and production.
4.4   Well Drilled with Equipment and Materials Procured from WB Loan after
Discontinuation of WB Deep Well Drilling Program.
A.    As stated in the Progress Report of April 18, 1992, filed with the World Bank, Nafta-
Gas had to desist temporarily from exploration of deep Mesozoic structures and turn
instead to production maintenance, extension and development drilling at more
prospective localities because of highly unfavorable situation caused by the hostilities in
the federal entities of former Yugoslavia, unavailability of supplies from these
republics (pipings, cement, barite, bentonite, fittings, rubber and other consumables)
and the general economic blockade.
The geophysical equipment and software procured from the World Bank Loan applied
to Rusanda, Kikinda Varos and Turija Sever oil fields and to the Ziti§te gas discovery.
The same applies to the workover equipment.
The three oil fields of different exploration maturity were resurveyed with the 3D
equipment to expand the data inventory for reliable geological modeling and
optimization of extension and development wells drilling and location. 3D seismic data
acquisition and interpretation gave good results on the Turija Sever oil field and
allowed many wells to be successfully brought on stream. The 3D data from Rusanda
oil field indicated the right sites for new wells.
The enclosed Table 3 lists the wells drilled on these three fields and their respective
recoveries.



14
On the above localities, until December 31, 1996, 68 wells were drilled by application
of equipment and materials purchased under the World Bank Loan. Oil production rate
for that time period reached 506,000 t and gas 101x16 St m3 in the total amount of cca
76 million US$. Having in mind the fact that an average well life time is 10 - 15
years, its quite realistic to expect considerably higher recovery factor of the above
mentioned.
B.    A good example of the benefits from the WB training program  is the discovery
preparation and start-up of the "Ziti9te" gas field.  The well designed geological
model, the application geophysical DHI and geological exploration methods (appraisal
wells) allowed the development of this field with the optimum number of wells. The
discovery was made in 1988; in less than a year the field was put in production. The
average depth of the wells is about 1200 m. Of the seven wells drilled, six are
producers.
4.5   Equipment and Material Procurement
4.5.1  For the procurement of equipment, spares and materials necessary for Project
implementation, Nafta-Gas used 32.38 mill US$ from the YU-2596 Loan. The disbursement
of 2.36 mill US$ was canceled upon Loan expiry. The bulk of the initial procurement
specification was, however, implemented. Having expanded the existing working capacities
with new acquisitions, Nafta-Gas achieved full capability to successfully perform the Project
tasks. It should be noted that the new equipment consisted of items which were the top
technological developments in the petroleum industry at the time.
4.6  In-House Courses and Training Abroad
4.6.1 A comparatively small share of the total Loan amount was allotted to advancing the
professional knowledge and skill of Nafta-Gas's staff. Time has proved that the investment
was most profit-conscious not only because of the immediate benefits derived for the purpose
of Project implementation but, in the long term, because of the general upgrading of the
performance of routine oil and gas exploration and production jobs.
4.6.2 In general, the training was designed to advance the technology applied to petroleum
exploration and production, and addressed all major Project components like geophysical
modeling and interpretation, deep well design and drilling, application of stimulation methods,
well testing and measurements, and laboratory tests. The courses were in-house and attended
by an audience of different professions. Specializations in renowned international training
centers were available to a more restricted group of Nafta-Gas's professionals.
4.6.3 High importance should be attached to the training of technical staff at various
manufacturers'. The equipment suppliers were committed to organize such training for all
equipment items procured under the YU-2596 Loan both in their own and the user's interest.



15
The large number of people who attended this type of training significantly elevated the overall
on-the-job knowledge and skill of Nafta-Gas's personnel.
4.7   Foreign Service Companies
4.7.1 In the course of Project implementation, Nafta-Gas did not use the services of foreign
companies as originally planned.  The engagement of foreign service companies for
stimulation jobs when testing the old wells was taken into serious consideration but never
effected because, as a rule, the candidate wells had a poor production history database which
resulted in rather pessimistic evaluations of the profitability.
5.    Basic Obligations of Nafta-Gas under the Loan Agreement
1.    Presentation of annual operation plans associated with Project implementation
for approval by the World Bank.
2.    Reporting to the World Bank on tenders drawn up for equipment procurement
and advertising invitations to tender.
3.    Delivery of bids to the World Bank and proposal of winners.
4.    Delivery of commercial contracts signed by the bidders and of applications for
relevant payments by the World Bank.
5.    Accounting for expenses from the special account with Jugobanka, New York.
This account was fed from the Loan fund to the amount of 1.6 mill US$.
6.    reporting on Project implementation status (quarterly commitment).
7.    Reporting on audit (Current Cost Financial Statement) made annually by Service
for Payment Operation and Financial Control for Nafta-Gas strictly to the form
established by the World Bank.
5.1   The performance of these procedures did not always go smoothly in either direction.
This particularly applies to Nafta-Gas. Due to procedural issues related to decision making,
Nafta-Gas could not always fully satisfy the time schedule. However, these delays did never
seriously affect the relations between the Bank and Nafta-Gas.
6.    Pending Issu
6.1   The implementation of the Project was occasionally associated with issues pending
settlement, be it with regards to equipment delivery or guarantees for the equipment. The
economic blockade stopped communications and aggravated the finalization of otherwise
readily solvable problems.
Today, we have to deal with the following outstanding issues:
1    OTIS, U.S.A. - Some of the equipment, valued at 273,912 US$ is in SR
Yugoslavia. The rest of the contracted equipment, valued at 447,603.90 US$



16
lies confiscated in the Republic of Croatia. The money for this yet
unsettled    contract is on the blocked special account with Jugobanka, New
York.
2.   ROBERTSON RESEARCH - Logging tools proved defective at commissioning.
Contract value: 423,757 US$. This contract has been paid by Nafta-Gas but the
logging tools are at the manufacturer's in the United Kingdom. Negotiations
toward amicable settlement are under way. If successful, remedy will be sought
through arbitration.
3.   TCA RESERVOIR ENGINEERING SERVICES, HOUSTON, TEXAS, U.S.A.
Nafta-Gas owes 29,900 US$ for the first part of the steam injection feasibility
study prepared with a view to attempt enhanced oil recovery from the
Jermenovci field.
4.   The special account with Jugobanka, New York is blocked because of the
economic sanctions imposed on SR Yugoslavia and Nafta-Gas has no true
information on the state of account.
7.    LOAN SERVICING
7.1   Servicing of the Loan principal, interest and commissions is shown in Tables 4 and 5.
7.2   The World Bank has returned overpayments of principal, interest and commission.
When money transfers were stopped by the sanctions, NIS-NAFTA-GAS became unable to
regularly service outstanding payments.
7.3   As soon as the sanctions were lifted, the Government of SR Yugoslavia started talks
with the international creditors about reassuming regular payments. When this problem is
overridden at higher level, NIS-NAFTA-GAS will immediately place its efforts to meet the
commitments to the World Bank.
8.   IMMEDIATE PROJECT BENEFITS
8.1   Using the financial resources available under the Loan YU-2596 to implement the First
Petroleum Sector Project, Nafta-Gas succeeded in the main to accomplish the initially set goals
of petroleum exploration in Vojvodina.
8.2   Although some objectives have not been reached because the operations had to be
discontinued, the completion of the wells listed in Table 3 resulted insignificant oil and gas
recovery. The technical staff upgraded. New technologies have been transferred to a fertile
ground and the long-term benefits from the Project are clearly high. Unfortunately, due to the
economic sanctions, some expectations either felt short or never came to be.



17
9.    RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
9.1  In the course of Project implementations, the relations with the Bank representatives in
charge of the Project were always good and open. In all contacts optimum solutions were
sought for in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. The Nafta-Gas participants in the
Project implementation gratefully remember the useful suggestions, instructions and help given
with best intentions whenever there were problems which inevitably crop up in the various
phases of such an undertaking as the First Petroleum Sector Project.
