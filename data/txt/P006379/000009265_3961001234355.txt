MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDW TIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERTIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SAO PAULO METROPOUTAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to fte Federal Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$126 million to help finance a project for a
Metropolitan Transport Decentrarization in Sao Paulo. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        .       <ii3an transportation is in a crisis in Brazil. Although the nation has invested
heavily in the sector over the past 15 years, the effective demand for urban transport services
particularly In major metropolitan regions (MRs) increased by about 82% in the last decade, and under
present pricing policies, exceeds the existing peaK hour supply In most MRs. To add to this capacity
shortage, the Brazilian urban transport sector suffers fron institutional problems due to a lack of
coordination between the three ie el* of govemment responsible for urban transport in the MRs. The
New Constituinon promulgated in October 1988, clearly transfers responsibility for urban transport to
state and municipal governments. The federally-owned rail system (CBTU) has been financed and
operated independently of the transportation priories withn the MRs. This has led to inefficient modal
and tariff ingration and, above all, to a lack of prioritization of urban transport investments. Finally,
cost recovery policis and mechanisms have been so inadequate that some of the systems (particularly
the CBTU) have Jeterorated to the extent that they are no longer a safe and reliable means of
transport.
3.    The urban poor, the main users of the CBTU trains, bear the brunt of the problems:
-  shortage of capacity at peak hours resulting in overcFowded (>10 pass/m2) often inhuman
conditons;
*   ong work loumeys (2.5 hours each way) from the metropolitan periphery to the urban centers,
with often more than two modal transfers; and
*  high proportion (20%) of their Income spent towards home-to-work fares for combined bus
plus rail trips.
Expansion of the capacity utilization of the rail based systems has been singled out as the least-cost
priority option to increase peak hour capacity in the MRs especially of Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio de
Janeiro (RJ), whicb between them alone account for 65% of all urban transport trips. There exists a
consensus that a decentralization - the transfer of the responsibility for the administration, operation,
financing and ownership of the CBTU Systems in each of the 9 MRs, In line with the provisions of the
New Constitution - will make the systems mors responsive to their ridership. This decentralization
should be coupled with the implementation of a comprehensive set of efficiency-related policies. These
among other things, should promote modal integration, improve direct cost recovery, strengthen the
targeting of subsidies, and institutionalize a predictable and sustainable system for financing the
operating shortfall of each operating agency, and for expansion of the systems in future.
4.    Since the mid 1 980's, the CBTU has lost more than 1 million passengers/day in its Sao Paulo
and Rio systems alone, which at present, are only transporting 1.5 million passengers/day. This is the
result of an Inefficient operation due to frequent disruptions of the system caused by equipment
shorteges and failures, power supply and overhead catenary problems, lack of appropriate signalling
to decrease headways and frequent accidents which disrupt rail services. The deferred maintenance



-2
pattern experienced by CBTU is due to poor maintenance policies, obsolete infrastructure, and a weak
financial situation resulting from:
*  a 'heavy dependence on the cash-strapped federal govemment for operating subsidies;
* poor cost recovery mechanisms such as very low tariffs and fare evasion;
a*    l ack of apspropriate cost accounting and financial management;
*   very weak Inventory management which affects spare part and rolling stock availability; and
* non-existent staff and line rationalization strategies.
The Federal Govemment (GOB) has decided to transfer the CBTU Systems to their respective States
and has set Itself a December 1993 de~fIne to accomplish this goal in the case of CBTU-SP. To
facilitate this decentralization, it has decided to embark on an urgent physical rehabilitation and
financial restructuring program for the CBTU-SP System, through which it intends to improve overall
operational performance and reduce operating expenses, and has approached the Bank for financial
and technical support. The proposed decentralization is In agreement with the Bank's strategy for the
sector which Is centered around: (i) assisting the three levels of govemment in formulating and
implementing an urban transport policy consistent with the increased role of subnational govemments;
(I) supporting an emergency program to rehabilitate existing services such as the CBTU rail services,
metro lines and busways, which can easily and quickly Increase their efficiency and their peak hour
capacity; Iili) introducing better cost recovery mechanisms including adequate cost-based peak hour
tariffs and fare evasion control In the rehabilitated services in order to strengthen their financial base;
(iv) Increasing the efflciency and equity of existing services through multimodal tariff and physical
intgration; (v) promoting derenulation and private sector participation; and {vi) improving the targeting
of subsidies to the poor.
S.    Itlonale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies
and investments that will encourage economic growth and social development in a context of
macroeconomic stability. Our emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, Increased efficiency in the
public sector and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. The proposed
project objectives are in line with the Bank's assistance objectives, namely: li) to promote financial
viability of public enterprises and their reform, including decentralization to various levels; (ii) to
contribute to poverty alleviation; and (iii) to reduce Govemment subsidies through better tariff policies
and improved financial management, and (iv) to encourage an increased participation of the private
sector In urban transport. Through Its involvement the Bank has already helped accelerate the
decentralization process and will support its completion, while stimulating a thorough review and
Improvements of sub-sector policies-particularly financial and modal integraVon-at both the federal
and state evels.
6.    Lessons Leamed from Past Bank Proiects. The major lessons from previous projects in the
urban transport sector In Brazil, which have been Incorporated in the proposed project are: (i) the
coordination between the three levels of government in urban transport cannot be taken for granted,
and must be dealt with very carefully at the projec: preparation level, and reviewed in detail during the
mid-term project review; (ii) policy for the sector must be strengthened to minimize distortions resulting
from inefficient physical and financial coordination between modes and to promote multimodal
integration; lill) the tariff levels should allow for significant cost recovery of working costs and must
be compleminted by financing mechanisms which cover the shortfall; (iv) demand levels forecast by
the borrowers should be carefully scrutinized; and Iv) more attention given to issues of operational
management of Infrastructure.
7.    PA. The broad project objectives through a first project in Sao Paulo are to lay
the foundations for the financial, institutional and organizational policy changes required to achieve



-3
sustainable, Integrated multimodat transport in the SP Metropolitan Region. The approach used Ir this
project will be utilized by CBTU as a model to decentralize their remaining 8 MR Systems. The specific
objectives for the proposed project are:
*  to support the Federal Govermment In its efforts to transfer the CBTU-SP System tc the State
In order to enhance its management and operations;
S  to introduce Institonal, organizational and financial policy refonns to assure its long-term
financial sustalnabilitv {including cost-efficiency gains, Improved multimodal integration,
expanded capacity, and substantial reduction In subsidies with improved targeting); and
*  to contribute to poverty alleviation and environmental improvement (facilitating access to work,
decreasing the trip time to work, the reduction of congestion, and the reduction of accidents
and fatalities throjgh the provision of safer and more comfortable rail transport).
8.    Prolect Descrition. The project includes an Investment Component (IC) and an Institutional
Development (ID) component. The IC component (90a of the loan) includes civil works and goods
to 4mplement the proposed rehabilitation of stations, track, rolling stock, signaUling, power supply,
substion equipment, fencing of the right of way, traffic engineering equipment and construction of
transfer points required to integrate CBTU with other modes. The ID component (10% of the loan) will
consist of the development and implementation of policies and action programs to: a) establish
organizational, financial and institional reforms as a basis for improved cost recovery, including the
implementationr of a plan of action for the transfer of those remaining viable CBTU Systems to their
respective states; (b) operationalize multi-modal and tariff integration between CBTU-SP, FEPASA's
(Sao Paulo State Railways) Metropolitan Train, feeder bus systems and non-motorized vehicles,
itroduce long run variable cost based fare structures which reflect peak and off peak services and
improve targeting of subsidies; {c) identify an investment program to consolidate the rehabilitation and
decentralization in SP; (d) study and recommend different management altematives, technical
Improvements and financial reforms for improving the operating efficiency of the FEPASA Metropolitan
Train and the municipal owned bus system (CMTC). Similar studies will be made for each of the
remaining operating systems including a review of management contracts and franchising or
concessions to the private sector; and (e) provide technical and management training to CBTU
employees as recommended In the orga-iization an: manpower development studies (and after
decentralization to the staff of each operating agency), and staff of selected other transport agencies
participating in the project.
9.    The project is estimated to require five years to implement, at a total cost of US$ 281 million
equivalent wkh a foreign exchange component of US$126 million (45 percent). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules r. and
D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 1001 2-BR dated March 6,
1992, Is being distributed separately.
10.   The Strateov for DecentralIation. The transfer of operational responsibility for the CBTU-SP
system on or before 12/31/93, Is the main objective. The transfer of ownership of the assets on the
other hand, requires some legislative amendments. Agreement was reached on the adoption of a two-
stage strategy: i) an "Operational Transfer" which means the effective transfer to a state Public
Corporation (SP Entity) of all management and operational responsibility and accountability for the
operation and administration of the CBTU-SP System; and lii) a second stage "Ownership Transfer"
In which assets of the CBTU-SP System would pass to the SP-Entity following the enactmunt and
execution of all legal, contractual and administrative acts and documents required under the legislation
of the Borrower and the State for these purposes.



-4-
11.   Thq terms and conditions of the Operational Transfer will be set out in a contract to be signed
between CBTU and the SP Entity, and will take thi form of a "concession" with a validity period of
50 yoars. This will be terminated, after appropriate legal authorizations are given and implemented,
by the effective Ownership Transfer of CBTU-SP System to the SP Entity. The Operational Transfer
will provide the SP Entity with all the rights and obligations required for the administration and
operational management of the system. Dated covenants were agreed for effecting the operational
transter and initiating the ownership transfer as noted in paragraph 16.
12.   EE&ct QO  nkaftio  and mm emnthip  The project will be managed by a special Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), cilated in CBTU for managing the execution of the project. The PIU will
continue to manage the execution of the project after the Operational Transfer of the CBTU-SP System
to the State. This will ensure the continuity of project management experience acquired prior to
Operational Transfer and wvill prevent potential delays which could occur due to an eventual change
of the project implementation team beforr the conclusion of the project. To manage and guide the
"non-hardware" aspects (political, legal, administrative, institutional, and so forth), through the
transition and until December 1993, an intergovernmental General Coordination Committee will
coordinate the work of a number of task forces, which will carry out strategic studies on terms of
reference agreed with the Bank. A separate and independent Monitoring and Audit consultant will be
contracted, reporting directly to the President of CBTU. Based on the performance of CBTU's
management, evidenced by actions taken to improve the finances and administration of the agency
since May 1990, the CBTU has the capacity to implement the project.
13.   Protect SU_tainabltv.  Govemment commitment, sound institutional arrangements, and
financial stability are the comerstones of project sustainability. The SP Govemment has given high
priority to metropolitan transportation. In July 1991 a new law set up a State Secretariat of
Metropolitan Transport to promote coordination and multi -modal integration, already more advanced
in SP thati elsewhere .n Brazil. SP has also moved quickly to sign the Convenio Basico (a formal
Agreement of Intent on Decentralization of the CBTU-SP) with the GOB. SP already possesses the
Institutional experience of operating the SP METRO and FEPASA, which is to be integrated with the
CBTU-SP, and steps are already underway to improve the institutional arrangements for improved
liaison in the sector with the Municipality of Sao Paulo. Finally, the financial policies (cost reduction,
tariff adjustments) designed for the restructuring of the CBTU-SP, coupled with efficiency gains
(increased capacity and operating targets), will bring eventual operating shortfalls to levels which
represent about 3% of the State oudget after 1995. Achieving these levels will provide positive
assurances of the long-term sustainability of the project.
14.   Environmensa AsDeCTS. Since the main objective of the proposed project is to increase the
capacity offered by the rail suburban system, it is expected that a substantial percentage of the
passengers now carried by bus will return to their original mode of rail transportation. This is especially
true for passenUers who iive within walking distance from the stations, who switched to buses
because, in the last five years, the capacity and safety offered by trains decreased considerably.
However, it is not so obvious for those passengers who are not within walking distance. Nevertheless,
it is estimated that by project completion about a thousand (1,000) less buses/day will be required in
the streets of the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, because over 320,000 pass/day are conservatively
-expected to switch back to rail. The main positive environmental impacts expected stem from this
reduction in bus services, given their present negative impact on the air quality, estimated at US$6.3
million/year in SP, as well as reduction in noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents. Other
positive impacts include the-effect of the rehabilitation of the rail system on passenger safety at the
stations, on the land use around the right of way and the decrease of fatal accidents resulting from
tack of fencing of the right-of-way. It is estimated that the quantifiable savings (from less negative
)vironme"t,I impacts) amount to US$18 million/year. Even if the benefits estimated were cut in half
bbcause the bus operators would, in some cases, continue to run the buses at lower load factors, the
project would contribute positively to the environment.

q  -15.   PRO    Q-  v   g     . The ridership of the CBTU-SP is predominantly of low-income.
About !8% earn less than 3 times the minimum wage I3MWI and about 78% earn less than 5MW
(only the very desperate travel under the appalling conditions today). Bank projections on household
expenditures including transportation show that the Impact of proposed rail fares, especially on the
lowest segments lup to 2 MW) would be significant. The project therefore includes policy teforms to
ensure that auantifiable, predictable and sustainable operating subsidies are made avaiiable by the
State to directty target the low.income ridership. They will benefit from improved access to work,
reduced travel time and congestion, and a general improvement in the safety conditions of the present
system.
16.   Aaed AJIon. The fellowing assurances have been obtained:
A. Project Manasement that: a) the Project Implemp"ation Unit (PIU) be adequately staffed
and structured: b) Procurement be carried out in accordan-. with Bank guidelines; c) a Project
MUngeynent Information System (PMIS) satisfactory to the Bank be installed within 90 days of Loan
signing; d) the project be executed, and the system subsequently operated ir accordance with good
environnmental practices. -
B. Decentralization and Operational Efficiency that: a) the Operational Transfer be completed
by the target date of 12131193, or when 60% of the loan funds have been disbursed, whichever is
earlier; b) the CBTU enter into a Contract with a juridically independent public corporation to be set
up (the SP-Entity) satisfactory to the Bank, to effect the Operational Transfer; c) by 12/31/92, the
Borrower submit to the Borrower's Congress a bill of law, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank, authorizing all actions required to effect the Ownership Transfer; d) by 06/30/93, SP establish
the SP Entity with sufficient powers and authority to accept the Operational and Ownership Transfers
.and to own and operate all assets included therein; e) by December 15 each year after the Operational
Transfer and until December 15, 1995, SP execute 'Contract Plans" satisfactory to the Bank., with the
SP Entity, Including specific operating, financial and performance targets for the following fiscal year
and the financial contibutions and other actions required from the State to enable the SP Entity to
attain such targets; f) CBTU comply with the agreed Implementation Program including agreed basic
physical, operational rnd financial targets; g) by 09130/93 CBTU prepare in consultation with the
Borrpwer and State, and put into effect a 'Financial Plan" of action (including dates and intermediate
targets), satisfactory to the Bank, to reach a working ratio for CBTU-SP's operations after the
Opevational Transfer, not higher than 1 by December 31, 1995. Such plan shall include a specific
program of tariff increases and a set of operational measures required for that purpose; and h) physical
operating targets which minimize the need for unnecessary tariff increases, will be adopted and will
automatically trigger an internal management review of operating income and expenditures, and
operating performance targets to maintain efficiency.
C. Financial Policy and Modal Integration that: a) the GOB during the project disbursement
period, meet the project-related cost of capital investments plus debt service (interest and amortization)
of the CBTU-SP and the Loan; b) up to 12/31/93, the GOB cover the difference between the working
costs and operating revenues of the CBTU-SP; c) the CBTU, SP (and where applicable the MSP)
undertake to ensure completion of selected studies, including a tariff and financial policy study (all
under terms of reference approved by the Bank) before the Mid-Term Project Review, so that an Action
Plan on the agreed recommendations can be prepared; and d) not later than 12 months from the date
of signing of the Loan Agreement, SP will present a plan (financial, technical and institutional) and a
timetable, satisfactory to the Bank, for the transfer and integration, and consolidation of the FEPASA
metropolitan train system with the CBTU-SP; and
D. A Mid-Term Review: that a Review will take place (on or about June 30, 1993) to review
preagreed institutional, onerational and financial performance Indicators, and compliarce with
covenants (including tariffs, subsidies, progress on studies, etc) of the Loan and Project Agreements,
tassess project performance and progress on decentralization and as necessary agree on remedial



a't"ons. Particular Importance will be given, during the mid-term review, to the agreed working ratios
and the status of tho sttudies and action plans required to ensure a smooth Operational Transfer.
17.   Prior to Effectiveness a Supplementary Agreement to the Convenio Basico, incorporating
selected orovisions of the Loan and Project Agreement, will be executed, and the PIU will be staffed
by CBTU, with a team of fully dedicated specialists satisfactory to the Bank.
18.    iect ftn2f. Substantial quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are expected from the
provision of larger capacity and safer operation by CBTU, namely, operating cost savings, time savings
for the users, less accidents and fatalities and employment generation through better spatial integration
of markets. In addition, there will be a positive environmental impact through the reduction In bus
services, and consequently of fossil fuel consum&tion and road congestion, with an improvement of
air quality and noise pollution. It will require less diiesel operated buses compared to the electrified rail
service, cleaner and less noisy. Poverty alle% iation will also result from facilitation of access to
employment. A preliminary economic evaluation of the project shows an Economic rDate of Retum of
46% for the investment component which represerts 90% of the project.
19.   BhM. The main risks are the dynamics and consequent delays in the dialogue between the
three levels of government, the poitical reluctance to raise tariffs to allow the CBTU-SP to reach the
targeted working rfatios, the possible delays in the procurement process, and the timely availability of
counterpart funds. Negotiations between the Federal and State Govemment have progressed very well
as have those between the State and municipal govemments for modal coordination. Al parties have
sgreed on the decentralization, and the riska are more associated with 'fine-tuningo its phasing and
tems. of transfer. The tariff issue will remain a major risk although CBTU has been increasing tariffs,
because Govemments may be tempted to freeze tariffs for long periods of time, thereby eroding
revenues. The contract plans will contain provisions to protect the CBTU-SP System from these
Imposed freezes. The delays in the procurement process have been minimized as the CBTU has
produced major tender documents. The timely availability of counterpart fund: has been guaranteed
under new legislation that prioritizes use of annual budgetary provisions of parastatal agencies to meet
Intemational and bilateral loan counterpart commitments. CBTU FY 92 counterpart funds have already
beNn Included in th GOB's FY92 provisions.
20.   Rcommendgfl . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
