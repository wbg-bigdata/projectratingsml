Loan and Project Sumary
Borrover:            Republic of Turkey
Beneficiaries:       Sinai Yatirim ye Kredi Bankasi (SYKB)
Balk Bankasi (HB)
Amounl:              USg100 million
Term:                Fifteen years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:     The Borrower would onlend $98.4 million to SYKB and HB
for relending to eligible sub-borrowers in the small and
medium scale industrial sector and $0.35 million to BB
for technical assistance.  The balance of $1.25 million
would be-allocated to the Small Industry Development
Organization (SIDO) for technical assistance to SMI
enterprises. For sub-loans covered under the Foreign
Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FElIS), sub-borrowers
would pay the fixed FRIlS interest rate while the
Borrower would onlend Bank funds denominated in TL to
SYKB and HB at a fixed interest rate equal to the
onlending rate to sub-borrowers minus an intermediation
fee of 4 percent. Alternatively, Bank funds would be
onlent in foreign exchange to SYKB and RB at a fixed
interest rate equal to the then prevailing Bank rate plus
a fee of 0.75 percent. The rate to sub-borrowers would
be fixed at 5 percent above the prevailing Bank rate.
Amortization of $98.4 million for financing of industry
would conform substantially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of individual sub-loans, while
amortization of $0.35 million for financing technical
assistance would be over 15 years including 3 years of
grace.
Project              The project is designed to support a program for the
Description:         development of labor-intensive SMI, with special emphasis
on Small Scale Industry (SSI), through lines of credit to
SYKB and BB, technical assistance for the institutional
strengthening and efficiency improvement of HB and
technical assistance to SMI enterprises through SIDO.

Benefits and Risks:    The project would support the development of
labor-intensive SMI projects in industries where Turkey
has a comparative advantage and thus contribute to both
job creation and growth of manufactured exports. The
project is estimated to create about 18,000 direct
jobs. The project would also provide technical
assistance to SMI resulting in their increased
productivity and efficiency. In addition, the project
would help strengthen the institutional structure for
financial assistance to SMI. The project risks mainly
relate to the overall investment situation in the
private industrial sector and the timely utilization of
the proposed loan by the intermediary banks.
Substantial delays in loan utilization are unlikely,
however, in view of the measures taken by the -
Government to stimulate the growth of the private
sector.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENITION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE RtEPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$100 million to help finance
a Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI) Project. The loan would have a term
of 15 years including 3 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate. The equivalent of $80 million and $18.75 million would be onlent to
Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB) and Halk Bankasi (RB) respectively.
Amortization of $98.4 million for financing of industry would conform
substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules of individual
sub-loans, while amortization of $0.35 million for financing technical
assistance would be over 15 years including 3 years of grace. Of the amount
of $98.75 million, the portion covered by the Government's Foreign Exchange
Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) would carry the fixed interest rate established
under FERIS minus a fee of 4 percent, while the balance would be onlent at a
fixed interest rate equal to the then prevailing Bank interest rate plus a fee
of 0.75 percent. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
sub-borrowers in the latter case.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.       Turkey's area is about 781,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
5U million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984.  The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
commercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment has expanded greatly, but the level of adult literacy remains
relatively low ccmpared to the European average for middle income countries.



-2-
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, aud the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans and an agricultural sector adjustment loan,
involves far-reaching changes in attitudes, institutions, and the legal and
policy framework, all of which require time to be put in place. Major
structural changes have been made in the exchange rate system, the export and
import regines, the tax system, interest rate and selective credit policies
and the public investment program. Implementation of the adjustment program
started in January 1980, continued under a military regime during the period
September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been carried out by an elected
goverment.
The Structural Adjustment Program - 1980-85
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual outcomes met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated
in 1983 due to a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages
in the monetary program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved
again, except in the area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The
improvement has been maintained in 1985, as evidenced by a slowdown in
inflation and a reduction in the budget deficit.
8.      After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports, and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).
Exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar terms. In
1985, the growth rate of the economy is, according to the latest estimates,
expected to be about 4.9 percent, as against the program target of
5.5 percent. The slowdown of growth is apparent across the board, but is most
significant in agriculture (2.3 percent growth) and manufacturing



- 3 -
(5.6 percent), due respectively to less favorable climatic conditions and
slackening domestic demand. On the expenditure side, the average almual real
rate of growth of public fixed investment over the period 1980-85 has been
fairly stable, at less than 3 percent p.a., while the growth rate of private
investment has recovered, following a 17.3 percent decline in 1980, and rose
by 7.1 percent in 1984 and an estimated 5.2 percent in 1985. Private
consumption, after declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by
5 percent in 1983 and 1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3 percent in
1985. Strict budgetary discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real
rate of growth of public consumption from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent
in 1983; however, it increased to 3.8 percent in 1984 and an estimated
4.4 percent in 1985.
9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation by a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index decelerated to 37 percent in
1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984, and
reached 50 percent. The major factors that brought about the worseniug of the
inflationary situation in 1984 were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases
of SEE prices - since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to
set their prices freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues.
10.      Inflation is expected to decline to 43-44 percent in 1985.  This
average annual inflation rate would be the net result of a period of high
inflation during the first quarter of the year, followed by a period of
deceleration starting in April 1985. Deceleration occurred despite
significant increases in prices of goods produced by SEEs; it was rendered
possible by the maintenance of high real rates of interest, a decline in the
prices of a number of agricultural goods (mostly fruits and vegetables), and
an overall slackening of domestic demand. The slowdown of inflation in the
second half of 1985 reinforces the expectations of a further decrease in the
average rate in 1986, bringing it close to the Government's target of
25 percent.
11.      In the fiscal area, the progress achieved between 1980 and 1982
(during which time the budget deficit declined from 5.3 percent to 2.1 percent
of GNP) was not sustained in 1983 and 1984. Due to a steady decline in
consolidated government revenues as a percentage of GNP, 1/ the budget deficit
increased to 3.2 percent of GNP in 1983, and reached almost 5 percent of GNP
in 1984. The somewhat disappointing performance in the raising of revenues
was accompanied, however, by significant improvements in the control of public
expenditure. Overall, government expenditures decreased from 22 percent of
GNP in 1983 to an estimated 16 percent in 1985, essentially due to a
1/      Although total government revenues (inclusive of extra-budgetary
funds introduced in 1984) have not declined as sharply.



- 4 -
curtailment of personnel expenditures and goveroment transfers to SEEs, with
the latter declining from 2.5 percent of GNP in 1983 to an estimated
0.8 percent of GNP in 1985. However, the fact that improvements in the area
of government expenditures were not matched by commensurate gains in the
reduction of the budget deficit highlights the urgency of mobilizing
additional public resources. As a step in this direction, the Government
introduced a Value Added Tax in January 1985, replacing previous indirect
taxes based on the value of output. The new tax has resulted in raising the
share of taxes on goods in total government revenues from around 12 percent in
1983-84 to an estimated 20 percent in 1985. As a result of these measures,
the budget deficit is expected to improve to about 2.5 percent of GNP in 1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Commercial bank deposit interest rates, which
were deregulated in July 1980, are positive in real terms. Time deposits have
been yielding a positive real return since early 1984, with interest rates
presently ranging between 45 to 55 percent depending upon the term of the
deposit. Positive deposit interest rates have resulted in a steady increase
in deposits: in 1984 private non-commercial deposits grew by 8 percent in
real terms, and in 1985 the growth has continued at a rate of about
10 percent. Improvements in incentives for savings were accompanied by
administrative reforms of the banking system. A new banking law was enacted
in June 1983. It included many of the recommendations made in the Bank's
report on the Financial Sector (No. 4459-TU), including measures to reduce the
undercapitalization of banks and the interlocking between banks and
corporations. The legal basis of the banking reform was strengthened with the
enactment of a revised banking law in April 1985, which introduced
standardized accounting for banks and specified improved procedures for
handling of non-performing loans. The Government also took a major step
towards reducing the cost of bank intermediation by reducing in December 1983
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
infrastructual facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge, and two dams).
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the high intermediation costs of the commercial banks and the prevailing
practice of requiring compensating balances. The Government has taken a
number of steps in 1985 to reduce the interest rate differentials between
preferential and non-perferential credits: in particular, the perferential
interest rate for export credits was discontinued ;n January 1985, while
interest rates for agricultural short-term loans and for loans to SEEs have
been increased in 1985 to 30 percent (from 28 and 24 percent respectively).
The narrowing of the gap between interest rates on preferential and
non-preferential credits, together with the decrease in the amount of
preferential credits, is expected to increase the general availability of
credit and exert a downward pressure on non-preferential interest rates.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in



- 5 -
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, tco, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports, fueled by high growth as vell as a more liberal import
regime put in place in 1984, grew by more than 16 percent to reach
$10.8 billion (or almost 22 percent of GNP). As a result of these
developments, both the trade and the current account deficits declined as
compared to 1983: the trade deficit by $50 million, and the current account
deficit by $350 million, to reach $1.4 billion or about 2.9 percent of GNP.
Projections for 1985 indicate a further strong improvement of the current
account sitliation. Merchandise exports, after a sluggish start in 1985, have
grown by 13 percevt (in dollar terms) in the first nine months of 1985, while
merchandise imports have grown at a moderate 5.3 percent. Among the
invisibles, tourism revenues and investment income from abroad have increased
significantly compared to 1984 and previous years. Similarly, workers'
remittances have continued to rise at a rate of about 10 percent per annum.
It is now estimated that the current account deficit in 1985 would be in the
range of $650-800 million (about 1.3 - 1.6 percent of GNP).
15.     Merchandise export performance has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of
increase of about 22 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than three-quarters in 1985. These results were achieved by a
combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization)
and direct (tax rebates, preferential credits) measures to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased by 16.1 percent in dollar value.
The increase was most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and
consumer goods) that have been suojected to major liberalization in terms of
both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of quantitative
restrictions. In 1985, as domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of
pent-up demand for importables released by import liberalization weakened, the
rate of import growth decreased to one-third of the level recorded in 1984.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;



-6-
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan'is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear ambitious and
likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public sector) as well
as to have an adverse impact on the external balance. Accordingly, the
Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that they remain
compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth strategy
coumensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.       The Bank's projections indicate that GDP growth of 5.7 percent p.a.
on average for the 1985-90 period may be more realistic. In the first phase
of this period (1985-87), growth might be relatively slow (5.3 percent p.a.),
gradually accelerating in the outer years with an average rate of 6.0 percent
p.a. in the period 1988-90. The inflation targets in the Bank's projections
are also more conservative, implying a reduction from about 40 percent in 1985
to around 18 percent in 1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's
projections for the period 1985-90 are presented in Table 1: 1/

11        The Bank's projections for 1985 may differ slightly from the
Government's latest estimates for 1985 discussed above.

20.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's detenmination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.8 percent p.a. on average for the
1985-90 period, starting with a more modest increase of around 3.5 percent
p.a. in the early years. The comparable figure for the growth of private
fixed investm nt (for the Whole period) is 10.0 percent p.a. These figures
are consistent with the need to meet the infrastructural requirements of the
economy through the public investment program, while providing for the
capacity expansion of the private sector necessary to meet the output and
export targets. The projections allow for a modest increase of per capita
consumption of about 3.0 percent p.a. on average over the period 1985-90.
21.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.5 percent per annum in real terms during 1985-90, while merchandise imports
are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.8 percent. This is
consistent with the import liberalization program of the Government. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1988
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the outer years of the period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through 1990. For the year 1990, the projections show a deficit of
$810 million as compared to an estimated 1985 figure of $750 million. The
projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the period, even
in the face of some sharp increases in amortization payments arising from the
debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
22.      On the external front, the current expectation of lower oil prices in
the next period is likely to have a positive impact on the balance of
payments. The savings on direct petroleum imports could be as much as
$275 million in 1986 alone. Lower oil prices will no doubt have some negative
consequences for Turkey's exports to oil-exporting countries as well as on
profit and workers' remittances from construction activities in these
co-ntries. Nevertheless, the overall effect on the current account is likely
to be positive, due to the stronger effect of the import savings.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy.  Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a strong growth of Turkish exports, the
GNP growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded
if slightly higher export growth rates were achieved and there was an
improvement in the mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic conditions and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p.a. over the
1985-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources
(3 percent lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would



lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a
lower GDP growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.a.) and a higher debt service
ratio (averaging 26.7 percent during 1986-90 against 25.1 percent in the base
case scenario). In such a situation the Government would have less chance of
absorbing Lhe unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, if the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a
high growth strategy, then it could witness a repeat of the situation which
prevailed in the 1970s, and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that
the Government would risk such a situation. It is therefore more probable -
even if exogeneous developments are unfavorable - that the GovernmenL will
continue with the structural adjustment program as implemented to date, so
that the scenario of high growth fuelled by increased external borrowing seems
at present unlikely.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources - OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources and are
likely to reach an estimated level of $2.5 billion by end-1985. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.3 billion (including IMF) at end-1984,
medium and long-term debt accounted for about 79 percent. Short-term debt as
a percentage of total debt outstanding fell ftom 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
21 percent in 1984. Much of this 6rowth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme 1/. At ent-1984,
the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to
$1.8 billion, constituting 39 percent of short-term external obligations.
Based on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19 to 22, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an estimated
42 percent in 1984 to 37 percent in 1990. This translates into a total debt
outstanding forecast for 1990 of $28.8 billion, with short-term debt
constituting about 25 percent of the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.0 billion a year during
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
a level of about 25 percent during 1986-1990, due largely to improvements in
the current account of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain
11       Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish
workers in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the
disposition of the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the
deposits i.nd pays an interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market
rate.

manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive support from international
commercial and official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic
performance, its stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its
improved debt management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about
$1.3 billion in 1985. Several major American, European, Japanese and Middle
Eastern banks were involved in these operations, including a $500 million
syndicated loan in support of the balance of payments signed in April 1985.
27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the DF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government has not asked
for a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the
view that the favorable economic developments in 1985 constitute proof of
Turkey having "graduated" from the INF's program and that the IMF presence
through Article IV consultations should suffice for purposes of maintaining
international confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through September 30, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent
$6185.8 million 1/ to Turkey, through 88 projects. Agriculture accounts for
21 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs for 22 percent, power for
16 percent, structural adjustment and program loans for 27 percent, and urban
development, transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for
the remaining 14 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged
63 percent of appraisal estimates at the end of September 1985, which compares
favorably with other countries in the region. As of September 30, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $246 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IIA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1985.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's mediumrterm objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was compleLed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current plan involves the broadening and deepening of the
adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments have
underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program without
giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank
lending in the post-SAL period would be on striking an appropriate balance
between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be quick disbursing
and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and carefully
formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects principally in
the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
1/       Net of cancellations.



- 10 -
30.      A series of secteral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. Further lending of this kind would support measures to address the
structural problems of the financial sector and enhance the utilization of
industrial capacity in the public and private sectors, keeping in view the
scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held assets in the manufacturing
subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral adjustment loans are likely to be
developed include energy and transport, and it is expected that there would be
a follow-up loan in agriculture.
31.      Project lending, which would continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, would be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. Some project lending would be earmarked for the construction or
rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would be
guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
32.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the public investment
program and studies of housing finance, engineering industries, transport
investment, telecomaunications and electronics. Topics expected to be covered
in the future include a study in domestic resource mobilization, a country
economic memorandum focussing on inflation, reviews of the health and
education sectors and a study of private sector adjustment to liberalization
action.
33.      This would be the second loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include the
Kayraktepe Hydropower Project, a loan for drainage and on-farm development, a
financial sector adjustment loan and a loan for Elbistan operation and
mainteuance assistance.
34.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debc was 13.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 14 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $13.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.2 billion in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estizmated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18 percent in 1989.
35.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.

PART III - THE SECTORAL FRM&EWORK
The Manufacturing Sector
36.      Overview. The key objectives of Turkey's industrial development
strategy are expansion of exports, broadening of the range of goods produced,
greater efficiency in public and private enterprises, and employment
generation. The Government recognizes that job creation must be the outcome
of economically viable investments. Numerous studies of Turkey's industrial
sector have shown that factor productivity is significantly higher in private
than in public industry, and that small firms in the private sector offer high
returns per unit of capital invested, while being more labor intensive. The
Goveroment's industrial policy involves limiting public investment in the
manufacturing sector to rehabilitation and modernization of existing
investments and relying on private sector investment in new manufacturing
industries. The small and medium-scale industrial sector, which had been
somewhat neglected during the 1960s and 1970s when Turkey gave priority to
large-scale capital intensive projects in the public sector, is to be
encouraged through removal of disincentives and provision of technical and
financial assistance.
37.      The economic policies adopted since 1980 have attempted to move
Turkey away from its previous import-substitution focus towards an
outward-orientation and greater reliance on market forces. During 1982-84,
the Government reoriented major parts of the incentives framework towards
promociJng export development. Significant progress has also been made in
removing quantitative restrictions and in lowering duties on imports, bringing
competitive pressures to bear upon Turkish industry. Turkish firms are now
expected to compete in domestic and export markets without reliance on the
excessive tariff protection and fiscal incentives that characterized Turkish
industrial policy prior to 1980.
38.      The Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) projects
favorable growth prospects for the industrial sector. The manufacturing
sector's share in GDP is expected to grow to 27 percent during the Plan
period. Currently, the manufacturing sector accounts for about 25 percent of
fixed investment, 11 percent of aggregate employment and 65 percent of
merchandise exports. The private sector, whose share of manufacturing
employment and value added is approximately twice that of the public sector,
is concentrated in the food processing, textiles, garments, engineering,
glass, plastics and ceramics subsectors. The public sector is mainly
concentrated in heavy industry (iron and steel, fertilizers, pulp and paper,
cement, petroleum refining, chemicals and mining) as well as in some light
industries such as textiles and electrical machinery, and certain
agro-industries such as milk and meat processing.
39.      The Role of Small and Medium Scale Industry.  Small and mediur-scale
establishments 1/ number about 6,000 units accounting for about 68 percent of
1/       There are several definitions of small and medium scale manufacturing
units in Turkey. The Small Industries Development Organization
defines small units as those employing 10-49 workers and medium-scale
units as those employing 50-199 workers. Under IBRD Loan 1952-TU,
small-scale units were defined as firms with fixed assets (including
land and buildings) valued at less than $500,000 (in 1984 prices) and
mediumrscale units as those with assets up to $2.5 million.



- 12 -
establishments registered in the organized private sector (employing 10 or
more workers). They employ about 235,000 workers or about 45 percent of the
total employed. These numbers exclude units in the informal sector
(para. 40). On the basis of a 1978 survey, SMI's share in total manufacturing
employment was estimated at about 35 percent. SMI firms are very prominent in
certain industries, notably wood processing/fu±rniture and engineering.
Updated data regarding the distribution of value added and employment by size
of units are not available, but the proportions accounted for by SMI in
various industries do not appear to have changed very markedly in the last six
years. To date as a group SMI has played a small role in exports. However,
the linkage between SMI and exports is expected to grow substantially in the
next few years as Turkey's experience is expected to resemble more that of
other prominent exporting countries.
40.      The artisanal units in the non-organized sector (employing
1-9 workers) are much more numerous (about 177,000 establishments), accounting
for about 20 percent of manufacturing value added and employing about
455,000 workers. Areas of growth for artisans are in metal goods, plastic
goods and furniture production. Despite special schemes (paras. 42 and 43),
most artisanal units appear to be operating at the margin, with their
financial condition made more difficult by high nominal interest rates on
working capital and their inability at times to pass on inflation cost
increases to their consumers. As a result of import liberalization,
competitive pressures on the SSI and artisanal sector can be expected to
intensify, leading to rationalization of the sector.
41.      SMI generally face a number of internal and external problems
inhibiting their development. Internal problems adversely affecting
productivity include obsolete machinery, deficient production engineering and
management practices and insufficient trained workers. External problems
include limited access to institutional finance and lack of technical
assistance. Available sources of technical assistance are too costly or not
geared to assisting SMI.
42.      Support Programs.  The Government has increasingly recognized the
potential of SMI to contribute to employment creation and export growth. The
Fifth Five-Year Plan enunciates a strategy which includes: (i) enlarging the
flow of investment and working capital loans; (ii) strengthening the Small
Industry Development Organization (SIDO) to develop appropriate strategies,
policies and technical extension activities for SMI; and (iii) expanding
support for industrial estates for SSI units and providing on-the-job and
technical training. Moreover, recent policy reforms have reduced
discrimination in regard to access of SMI to incentives.
43.      In October 1984, a new incentive scheme simplified investment
application procedures for projects of less than TL600 million. Under this
scheme, small projects also became entitled to receive the same rate of cash
incentive (7 percent of the capital cost of completed projects) from the
Government as large projects. For small units, the minimum required equity
percentage is 40 rather than 50 percent for any project proposal submitted to
the State Planning Organization (SPO) for a Certificate of Encouragement.
Finally, the special problems faced by SMI units in obtaining access to the
export rebate system, which was geared towards large volume exports, have been
eased by the Government through the phasing out of the export rebate system
and the maintenance of a realistic exchange rate policy.

44.      Strategy for Industry and Experience vith Past Lending.  The Bank has
undertaken a number of studies in recent years (including one on small and
mediumrscale industries) related to the industrial sector in Turkey. These
studies have formed the basis for a constructive policy dia.logue with the
Government. Bank lending for the industrial sector has beea directed at two
broad areas: (i) improving the efficiency of SEEs (such as in the textiles,
pulp and paper, and iron and steel subsectors) both through direct Bank loans
and indirect loans through DYB; and (ii) encouraging private sector investment
through financial intermediary loans utilizing TSKB and SYKB. The structural
adjustment program included a strong focus on trade policy issues, SEE
efficiency and financial sector refonms.
45.      In order to support the Government's objective of expanding the role
of the private sector in export expansion and employment generation, the
proposed project would build on the Bank's first project in this area - the
Labor-Intensive Industry Project (Loan 1952-TU) - and provide further
assistance for the development of the small and medium-scale manufacturing
sector. Under the first project, SYKB approved 112 sub-projects for a total
amount of about $40 million, principally in the textile, chemical, machinery,
food, metal products and marble industries. SYKB's performance in utilizing
the Bank loan, as reflected by the good quality of sub-project appraisal, the
large number of sub-projects financed and the low cost per job, has been very
satisfactory. The strategy under the proposed project would be to provide
technical assistance to SMI units by enabling SIDO to initiate the
establishment of a nationwide network of extension services centers. SIDO
would also assist in integrating the activities of small producers and
subcontractors with those of larger exporting firms. In addition to financing
SMI through Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB), the proposed project would
also give special emphasis to the development of the artisanal subsector by
supporting the development lending activities of Halk Bankasi (HB). The
Bank's operations in the industrial sector were reviewed by the Operations
Evaluation Department in its report entitled "Sector Operations Review: The
Industries and DFCs Program in Turkey" (Report No. 3077 dated July 18, 1980).
Since the Bank's operations in the DFCs sector till then had been confined to
financing TSKB and, through it, private sector industry, the report focussed
on TSKB. However, the report highlighted the importance of institutional
strengthening of financial intermediaries as well as the need for an export
orientation for Turkish industry, the exploitation of its comparativie
advantage and a relatively modest capital intensity. All these findings have
been taken into account in designing subsequent Bank operations including the
proposed project.
The Financial Sector
46. *    The financial system in Turkey is dominated by the banking system
which consists of 19 domestic commercial banks, 13 foreign commercial banks,
and 15 specialized banks, such as the Agricultural Bank (TCZB) and Halk
Bankasi (HB). In addition, two privately-owned development banks (TSKB and
SYKB) and two government-owned banks (DYB and DESIYAB) provide term finance to
the manufacturing sector. Nearly 60 percent of total private fixed investment
in the organized sector is financed by financial institutions, with the
balance coning mainly from the investors' own sources. Of this amount, nearly
four-fifths is extended through deposit money banks, while the investment and
development banks account for the balance. A substantial portion of deposit
money banks' short-ternm loans is rolled over year after year and in effect
constitutes medium-ternm finance, but such financing is principally applied at
present to payments of arrears.



- 14 -
47.      Balk Bankasi (HB) is the principal source of loans to small
businesses in the unorganized sector through a network of more than
600 regional offices and branches. Its borrowers include small tradesmen and
artisans, often organized in cooperatives, as well as SMI manufacturing
units. For SMI units that are too large to qualify for HB financing (i.e.
firms with fixed assets of more than TL300 million excluding land and
buildings), sources of funds are very limited. Commercial banks are reluctant
to lend to SMI because of higher administrative costs and a perceived higher
risk. SYKB has been providing funds under the Bank-financed Labor-Intensive
Industry Project for firms at the larger end of the StI spectrum.
48.      The cost of loans to borrowers in Turkey is influenced to some extent
by the rediscounting policies that are set forth periodically by the Central
Bank, which vary with different activities and maturities. For investment
loans eligible for Central Bank rediscounting, the final cost is a blend
between the cost of funds eligible for rediscounting and the cost of funds
from the banks' own sources. The effective blended interest rate of medium
and long-term TL investment loans for industrial credits from the deposit
money banks is now estimated at 50-55 percent p.a., but the cost of similar
funds from the investment banks is 38-41 percent p.a., because a relatively
higher proportion of these loans can be rediscounted with the Central Bank.
Given the expectation of significantly lower inflation rates in the future,
these interest rates are generally expected to be positive in real terms over
the life of the loans. For SSI units that qualify to borrow from Halk
Bankasi, a range of rates exists depending upon the source and purpose. For
tradesman and artisans who are members of cooperatives and require loans for
working capital, the effective cost through the Central Bank rediscount
facility is estimated at 30-32 percent, whereas the cost of investment loans
for SSI is 43-52 percent.
49.      Until mid-1984, the interest rate on foreign currency loans was set
by the intermediary's cost (or the weighted average cost) of foreign currency
borrowings plus a spread (about 5 percent), with the borrower assuming the
full foreign exchange risk. The substantial depreciation of the Turkish lira
in 1982-84 caused heavy losses to borrowers carrying the foreign exchange risk
and therefore demand for such loans virtually ceased. To encourage greater
use of foreign borrowings, the Government, in July 1984, instituted a foreign
exchange risk insurance scheme (FERIS) which was made applicable to IBRD loans
to TSKB and SYKB. Under this scheme, loans were denominated in TL at a fixed
interest rate (26 percent) over an 8-year term, with a special fund bearing
the foreign exchange risk. The scheme succeeded in stimulating investment
demand, in part because the effective cost to borrowers (estimated at
31-33 percent, including front-end and special commitment fees) was low
compared to the prevailing inflation rate. The Government decided to continue
the scheme in 1985, with a fixed interest rate of 35 percent for sub-loans
approved through December 31, 1985. The rate will be reviewed every six
months and adjusted as necessary. The scheme also lays down guidelines for
the treatment of prepayment. Coverage of intermediary banks under FERIS has
been extended to include, in addi.ion to TSKB and SYKB, several other
development banks including HEB and DESIYAB. The Government's intention is to
operate FRiIS as a temporary, self-financing and non-discriminatory scheme to
mobilize urivate sector iuvestment. In particular, the Government intends to
discontinue FER1S in its present form as soon as the private investment
climate has revived, and to manage the scheme on a self-financing basis, i.e.
without any subsidy from the budget. It is also the Government's intention to



- 15 -
set FERIS interest rates so as to be positive over the life of the sub-loans,
and in line with interest rates for similar maturities under the Central
Bank's rediscount facility for industrial lending.
50.      The Government has already taken a number of measures for the
alleviation of the problems and constraints facing the financial sector
(para. 12). The full impact of some of these measures can only be realized
over several years. Additional measures would also be necessary and are under
the Government's consideration. One of the problems, namely the high
intermediation cost of commercial banks and the need for efficiency
improvements, is being addressed under the proposed project through provision
of technical assistance to Halk Bankasi for institutional strengthening.
PAR1 IV - lIE PROJECT
51.      The project was identified by a Bank mission in cooperation with the
Turkish authorities in September 1984. It was appraised in November 1984.
Negotiations were held in Washington in November 1985, with a Turkish
delegation led by Mr. Hikmet Ulugbay, Chief Economic and Commercial Counselor,
Embassy of the Republic of Turkey, and including representatives of SYKB, HB
and SIDO. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Small and Medium Scale Industry
Project" (No. 5526-TU) dated December 11, 1985 is being distributed
separately. A loan and project summary is provided at the beginning of this
report and Annex III contains supplementary project data.
Project Obiectives and Description
52.      The proposed project would assist in the development of efficient
labor-intensive industries, mainly in the SMI category, and thus contribute to
job creation and growth of manufactured exports, both important objectives of
the Government's structural adjustment program being supported by the Bank.
The project would also concurrently assist in developing financial
intermediaries capable of providing term finance and financial services to SMI
in an efficient manner and thus improve SMI's access to term finance.
Finally, the project would help to initiate a national program of technical
assistance to provide a range of technical and management services to SMI in a
cost effective manner. In order to achieve the above objectives, the project
includes (i) credit lines of $8U million and $18.4 million for Sinai Yatirim
ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB) and Halk Bankasi (HB) respectively; and (ii) technical
assistance of $1.25 million for a program of technical assistance to SMI, to
be implemented by the Small Industry Development Organization (SIDO), and
$35U,000 for the institutional strengthening of RB.
Financial Intermediaries
(i) Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB)
53.      The Institution.  SYKB was established in 1963 by five major
commercial banks in Turkey, to meet the investment financing needs of the
private industrial sector. Its paid-in capital is TL2 billion of which
60 percent is owned by Is Bank - the largest bank in Turkey. Its management
and staff are competent and adequate in numbers. SYKB's appraisal procedures
are satisfactory but there is scope for further strengthening of project
supervision; SYKB has confirmed measures to achieve this.



- 16 -
54.      Operations and Financial Position.  Total loan approvals of SYKB have
increased from TL2,765 million for 29 projects in 1980 to TL16,783 million for
83 projects in 1984, i.e. an increase of 57 percent p.a. in nominal terms and
14 percent p.a. in real terms. Local currency loan approvals were 33 percent
of total loans during the 1980-1984 period. Foreign currency loans increased
from $17.4 million (13 in number) in 1980 to $22.0 million (46 in number) in
1982 but declined to $18.1 million (41 in number) in 1983 due to the
reluctance of sub-borrowers to accept the foreign exchange risk. Foreign
currency loan approvals, however, increased to $37.7 million (66 in number) in
1984 with the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme
(FERIS) (para. 49). SYKB has generally firtanced labor-intensive projects
which have obtained Certificates of Encouragement from the Government. It is
estimated that about 26,000 direct jobs would be created by projects which
received loans from SYKB for fixed investment during 1980-84.
55.      SYKB's net income as a percentage of equity has increased from
22 percent in 1980 to 32 percent in 1984. Hcwever, the returns to
shareholders in nominal terms on their capital are still low compared to
interest rates on term deposits or other financial instruments in Turkey.
SYKB's administrative expenses in relation to total assets have remained at
around 2 percent which is satisfactory. The long-term debt/equity ratio has
gone up from 4.2:1 at the end of 1980 to 8.6:1 at the end of 1984, which is
within the maximum limit of 9:1 agreed with the Bank under the Labor Intensive
Industry Project. At the end of 1984, the current ratio was 1.9:1 indicating
a satisfactory liquidity position. SYKB's arrears and loans affected by
arrears of more than three months were 2.5 percent and 14.7 percent
respectively of the total loan portfolio on December 31, 1984 and were
reasonable. SYKB's fInancial statements have been audited by independent
auditors who have given unqualified audit reports.
56.      According to SYXB's financial projections, its return on equity would
increase to 45 percent in 1988. Its liquidity and long-term financial
position would also continue to be satisfactory.
57.      Bank-financed Operations.  SYKB has so far received two loans of
$15 million (Loan 1755-TU) and $40 million (Loan 1952-TU) from the Bank in
support of the development of the textile industry and labor-intensive
industries respectively.  The two loans were almost fully coumitted by the end
of 1984. Under the Labor-Intensive Industry Project, SYKB had approved
112 sub-projects for a total amount of $39.5 million up to December 31, 1984.
About 38 percent of the loan amount was approved for SSI sub-projects against
the original target of 33 percent. Sub-projects financed under the loan would
create about 8,600 jobs at an average cost of $8,700 each. SYKB's performance
in utilizing the loan, as reflected by the good quality of sub-project
appraisals, the financing of a large number of SSI sub-projects, and the low
cost per job, has been very satisfactory.
(ii) Halk Bankasi (KB)
58.      The Institution.  Halk Bankasi was established in 1938 as a State
Economic Enterprise (SEE) with the basic purpose of contributing to the
mobilization of savings and providing working capital and investment loans to
traders, artisans and small and mediumrscale industries. It is the only bank
specializing in the latter activity at present. The Treasury is the main
shareholder of HB and holds 95 percent of HB's paid-in capital of



- 17 -
TL11.5 billion ($26.4 million as of December 1984). IB operates from its head
office in Ankara and regional offices in Istanbul and Izmir as well as its 598
branches and 9 foreign currency bureaus throughout Turkey. Its management and
senior staff have generally long banking experience. It has recently received
technical assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany for support to its
lending to selected subsectors in SSI.
59.      Halk Bankasi has agreed to strengthen its staffing and to adopt
appropriate policies and procedures to improve its project appraisal and
supervision. In addition, RB has agreed to undertake an in-depth review of
its overall institutional structure with the help of independent consultants
for the purpose of long-term institutional strengthening and improvements in
efficiency. Under the proposed project, the Bank would provide $350,000 to RB
for the above-mentioned study of its institutional structure and for staff
training, in addition to $18.4 million for onlending to SSI as a pilot
project. This pilot project should lay the basis for further Bank assistance
to SSI through HB.
60.      Operations and Financial Position.  Over the period 1981-1984, HB's
total lending increased by 1.5 percent p.a. in real terms and amounted to
TL207 billion ($475 million) at the end of 1984.  HB's Industrial Credit
Department, which has the overall responsibility for loans to SMI for working
capital and investment purposes, accounted for 25 percent of the total
portfolio of HB as of December 31, 1984. HB's industrial credit portfolio
(including both short and long-term loans) increased by 1 percent p.a. in real
terms during 1981-84 and amounted to TL48 billion ($110 million) at the end of
1984. Working capital loans were about 70 percent of total loans made in
1984, the balance of 30 percent being for fixed investment.
61.      HB's net profit as a percentage of equity was 19 percent in 1982,
12 percent in 1983 and 25 percent in 1984. HB's administrative expenses as a
share of total assets between 1981-1984 were 3-4 percent and its interest
spread was 6-9 percent, both on the high side. At the end of 1984, HB's total
debt/equity ratio stood at 12:1, which is low for a commercial bank and well
within the limit of 20:1 required by the Central Bank for all commercial
banks. HB follows sound liquidity policies. Total arrears for all credits of
HB at the end of 1984 were TL8.1 billion ($18.6 million) or about 4 percent of
the loan portfolio, which is on the low side. HB's financial projections show
that its return on equity would be about 18 percent in the next four years and
that it would maintain a satisfactory liquidity and long-term financial
position.
62.      EB's financial statements are audited by the Supreme Board of
Auditors of the Prime Ministry. The audit is carried out in accordance with
the Government's requirements for state enterprises and is considered
acceptable by the Bank. HB's accounts have been found satisfactory by the
auditors.
Technical Assistance Program for SMI
63.      The technical assistance needs of SMI in Turkey are relatively
sophisticated and include access to improved product designs, production
technology, management methods and marketing skills, particularly for
competing in export markets. There is also a need to develop inter-firm
linkages between SMI and larger firms to allow SRI access to national and
international markets.



- 18 -
64.      Until now, SMIs have had very limited access to institutional sources
of technical assistance because these institutions were not geared towards
serving the needs of smaller firms. In 1970, with the support of UNDP/UNIDO,
the Government established the Small Industry Development Organization (SIDO)
with a pilot project in Gaziantep in Eastern Turkey to assist small
enterprises, especially metal working industries, located nearby. The pilot
project has not been successful primarily because of the incompatibility of
its relatively complex machinery and technology with the needs of most of the
small enterprises in the area for relatively simple knowhow and the lack of an
effective extension service to cater to the needs of SMI.
65.      In June 1983, the Government decided to restructure SIDO. It
transformed SIDOU into a semi-autonomous body of the Ministry of Industry and
Trade (MOLT) with the mandate to provide technical assistance to SMI on a
nationwide basis. At the same time, UNDP approved a three-year project at an
estimated cost of $912,000 to assist SIDO in establishing a demonstration
center and common facilities for small foundries in Ankara.
66.      In the light of its experience with the Gaziantep pilot project,
SIDO's management has adopted a new strategy to assist SMI. The new strategy
calls for SIDO to build up a decentralized network of branch offices staffed
with multidisciplinary extension teams. Each branch office would promote
technical assistance by visiting and undertaking diagnostic surveys of SMI
firms to assess their problems and needs and refer firms needing specialized
assistance to appropriate experts or institutions capable of providing such
services. Thus SIDO would be a catalyst in mobilizing existing sources of
technical, marketing, training and management expertise to assist SMI, rather
than attempting exclusively on its own to service all the diverse technical
assistance needs of SHI.
67.      SIDO currently employs a total staff of 72, of which 66 are at
Gaziantep and the remaining 6 are at Ankara headquarters. SIDO's present
management has considerable experience in small industry development. SIDO's
operations are reviewed by a governing body chaired by the Deputy
Under-Secretary of MOIT and including a representative of Halk Bankasi.
However, SIDO's organization and staffing need substantial strengthening to
implement its new development strategy.
68.      The proposed project component would provide assistance to SIDO over
a three-year period to initiate the development of-Wi) an effective
decentralized organization structure with stronger management and staff
capabilities; (ii) an effective extension service; (iii) a computerized
information system to (a) monitor and manage the decentralized technical
extension program and (b) meet the information needs of SMI and promote
inter-firm production and marketing linkages; and (iv) a program that would
help SMI to utilize the services of specialized consultants from the private
and public sectors. It has been agreed that the impact of SIDO's new
development strategy as well as the range and cost-effectiveness of its
overall activities, including the role of two demonstration centers at
Gaziantep and Ankara, would be reviewed by the Government with SIDO in
mid-1987 and end-1988 and its findings and conclusions will be discussed with
the Bank, with the object of adjusting the strategy and activities of SIDO, if
necessary.



- 19 -
69.      The proposed work program would be a substantial addition to SIDO's
existing activities. In order to ensure that the technical assistance
component of the project is adequately implemented, a supplementary project
monitoring procedure would be instituted in addition to normal project
supervision.
Main Features of the Loan
70.      The proposed Bank loan of $100 million would be made to the Republic
of Turkey, which would cnlend *80 million to SYKB and $18.4 million to HB for
relendiLg to SMI.  The Government would also onlend the technical assistance
component of $35U,000 to HB and allocate the technical assistance funds of
$1.25 miil.on to SIDO.  The definition of SSI, SMI, and the cost per job
criteria for assistance by SYKB and HB would be the same in real terms as
under the Labor-Intensive Industry Project. Thus, SSI sub-projects would
include new projects with a maximum investment limit, excluding land and
buildings, of $500,000 and expansion projects with a limit of $650,000 1/.
For mediumrscale industry projects, the respective maximum investment lLmits
would be $2.5 million and $3.5 million for new and expansion projects. SYKB
has agreed that at least 80 percent of its portion of the loan proceeds would
be reserved for financing SMI projects and, within this limit, at least
30 percent of the loan would be onlent to SSI. All eligible sub-projects
would have a maximum average capital investment (excluding land and buildings)
of $18,000 per job. A small number of non-SNi projects which satisfy the cost
per job criteria and are considered export-oriented based on Certificates of
Encouragement would also be eligible for financing under the loan. Experience
has shown that such sub-projects could be somewhat bigger than typical SMI
sub-projects because of the need to achieve economies of scale. As a
consequence of SYKB's policy guidelines, the sub-project and sub-loan sizes
for these larger sub-projects are expected to be in the range of $4-5 million
and $2-2.5 million respectively.   The amount onlent to HB ($18.4 million)
would be used by RB for financing labor-intensive sub-projects in the SSI
category only. Furthermore, within the SSI category, HB has agreed to
concentrate its assistance on very small enterprises and, thus, use at least
70 percent of its share of the Bank loan for assistance to sub-projects with
total fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, not exceeding t20O,000. It
is anticipated that most of the sub-projects to be financed under the loan
would be for the manufacture of food products, ready-made garments, furniture,
leather products, and metal works and engineering.
71.      SYKB has undertaken to calculate economic and financial rates of
return for all sub-projects receiving term financing and having total
i7vestment in fixed assets exceeding $750,000 equivalent. Eligible
sub-projects would have a minimun economic rate of return of 12 percent and a
minimum financial rate of return which would be not less than the Central
Bank's prevailing rediscount rate for loans for industrial investments.
72.      The Borrower wou'd repay the loan to the Bank over a fixed period of
15 years including a grace period of 3 years. SYKB and HB would make
sub-loans normally of 8-10 years but in no case would final repayment be
beyond the final repayment date of the Bank loan. They would repay the loans
to the Government on a schedule commensurate with the aggregate amortization
schedule or indiviYC-&- 3ub-loans.  HB would repay the technical assistance
,&'     All 'Limits iL this paragraph are expressed in end-1984 prices.



- 20 -
component of $350,000 over 15 years. The execution of subsidiary loan
agreements, acceptable to the Bank, between the Government and SYKB and HB,
would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
73.      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent to sub-borrowers either
under FERIS or in foreign exchange with the sub-borrowers bearing the foreign
exchange risk. Under FERIS, the Government would lend Bank funds denominated
in TL to SKEB and HB at a fixed rate equal to the onlending rate to
sub-borrowers minus an intermediation fee of 4 percent. The margin available
to FERIS for coverage of foreign exchange risk would be the difference between
this rate and the interest rate payable on the foreign borrowing.
Alternatively, Bank funds would be lent in foreign exchange to SYKB and HB at
a fixed interest rate equal to the then prevailing Bank rate plus 0.75 percent
to compensate the Government for bearing the risk arising from the variability
of the l3ank's interest rate. The onlending rate to sub-borrowers would be
fixed at 5 percent above the Bank rate.
74.      The free limit for SYKB would be $1.25 million.  It is estimated that
the total number of sub-projects to be financed by SYKB under the proposed
loan would be about 200 of which about 10 percent by number and 35 percent by
amount would be above the free limit and would require the Bank's prior
approval. The free limit for HB has been established at a lower level of
$150,000 because it would be financing small sub-loans and this would be the
first Bank loan to RB. MB has agreed to submit for the Bank's approval the
appraisal reports of the first five sub-projects irrespective of the sub-loan
amount. It has also agreed to make available to the Bank's supervision
missions 10 percent of the sub-projects with loan amounts of
$100,000-4150,000, to be selected by the Bank's staff, for ex-post review. It
is estimated that HB would use the loan proceeds to finance about 500
sub-projects, of which 10 percent by number and 30 percent by amount would be
above the free limit.
75.      It has boan agreed that the long-term debt/equity limit of SYKE would
be increased from the present 9:1 to 10:1 in view of the satisfactory
financial position and quality of loan portfolio of SYKB. HB would continue
to be subject to the total debt/equity limit of 20:1 applicable to comnercial
banks.
Procurement and Disbursements
76.      SYKB and HB would require their sub-borrowers to obtain at least
three quotations from suppliers eligible under the Bank's guidelines, except
that small items costing less than $10,000 and proprietary items may be
purchased by direct contracting. The proceeds of the Bank loan onlent to
industrial enterprises would be used to finance the full foreign exchange
costs of directly imported machinery and equipment, and the initial stock of
imported raw materials and spare parts. Bank funds would also be used to
finance 70 percent of the cost of imported machinery and equipment procured
off-the-shelf in the domestic market, and 50 percent of the cost of
domestically produced machinery and equipment, net of taxes, reflecting the
imputed import content of such items. As regards SIDO, bid packages valued at
below $250,000 would be procured through international shopping by comparing
price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers. Items estimated to
cost $250,000 or more would be procured according to the Bank's ICB
procedures. Consultant selection by SIDO and RB would follow Bank guidelines.



- 21 -
77.      Disbursement of funds would be made against standard documentation
and statements of expenditure. In order to ensure that Turkey would have
ready access to foreign exchange, it has been agreed that a Special Account
would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey to which the World Bank
would make an initial deposit of $6 million. The Special Account would be
replenished periodically against withdrawal applications. On the basis of
previous experience with comparable loans in the region, the disbursement
period of the proposed loan is expected to be about six years.
Status of Project Preparation
78.      Both SYKB and RB have a well-developed project pipeline and sub-loan
commitments are expected to commence immediately upon loan effectiveness. The
terms of reference of the study for the institutional strengthening of HB have
been agreed and the selection of consultants is expected to be completed by
June 3U, 1986. SIDO has already got core staff in position and does not
foresee any difficulty in the recruitment of additional staff to implement the
technical assistance program for SMI. The terms of reference for the advisors
to be employed by SIDO under the project have been agreed, together with a
timetable for their selection.
Reports and Audit
79.      SYKB would submit periodic reports to the Bank, which would include a
slunary of operations, progress on utilization of the loan, and annual
accounts and audit reports. Similar reports would also be submitted by RB.
SIDO would submit quarterly reports on progress in implementation of various
components of the TA program for SMI.  SYKB, HB and SIDO would also submit
their audited accounts and a project completion report.
Project Benefits and Risks
80.      The project would support the development of labor-intensive SMI in
subsectors in which Turkey has a comparative advantage. This would, in turn,
create productive jobs at relatively low cost and contribute to exports of
manufactured goods. Although the maximum limit for the cost per job
(excluding land and buildings) is $18,000, it is estimated, based on the
experience under the Labor-Intensive Industry Project, that the average cost
would be about $10,000 as compared to the average of $120,000 in the
manufacturing sector as a whole. About 18,000 new direct jobs are expected to
be provided by sub-projects to be financed under the project. The project
would also use, for the first time, HB as a financial intermediary. As a
result, investment funds would become accessible to SSI and artisans located
outside the main urban centres. This would contribute to balanced industrial
development at the regional level. The project would also assist in overall
institutional strengthening and efficiency improvement in HB through technical
assistance. This can lead to a much bigger role for RB in future assistance
to SSI. Technical assistance for SMI would be the first major effort in
Turkey to develop institutional capability to provide extension services to
SMI and to facilitate sub-contracting on a national basis.  This would result
in improved productivity and efficiency of SNI and the development of a
much-desired complementary relationship between SSI and larger industries.
Upon the completion of the TA program, SIDO would be able to provide
assistance and guidance to about 350 SMI enterprises, train about 200
entrepreneurs and develop about 900 company profiles per year.



- 22 -
81.      The project risks relate mainly to two areas:  meeting of investment
targets by the intermediary banks and implementation of technical assistance
by SIDO. The private sector investment situation has been uncertain in Turkey
in the recent past and any decline in investment would slow down the
utilization of the proposed loan by SYKB and HB. However, the Gove:nmert is
fully committed to the promotion of the private sector. Also, the proposed
loan is expected to meet only a part of demand for funds on SYKB and HU.  It
is therefore unlikely that SYKB and 1B would experience significant delays in
the utilization of the proposed loan. As regards SIDO, it has been operating
in only two areas of Turkey with a relatively small staff who have generally
limited practical experience. Also, the equipment and information resources
at SIDO are inadequate. These factors introduce an element of risk in the
proposed technical assistance component of the loan which calls for a
substantial increase in staff and may strain the management resources of
SIDO. However, the program has been so designed as to minimize the risks. In
addition, Bank staff would closely monitor the implementation of technical
assistance and SIDO's activities. The risks are therefore considered
reasonable and acceptable, considering the potential benefits of the project.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
82.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with t-. Arti:les
of Agreement of the Bank and I recomnend that the Executive Directors spprove
the proposed loan.
