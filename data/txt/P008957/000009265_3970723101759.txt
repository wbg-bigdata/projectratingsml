SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY (SMI) PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Republic of Turkey.
Beneficiaries:           Sanai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankaei (SYKB)
Halk Bankasi (HB)
Amount:                  US$100 million.
Terms:                   15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Relending terms:         The Government will onlend US$98.4 million to the two
financial intermediaries, viz. SYKB and HB, for
relending to eligible sub-borrowers in the industrial
sector and US$0.35 million to HB as technical
assistance. In addition, the Government will transfer
USi1.25 million equivalent to SIDO for technical
assistance to SMI enterprises. Sub-borrowers will be
able to borrow either in local currency at the
intereo. rate established under the Foreign Exchange
Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) or in foreign exchange.
Under FERIS, the Government will lend Bank funds
denominated in TL to SYKB and HB at a fixed rate equal
to the onlending rate to sub-borrowers minus
intermediation cost (4%). Alternatively, Bank funds
would be lent in foreign exchange to SYKB and HB at a
fixed interest equal to the then prevailing Bank rate
plus 0.75% to compensate the Government for bearing
the interest risk arising from the variability of the
Bank's interest rate. The onlending rate to
sub-borrowers will be fixed at 5% above the Bank rate
prevailing at the time of subloan approval. The
repayment of the loans by SYKB and HB to the
Government will conform substantially to the aggregate
of the amortization schedules of individual subloans,
except for the technical assistance amount of US$0.35
million to be repaid by HB over 15 years including 3
years of grace.
Project description:    The project is designed to support a program for the
development of labor-intensive SMI through lines of
credit to SYKB (US$80 million) and HB (US$18.4
million) and technical assistance for the
institutional strengthening and efficiency improvement
of HB (US$0.35 million) and technical assistance to



- ii -
SMI enterprises (US$1.25 million) through SIDO. It
would (i) provide a part of the foreign exchange
requirements of SYKB and HB over 1986-88 for onlending
to SMI, with special emphasis on small scale
industries (SSI); and (ii) finance a program of
technical assistance to SMI.
Benefits and risks:      The project would support the development of labor-
intensive SMI projects in industries where Turkey has
a comparative advantage and thus contribute to both
job creation and growth of manufactured exports. The
project is estimated to create about 18,000 direct
jobs. The project would also provide technical
assistance to SMI resulting in their increased
productivity and efficiency. In addition, the project
would help strengthen the institutional structure for
financial assistance to SMI. The project risks mainly
relate to the overall investment situation in the
private industrial sector and the timely utilization
of the proposed loan by the iutermediary banks.
Substantial delays in loan utilization are, however,
unlikely in view of the measures taken by the
Government to stimulate the growth of private sector.
Free limit:             US$1.25 million for SYKB and US$150,000 for HEB.  In
addition, HB will submit the first five sub-loans for
the Bank's approval irrespective of the sub-loan
amount.
Final date for sub-
project submission:   June 30, 1988.
Procurement:             SMIs to procure through international and local
shopping procedures which require comparison of offers
from at least three suppliers. However, small items
costing less than US$10,000 and proprietary items may
be purchased by direct contracting.

SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY (SMI) PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed project addresses two critical issues now facing the
Turkish economy-high urban unemployment and the problem of sustaining high
growth rates of manufactured exports. Turkey's rapidly growing unemployment
(up from 1.67 million in 1979 to about 3.06 million in 1984) has become a
major social issue. The limited possibilities for job creation in agriculture
and the growth of non-productive marginal jobs in the services sector make the
unemployment issue a particularly complex one to tackle. It is clear that the
industrial sector will need to play a much bigger role in productive job
creation in future. An effective approach to urban job creation (as
illustrated in the labor-intensive industry project--Loan 1952-TU) is to
foster development of labor intensive enterprises in industries where Turkey
has comparative advantage. This approach has proved successful in terms of
generating productive employment at a low investment cost.
1.02     However, the development of small and medium scale industrial
enterprises'' (SMI) as a group is being inhibited by a variety of internal
and external constraints which need to be specifically addressed if this group
is to develop efficiently and make an effective contribution to export and
employment growth. Until recently, the Government's export promotion policy
discriminated against smaller exporters. Because of depressed domestic
demand, this policy adversely affected their growth. Lack of access to
institutional finance, particularly for financing machinery, plant and
adequate working capital has been another serious problem. The Halk Bank
(HB), the only source of finance for artisanal enterprises, is constrained by
limited resources and inadequate management systems and procedures for
development lending. Commercial banks generally are averse to financing SMI
partly as a result of perceived higher risk, the higher unit costs of smaller
loans and a preference for assisting clients with whom they have a
longstanding banking relationship in a period of credit scarcity. Yet another
constraint is SMI's limited access to technical assistance. Specialized
advice needed to resolve technical, management, marketing problems, etc. is
out of reach for SMI, both because of lack of information on availability of
such services and the high costs involved. Government operated institutions,
so far, have not been effective in assisting small firms due to lack of
qualified extension personnel, unclear objectives, and low credibility.
1.03     Since 1980, the Government has enacted a number of policy reforms to
open up the economy to market forces as well as bring about structural
adjustment. Some of these reforms have benefited SMI, e.g. adoption of a
crawling peg exchange rate policy instead of specific export subsidies to
promote exports. Reform of the financial sector and trade liberalization will
undoubtedly help create a favorable environment for SMI development, but
specific intervention is still needed to remove particular bottlenecks in
access to finance, technology, and skilled workers to promote sustained
development of SMI. The proposed project builds on the successful outcome of
1/ See para. 2.06 for the definition of SMI.



the Bank's first project aimed at assisting labor intensive SMI (Loan
1952-TU). It gives special emphasis to the development of artisanal and SSI
enterprises as well as to the institution building of HB so that HB becomes
capable of efficiently providing investment finance and other financial
services to these firms. The project will also assist the Small Industries
Development Organization (SIDO) to initiate the establishment of a nationwide
network of branches to provide technical assistance to SMI as well as to start
a program that would help SMI utilize the services of specialized consultants
from both the private and public sectors.
II. HAIUFACTURING SECTOR
A. Government Policies in the Industrial Sector
2.01     Industrialization in Turkey has been viewed as an instrument for
achieving faster economic growth, greater self-sufficiency, and reduced
inter-regional disparities. Until recently, the main thrust of industrial
development strategy had been capital-intensive import substitution in basic
industries. The principal policy instruments used were large investment
allocations to State Ecouomic Enterprises (SEEs) accom'enied by centralized
planning and control, and generous incentives combined v'th high levels of
protection for private investments. The vigorous pursuit of these policies
under the first three development plans (1963-1977) resulted in high growth
rates, substantial structural change, and dispersal of industry to less
developed regions. On the other hand, the same policies gave rise to
industrial inefficiency, extreme anti-trade bias and excessive capital
intensity in production.  The emphasis on costly import-substitutio., as well
as several other factors, including shortcomings in the S. & D effort and
inadequacies in labor training, contributed to the decline in the productivity
of investment.  The countrv's latent export capacity could nat offset the
changes in the international environment in the aftermath of the 1973-74 oil
crisis, leading to a major crisis in the balance of payments in 1977-79.
2.02     In January 1980, in response to the crisis, the Government adopted a
new economic development strategy characterized by an outward orientation of
the economy and an increased role to market forces with greater emphasis on
the private sector to stimulate growth, employment and exports. Major policy
reforms have been enacted since then in the areas of exchange rate (large
devaluation followed by a crawling-peg policy); export incentives (subsidized
credits, free access to imported inputs, indirect tax rebates); domestic
resource mobilization (deregulation of interest rates, tax reforms, capital
market legislation); pricing policy (freeing most SEEs to set their own
prices); import liberalization (shifting a large number of items to more
liberalized treatment); public sector investment (rationalization and removal
of a number of economically unviable projects from public sector investment);
private direct foreign investment (centralization of responsibility and
simplification of rules and regulations), etc. A number of these reforms are
far reaching and it may be several years before their full impact is felt.
2.03     The policy reforms designed to stabilize the economy and bring about
structural changes produced a decline in inflation (from 100X in 1980 to below
30X in 1982). The recent resurgence of inflation (estimated at more than 50%



- 3 -
in 1984), is partly attributable to SEE price increases and to the impact of
the export drive on domestic food prices. Government is attempting to bring
the situation under control in the context of a tighter program in place for
the second half of the IMF standby. The reforms.have also led to a dramatic
expansion in the value of merchandise exports (from US$2.9 billion in 1980 to
an estimated US$7.2 billion for 1984) despite the recession which prevailed
abroad during most of this period. Industrial value added also increased by
28S during the same period.  However, many private sector industrial firms
including many SMI are in serious financial difficulties because of the
erosion of their equity base and very high real interest rates for working
capital loans. Complex financial sector issues are at the root of these
problems and are being addressed with Bank assistance (see paras. 3.12-3.20).
B. Trends in Labor Force and Employment
2.04     Turkey's total population, estimated at 47.4 million in 1984, has
been growing at an average annual rate of 2.42 in the past decade. Although
the total working age group increased at about the same annual rate, the labor
force grew at only about 1.6X per annum between 1968-77, reflecting declining
labor force participation. Total civilian employment increased even slower,
at slightly above li, resulting in increasing unemployment which totalled 2.1
million in 1977 or 12.82 of the labor force. Between 1977 and 1983, in spite
of the large increase in out-migration to Saudi Arabia, Libya and Iraq, the
unemployment situation worsened primarIly because of the higher growth rate of
the labor force (1.9%) compared to a marginal increase in the number of jobs
created (450,000). As a result, by 1983 total unemployment increased to 3.56
million or about 192 of the labor force. Most of the unemployed (2.9 million)
are located in urban areas and 97% are barely literate or with primary or
middle school education. The industrial sector's track record in job creation
has been inadequate;  between 1978 and 1982, industrial employment increased
from 1.826 million to 1.R93 million or only by 67,000 workers. Although firm
data are lacking, it is likely that most of the jobs created have been
generated by organized sector manufacturing establishments engaged in export
production which have had high capacity utilization ratios (see para. 2.06).
C. Structural Characteristics and Performance
2.05     The manufacturing sector4' is the leading sector of the Turkish
economy and, in 1984, accounted for 252 of GDP (higher than agriculture whose
share was about 18S of GDP), 23Z of fixed investment, 11X of employment and
642 of total merchandise exports. State economic enterprises (SEEs) occupy a
prominent role in manufacturing even though their importance has diminished
over the last few years because of deliberate government initiatives to limit
their growth. Manufacturing SEEs accounted for some 30S of manufacturing
value added, 352 of manufacturing employment (268,000 workers) and about 602
of manufacturing investment in 1984. About 20 SEEs operate some 440 plants in
practically all branches of manufacturing; the major concentrations are in
food, tobacco, textiles, chemicals, paper and basic metals. Most SSEs are
large capital-intensive operations and suffer from significant overstaffing.
1/ The industrial sector includes manufacturing, mining and energy;
manufacturing accounts for about 801 of industrial value added.



- 4 -
The private sector whose share of manufacturing employment and value added is
approximately twice that of the public sector, Is particularly strong in
textiles and garments, food, beverages, engineering products, furniture,
plastics, and ceramics.
(i) The Private Sector and the Role of Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI)
2.06     In 1978, the organized private sector (comprising establishments
employing 10 or more workers) included some 8600 establishments employing
520,200 workers. Small-scale establishments-' (employing 10-49 workers) and
medium-scale establishments (employing 50-199 workers) accounted for some 5867
establishments and employed 235,000 workers. Thus small and medium scale
establishments (SMI) accounted for 68Z of establishments and 451 of workers in
the organized private sector. SMI firms have the highest share of total
employment r.nd value added in the manufacture of furniture and wood products;
other impor..ant sub-sectors of SMI activity are engineering, chemicals,
non-metallic products and paper products in that order. Although recent data
on SMI are not available, tha relative importance of SMI in these sub-sectors
does not appear to have changed appreciably over the past five years. In some
sub-sectors-engineering, garments, and food industries--SMI have increased
their shares of empInymont pnd output because of higher capacity utilization
rates due to improved expor: performance (para. 2.07).
2.07     Between 1970-77, SMI as a-group showed strong growth relative to
larger firms and increased their share of total manufacturing employment
(including SEEs) from 31S to 35S. Although comparable data by firm size are
not available for 1978-82, some 2,300 new firms were established in the
organized private manufacturing sector in this period and some 58,500 jobs
were created.1l  Analysis of the number of new firms and additional
employment generated by sub-sector (see Table 2.1) indicate that most of the
new firms and new jobs created belong to the SKI category.
(ii) Artisanal Enterprises
2.08     In the non-organized sector, artisanal establishments (employing 1-9
workers) comprised some 177,000 establishments employing 455,000 workers and
1/ There is no single official definition of SSI in Turkey. The State
Institute of Statistics uses the number of workers employed to clatsify
firms into the non-organized (employing less than 10 workers) or organized
(employing 1O or more workers) categories. The Small Industry Develdpment
Organization defines SSI as firms employing up to 50 workers. The Halk
Bank (HB) defines SSI as firms with less than 25 workers and less than TL
80 million assets (excluding land and building). Medium scale firms (MSI)
are defined by BB as firms with assets (excluding land and buildings)
between TL 80 million and TL 300 million (US$190,000-US$700,000). The
Bank-financed project (Loan 1952-TU) defined SSI as firms with fixed
assets (excluding land and building) valued at less than US$500,000 in
1984 prices; the corresponding limit for SMI is US$2.5 million in 1984
prices. These limits will be maintained in the proposed project.
2/ Only a part of the additional employment is due to the new firms.

accounted for about 201 of manufacturing value added. Major concentrations of
artisanal firms occur in garments and leather (281)" metals and engineering
(262), wood products (18Z), food products (81) and chemicals (61). The
artisanal sector grew slowly in the decade 1970-8Q; the number of
establishments increased by less than 21. The number of firms in metals,
engineering, chemicals, plastics and wood products shoved substantial
increases, but these were offset by losses in the more traditional sectors of
textiles, garments, leather products and food industries. The major problem
of the artisanal sector is one of overcrowding; this is particulary apparent
in the sub-sectors of textiles, garments, leather products, wood products and
in fabricated metal products. Many artisans are severely under-employed and
continue in these non-produ' tive jobs because of the lack of alternative
employment opportunities in organized manufacturing.
(iii) Sub-sectoral Structure
2.09     The manufacturing sector is fairly broad-based; only food processing,
petroleum products, textiles, and iron and steel each account for more than 51
of production value. Food processing is clearly Turkey's most important
manufacturing sub-sector, accounting for 281 of manufacturing production in
1984. Table 2.2 shows the shares in manufacturing output of consumer goods.
intermediate goods and capital goods (44Z, 411 and 151 respectively), and the
ranking of the three most important sub-sectors in each category.
(iV) Growth:
2.10     Despite the recession which prevailed in Turkey and abroad during
1980-83, manufacturing output grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent per annum
during The Fourth Plan period (1978-83) and in the last two years the growth
rate reached about 9 percent. Some key performance indicators are shown in
Table 2.3.

-7-
The fairly high output growth rate since 1981 was made possible mainly because
capacity utilization rates (CURs) in most industries were low during 1980-83.
Investment rates were thus able to remain low, particularly in the private
sector, even though the export drive required, and obtained, substantial
increases in output.  Industries with high output growth rates'-  include
agricultural machinery (14.8%) iron and steel (9.1%), petroleum products
(8.71), non-electrical machinery (8.1%), metal goods (6.8%), clothing (6.1%),
and rubber products (11.5X).
(v) Export Performance
2.11     During 1978-83, 291 of the total increase in manufacturing output
went into exports i.e. a marginal export/output ratio of 291 compared to only
about 71 between 1973-77. The table 2.4 below analyzes the strong export
performance of the manufacturing sector relative to other sectors as well as
the performance of different product groups. Five industries (ready made
clothing, foodstuffs, textiles, iron and steel and petroleum products)
contributed to 751 of the increase in manufactured exports; five others
(fertilizers, measuring instruments, furniture, shoes and agricultural
machinery) were the fastest growing exporting industries;together, these ten
industries were responsible for about 80% of the increase in manufacturing
exports. A noteworthy feature of this export performance is the appearance of
new industries in the list of major exporters (iron and steel and petroleum
products) and fastest growing exporters (fertilizers, instruments, -
agricultural machinery). The other noteworthy feature is the penetration of
new markets in Middle Eastern countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Algeria)
particularly for foodstuff, iron and steel products and non-electrical
machinery.

The table indicates that real investment in 1983 was only 65Z of the 1977
level; also the balance between the public and private sectors, which was in
favo-z of the latter before 1979, shifted thereafter strongly in favor of the
public sector. However, in the past couple of years, the Government has been
trying to restore the balance as part of the structural adjustment strategy by
cutting back on public investment. Private investment activity has been very
depressed, because of low capacity utilization and high non-preferential
interest rates. Borrowing in foreign currency for investment-purposes has
been particularly adversely affected because of the high devaluation of the
TL. The Government introduced a Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (para.
3.10) (FERIS) in 1984 to cover borrowers of foreign currency against exchange
risks which significantly helped to stimulate iwnestment borrowing. It is
likely that the Government wi'll continue with the scheme as long as inflation
is volatile and the investment climate uncertain.
(vii) Prospects for the Manufacturing Sector
2.13     The Bank undertook a detailed review of the Government's Fifth
Five-Year Plan (1984-89), approved by the National Assembly in July 1984
(Report No. 5418-TU). The Plan envisages that the industrial sector will
continue its lead role in the economy with its share of value-added GDP
increasing from 32Z in 1984 to 341 in 1989 at an annual growth rate of 7.5X.
Manufactured exports are projected to grow at an annual average rate of
10.61. The Plan calls for a larger role for the private sector, principally
by restricting the growth of industrial SEEs.  The private sector's share of
total manufacturing investment (TL 3015 billion in 1983 prices) is projected
at 57X. Private manufacturing investment during the Plan period is projected
to be nearly 41% higher and public manufacturing investment 14Z lower than
their corresponding amounts in the Fourth Plan period. However, given the
high real interest rates on working capital and low CURs in non export
oriented industries, private investment may grow more slowly than projected in
the Plan.
2.14     Based on a review of CUR trends and production targets, the Bank's
review of the Plan concluded that the bulk of Plan manufacturing investment
(74X) should flow to the intermediate goods sector; only 18 and 8 percent
respectively should flow to the consumer and capital goods industries.



Otherwise, supply bottlenecks are most likely to constrain the intermediate
goods sector, which could jeopardize export targets in the consumer and
capital goods industries. An analysis of major and leading (fastest growing)
export sub-sectors indicates that based on CUR trends, existing capacity and
output targets, large investments are needed only in two major export
industries-garments, and iron and steel. If iron and steel is excluded, the
remaining nine major and leading export sub-sectors which are expected to
account for 70% of the increased exports, will require only about 16Z of the
fixed investment in manufacturing projected in the Plan. Thus the export
targets can be attained even under stabilization conditions. Attainment of
the export targets will, however, require continuing real devaluation of the
TL, which in turn will facilitate the scaling down of direct incentives to an
average level of 6Z-81 and redirection of direct incentives to capital goods
industries.
D. Issues and Policies Affecting SMI Development
(i) Issues and Constraints
2.15     SMI generally face a number of internal and external constraints.
Internal problems adversely affecting productivity include outdated machinery,
obsolete and deficient technical and production engineering methods, poor
working conditions, inadequate management, planning and control, and marketing
know-how.I1 External problems tend to compound the internal ones. One
problem is the limited access to institutional finance (para. 3.04)
exacerbated by current stabilization measures and related factors which have
maintained non-preferential working capital interest rates at record levels.
2.16     Another external constraint is the limited availability and high cost
of technical assistance. Many SEEs have special R & D divisions capable of
providing extension. rexvroes (such as Sumerbank's unit in Bursa) with a
mandate to assist private sector including SKI, but in fact have given
services only to their own operations. In the private sector mnny large
enterprises have mechanisms to provide technical assistance such as
production/quality control departments or "in-house" divisions that provide
consulting services. They also benefit from service agreements with licensors
and suppliers of technology and plant machinery. Except for firms acting as
sub-contractors and suppliers to a few of the large machinery manufacturers,
the availability of industrial extension services to SMI is extremely
limited. The available private consulting firms tend to be geared to the
requirements of larger firms and appear extremely costly to SMI. A few public
institutions have been established over the years to provide advice and
information in technical and management fields including the National
Productivity Center (NPC), SEGEM (for training), TUBITAK/TURDOK (technical
research and information services) and specialized sub-sectoral institutes.
The only institution established to assist SSI-the Small Industry Development
Organization (SIDO)-has had very limited impact.
1/ Constraints facing SMI in Turkey are discussed in detail in Turkey:
Prospects for Small-Medium Scale Industry Development and Employment
Creation, World Bank Report No. 2913-TU, 1980, Volume II, pp. 46-50.



- 10 -
2.17      SMI face complex problems in exporting because of lack of market
research and data, inability to tap distribution channels, pricing and costing
problems and inability to adapt products to meet export market requirements.
Export trading companies established in recent years have only partially met
this need in a few sub-sectors (e.g. garments) where strong sub-contracting
relations exist. In view of the lack of management, production and export
marketing services for SMI, it is necessary to complement any program of
financial assistance with appropriate technical assistance in order to bring
about desired modernization and improvements in operating efficiency.
(ii) Government Policies for SMI Development
2.18     Prior to 1980, Government policies which favored large,
capital-intensive, import-substitution projects did not promote the
development of SMI. Following the adoption of an outward-oriented development
strategy, the Government has increasingly recognized the potential of SMI to
contribute to employment creation and export growth. The Fifth Five Year
Development Plan (1985-89) enunciates a strategy and accompanying policy
measures specifically to promote SSI. These include:
(a)   strengthening the Small Industry Development Organization (SIDO) to
develop appropriate strategies, policies and technical extension
activities to assist SMI development;
(b)   enlarging the flow of investment and working capital loans;
Cc)   expanding support for the building of industrial estates for
artisanal firms and providing on-the-job and technical training in
the industrial estates.
2.19     In addition to these direct measures, recent policy reforms have
reduced discrimination in regard to access of SMI to incentives. With regard
to investment incentives, the new regime published in October 1984 has several
improvements. First, for investment of less than TL 600 million (US$1.32
million at end 1984 prices) application procedures have been simplified, with
investing firms required to prepare simplified investment forms rather than
submit detailed feasibility studies. Second, the newly introduced support
premium rate (a one time subsidy on the total project investment) is the same
as for larger investments (7%) except for the projects in the less developed
regions. Third, the required percentage of production to be exported has been
reduced from 25% to 5%-20%, the percentage depending upon location. Fourth,
the new regime also for the first time provides incentives that directly
encourage use of labor: it grants tax exemptions for wages paid to firms in
sectors of special importance and in the least developed regions. Some of the
qualifying sectors--electronics and communications, agriculture and livestock,
production of medica'l equipment, aquatic products, and tourism--are typically
characterized by firms in which labor intensive SMI are important. Finally,
for smaller (less than TL 600 million) investments, the required equity
percentage is lower (40Z) than the normal level (50%).



- 11 -
2.20     The problem of the export rebate system (the most important of the
direct export incentives)"', which also discriminated against smaller
industry by granting high rebates for large volume exporters-' has largely
been removed by the Government's policy set forth in the Fifth Five Year Plan
to reduce this incentive and rely increasingly on the indirect incentives of a
realistic exchange rate. Rebate percentages were reduced to 80% of the
previous level beginning April 1984 and further to 55Z beginning September
1984. With the institution of a system of value added taxation which the
Government has implemented with effect from January 1985, the export rebate
system will be reexamined and possibly further reduced in scope.
E. Bank's Lending and Strategy in the Industrial Sector
(i) Recent Developments
2.21     Between 1978 and 1984 the Bank undertook a number of major economic
and sector studies in support of its Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) as
well as its overall macro economic and sectoral dialogue with the country
(Annex 1 lists the relevant reports). The thrust of the Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) has been directed along several lines-analyses of issues of
comparative advantage, tariff reform, and liberalization of imports in support
of the Government's policy of opening up the economy to market forces;
analysis of the foreign exchange regime and export incentives to ensure
competitiveness of exports; review of the financial sector to identify key
institutional and policy issues in order to assist the Government in policy
reforms, (e.g. introduction of positive deposit rates, reduction of interest
subsidies on selective credits, development of a capital market, elimination
of transaction tax, etc.); review of public sector investment programs to
rationalize and improve the efficiency of public investments; review of the
functioning of SEEs with the view to improving operating efficiency and
resource allocation; and review of the prospects of SMI to ensure appropriate
policies for their development. These studies have provided the technical
underpinnings for the Bank's dialogue with the Government on the content and
pace of the Structural Adjustment Lending effort. Given the continued need
for stabilization of inflation and recognizing the ongoing natue of the
structural adjustment process, particularly at the sectoral level, future ESW
(see para. 2.23) will continue to focus on most of the above-mentioned issues.
2.22     Up to 1980, Bank industrial lending was directed at two broad areas:
(i) towards State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) for improving the resource
allocation process and the technical and management efficiency of SEEs, both
1/ Other direct export incentives were preferential export credits and foreign
exchange allocation with duty-free imports. Export rebates account for
about two-thirds of total subsidy value. Preferential export credits were
discontinued as of January 1, 1985. See Turkey: The Vth Five Year Plan in
the Context of Structural Adjustment: A Review, Report No. 5418-TU of
January 22, 1985, para. 4.47.
2/ Since April 22, 1982 firms have received rebates which increase with the
volume of exports culminating in an additional 10 percentage points for
annual export levels in excess of US$30 million.



- 12 -
directly as well as through the State Investment Bank (DYB); Bank loans have
also attempted to strengthen DYB through improvement of systems and procedures
and training of staff; and (ii) towards the private sector through the
Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB) and The Industrial Investment and
Credit Bank (SYKB) to develop viable import substitution and export
competitive industries as well as to encourage geographical and
entrepreneurial diversification. The loans have also attempted to strengthen
the participating intermediaries and to develop a capital market. Bank
lending, however, had limited success in attaining many of these objectives
e.g. development of a capital market because these projects had little impact
on the larger sector policy issues. Following the economic crisis of the late
1970's, and greater receptivity on the part of the Government to Bank policy
advice, the Bank made five SALs aimed at assisting the Government in
implementing a number of major policy reforms in the industrial and financial
sectors. The last three SALs have included a strong focus on trade policy
issues and have allowed the Bank to engage in a constructive dialogue with the
Government on policy reforms which conventional Bank project lending could not
cover.
(ii) Future Strategy
2.23     The key to future economic growth is continued successful adjustment
to a market economy in which industry, particularly manufacturing, will play a
critical role in sustaining the export effort and creating jobs. The Fifth
Five Year Plan (1985-1989) makes clear that the Government is prepared to
pursue this strategy which will require that industrial and financial sector
policy reforms enunciated since 1980 be supplemented by further reforms
pertaining to SEE efficiency, deepening of capital markets, adoption of
realistic interest rates, restructuring of financial institutions, further
lowering of trade barriers, etc. to fully bring about the changeover to a
market-oriented economy. The Plan states that the private sector is in the
best position to address the two critical problems facing the
economy-sustaining high export growth rates and creating jobs in urban
areas.
2.24     The Bank's medium term ESW and lending strategy is aimed at assisting
the Government in following through with its program of policy reform. With
regard to ESW, the Bank's objectives are twofold: (i) to monitor Turkey's
progress towards the goals of stabilization, restructuring of the economy and
restoration of creditworthiness; and (ii) to provide the macro and broad
sectoral basis for sector and project lending. Following the recent reviews
of the development strategy and of the Public Investment program of the Fifth
Five-Year Plan, four additional studies--on agroindustries, industrial
technology, a review of the telecommunications and electronics industries, and
a review of engineering industries-are proposed to examine the longer term
technological and R & D needs of industry and to analyze their investment and
training requirements to ensure that they attain international competitiveness
and continue to contribute strongly to export growth. This will be followed
by a study of the effect of liberalization on the performance of selected
sub-sectors to assist the Government in formulating a program of structural
rationalization of private industries.
2.25     Industrial lending strategies are aimed at assisting the Government
to implement the program of financial sector reform, to improve the efficiency



- 13 -
of public enterprises and to strengthen the role of the private sector. The
public sector, which comprises nearly 502 of manufacturing sector investments
(para. 2.12), will remain an important area for Bank lending. However, in
light of the Government policy to reduce the role of SEEs in manufacturing,
Bank lending to SEEs will emphasize rehabilitation, improvement in efficiency
and policy reforms (e.g. pricing and rationalization of investment programs)
to be tackled both at the firm and sub-sector level.
2.26     The Bank is supporting the Government's long-term objective of
expanding the role of the private sector, so that it produces and exports more
efficiently as well as generates employment at low cost through the proposed
project, which builds on the first labor intensive industry project (Loan
1952-TU). In this respect, the Bank's strategy will focus on increasing the
quality and quantity of technical assistance to the SMI sector by assisting
SIDO to establish a nationwide network of extension service centers which will
also strengthen the industrial sector as a whole by building up suppliers and
sub-contractors for larger industries. The proposed project will give special
emphasis to the development of artisanal firms by earmarking funds for this
group to be onlent by Halk Bankasi. Halk Bankasi itself will be strengthened
so that it will develop a capability to provide medium and long term
investment loans to SMI in an efficient manner.

commercial banks and 15 banks (including the Central Bank, Agricultural Credit
Bank (TCZB) and Halk Bank (HB)) established under special laws. There were
also two privately-owned development banks (TSKB and SYKB), and 13 foreign
banks. The total number of banks' branch offices was 6,221. The banking
sector is highly concentrated; TCZB and the three leading commercial banks (Is
Bank, Yapi-Kredi Bank, and Akbank) together accounting for more than 50Z of
the total assets of the banking sector (TL 12,964 billion at the end of 1984).
3.02     The size of the financial system and trends in its growth are
summarized in Table 3.1. In nominal terms, the financial system in Turkey has
been increasing rapidly but this growth reflects the high rates of inflation.
In real terms (1975 prices), M2 was equivalent to only TL 170 billion in 1984
(average grovth of 3.2Z per annum) and total credit equivalent to only TL 171
billion (-2.1S per annum). Also, the financial system has remained small in
size in relation to GNP and has fluctuated widely in 1975-84. The increase in
inflation rate from 10 in 1975 to 1071 in 1980 without a corresponding
increase in nominal interest rates made fir-ial assets unattractive leading
to a decrease in the size of the financial system compared to GNP between 1975
and 1980. The subsequent decrease in irflation (3'1 in 1981 and 271 in 1982)
and increase in nominal deposit rates (ranging from 251 for one-month deposits
to 501 for 6-months and longer deposits from January 1. 1982) produced high
real interest rates in 1981-82.
3.03     The Government reduced the interest rates on demand deposits in 1983
in the expectation of further declines in inflation and to alleviate the
financial problems faced by businesses due to very high real interest rates.
However, inflation accelerated considerably during the second-half of 1983
(30.4% for the whole of 1983), resulting in negative real interest rates on
deposits (-51) by the end of 1983. The interest rates were, therefore,
increased again in December 1983 (471 for 6-month and 451 for one-year time
deposits). The Government also decided to maintain positive interest rates on
demand deposits and to adjust these rates every quarter in line with changes
in inflationary expectations and the situation in credit markets. The present
rates (August 1985) for 3-month, 6-month, and one-year deposits are 45Z, 502
and 55Z respectively. The interest rate structure reflects the Government's
expectation of an overall decline in inflation during 1985 which was already
38.9Z for 12 months ending October 31, 1985 as compared to an average of 50.41
for the whole of 1984. The increase in interest rates has brought an upturn
in the relative size of the financial system as seen by a significant increase
in real terms (32% in 1983 and 30% in 1984) in the stock of M2 and in the
ratio of M2 tJ GT (from 151 in 1980 to 231 in 1984).  The ratio of direct
credits from the financial system to GNP, however, did not show an increase in
1980-83 and declined in 1984 mainly due to restrictions on Central Bank
lending and its debt consolidation (para. 3.04).
B. Credit by the Financial System
3.04     The total direct credit extended by the financial system in Turkey
has increased significantly in nominal terms as shown in Table 3.2. In real
terms, there was a decline of 251 in total credit between 1975 and 1980. This
decline was partly related to the increase in reserve requirements imposed in
1977, but it also reflected difficulties in attrecting deposits. During the
same period, the Central Bank's share in total credit increased from 321 to
about 501 mainly due to its financing the increased funding needs of the

and development banks.
public sector. Total credit started picking up in real terms from the second
half of 1980 but had not reached the 1975 level by the end of 1984.  The
growth of credits since 1980 has been to a large extent determined by the
ceilings on the expansion of domestic financial assets of the Central Bank,
which were established in the context of economic stabilization policy
increases agreed with the INF. One of the main functions of these credit
ceilings has been to ration the credit extended by the Central Bank to the
public sector and the amount of preferential credit to the private sector
financed by the Central Bank.  A substantial portion of the decline in Central
Bank credit in 1984 was due to debt consolidation which resulted in the
assumption of debts of certain SEEs and state-owned banks by the Treasury. As
a result, the share of deposit money banks in total credit financing in 1984
increased to the highest level in the last 10 years. The share of Halk
Bankasi, one of the two intermediaries under the proposed Bank loan, was 71 in
the total credit of deposit money banks at the end of 1984. SYKB which is a
development bank and the other intermediary under the proposed loan has
accounted for 61 of the total credit by investment and development banks at
the end of 1984 (para. 3.06).
C. Financing of the Industrial Sector Including SMI
3.05     Nearly 601 of total private fixed investment in the organized
industrial sector is financed by financial institutions. Of this amount,
about 801 is now extended through deposit money banks which are required to
maintain 201 of their deposits in medium and long-term credits, and the
balance from investment and development banks. A substantial portion of
deposit money banks' short term loans to the industrial sector are rolled over
and thus function as medium or long-term credits, but under present conditions
of financial stress faced by enterprises, most is used to finance arrears and
working capital rather than fixed assets. Nearly all of the investment not



- 16 -
financed by intermediaries comes from investing firms' own funds. Bonds,
which comprised about 8Z of manufacturing investment in the mid-70s, presently
represent a negligible proportion of such investment because of the high
interest rates on deposits. Suppliers' credits also play a limited role in
financing because of the private sector's reluctance to bear the foreign
exchange risk (see para. 3.10). Foreign investment is a growing source of
funds, but has not reached more than 1-2% of the total.
3.06     Four banks are classified as investment and development banks.  DYB
(State Investment Bank), which concentrates its activity in financing
investment of SEEs, accounts for about 60% of total assets of this group of
banks and has been a channel for three Bank loans to the public sector. The
other three development banks-TSRB, SYKB (both private sector-owned), and
DESIYAB (government-owned)-serve principally the private sector. Of these,
TSKB, with about two-thirds of the total assets, is the largest. It is
regarded primarily as a source of foreign exchange loans. SYKB formerly
provided mainly medium-term local currency loans, but during the last three
years it has been extending largely medium- and long-term loans in foreign
currency. DESIYAB, the most recently established institution of this group
(1976), channels resources of workers abroad into industrial and other
productive investments in Turkey especially in the less developed regions.
TSKB and SYKB have been recipients of several Bank loans. Total credits of
investment and development banks have decreased in real terms by 33X during
1975-84 and their share in total direct credit by the financial system has
declined from 14X in 1975 to about 10% in 1980-84 (see table 3.2). The
reluctance of investors to borrow in foreign currencies (para. 3.10) and their
lack of access to local currency resources (para. 3.19) are the main reasons
for this situation.
3.07     Halk Bankasi (RB) is the principal source of loans to small
businesses in the unorganized sector through a network of more than 600
regional offices and branches. Its borrowers include small tradesmen and
artisans often organized in cooperatives. Only about 25X of its funtds go to
manufacturing firms, mostly for working capital which is much less than the
potential need. It is proposed as an intermediary under this project in order
to assist the smaller firms (4.22-4.47). For SMI that are too large to
qualify for HB financing (i.e. firms with fixed assets of TL 300 million
excluding land and buildings) sources of funds are very limited. Commercial
banks are reluctant to lend to SMI because of higher administrative costs and
a perceived higher risk. SYKB has been providing funds under the Bank's first
labor intensive industry project for firms at the larger end of the SMI
spectrum and is proposed as one of the intermediaries under the project to
serve that group (paras. 4.01-4.21).
D. Interest Rates and the Cost of Capital
3.08     Prior to mid-1980, all interest rates were regulated by Government.
Though differentiated by activity and maturity, lending rates were
consistently negative in real terms, especially in priority activities and
regions. Since deregulation on July 1, 1980, the banks collectively determine
base lending interest rates. For loans that qualify, their rates are
influenced by the rediscounting policies that are set forth periodically by



- 17 -
the Central Bank which vary with different activities and maturitieo. The
base lending rates are revised periodically by the banks, taking into account
expectations of inflation and market conditions. The costs to the borrowers
also include commission, taxes, and (for all but a few categories of high
priority loans, e.g. agriculture) contributions to a new Resource Utilization
Support Fund, which replaced the Interest Rate Rebate Fund at the end of
1984. The fund is being used to defray investment costs for eligible projects
receiving certificates of encouragement with greatest support for less
developed regions, and for exports based on net foreign exchange revenue
earned.
3.09     For investment loans eligible for Central Bank rediscounting, the
final cost is a blend between the cost of funds eligible for rediscounting
(for which the rediscount proportion ranges from 50% to as high as 90% for the
less developed regions) and the cost of funds from the banks' own sources.
However, the Central Bank's rediscounting facility is not available throughout
a given year, depending on progress made in meetis.g the monetary and credit
ceilings; this results in postponement of investments or, on occasions,
borrowings from banks at their regular rates. During 1984, the effective
interest rate on the rediscounted portions of medium and long-term TL
investment loans for industrial credits to the private sector, after taking
into account various taxes, and charges varied between 26% for loans to the
least developed regions to 38% for other investment loans. The effective cost
of the rediscounted portions during 1984 was negative, since inflation
averaged 50.4%. Medium and long-term loans that do not qualify for
rediscounting and the non-rediscounted portion of loans made from banks' own
sources are much costlier, ranging from an effective cost of 60X to 80%.
Under SAL IV, the Government declared its intention to set interest rates an
preferential credits at least equal to the rate of inflation and minimize the
difference between preferential and non-preferential credits. In pursuit of
this policy, the Central Bank rediscount rates on investment credits were
raised from 19.5-30% to 33% commencing January 1985 and, thus, differences
between preferential and non-preferential categories were also reduced. The
effective blended interest rate of medium and long-term TL investment loans
for industrial credits from the deposit money banks is now estimated at 50-55%
p.a. but the cost of similar funds from the investment banks is 38-41% because
a relatively higher proportion of these loans can be rediscounted. The
availability of local currency term loans from the investment banks is,
however, very limited (para. 3.20). Given the expectation of significantly
lower inflation rates in the future, the blended interest rates are generally
expected to be positive in real terms in 1985 and over the life of loans. For
SSI that qualify to borrow from Halk Bankasi, a range of rates exist depending
upon the source and purpose. For tradesman and artisans who are members of
cooperatives and require loans for working capital, the effective cost through
the Central Bank rediscount facility is 30-32%, whereas the cost of investment
loans for SSI is 43-52%.
3.10     On foreign currency loans until mid-1984, the interest rate was set
by the intermediary's cost (or the weighted average cost) of foreign currency
borrowings plus a spread, which for TSKB and SYKB was set at about 5Z. The
effective interest rate on foreign currency loans was about 14% with the
borrower assuming the full foreign exchange risk. Demand for foreign funds on



- 18 -
this basis has been very limited, however. Firms with loans denominated in
foreign currencies have found that the amount of TL required to repay them has
increased faster than the increase in earnings, due both to depressed domestic
markets and the fact that the TL has had a significant and continuing level of
real devaluation. This problem was particularly acute for new firms under
construction which had not started operations and suffered heavy losses duo to
the foreign exchange risk. Although there are presently no strong reasons to
fear significant losses arising from the foreign exchange risk given the
present exchange rate policies, firms are unwilling to borrow in foreign
currencies under the current relatively d pressed conditions. Furthermore,
with the foreign exchange constraint greatly eased in the last couple of years
with the surge of exports, some firms were able to satisfy their requirements
by obtaining TL loans (which could in some cases be at lower effective
interest rate) and then either purchasing the requisite foreign exchange, or
utilizing the foreign exchange from exports. To encourage greater use of
foreign borrowings, the Government, in July 1984, instituted a foreign
exchange risk insurance scheme (FERIS) applicable to IBRD loans to TSKB and
SYKB in the private manufacturing sector. In this scheme, loans were
denominated in TL at a fixed interest rate (26Z) over an 8-year term with a
spacial fund bearing the foreign exchange risk.  This scheme succeeded in
stimulating investment demand for Bank loans, in part because the effective
costs to borrowers, estimated at 31-332-', was low compared to the
prevailing inflation rate. The question of how to harmonize the costs of
domestic and foreign exchange loans and develop an acceptable long-term scheme
that will stimulate investment without subsidizing it is a major issue of the
financial sector (see paras. 3.12-3.14 below).
E. Financial Sector Issues
3.11     The financial sector issues in Turkey have been a subject of
intensive dialogue between the Bank and the Government for a number of years
and most recently when the Bank report on the policies for the financial
sector in Turkey (Report No. 4459-TU of September 1983) was prepared and
discussed with the Turkish authorities. The major issues identified in that
report are beginning to be effectively addressed by the Government including
some in the context of recent SALs. These issues fall into the following four
categories: (i) structure, costs and foreign exchange risk; (ii) banking
sector efficiency; (iii) development of capital markets; and (iv) local
currency resources of development banks.
(i) Structure, Costs and Foreign Exchange Risk
3.12     There are several problems which are evident from the discussion
above (paras. 3.08-3.10) regarding the structure and cost of capital. These
problems are embodied partly in the system of selective credits which results
in fragmentation of the financial market and in wide differences between the
cost of different types of credits. Other problems stem from significant
increases in inflation without corresponding adjustments in lending rates
1/ The nominal interest rate was fixed at 262. The rate of 31-33X takes into
account the effect of certain additional fees and charges imposed by the
intermediaries (TSKB and SYKB).



- 19 -
which caused some preferential interest rates to be highly negative in real
terms over most of 1983 and 1984 while non-preferential rates were generally
highly positive in real terms following their liberalization. This situation
leads to constraints in the optimum mobilization of domestic savings, and
distortions in allocation of resources; it can also lead to inflationary
pressures to the extent that preferential credits are not financed through
cross-subsidization. The Government's recent 4ctions have brought
improvements in the interest rate structure but further actions need to be
taken to introduce and maintain real positive interest rates on all loans, and
to minimize the gap between the cost of preferential and non-preferential
credits.
3.13     While borrowers of local currency loans were subject to either highly
positive or negative real rates, borrowers of loans in foreign currencies with
exchange risks suffered large losses in recent years due to the major
devaluation of TL. As a result, they became reluctant to borrow foreign
currency loans, particularly those with medium and long-term maturities. In
response, the Government introduced a Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme
(FERIS) in 1984 (para. 3.10) and has decided to continue the scheme for the
time being with a fixed interest rate of 35X and an effective cost of 38-42X
applicable to loans approved during 1985. In addition, it is the Government's
intention to operate the scheme on the basis of the following principles:
i)    FERIS will be managed in order to be self-financing.  To achieve
this, the lending rate to borrowers would be positive in real terms
over the life of the subloans. The rate would be reviewed every six
months and adjusted as necessary. In the case of prepayment of a
loan under FERIS, the borrower will be required to compensate the
scheme for any losses incurred on that loan between the date of
disbursement of the loan proceeds and the prepayment date.
(ii)    The effective cost of funds to borrowers under the Central Bank
Rediscount Rates will be comparable to the cost of funds to borrowers
under FERIS.
(iii)   FERIS will not discriminate between financial institutions covered
under the scheme. Onlending terms and conditions will be applied
equitably to such loans and the financial institutions will be
allowed an appropriate spread.
(iv)    In order to be eligible for financing under FERIS, projects will be
required to have a Certificate of Encouragement which in turn
requires normally a minimum debt/equity limit of 50:50. FERIS will,
therefore, be an instrument for mobilizing private savings.
(v)    Financial intermediaries will continue to offer finance in foreign
currency with the exchange risk to be passed on to sub-borrowers.
3.14     Accordingly, it has been agreed during negotiations that the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan may be onlent to sub-borrowers either under FERIS or
in foreign exchange. Under FERIS, the Government will lend Bank funds



- 20 -
denominated in TL to SYKB and Halk Bankasi at a rate equal to the onlending
rate to sub-borrowers minus a spread of 4X. Alternatively, Bank funds would
be lent in foreiga exchange to SYKB and Halk Bankasi at a fixed interest equal
to the then prevailing Bank rate plus 0.75% to compensate the Government for
bearing the risk arising from the variability of the Bank interest rate.  The
onlending rate to sub-borrowers will be fixed at 5% above the Bank rate
prevailing at the time of subloan approval.  The Government intends to
discontinue FERIS in its present form as soon as the private investment
climate has recovered and inflation has abated.  The Bank plans to discuss the
future of FERIS, together with other specialized credit schemes, with the
Government in the context of the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
(ii) Improving Efficiency of the Banking System
3.15     The bankiLg system, which dominates the financial sector of Turkey,
has been characterized by lack of competition, excessive number of branch
office, widespread interlocking ownership between banks and enterprises, lack
of accounting standards, and lack of effective supervision by the Central Bank
with unsatisfactory procedures for the monitoring of loan portfolios. Though
the costs of intermediation have been dropping (from 11X of total assets in
1980 to 7Z in 1983) they are significaoti.y higher than in in4ustrialized
countries which range from 3% to 4-1/12. These costs have been inflated by
liquidity and reserve requirements of the Central Bank and a tax on inter-bank
transactions which contributed to the absence of an inter-bank money market.
Improied efficiency of the banking system would improve the.cnst and terms of
funds available to SMI. The Banking Law of June 28, 1983 laid the cornerstone
for strengthening the banking system. Covering many of the recommendations of
the Bank's report on the Financial Sector'-', it reduces under-capitalization
of banks by setting a maximnu total debt/equity ratio of 20:1, places limits
on tne real assets and investments of banks, links the establishment of
branches to the level of a bank's equity, and reduces the interlocking
ownership between banks and corporations. It also introduces a deposit
insurance scheme and strengthens the role of the Central Bank in the
supervision of the sector.
3.16     There are two major issues which need to be addressed further.  One
is the intermediation cost which despite recent measures (such as reduction of
a withholding tax) is still excessive. This will require a number of
approaches including tax incentives to reduce operating expenditures, better
enforcement of Central Bank liquidity requirements to encourage use of the
interbank market and further steps to limit banks' equity holding in companies
in order to induce arm's-length relationship with customers, and the
introduction of modern technology to improve accounting and auditing
practices. The other issue is the supervision capability of the Central Bank
which despite the Decree Law on Banking, remains weak. Further progress
requires clearer demarcation of responsibility between the Central Bank and
different departments in the Ministry of Finance for supervision of banks,
improving the monitoring of exposure of banks to major borrowers, and raising
the standards of project appraisal by banks for discounting of loans by the
V/ Bank report 4459-TU, of September 21, 1983.



- 21 -
Central Bank. .ne Bank has begun to address these issues for the overall
banking sector in the context of the discussions of the financial sector
report and to be pursued through the proposed financial sector loan.
3.17     Halk Bankasi which would be an intermediary for the proposed Bank
loan is a specialized commercial bank. It does not have some of the
characteristics of other commercial banks (e.g. interlocking of ownership with
its assisted enterprises, under-capitalization, etc.), and its intermediation
costs have been relatively low at 6-7Z. However, these costs are still high
when compared to international levels. This points out to the need for
greater efficiency in operations particularly with respect to deployment of
staff, size and location of branches, internal operational controls,
computerization of operations, etc. In order to address the above issue, the
proposed project includes technical assistance to identify and introduce
measures to improve operational efficiency (para. 4.16).
(iii) Development of Capital Market
3.18     The development of a larger and more diversified capital market is
needed in Turkey to increase competition with banks, provide savers with a
wider choice of financial instruments, enable companies to restore their
equity to sound levels, and facilitate broader corporate ownership.
Accomplishing this task will require strengthening the institutional
framework, particularly the capability of the Capital Markets Board to
regulate, supervise and develop the market in coordination with the work of
other agencies. Legislation concerning the accounting and auditing profession
is also needed to upgrade disclosure standards and introduce the requirement
of externAl audit of the accounts of firms whose securities are to be offered
to the public. Other areas where progress is needed include: strengthening
securities market intermediaries, promoting institutional investors;
development of the primary market for securities; reducing the restrictions
governing corporate debt issues, stimulating the equity market; and
implementing plans to establish a new stock exchange in order to develop the
secondary market for securities.
3.19     The Bank Group is assisting the Government to bring about these
developments in sevex.-l ways. IFC is providing technical assistance to the
Capital Markets Board. Programs have been agreed to and are being implemented
to adopt a system of standardized accounts for companies making public issues
of securities, and to enact a law regulating the activities of external
auditors and providing for the opening of the Stock Exchange. Finally, the
Government-Bank dialogue on these matters, initiated in the context of the
IFC's TA program and to be pursued through a possible financial sector loan
(para. 3.16), should assist in improving the institutional, supervisory and
developmental framework of the capital markets in parallel with measures
already planned to strengthen primary markets for securities and activate
equity markets through the opening of a new stock exchange. These measures
will have an impact on medium and large-sized enterprises both directly by
facilitating access to sources of equity, and indirectly by increasing
competition with the banking system and thereby increasing the availability of
and reducing costs of short and medium-term financing.

(iv) Local Currency Resources of Development Banks
3.20     In addition to the problems related to the use of foreign exchange
funds discussed above (para. 3.10), the four major development banks in Turkey
(TSKB and SYKB in the private sector and DYB and DESIYAB in the public sector)
face a common problem: lack of access to local currency resources. The two
private sector development banks (TSKB and SYKB) are also inhibited from
competing with commercial banks because their shares are mostly owned by the
leading commercial banks and both are dominated by a single shareholder, Is
Bank. The continuing dialogue between the Government and the Bank on these
issues in this context of a possible financial sector loan is intended to
address these medium-term issues by seeking an increase in private sector
development banks' share of medium and long-term loans in the Central Bank
discowit facility and stricter requirements of project evaluation by
commercial banks to participate in the facility. As regards the proposed
project, HB is a deposit money bank and does not face constraints similar to
development banks in mobilizing local currency resources. SYKB has projected
an increase in its local currency loans of only 332 p.a. in nominal terms
during 1985-38 and does not foresee any difficulty in meeting the fund
requirements from its traditional sources, viz. Central Bank rediscounting
facility, capital increases and internal generation of funds.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
4.01     The proposed project will assist in the development of efficient
labor-intensive industries, mainly in the SMI category,  here- Turkey has
comparative advantage and thus contribute both to job creation and growth of
manufactured exports. The project will place special emphasis on assistance
to small scale industrial enterprises, particularly those located in remote
area of the country, through Halk Bankasi (HB) which has a widespread branch
network. The project will also concurrently assist in developing financial
intermediaries capable of providing term finance and financial services to SMI
in an efficient manner and thus improve SMI's access to term finance.
Finally, the project will help start a national program of technical
assistance for SMI involving both private and public sector institutions to
provide a range of technical and management services to SMI in a cost
effective manner. In order to achieve the above objectives, the project
includes (i) credit lines of US$80 million and US$18.4 million for Sinai
Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB) and Halk Bankasi (HB) respectively; and (ii)
technical assistance of US$1.25 million for SMI to be implemented by the Small
Industry Development Organization (SIDO), and US$350,000 for the institutional
strengthening and efficiency improvements of RB. On the basis of past
operations and project pipeline of SYKB and RB, and overall financial needs of
the SMI sector, it is anticipated that most of the subprojects to be financed
under the loan would be for the manufacture of food products, ready-made
garments, furniture, leather products, and metal works and engineering. The
project objectives support those in the Five Year Plan (para. 2.18), and are
consistent with the Bank's strategy and lending objectives in Turkey (paras.
2.23-2.25).

B. Financial Intermediaries
(i) Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB)'-'
4.02     The Institution:  SYKB was established in 1963 by five major
commercial banks in Turkey, to meet the investment financing needs of the
private industrial sector. Its paid-in capital is TL 2,000 million of which
60% is owned by Is Bank-the largest bank in Turkey--and the remainder is
equally divided among the four other banks. It has very competent management
and staff. The total professional staff of SYKB was 49 in December 1984; this
included 9 engineers and 24 economists/financial analysts and their total
number has increased by 50% during the last four years. The staff is
experienced and has been provided with adequate training in project appraisal
and supervision. SYKB plans to increase its staff gradually and the total
member of engineers and economists would reach to 54 by 1988; this would be
adequate to meet projected operational requirements. SYKB's internal staff
training arrangements are satisfactory and it does not need special project-
related training.
4.03     SYKB's operational and financial policies are laid down in its policy
statement of January 1979 which is designed to ensure sound lending operations
and a strong finnncial position.  SYKB's appraisal procedures are satisfactory
as indicated by the review of subprojects financed by SYKB under the Bank's
loans for the textile industry (Loan 1755-TU) and labor intensive industry
(Loan 1952-TU) projects. As regards project supervision, there is scope for
its further strengthening by closely following the details of supervision
system agreed with the Bank under the labor-intensive industry project. In
particular, SYKB staff has to increase the frequency of visits to all projects
under implementation (at least once every six months) and to monitor
non-financial aspects of projects (including physical implementation and
technical and marketing aspects) on a regular basis. SYKB management
coanfirmed that its staff has been instructed to carry out above improvements
4.04     Operations and Financial Positaon:  Total loan approvals of SYKB have
increased from TL 2,765 million for 29 projects in 1980 to TL 16,782.9 million
for 83 projects in 1984. The increase in real terms during the period was 14%
p.a. and the number of projects almost trippled which is quite impressive.
Local currency loan approvals were 33% of total loans during the 1980-1984
period. The foreign currency loans increased from US$17.4 million (13 in
number) in 1980 to US$22.0 million (46 in number) in 1982 but declined to
US$18.1 million (41 in number) in 1983, due to reluctance of sub-borrowers to
accept foreign exchange risk (para. 3.13). Foreign currency loan approvals,
however, increased to US$37.7 million (66 in number) in 1984 with the
introduction of the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) (para.
3.13). SYKB has continued financing priority projects which have obtained
Certificates of Encouragement from the Government. The projects assisted by
SYKB have high labor-intensity, particularly in more recent years. It is
estimated that about 26,000 direct jobs would be created by projects which

received loans from SYKB for fixed investment during 1980-1984 period, with an
estimated average cost per job (excluding land and buildings) of US$19,726 in
1980, US$20,720 in 1981, US$7.975 in 1982, US$11,111 in 1983, and US$8,247 in
1984.
4.05     SYKB's net income as percentage of equity has increased from 22% to
32% in 1980-84. Its administrative expenses in relation to total assets have
remained at around 2% which is satisfactory. SYKB's average interest spread
for the last few years has been about 10% p.a. which is high mainly due to
charging interest from the date of loan commitments and interest free loans
(TL 725.4 million as of September 30, 1984) from shareholding banks. (The
spread would, however, reduce to 6.5X by 1988 mainly due to the conversion of
shareholding banks' loans into equity and increase in the share of loans in
the total resources of SYKB). The returns to shareholders in nominal terms on
their capital and loans to SYKB (received in the form of annual dividends)
have gone up from a low of 1 in 1980 to 32% in 1984 which are still low,
compared to interest rates on term deposits or other financial instruments in
Turkey. The long-term debt/equity ratio has gone up from 4.2:1 at the end of
1980 to 8.6:1 at the end of 1984 which is within the maximum limit of 9:1
agreed with the Bank under the labor intensive industry project. At the end
of 1984, the current ratio was 1.9:1 and showed a satisfactory liquidity
position. SYKB's arrears and loans affected by arrears of more than three
months were 2.5% and 14.71 respectively of the total loan portfolio on
December 31, 1984 and were reasonable.
4.06     According to SYKB's financial projections, its return on equity would
increase to 45Z in 1988 and its liquidity and long-term financial position
would continue to be satisfactory. In view of its sound financial position,
it is proposed to increase the debt/equity limit of SYKB from 9:1 to 10:1
under the proposed project.
4.07     SYKB's audit has been performed satisfactorily by independent
auditors who have given unqualified audit reports.
4.08     Bank-financed Operations:  SYUB has so far received two loans of
US$15 million (Loan 1755-TU) and US$40 million (Loan 1952-TU) from the Bank in
support of the development of textile industry and labor-intensive industry,
respectively. Due to reluctance of firms to incur foreign exchange risk, the
last date for loan commitments was extended for both Loens. With the help of
the 1984 FERIS, the two loans were almost fully committed (textiles 1001 and
labor-intensive 99%) by December 31, 1984. SYKB has approved 112 subprojects
(net of cancellations) with a total amount of US$39.5 million up to December
31, 1984 under the Bank loan for labor-intensive industries. About 38% of the
loan amount has been approved for SSI subprojects against the original target
of 33%. Subprojects assisted under the loan would create about 8,600 jobs at
an average cost of US$8,700 each (excluding land and buildings). The ERR and
FRR were calculated for subprojects with fixed investment of above US$750,000
each and these ranged between 16Z to 45% and 19.6% to 54% respectively.
SYKB's performance in utilizing the loan as reflected by good quality of
subproject appraisal, financing of a large number of SSI subprojects and low
cost per job, has been very satisfactory.



- 25 -
4.09     Proposed Bank Loan:  Total foreign currency loan commitments of SYKB
during the 1986-1988 period are estimated at US$171 million. The proposed
Bank loan of US$80 million and an expected loan of US$35 million form EIB
would meet the bulk of the resource requirements. The unidentified resource
gap may be met from existing or new sources (e.g. KfW).
4.10     The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million would be used by SYKB to
finance mainly labor-intensive small and medium scale industry projects. The
definition of SSI, SMI and the cost of per job criteria for assistance will be
the same in real terms as under the last labor-intensive industry project.
The definition of SSI subprojects would include new projects with maximum
investment limit, excluding land and building, of US$500,0001' and expansion
projects with a limit of US$650,000." For medium-scale industry projects
(MSI) the respective maximum investment limits would be US$2.5 million and
US$3.5 million1' for new and expansion projects. At least 80X of the loan
would be reserved for financing SMI projects and, within this limit, at least
30% of the loan would be onlent to SSI. All eligible subprojects will have a
maximum capital investment (excluding land and buildings) of US$18,0001' per
job. Non-SMI projects which satisfy the cost per job criteria and are
considered export-oriented based on Certificates of Encouragement would be
eligible for financing from the balance of the loan proceeds (up to a maximum
of 20% of the loan to SYKB). This would allow SYKB leeway in financing a
small number of subprojects which, besides being labor-intensive, were also
export-oriented.  The Bank's experience has shown that such subprojects could
be somewhat bigger than typical SMI subprojects because of the need to capture
economies of scale. As a consequence of SYKB's policy guidelines, regarding
the size of subloans, the maximum subproject and subloan sizes for these
larger subprojects are expected to be in the range of US$4-5 million and
US$2-2.25 million respectively, i.e. not significantly larger than the
subprojects that would belong to SMI category under the loan.
4.11     As agreed under the labor-intensive industry project, SYKB will
calculate economic and financial rates of return for all subprojects receiving
term financing and having total investment in fixed assets exceeding
US$750,000 equivalent. The eligible subprojects will also have a minimum
economic rate of return of 1Z% and a minimum financial rate of return which
will be not less than the Central Bank's rediscount rate for the industrial
investment loans at the time of subloan approval.
(ii) Halk Bankasi (HB)!-'
4.12     Role of HB in the Proposed Project:  The Bank has endeavored under
its industrial credits to Turkey to diversify its assistance on a geographical
basis and to enhance the support to SSI. The achievement of these objectives
has been constrained by the inadequate branch network of DFCs in Turkey and
the lack of interest of commercial banks in assistance to SSI.

- 26 -
4.13     The Balk Bankasi (HB) is a specialized bank in Turkey which caters
mainly to the credit needs of small traders, artisans, and SSI and mobilizes
small savings. It has been established on the pattern of "popular banks" in
many European and Asian countries and is a member of the International Popular
Credit Confederation.L' HB has a large branch network (para. 4.14)
whichprovides easy access to small enterprises all over the country. It has
recently received technical assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany
(to be continued up to 1987) which includes advisory services to assist the
head office and selected branches of RB in the policies, procedures and
criteria of assisting SSI, particularly small metal and wood-working and
processing industries.'  In view of the above and considering that the
Government and the chief executive of EB are keen to enhance its developmental
role, the Bank can provide technical and financial assistance to HB and, thus,
help in the development of SSI on an extensive basis. At this stage, it is
proposed that the Bank support the institutional strengthening of HB and
provide technical assistance (para. 4.17) for this purpose. In addition, a
relatively small amount of the loan (US$18.40 million) is proposed to be
provided for onlending to SSI through HB (para. 4.21) as a pilot project. The
technical and financial assistance programs are designed to lay the basio for
further Bank assistance to HB and the SSI sector.
4.14     The Institution:  HB was established in 1938 as a State Enterprise
(SEE) to provide specialized banking services for the promotion of small
businesses. The Ministry of Finance is the main shareholder of HB as it holds
95% of HB's paid-in capital of TL 11.5 billion (US$26.4 million as of December
1984). HB operates from its head office in Ankara and regional offices in
Istanbul and Izmir as well as its 598 branches and 9 foreign currency bureaus
throughout Turkey. Its management and senior staff have generally long
banking experience. During the last five years (1979-84). the number of RB
staff increased by 27Z to 11,726 of which 4,260 (36X) are in managerial and
executive positions.
4.15    HB's lending operations are governed by four different credit
departments, each having its own specialization including one for the
industrial sector. RB has an established system of delegation of loan
approval authority from the Board to branch managers. The branches are
authorized to approve loans up to their permitted limit. The limit varies
among different branches depending upon their size and it can go up to TL 25
million. Most of the day-to-day banking operations are therefore carried out
at the branch level.
4.16     HB has followed conservative commercial banking practices.  Although
its decisions on investment loans are made after a review of technical,
financial and market aspects of the project, the financial structure of the

borrowers and the collateral of the loan are given high importance. There is
a need for more project-oriented lending by HEB by increasing the emphasis on
project viability rather than the loan collateral and directing/coordinating
technical assistance to SSI. This objective is proposed to be achieved by
increasing the number of professional staff for industrial projects, appoint-
ment of a training officer for preparation and implementation of training
programs in project appraisal and supervision, adoption of an appropriate
policy statement, and active coordination with the Small Industry Development
Organization (SIDO). HB has already appointed additional professional staff
(8 financial analysts/economists) for the immediate needs of the Industrial
Credit Department and completed the training of a core staff with other DFCs
in Turkey. It has also adopted a policy statement acceptable to the Bank.
During negotiations, assurances were received from HB on the appointment of a
training officer before sending the first withdrawal application under a
sub-loan. The proposed loan includes technical assistance of US$50,000 for
the training of HB's staff in foreign institutions. As HB would need to
increase the number of engineers from 66 to 100 and the number of
economists/financial analysts from 32 to 70 by 1987 to meet the targets of its
projected industrial investment operations, assurances were also received from
RB on an appropriate annual recruitment plan to meet the above target.
4.1/     While the above measures would help to bring an immediate improvement
in the capability of HB to identify, appraise, and supervise industrial
projects, an in-depth review of its overall institutional structure would
enable adjustments which may be called for (i) to respond effectively to the
new and growing role of HB, particularly with respect to greater development-
orientation in its operations; and (ii) to improve cost and operational
efficiency. A technical assistance of US$300,000 is, therefore, proposed for
HB to undertake a study which would review mainly (a) organizational
structure, policies, and procedures; (b) accounting, internal auditing and
management information system; and (c) the developmental role of HB. The
study would also make recommendations for further institutional strengthening
of HB and means to improve efficiency. The findings and recommendations of
the study will form the basis for preparation of an action program and
timetable for its implementation by HB, in consultation with the Bank. The
terms of reference of the study (Annex 3, Attachment 2) were agreed during
negotiations.
4.18     Operations and Financial Position:  During the 1981-1984 period, HB's
total loans increased by 1.5% p.a. in real terms and amounted to TL 207
billion (US$ 475 million) at the end of 1984. The Industrial Credit
Department which has the overall responsibility for loans to SMI for working
capital and investment purposes accounted for 25% of total portfolio of HB as
of December 31, 1984. The industrial credit portfolio (including both short
and long-term loans) increased by 1% p.a. in real terms during 1981-84 and
amounted to TL 48 billion (US$110 million) at the end of 1984. The credit
available for investment to the small businesses and industry-i' out of this

SSI includes very small euterprises, i.e. those with less than 25
employees and less than TL 80 million (US$ 190,000) capital investment
(excluding land and buildings). MSI enterprises are those having capital
(excluding land and buildings) between TL 80 million to TO 300 million
(US$190,000 to US$700,000).

department was TL 21 billion (US$48 million) at the end of 1984; an increase
of 4Z p.a. in real terms during 1981-1984. The working capital loans were
about 70Z of total loans made in 1984; the balance of 30X being for fixed
investment.
4.19     Although HB is not a profit-motivated institution, its net profit as
percentage of equity was 19Z in 1982, 12% in 1983, and 25Z in 1984. The major
adjustments in deposit and lending rates in the last few years have been
responsible for the deviation in the net profit of HB. HB's average interest
spread was 7% in 1982, 6Z in 1983 and 9X in 1984 which is high from
international st-ndard. HB's administrative expenses as a share of total
assets between 1981-1984 have also been high at 3-4% mainly due to the large
number of branches and the small size of sub-loans of HB. At the end of 1984,
the total debtl/-equity ratio of HB stood at 12:1 which is low for a
commercial bank and well within the maximum limit of 20:1 required by the
Central Bank for all commercial banks.2/ HB follows sound liquidity
policies and complies with the liquidity reserve requirement of the Central
Bank. Total arrears for all credits of HB at the end of 1984 were TL 8.1
billion (USt 18.6 million) or 3.9Z of the loan portfolio, which is on the low
side. HB's financial projections show that its return on equity will be about
18X in the next four years and that it will maintain a satisfactory liquidity
and long-term financial position.
4.20     HB's financial statements are audited by BLxsbakanlik Yuksek Demetreme
Kurulu (Supreme Board of Auditors) in the Prime Minister's Office. The audit
is carried out in accordance with the Government's requirements for the state
enterprises and is considered acceptable by the Bank. HB's accounts have been
found satisfactory by the auditors.
4.21     Proposed Bank Loan:  The proposed Bank loan of US$18.40 million would
be used by HB to finance labor-intensive subprojects in the SSI category only
as defined in para. 4.10. Furthermore, within SSI category, RB will
concentrate its financing on very small enterprises, which is the main area of
is operations. It will thus use at least 70% of its share in the Bank loan
(US$13 million) for assistance to subprojects with total fixed assets,
excluding land and buildings, not exceeding US$200,000 in 1984 prices.3/
The proposed loan would meet about 37% of investment fund needs of HB (i.e.
Investment Credit Department) on commitment basis for financing the
procurement of machinery and equipment by small industrial enterprises during
1986-88, the balance coming mainly from paid-in capital, term-deposits, and a
loan of DM 10 million from KfW.
1/ Includes short-term and long-term deposits and borrowings.
2/ In view of this general limit and considering that HB is an almost fully
Government-owned commercial bank, a separate long-term debt/equity limit
is not considered necessary for HB.
3/ This limit is almost equivalent to the present SSI limit of TL 80 million
used internally in HB.

C. Technical Assistance Program for SMIl/
4.22     Turkey's industrial sector is at a fairly advanced stage of
development compared to most developing countries. The technical assistance
needs of SHI are relatively sophisticated and include access to improved
product designs, production technology, management methods and marketing
skills, particularly for competing in export markets. There is a need to
develop inter-firm linkages between SMI and larger firms to allow SMI access
to national and international markets. Until now, SMIs have had very limited
access to existing institutional sources of technical assistance because these
institutions were not geared towards serving the needs of smaller firms. In
1970, with the support of UNDP/UNIDO, the Government established the Small
Industry Development Organization (SIDO) with a pilot project in Gaziantep in
Eastern Turkey to assist small enterprises of that district. The Gaziantep
facilities comprise a demonstration center for metal working industries. The
pilot project has not been successful primarily because of the incompatability
of its relatively complex machinery and technology with the needs of most of
the small enterprises in the area for relatively simple knowhow and the lack
of an effective extension service for SMI.
4.23     In June 1983, the Government decided to substantially strengthen
SIDO. SIDO became a semi-autonomous body of the Ministry of Industry and
Trade (MOIT) with the mandate of providing technical assistance to SMI on a
nation-wide basis. At the same time, UNDP approved a three-year project at an
estimated cost of $9l2,000 to assist SIDO establish a demonstration center cum
common facilities for small foundries in Ankara, which is under implementation.
4.24     In the light of its experience with the (Mziantep pilot project,
SIDO's management has adopted a new strategy to assist SMI. The new strategy
calls for SIDO to build up a decentralized network of branch offices staffed
with multidisciplinary extension teams. Each branch office would promote
technical assistance by visiting and undertaking diagnostic surveys of SMI
firms to assess their individual problems and needs and refer firms needing
specialized assistance to appropriate experts or institutions capable of
providing such services. The firms will receive in-plant services tailored to
their specific needs with minimum disruption of work. Also, SIDO will become
a catalyst in mobilizing existing sources of technical, marketing, training
and management expertise to assist SMI rather than attempting exclusively on
its own to service all the diverse technical assistance needs of SMI.
4.25     SIDO currently employs a total staff of 72 (16 professionals) of
which 66 are at Gaziantep and the remaining 6 are at Ankara headquarters.
SIDO's present management has considerable experience in small industry
development and appears competent. SIDO's operations are reviewed by a
governing body chaired by the Deputy Under-Secretary of MOIT and includes a
representative of Halk Bankasi (HB). However, SIDO's organization and
staffing need substantial strengthening to implement effectively its new
development strategy.

4.26     The proposed project component will assist in the implementation of
the new development strategy of SIDO (para. 4.24) with a modest beginning. It
will provide assistance to SIDO over a three-year period to (i) develop a
decentralized organization structure and strengthening management and staff
capabilities; (ii) develop an effective extension service through six branch
offices; (iii) develop a computerized information system (a) to monitor and
manage the decentralized technical extension program; and (b) to meet the
information needs of SMI and promote inter-firm production and marketing
linkages; and (iv) develop an efficient system including a financial mechanism
to promote other specialized institutions and private consultants in assisting
SMI. The impact of SIDO's new development strategy as well as the range and
cost-effectiveness of its overall activities, including the role of two
demonstration centres at Gaziantep and Ankara, will be reviewed by the
Government with SIDO in mid-1987 and in end-1988 (which would be the middle
and end respectively of the implementation of the TA component of the project)
and the findings and conclusions will be discussed with the Bank with the
objective of adjusting/redirecting the strategy and future activities of SIDO,
if necessary.
4.27     The major elements of this project component (see Chart 1 for summary
description) include advisory assistance, overseas training for SIDO
management and staff, equipment and reference information, materials and
funding for consulting assistance for SMI firms to resolve complex and
specialized problems. The foreign exchange cost of the project component is
estimated at $1.25 million. The local currency needs of SIDO to implement the
project component, and to meet its operating costs are estimated at TL 330
million in constant 1985 prices.
4.28     The proposed work program will be a substantial addition to SIDO's
existing activities involving significant increases in its branches and staff,
introduction of a new computerized information system, provision of extension
services, promotion of sub-contracting, etc. To ensure that the technical
assistance component of the project is adequately implemented and that the
expansion of SIDO activities is carried out on schedule, a supplementary
project monitoring procedure will be instituted in addition to normal project
supervision as follows: (i) copies of final reports by foreign advisors to
SIDO will be sent to the World Bank for review and conmment; briefing and
debriefing sessions will be held with the advisors as appropriate; (ii) SIDO
will prepare a semi-annual progress report for the World Bank; (iii) SIDO will
prepare a more complete annual report detailing activities, expenditures and
results as related to the annual goals under the program; and (iv) SIDO will
maintain separate accounts for the expenditures under the proposed technical
assistance component. These accounts will be audited and submitted together
with the annual accounts of SIDO for the Bank's review.
4.29     Assurances were received from the Government during negotiations that
it will provide to SIDO all the funds necessary to implement the above program
and will commit SIDO to implement the new development strategy, build up its
organization structure including branch offices, hire and train additional
staff, introduce new information system and procedures, implement the
technical assistance component of the project according to an agreed timetable
and submit periodic reports on the implementation of the project.

V. MAIN FEATURES OF THE LOAN
A. The Borrower and Loan Conditions
5.01     Lending and Relending Arrangements:  The Government will be the
borrower of the proposed loan of US$100 million. The Government will onlend
the respective loan amounts to SYKB and HB, including the technical assistance
component of US$350,000 to HB, and transfer the technical assistance funds of
US$1.25 million to SIDO. The Government will repay the loan to the Bank over
a fixed period of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years. SYKB and HB
will make subloans normally of 8-10 years but in no case more than the loan
maturity period. They will repay the loans to the Government commensurate
with the aggregate amortization schedule of individual subloans. HB will
repay the technical assistance component of US$350,000 over 15 years. The
Government will be responsible on behalf of SIDO, for the repayment of
technical assistance component of US$1.25 million. The execution of
subsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to the Bank, between the Government and
SYKB and HB, will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.02     Interest Rates and Foreign Exchante Risk:  As elaborated in
paras.3.13 and 3.14, the proceeds of the Bank loan will be onlent to
sub-borrowers either under FERIS or in foreign exchange. Under FERIS, the
Government will lend Bank funds to SYKB and HB at a fixed rate equal to the
onlending rate to sub-borrowers minus the intermediation cost of 42.
Alternatively, Bank funds would be lent in foreign exchange.to SYXB and EB at
a fixed interest rate equal to the then prevailing Bank rate plus 0.75S to
compensate the Government for bearing the risk arising from the variability of
the Bank's interest rate. The onlending rate to sub-borrowers will be fixed
at 5S above the Bank rate prevailing at the time of sub-loan approval. The
onlending rates to sub-borrowers would be positive in real terms over the life
of sub-loans based on projected inflation (para. 3.09).. These arrangements
would ensure that onlending rates are: (i) free of any subsidy from the
Government, (ii) comparable to interest rates on other similar funds in
Turkey, and (iii) provide a reasonable spread to SYKB and HB.
5.03     Free Limit:  In view of the generally satisfactory quality of project
appraisal under the textile and labor-intensive industry projects, SYKB's free
limit for subloans is proposed to be US$1.25 million; all subprojects above
this limit will require prior approval of the Bank based on a full review of
their viability to be submitted by SYKB in the form of an appraisal report.
On the basis of experience under the labor-intensive industry project and the
project pipeline of SYKB, it is estimated that the total number of subprojects
to be financed by SYKB would be about 200 of which about 101 by number and 351
by amount would be above the free limit. While all SSI subprojects would be
below the free limit, about 502 of the subprojects in MSI category wolild be
above the limit and would require the Bank's prior approval.
5.04     The free limit for HB's portion of the loan is proposed to be kept at
a low level of US$150,000 because it would be financing small subloans and
this would be the first Bank loan to HB. Also, EB will submit for the Bank's
approval the appraisal of the first five subprojects irrespective of the sub-
loan amount. This would give an opportunity to the Bank to review the quality



- 33 -
of project appraisal of HB and to provide necessary advice and guidance to its
staff at an initial stage. In addition, HB will make available to the Bank's
supervision missions 10X of the subprojects with loan amounts of US$100,000-
US 150,000, to be identified by the Bank's staff, for an ex-post review. It
is estimated that HB will use the loan proceeds to finance about 500 sub-
projects of which 10X by number and 30X by amount would be above the free
limit.
5.05     Closing Date:  On the basis of resource requirements of, and the
expected pace of utilization of loan proceeds by SYKB and HB, the last date
for submission of subloan applications to the Bank will be June 30, 1988; the
last date for submission of applications will not apply to the technical
assistance component. The closing date of the loan will be June 30, 1992.
B. Procurement and Disbursements
5.06     The subloan proceeds of US$98.4 million (US$80 million for SYKB and
US$18.4 million for HB) will be used to finance the full costs of acquiring
imported machinery and equipment (including the foreign costs of know-how
acquisition, commissioning and training costs incurred with the initial
investment) and the initial stock of imported raw materials and spare parts.
In addition, Bank funds will be used to finance 70X of the cost of imported
machinery and equipment procured off-the-shelf in the domestic market, and to
finance 50Z1' of the cost of domestically produced machinery and equipment,
net of taxes, reflecting the imputed import content of such items. The
technical assistance component of US$1.6 million (US$1.25 million for SIDO and
US$350,000 for HB) will be used to finance the full cost of imported
equipment, engaging the services of advisors and consultants and foreign
training of SIDO and HB staff.
5.07     The procurement procedures will be consistent with those provided
under the labor-intensive industry project. SYKB and HB will require their
sub-borrowers normally to obtain at least three bids from suppliers eligible
under Bank guidelines. However, small items costing less the' US$10,000 and
proprietary items will be purchased by direct contracting. Goods and services
will be procured by SIDO through international shopping or ICB in accordance
with Bank guidelines.
5.08     The estimated disbursement schedule of the loan is g ren in Annex 5.
This is based on actual disbursement profiles of the IDF sub-sector in the
EMENA Region for 1974-83. Disbursement of funds will normall- be done against
standard documentation. A Special Account (Revolving Fund) will be
established in the name of the borrower (i.e. the Government) and it will have
1/ The last labor-intensive indu;stry project had provided for the financing
of 40X of the cost but it is now proposed to be increased to 50Z because
the devaluation of TL has been higher than domestic inflation in the last
four years, thus increasing the imputed import content by at least 10
percentage points.



- 34 -
sub-accounts for SYKB, HB and SIDO for disbursement purposes. An amount of
US$6 million will be initially deposited by the Bank in the Special Account.
The Account will be maintained in US dollars.
5.09     As a large number of subloans of HB will be very small in size with
only one contract of up to US$20,000, Statement of Expenditures (SOE) will be
used for reimbursements of contracts of up to US$20,000. SYKB and HB will
submit a monthly SOE giving information on amounts of individual subloans,
amount of payments, purpose of loans, name and address of machinery suppliers,
and the country of origin of the machinery. All supporting documents for
disbursements covered under SOE will be made available on request, to the
Bank's supervision missions. Also, an independent auditor will verify all SOE
and the Special Account within five and six months respectively for SYKB and
HB after the end of each of their financial year and his report will be
submitted to the Bank.
C. Status of Project Preparation
5.10     Both SYKB and HB have a well-developed project pipeline and sub-loan
commitments are expected to commence immediately upon loan effectiveness. HB
has employed and trained additional professional staff for the immediate needs
of its Industrial Credit Department. The terms of reference of the study for
the institutional strengthening of HB have been agreed and the selection of
consultants is expected to be completed by June 30, 1986. SIDO has already
got core staff in position and does not foresee any difficulty in the
recruitment of additional staff to implement the technical assistance program
for SMI. The terms of reference for the advisors to be employed by SIDO under
the project have been agreed and their selection would be made in accordance
with the timetable agreed during negotiations.
D. Reporting
5.11      SYKB will submit to the Bank periodic reports, as under the
labor-intensive industry project. These reports will include summary of
operations, progress on utilization of loan and annual accounts and audit
reports.  Similar reports will also be submitted by HB.  SIDO will submit
quarterly reports on the progress in implementation of various components of
TA program for SMI. SYKB, BB, and SIDO will also submit a project completion
report.
E. Project Benefits and Risks
5.12     The project will support the development of labor-intensive SKI in
which Turkey has comparative advantages. This would, in turn, create
productive jobs at relatively low cost and contribute to exports of
manufactured goods. Although the maximum limit for the cost per job
(excluding land and buildings) is US$18,000, it is estimated, based on the
experience under the labor-intensive industry project, that the average cost
would be about US$16,000 as compared to the average of US$120,000 in the
manufacturing sector as a whole. Thus, about 18,000 direct jobs will be



- 35 -
provided by subprojects to be financed under the project. The project would
also use, for the first time, HB as a financial intermediary which has branch
offices all over the country. As a result, investment funds would become
accessible to SSI and artisans located outside the main urban centres. This
would contribute to a balanced industrial development at the regional level.
The project would also assist HB in developing the project appraisal and
supervision capability and to promote its developmental role as well as its
overall institutional strengthening and efficiency improvement through
technical assistance. The role of HB in the project is of a pilot nature but,
based on a satisfactory experience, HB can play a much bigger role in the
Bank's future assistance to SSI. Technical assistance for SMI would initiate
the development of institutional capability in Turkey to provide extension
services to SMI and to facilitate sub-contracting on a national basis. This
would result in improved productivity and efficiency of SMI and the
development of a much-desired complementary relationship between SSI and
larger industries. Upon the completion of the TA program, SIDO would be able
to provide assistance and guidance to about 350 SMI enterprises, train about
200 entrepreneurs and to develop about 900 company profiles per year.
5.13     The project risks relate to mainly two areas: meeting of investment
targets by the intermediary banks and implementation of technical assistance
by SIDO. The private sector investment situation has been uncertain in Turkey
in the recent past mainly due to very high real interest rates on working
capital loans, adverse effects of large devaluation of Turkish Lira on the
debt-servicing burden of enterprises which had carried exchange risk on their
foreign currency borrowings, and slow recovery of domestic markets in many
industries. The Government's policies for the promotion of private sector
investment, the emphasis on development of industries with comparative
advantages in export markets, and the FERIS scheme have helped to revive the
private sector investment. A reversal in this situation may slow down the
investments by SYKB and HB and the utilization of the proposed loan. However,
the present Government is fully committed to the promotion of the private
sector. Also, the proposed loan is expected to meet only a part of demand for
funds on SYKB and HB (paras. 4.19 and 4.46). It is therefore unlikely that
SYKB and HB will experience significant delays in the utilization of the
proposed loan. As regards SIDO, it has been operating in only two areas of
Turkey with a relatively s:iall staff who have generally limited practical
experience. Also, the equipment and information resources at SIDO are
inadequate. These factors introduce an element of risk in the proposed
technical assistance component of the loan which would require substantial
increase in staff and tax the management resources of SIDO. However, as the
designated Government unit to provide technical assistance to SMI, SIDO is the
logical choice for strengthening. The activities outlined under the technical
assistance component are designed to improve the administration capabilities
and services of SIDO for SMI, and to further enlarge the scope of SIDO's
efforts through the backup resources of other organizations. In addition, the
Bank staff would need to cli ely monitor the implementation of technical
assistance and SIDO's activi:ies. The risks are therefore reasonable and
should be accepted considering the potential benefits of the project.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     The Bank has reached agreement with the Government, SYKB, and HB on
making a loan of US$100 million.  The Government will (i) onlend US$80 million
to SYKB and US$18.4 million to HB for onlending to eligible enterprises in the
industrial sector in Turkey (para. 4.01), (ii) onlend US$0.35 million to HEB
for the preparation of a study for its institutional strengthening and
improvements in efficiency and staff training (para. 4.17), and (iii) allocate
US$1.25 million to SIDO to implement the program of technical assistance to
SKI enterprises (paras. 4.22-4.29).
6.02     Agreement was reached with the Government on the following main
points:
(i)  The Government will implement the TA program for SMI through SIDO
(paras. 4.22 to 4.29).
(ii)  The Government will make the necessary funds available to SIDO for
implementing and operating the TA program for SMI (para. 4.29).
(iii) The impact of SIDO's new development strategy as well as the range
and cost-effectiveness of its overall activities, including the role
of two demonstration centres at Gaziantep and Ankara, will be
reviewed by the Government with SIDO in mid-1987 and end-1988 and the
findings and conclusions will be discussed with the Bank with the
objective of adjusting/redirecting the strategy and activities of
SIDO, if necessary (para. 4.26).
(iv)  The repayment term of the loan will be 15 years including a grace
period of 3 years (para. 5.01).
(v) The proceeds of the Bank loan will be onlent to sub-borrowers either
under FERIS or in foreign exchange. Under FERIS, the Government will
lend Bank funds to SYKB and HB at a fixed rate equal to the onlending
rate to sub-borrowers minus the inter- mediation cost of 4%.
Alternatively, Bank funds would be lent in foreign exchange to SYKB
and HB at a fixed interest rate equal to the then prevailing Bank
rate plus 0.75Z to compensate the Government for bearing the risk
arising from the variability of the Bank's interest rate. The
onlending rate to sub-borrowers will be fixed at 5% above the Bank
rate prevailing at the time of sub-loan approval (para 3.14).
(vi)  The Government will sign, before loan effectiveness, subsidiary loan
agreements with SYKB and HB, acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.01).
6.03     Assurances have also been received from the Government to ensure that
SIDO implements the technical assistance program which would include the
appointment of advisors and additional staff in SIDO, staff training,
procurement of equipment and reference material, establishment of branches,
strengthening of extension activities, development of information system,
provision of technical advisory services, and submission of periodical reports
to the Bank; as elaborated in paras. 4.22-4.29 and Annex 4.



- 37 -
6.04     Agreement was also reached with SYKB and HB on the following points:
(i) The following definitions will be used for SSI and SMI enterprises
(para. 4.10):
(a)  SSI -  Fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, up to
US$500,000 for new projects and US$650,000 for expansion
projects.
(b)  SMI -  Fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, up to US$2.5
million for new projects and US$3.5 million for expansion
projects.
All values are in 1984 prices and would be adjusted according to the
international inflation index.
(ii) All enterprises eligible for financing under the proposed Bank loan
would be labor-intensive with an average capital investment
(excluding land and buildings) not exceeding US$18,000 per job in
1984 prices (para. 4.10).
-iii)  SYKB and HB will onlend the loan proceeds to eligible enterprises for
terms not exceeding 15 years including a grace period of up to 3
years (para. 5.01).
(iv) The loan repayment by SYKB and HB will be according to the aggregate
amortization schedules of individual sub-loans, except for the
technical assistance of US$350,000 for HB will be repaid in 15 years
including a grace period of 3 years (para. 5.01).
(v) SYKB will use at least 80% of its share of loan proceeds to finance
SMI and within the above limit it will use at least 30X of loan
proceeds for onlending to SSI (para. 4.10). HB will use its share of
loan proceeds for onlending exclusively for the financing of SSI and
at least 70% of the above amount will be channelled to very small
SI, i.e. enterprises with fixed assets, excluding land and
buildings, not exceeding US$200,000 (para. 4.21).
(vi)  The free limit will be US$1.25 million for SYKB (para. 5.03) and
US$150,000 for HB. The first five sub-projects of HB will be treated
as above the free limit irrespective of their size (para. 5.04).
(vii)  The last date for submission of sub-loans will be June 30, 1988, and
the closing date will be June 30, 1992 (para. 5.05).
(viii)  ERR and FRR will be calculated by SYKB for all sub-projects with
total investment cost of above US$750,000. The minimum ERR will be
12% and minimum FRR will be not less than the Central Bank's
rediscount rate for the industrial investment loans at the time of
subloan approval (para. 4.11).



- 38 -
(ix) The debt/equity limit of SYKB will not exceed 10:1 during the life of
the loan (para. 4.06).
(x) HB will carry out the program of its institutional strengthening and
efficiency improvements through appointment of additional staff,
training of staff and an in-depth review of its institutional
structure (para. 4.16-4.17).
(xi) HB will submit its annual audited financial statements to the Bank
within six months of the end of each year.
(xii)  SYKB will submit its annual audited financiai statements to the Bank
within five months of the end of each year.
6.05     The proposed project is ruitable for a Bank loan of US$100 million on
the terms and conditions outlined above.

SMI PROJECT
Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB)
(i) Institutional Aspects
1.       Establishment and Ownership:  SYKB was established in 1963 by five
major commercial banks in Turkey; namely Is Bankasi, Akbank, Garanti Bankasi,
Osmanli Bankasi and Vakiflar Bankasi, to meet the investment financing needs
of the private industrial sector. The paid-in capital of SYKB is TL 2,000
million of which 60X is owned by Is Bank -the largest bank in Turkey- and
the remainder is equally divided among the four other banks.
2.       Board:  SYKB's Board consists of six members.  Mr. Cahit Kocaomer,
who represents Is Bank, has been the Chairman since February 19i6. The other
5 members are the representatives of the four remaining shareholder banks ane
SYKB's General Manager, Mr. Orhan Altan.
3.       Organization:  Project identification, appraisal and supervision are
undertaken by the Financial Analysis, Technical, and Economic Study and
Research Departments. Resource mobilization and loan administration including
legal and insurance aspects are handled by the Loans Department and accounting
matters are carried out by the Accounting Department. There have not been any
changes in the overall organization of SYKB since its appraisal in 1980 by the
Bank for the labor-intensive industry project (SAR 3189-TU) and its
organizational structure (Attachment 1) is satisfactory.
4.        Magement and Staff:  The general manager, Mr. Altan, appointed on
January 1, 1979, is a competent chief executive and has gradually transformed
SYKB into a dynamic and development-oriented financial institution. The
Assistant General Manager, Mr. Omer Kizilkaya, provides support and continuity
in management. The total professional staff of SYKB was 49 in December 1984,
including 9 engineers and 24 economists/financial analysts. The staff is
experienced and turnover has been very low. SYKB has been increasing its
professional staff according to its operational needs. The staff has been
provided with adequate training in project appraisal and supervision. SYKB
plans to increase its staff gradually and the total member of engineers and
economists would reach to 54 by 1988. This would be adequate to meet
projected operational requirements and no difficulty is foreseen in the
employment and training of additional staff.
5. Policies: SYKB adopted a policy statement in January 1979 which ensures
sound lending operations. The statement provides, inter alia, for conducting
sectoral and sub-sectoral studies to identify priority development areas and
viable projects with high economic priority. It further stipulates that SYKB
will finance projects whose majority control is vested with the private sector
and provide up to 602 of the fixed investment cost of the project; its total
exposure in an enterprise will not normally exceed 20% of its own equity;
equity investment will not exceed 25% of the enterprise's capital and 10% of
its own equity; and it will not carry foreign exchange risk. SYMB follows
conservative though reasonable collateral policies.



- 42 -
6.       Procedures:  SYKB's appraisal procedures are satisfactory as
indicated by the review of subprojects financed under the Bank's loans for the
textile industry (Loan 1755-TU) and labor intensive industry (Loan 1952-TU)
projects. Appraisal includes assessment of the management capability and
credit-worthiness of the applicant and economic, technical, marketing and
financial viability of the proposed project. As regards supervision, SYK5B's
staff makes periodical visits to projects and monitors the cost and financing
of projects under implementation and the financial performance of projects in
operation. There is, however, scope for further strengthening of the project
supervision by increasing the frequency of visits to projects under
implementation (at least once every six months) and monitoring non-financial
aspects of projects (including physical implementation and technical and
marketing aspects) as provided in the supervision system agreed under the
labor-intensive industry project. SYKB agreed with the appraisal mission to
carry out above improvements and this was reconfirmed during loan negotiations.
7.       SYKB's procurement procedures are designed to ensure economy and
efficiency. Normally at least three bids from suppliers in different
countries are required for purchase of imported goods. For local procurement,
adequate domestic shopping is required. These procurement procedures are
consistent with those adopted by other Bank assisted DFCs providing loans to
SMI and are considered satisfactory. Disbursement procedures are also
satisfactory.
Dii)  Operations
8.       Overall Operations;  Approvals, commitments and disbursements of
loans and equity investments for 1980-1984 are given in Attachment 2. Total
loan approvals of SYKB have increased from TL 2,765 million for 29 projects in
1980 to TL 16,782.9 million for 83 projects in 1984, i.e. 57% p.a. in nominal
terms. The increase in real terms during the period was 14X p.a. and the
number of projects almost trippled which is quite impressive. Local currency
loan approvals were 33% of total loans during the 1980-1984 period, and their
relative share has decreased from 38% in 1980 to 13% in 1984 mainly because of
the availability of new foreign currency resources to SYKB. The foreign
currency loans increased from US$17.4 million (13 in number) in 1980 to
US$22.0 million (46 in number) in 1982 but declined to US$18.1 million (41 in
number) in 1983 due to reluctance of sub-borrowers to accept foreign exchange
risk (para 3.10). Commitments were also low in 1983 (56X of approvals) for
the same reason. Foreign currency loan approvals, however, increased to
US$37.7 million (66 in number) in 1984 with the introduction of the Foreign
Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) (para 3.10 in text).
9.       Structure of Operations:  Analysis of SYKB's loan approvals during
the 1980-1984 period by sector, geographical location, size, repayment terms
and type of projects is giveit in Attachment 3. During this period, the main
beneficiaries of SYKB's loans have been textile (36%), food (14%), chemical
(12%), and clothing (10%) industries. Fixed investment loans were 40% and 60%
for expansion and new projects respectively, and 48% of the loans approved
were for sub-projects of above US$1 million each in 1984. SYKB's own
contribution to the total fixed investment in its assisted projects was 46% in
1980, 41% in 1981, 75% in 1982, 35% in 1983 and 59% in 1984; the balance of



- 43 -
funds coming from equity sources and other borrowings. With the availability
of foreign currency funds under the Bank's textile project (Loan 1755-TU) and
labor-intensive industry project (Loan 1952-TU), SYKB's own contribution in
project financing increased in 1982.  It decdlned in 1983 due to borrowers'
reluctance to accept foreign exchange risk but again picked up in 1984 with
the introduction of the FERIS.
10.      Development Impact of SYKB's Operations:  SYKB's promotional
activities include the identification and development of and assistance to SMI
projects of high economic priority. In order to achieve the above objective,
SYKB has completed studies of various industrial sub-sectors, including
textile goods, exports, forest products processing industry, meat processing
industry, and marble extracting and processing industry. The above studies
have led to the identification and financing of a large number of
sub-projects, some of which are export-oriented. Currently, SYKB is
undertaking studies of electro-mechanical industry and treatment of leather
products. SYKB has continued financing priority projects which have obtained
Certificates of Encouragement from the Government. SYKB's loan approvals for
projects located in the semi-developed and less-developed regions of Turkey
have increased from TL 1.9 billion in 1980 to TL 6.6 billion 1984, but have
declined in real terms reflecting general reluctance of investors to develop
projects in these areas as Government priorities have favored exports for
which these areas are less suitable. The projects assisted by SYXB have high
labor-intensity, particularly in more recent years.  It is estimated that
about 26,000 direct jobs would be created by projects which received loans
from SYKB for fixed investment during 1980 - 1984 period, with an estimated
average cost per job (excluding land and buildings) of US$19,726 in 1980,
US$20,720 in 1981, US$7,975 in 1982, US$11,111 in 1983 and US$8,247 in 1984.
11.      Bank-financed Operations:  SYJB has so far received two loans of
US$15 million (Loan 1755-TU) and US$40 million (Loan 1952-TU) from the Bank in
support of the development of textile industry and labor-intensive industry,
respectively. Due to reluctance of firms to incur foreign exchange risk, the
last date for loan coamitments under the textile projects was extended twice.
With the help of the 1984 FERIS, it was almost entirely comitted by December
1984. The last date for commitments under the loan for labor-intensive
industry project was also extended by one year to December 31, 1984 for the
same reason. This loan has also been couitted rapidly after the introduction
of FERIS. At least one-third of the loan for labor-intensive industry was
earmarked to finance SSI sub-projects defined as enterprises with assets,
excluding land and buildings, not exceeding US$350,000 in case of new
sub-projects, and US$500,000 in case of expansion of sub-projects 1/.
12.      SYKB has approved 112 sub-projects (net of cancellations) with a
total amount of US$39.5 million (99Z) up to December 31, 1984 under the Bank
loan for labor-intensive industries. About 38Z of the loan amount has been
approved for SSI sub-projects. Sub-loan disbursements as of the same date
have amounted to US$17.5 million 2/ which corresponds to 144 of the total loan
amount. Sub-projects assisted under the loan would create about 8,600 jobs at
1/ December 31, 1980 prices.
2/ US$9.4 million for SSI and US$8.1 million for non-SSI.



- 44 -
an average cost of US$8,700 each (excluding land and buildings) 1W. The major
industrial sub-sectors which have been beneficiaries of Bank-funded loans are
textile, chemical, machinery, food, metal products, and marble industries.
The majority of projects have been located in Istanbul (41X), Bursa (92),
Izmir (6S), and Tekirdag (52). The ERR and FRR were calculated for
subprojects with fixed investment of above US$750,000 each and these ranged
between 16S to 452 and 19.6S to 54X respectively. SYKB's performance in
utilizing the loan as reflected by good quality of subproject appraisal,
financing of a large number of SSI subprojects and low cost per job has been
very satisfactory.
(iii) Financial Situation
13.      Profitability:  SYKB's income statements for 1980-1984 are given in
Attachment 4. Net income increased from TL 112 million in 1980 (222 of
equity) to TL 832 million in 1984 (32S of equity). SYKB's administrative
expenses in relation to total assets have stayed at around 21 between
1980-1984 which are satisfactory. SYKB's average interest spread for the last
few years has been about 101 p.a. The high interest spread is mainly due to
charging of interest from the date of loan commitments and special treatment
of interest on loans from shareholding banks. Until 1976, these loans carried
an interest rate of 111 per annum but, in 1977, the shareholding banks made
them interest free and elected to take the return in the form of higher
dividends on their equity investment. The interest spread is, however,
projected to decline in future years and would be 6.51 by 1988. SYRB's payout
ratio (relationship of dividend payments to net profit after tax) has
gradually increased and was 77:23 in 1984 as compared to the limit of 82:18
permitted by SYKB's Articles of Association. The actual returns to
shareholders in nominal terms on their capital and loans to SYKB have gone up
from a low of 11X in 1980 to 32Z in 1984 which are still fairly low, compared
to interest rates on term deposits or other financial instruments in Turkey.
14.      Financial Position:  SYRB's Comparative Balance Sheets for the years
ending December 31, 1980 - 1984 are given in Attachment 5.  Total assets
increased, in current prices, from TL 4,169 million at the end of 1980 to TL
34,867 million at the end of 1984. In nominal terms they increased by over
7002. The paid-in capital has increased from TL 400 million at the end of
1980 to TL 2 billion at the end of 1984 with the biggest increases occurring
in 1983 and 1984 by TL 400 million and TL 1200 million respectively. The
long-term debt/equity ratio has gone up from 4.2:1 at the end of 1980 to 8.E:1
at the end of 1984 which is within the maximum limit of 9:1 agreed with the
Bank under the labor intensive industry project. At the end of 1984, the
current ratio was 1.9:1 and showed a satisfactory liquidity position.
15.      Resource Mobilization:  The long-term resource position of SYKB as of
December 31, 1984 was as follows:
1/ It was agreed under the loan (No. 1952-TU) to limit the maximum investment
cost (excluding land and buildings) per job created to US$15,000 in
December 1980 prices.

Surplus/ (Deficit) on Approval basis         (904.3)             0.5
As can be seen from the above table, SYBD's major sources of local currency
funds are loans from the Central Bank uwder its discount facility followed by
paid-in capital, and provisions and reserves. Although SYKB's local currency
loan approvals exceeded its resources as of December 31, 1984, the shortfall
could be covered through the fuller utilization of discounting facility of the
Central Bank and loan recoveries. The major utilised foreign currencies
resources are from the World Bank (Textile US$15 million, Labor Intenswive
US$40 million) and from EIB (US$11.4 million). S7KB's foreign currency
resources exceeded the loan approvals by only a small amount of US$0.5 million
as of December 31, 1984.
16.     Quality of Portfolio:  SYXK's arrears situation is given in
Attachment 6. Although SYKB'8 arrears have increased over the years, they are
still on the low side. Arrears and loans affected by arrears of more than
three months were 2.51 and 14.71 respectively of the total loan portfolio on
December 31, 1984. The loan portfolio is well spread among different
industrial sub-sectors and a large portion (70X) is secured by bank
guarantees. The quality of the loan portfolio is, therefore, good. SYRB has
agreed under the textile project to retain at least 5% of its net annual
income as a provision for bad and doubtful loans and investments up to a
maximum of 2S of its loan and equity portfolio. It has been complying with
this loan condition and its provisions amounted to TL 844 million at the end
of 1984.
17.     Audit: SYKB's audit has been performed satisfactorily by Muhas, a
local audit firm in cooperation with Price Waterhouse, an international audit
firm, and it has given an unqualified audit report.



- 46 -
(iv)  Future Operations and Prospects
18.      Operational Forecast;  SYKB's operational projections for the 1985 -
1988 period are given in Attachment 7. The loan approvals are projected to
increase at an annual average rate of about 41% in current prices or 8% in
real terms. SYKB's loans will form about 3% of the estimated total private
sector investment in the industrial sector in 1985-88 and it is considered a
reasonable target in view of the lending operations of SYKB in recent years.
The project pipeline of SYKB as of December 31, 1984, consisted of loan
applications for US$35.37 million equivalent in foreign currency and TL 1.85
billion in local currency. The projects included in the pipeline are mainly
in textile (35Z), food (17%), chemical (11X), clothing (10%), and
machinery(8Z) subsectors. Foreign currency loan approvals are projected at
US$25.3 million (60 in number) in 1985 (US$37.6 million in 1984) and are
estimated to increase to US$70.5 million (110 in number) in 1988. The
projected foreign currency loan approvals also include sub-projects in the SKI
sector to be financed during 1986-1988 under the proposed Bank loan (US$80
million). SYKB's local currency loan approvals are expected to increase from
TL 5.9 billion (18 in number) in 1985 to TL 14 billion (42 in number) in 1988,
an increase of 33% p.a. in current prices or 3% in real terms. The equity
investments of SYKB are expected to remain low (TL 500 million in 1985) and
would increase at an average rate of 17X p.a. in current prices during
1985-1988.
19.      Total foreign currency loan commitments of SYKB during the 1986-1988
period are estimated at US$171 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$80
million and an expected loan of USt35 million equivalent from EIB would reduce
the foreign currency resource gap to about US$56 million. SYKB does not yet
have firm plans to fill this gap but expects that existing and new sources
(e.g. KfW) will provide additional funds. SYKB plar.s to meet its local
currency requirements largely through increases in paid-in capital, borrowings
from the Central Bank and internal generation of funds.
20.      Projected Profitability and Financial Position:  SYKB's projected
income statements and balance sheets for the 1984-1988 period are given in
Annexes 8 and 9. Net income is projected to increase from TL 1,103 million in
1985 to TL 6,463 million in 1988 in current prices. The return on equity is
expected to increase from 32% in 1984 to 45% in 1988. The liquidity position
will also be satisfactory as indicated by the current ratio of 1.12:1 to
1.23:1. SYKB's financial structure will continue to be sound with debt/equity
ratio being below the 9:1 limit at least until 1987. At that stage a further
increase in equity would be required and has been planned for (para 21).
21.      Debt -Equity Limit:  Under the Bank Loan (1952-TU), SYKB was
authorized a debt/equity limit of 9:1. The projections indicate that SYKB's
debt/equity ratio will remain below this limit up to 1987 and thereafter will
increase to about 10:1, despite increase in equity. (SYKB's shareholoers are
planning to increase their paid-in capital from TL 2 billion to TL 6 billion
in 1987 and to TL 10 billion by the end of 1988). It is recommended that
SYKB's maximum debt/equity limit be increased to 10:1 considering its
efficient management, highly prucent financial policies and practices,
satisfactory project appraisal, and sound portfolio (para 15).

Annex 3
TURKEY
SMI PROJECT
Halk Bankasi (HB)
ti)      Institutional Aspects
1.       Establishment and Ownership:  HB was established in i938 (Law 2284)
as a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) and is the only bank in Turkey which
caters to the needs of SSI and artisans in a comprehensive manner. It is also
authorized to finance cooperatives and industrial estates. HB's basic purpose
is to contribute to the mobilization of savings and to provide working capital
and investment loans to traders, artisans and small and medium-scale
industries. It operates an the pattern of "popular banks" in many European
and Asian countries and is the member of the International Popular Credit
Confederation. The operations of HB are guided by its articles of
incorporation and statutes and it conducts its activities within the framework
of the government's general economic plans, policies and objectives. HB has
full government support in furthering its basic purpose of establishment. The
Ministry of Finance is the main shareholder of HB as it holds 95% of HB's
paid-in capital of TL 11.5 billion (US$ 26.4 million as of December 1984 1/),
the remaining capital (5%) being held by private and state banks,
cooperatives, municipalities, private companies and individuals.
2.       Organization:  HB operates from its head office in Ankara and
regional offices in Istanbul and Izmir as well as its 598 branches and 9
foreign currency bureaus throughout Turkey. During the last five years, the
number of HB staff increased by 272 to 11,726 of which 4,260 (36a) are
classified as managers and executives 2/. Currently, there are 26 departments
at the head office which report to six deputy general managers who are members
of the management comnittee under the general manager's supervision. A
summary of the organization chart of HB is given as Attachment 1.
3.       HB's loans are governed by four different credit departments, each
having its own specialization (para 17). BB has an established system of
delegation of loan approval authority from the Board to branch managers. The
branches are authorized to approve loans up to their permitted limit. The
limit varies among different branches but it does not exceed TL 25 million.
The branches perform day-to-day commercial banking functions including loan
approvals (within their limit), disbursement and co!lection of loans and
maintenance of customer deposits and accounts. Loans exceeding the authority
delegated to branch managers are approved at the head office.
4.       Board, Management, and Staff:  HB's Board consists of six directors
including the Chairman and three outside members appointed by the Treasury and
1/  1984 December US$ 1 = TL 436.0           1984 Average US$ 1 = TL 388
1983 December US$ 1 = TL 294             1983 Average US$ 1 = TL 240
2/  Includes Managers, Assistant Managers, Accountants, Supervisors,
Engineers. Economists. and Financial Analysts.



- 57 -
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Chairman, Mr. Ahmet Ertugrul, is
also the chief executive officer (General Manager) of HB. He i8 an economist
with substantial experience in the Treasury. He took over his present
position in HB in September 1984. He is giving special attention to enhance
the developmental role of HB. The other two directors on the Board are deputy
general managers of HB.
5.       The Board normally meets once per week and more often if necessary.
According to recently increased limits, it approves all loans for amounts
exceeding TL 200 million (US$ 460,000). The Credit Committee, consisting of
the general manager and two assistant general managers, approves loans which
are between TL 25 million (US$ 57,000) and TL 200 million. The Manager of the
respective credit department at the head office approves loans exceeding the
branch's limit but below TL 25 million.
6.       HB's senior and middle management has changed little except for the
new general manager and one deputy general manager. Almost the entire
management team has been drawn from among the HB staff, and, thus, has long
banking experience.
7.       As of September 30, 1985, HB's professional staff included 66
engineers, and 32 economists/financial analysts who work largely on industrial
projects. This staff is placed mainly at the Head Office and larger
branches. The technical staff visits smaller branches to appraise and
supervise smaller projects as and when needed. The professional staff in the
Industrial Credit Department at the Head Office was not adequate at the time
of appraisal and, as agreed with the appraisal mission, RB has increased their
number and arranged for their training (para. 14). HB will also need to
increase the number of engineers to 100 and the number of economists/financial
analysts to 70 by 1987 to meet the targets of its projected investment
operations. During negotiations, assurances were received from HB on an
appropriate annual staffing plan for 1986-87. The overall staff turnover in
HB is low (about 5S for the professional staff) but there is a greater
tendency among the technical staff to move to the private sector because of
the much higher salaries. As this is a problem common to all state
enterprises, the Government is reviewing their overaLl salary structure to
remedy the situation. HB management is also fully conscious of the problem
and, as an interim measure, has decided to offer additional fringe benefits to
the technical staff.
8.       Staff Training:  HB has a seperate department for staff training but
its activites are largely confined to commercial banking. The staff engaged
in lending to industry for investment purposes has to develop expertise in
development banking and this would require training in project identification,
appraisal and supervision. Arrangements for staff training in this area are
described in para 14. The proposed project includes technical assistance of
US$50,000 for staff training.
9.       Policies and Procedures:  HB operates on the basis of numerous
Government policy instructions and internal administrative circulars. The
decisions on investment loans are made after a review of the technical.
financial and market aspects of the project but the financial structure of the
borrower and the collateral for the loans are given high importance. There is
no formal supervision of projects but branch offices maintain close
relationship with clients and closely monitor their liquidity and financial
position. There is a need for more development-orientation in the operations



- 58 -
of HB by incre-.ing the emphasis on project viability rather than the loan
collateral Paad directing/coordinating technical assistance to SSI. This would
require an increase in the number and improvement in the capability of the
technical staff of HB (paras 7 and 14).
10.      The Federal Republic of Germany has approved a technical assistance
program for small metal and wood-working and processing industries in three
selected regions of the country. The 3-year program is being implemented,
beginning August 1984, by GTZ in collaboration with HB. Under the program, a
German advisor has been provided to assist the head office and branches of HB
in the policies, procedures and criteria of assisting SSI, particularly the
above mentioned sub-sectors. In addition, four engineers/technicians have
been provided at the selected regional offices of HB.
11.      Procurement and Disbursement:  RB's procurement procedures for
purchase of goods under its loans are based on adequate shopping (i.e.
canvassing with several suppliers/sellers). The borrower consults with the
technical staff of RB on types of equipment and prices and contracts/purchases
are made only after the full satisfaction of HB staff. Under the proposed
Benk loan, it will, however, be mandatory to obtain normally three bids from
different suppliers for goods estimated to cost US$10,000 or more. As regards
disbursement procedures, working capital loans are disbursed immediately upon
the loan approval. Investment loans are disbursed against actual invoices.
These procedures are satisfactory.
12.      Institutional Strengthening:  HB's institutional strengthening has to
take a two-pronged approach. In the immediate future, there is a need for
improvement in HB's project identification, appraisal and supervision and,
over the medium term, improvement is needed in the overall institutional
strucuture of HB and its general efficiency. Various measures for the
institutional strengthening of HB on the basis of above approach are discussed
in paras. 13-16 below.
13.      HB did not have a formal policy statement which would clearly define
its policies and criteria for assistance to the industrial sector. During
loan negotiations, a draft policy statement was discussed and agreed between
the Bank and HB representatives and was later adopted by HB's Board. It
provides for greater emphasis on the promotional activities of HB including
technical assistance to its borrowers, and specifies economic and financial
criteria of assistance.
14.      HB should also increase the number of financial analysts/economists
in the Industrial Credit Department and should take measures to improve their
professional capability for project appraisal and supervision. In order to
meet the immediate requirements, the management of RB confirmed that it would
increase the number of above-mentioned staff by 8 to 12 and arrange for
on-the-job training of 10 engineers and economists/financial analysts in DFCs
in Turkey. In addition, HB's management agreed to appoint a training officer
who would prepare a medium-term training program, within six months of his
appointment, for the development of staff expertise in the identification,
appraisal, and supervision of investment projects. The appointment of
additional staff and their training has now been completed. During
negotiations, assurances were received from HB on the appointment of the
training officer before submitting the first application for withdrawal under
a sub-loan.



- 59 -
15.      In order to intensify its assistance to SSI enterprises, HB will also
seek active coordination of the Small Industrial Development Organization
(SIDO). SIDO will assist HB subprojects, upon request, ln solving the
technical, management, and marketing problems on a cost-sharing basis (Annex
4, para 36).
16.      While the above measures would help to bring an imediate improvement
in the capability of HB to identify, appraise, and supervise SMI sub-projects,
it would be desirable to consider an indepth review of the overall
institutional structure of HB to bring long-term improvements. The
institutional structure of HB has remained almost unchanged despite a rapid
growth in operations and size of organization. The operations of HB are
expected to grow at an accelerated rate in the future as the fifth Five Year
Plan (1985-89) puts special emphasis on the development of SSI and the
enlarged role of RB for this purpose. An in-depth review of the institutional
structure of HB would lead to appropriate adjustments which may be called for
(i) to respond effectively to the new and growing role of HB, partic'Aiarly
with respect to a greater development-orientation in its operations; and (ii)
to improve cost and operational efficiency. This can be accomplished through
a study which should review mainly (a) organizational structure, policies, and
procedures, (b) accounting, internal auditing and management information
system, and (c) the developmental role of RB. The study should make
recommendations for further institutional strengthening of EB and means to
improve efficiency. The findings and recommendations of the study will be
reviewed by the management of HB, and based thereon, HB will prepare, in
consultation with the Bank, an action program and its timetable for
implementation by the management of HB. The implementation of the program
could be further supported in a second Bank loan to HB. The study is
estimated to cost about US$300,000 and is covered in the technical assistance
for HB in the proposed project. The consultants will be selected in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The terms of reference of the study
(Attachment 2) were agreed during negotiations.
(ii)     Operations
17.      Overall Operations:  HB's operations have grown very rapidly in the
last decade. During the 1981-1984 period alone, its total loans increased by
165% to about TL 207 billion (US$ 475 million). The increase in real terms
was 1.5%. HB's loans are made through four different credit departments.
These are Commercial Credit, Industrial Credit, Cooperative Credit and Funds
Credit Departments. The Commercial Credit Department's lending focuses on
trade financing, and loans to consumer and professionals. The Funds Credit
Department is responsible mainly for channelling bilateral aid or expatriate
funds (e.g. Turkish workers abroad) mainly to industrial estates and other
specialized purposes. The Cooperative Credit Department lends to cooperatives
and members of cooperatives who are involved in very small SSI, and artisanal
and handicraft operations. The Industrial Credit Department lends to SMI for
working capital and investment purposes. As of December 31, 1984, the credit
portfolio of the different departments was distributed as follows: commercial
(21%), cooperatives (23%), funds (31%) and industrial (25%).



- 60 -
I        ,.
18.      Industrial Sector Landing: The major portion of financing of SKI
projects by jthe Industrial Credit Department has been for working capital.
The total loans for the SSI 1/ amounted to TL 97 billion (US*250 million) in
1984 of which the working ci^ital loans were TL 91 billion (US$235 million)
and the equipment loans were TL 6 billion (US$ 15.5 million).  SSI investmnt
loans have increased at an average rate of 441 p.a. during 1981-1984 period.
The total loans for non-SSI (largely HSI) 1/ were TL 135 billion in 1984 (US$
348 million) and the share of equipment and vorking capital loans was 501
each. The total investment financing of U8*180 million equivalent constitutes
only a small part of HB's overall activities.
19.      The growth between 1981-1984 in industrial crodit portfolio
(including both short and lonrterm loans) was by 141X to TI. 48.0 billion
(US*110 million) at the end of 1984. The credit available for investment to
the small businesses and industry out of this departmet was TL 21 billion
(US48 million) at the end of 1984; an increase of about 1901 during the
1981-1984 period or an increase of 41 in real term. Analysis of XB's
industrial credit portfolio during the 1981-1984 period by sector,
geographical location, size, and repayment term is given in Attachment 3.
During this period, the main sub-sectoral beneficiaries of iB's loans have
been machinery and electricals (21.6Z), chemicals and plastics (16.11), food
(14.41), forest products (11.31), steel and metal works (8.7M), textile and
leather products (8.5Z). About 241 of the portfolio was for loans of less
than TL 1 million in size; 201 being between TL 1 to 10 million and 561 above
TL 10 million range.
(iii)    Financial Situation
20.      Profitability:  EB's income statements for 1981-1984 are given in
Attachment 4. Although BB is not a profit-motivated institution, its net
profit was TL 5.2 billion (49Z of equity), TL 2.9 billion (191 of equity) and
Th 2.2 billion (12X of equity) and TL 10.3 (251 of equity) at the end of 1981,
1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively. The decline in profit from 1981 to 1983 is
primarily due to the increase in interest on deposits in 1982 without a
corresponding increase in interest income. The interest rates on EB's loan
portfolio have, however, been adjusted in 1983 and the net income in 1984 has
increased to TL 10.3 billion. HB's average interest spread was 7Z in 1982, 61
in 1983 and 9Z in 1984 which is high by international standards. HB's
administrative expenses as a share of total assets between 1981-1984 have also
been high at 3-42 mainly due to the large number of branches and the small
size of sub-loans of HB.
I/ This breakdown is based on HB's own internal definitions of SSI and HSI.
SSI includes very small enterprises, i.e. those with less than 25
employees and less than TI 80 million (US$ 190,000) capital investment
(excluding land and building). HSI enterprises are those having capital
(excluding land and buildings) between TI 80 million to TL 300 million
(US$190,000 to US$700,000).



- 61 -
21.      Financial Positlon:  RD's balance sheets for 1981-1984 are provided
in Attachment 5. Its total assets increased substantially in current prices
from TL 127.0 billion at the end of 1981 to TL 463.0 billion at the end of
1984. Although the average annual increase during the period was 54%., the
increase in real terms was 13S p.a. The paid-in capital of HB has increased
from TL 4.9 billion to TL 11.5 billion during the 1981-1984 period. At the
end of 1984, the total debt I/ -equity ratio stood at 12:1 which is low for a
commercial bank, and an indication of a sound and conservative lending
policy. The total debt/equity r&tio is also well within the maximum limit of
20:1 required by the Central Bank for all commercial banks. HD follows sound
liquidity policies and complies with the liquidity reserve requirement of the
Central Bank. Its liquid assets (cash or cash convertibles) have been more
than 501 of the deposits and a special provision equivalent to about 20% of
demand and time deposits has been maintained to preserve liquidity. HB has
maintained various provisions and reserves to safeguard against possible
losses and to meet legal requirements, and these totalled to TL 13.1 billion
at the end of 1984.
22.      Resource Mobilization:  As of December 31, 1984, HB had the following
sources of funds:
Table 4.2: HB: SOURCES OF FUNDS - DECEMBER 31, 1984
(TL Billion)
December 31,
Sources                                  1984

Other Sources                             82.5   17.8
TOTAL                               463.0  100.0
Through its extensive network of branches, HB is in a position to raise its
resources by accepting deposits from large state enterprises as well as
private individuals. This accounted for 55.52 of its resources as of December
31, 1984. The Central Bank rediscount facility and the Government Fund
accounted for about 17.7X of its resources as of December 31, 1984. The
remaining sources of funds are shareholders' equity (91) and other specialized'
and bilateral sources (181) which are provided to HB either cost-free, or at
low rates of interest. HB expects to meet its future fund requirements mainly
by increase in deposits and other traditional sources; the proposed Bank loan
of US$18.75 million for BB to be a small part of its total resources (para
25). Another possible source of funds is KfW.
1/ Includes short-term and long-term deposits and borrowings.



- 62 -
23.      Quality of Portfolio:  HB follows conservative loan collateral policy.
Its loans are fully secured by mortgages and/or personal or bank guarantees.
The arrears are low considering the nature of HB operations and only a small
percentage of loans have been rescheduled, and only for short periods. Total
arrears for all credits at the end of 1984 were TL 8.1 billion (US$ 18.6 mil-
lion) or about 3.9Z of the loan portfolio of TL 207 billion (USS 475 million).
Total rescheduled loans in 1984 were TL 400 million (US$1 million). HB's
branch offices play an effective role in loan collection and help prevent an
increase in arrears. The legal department of HB takes legal action in the
event of a missed interest or principal payment within three months of the
default to recover the amount outstanding. The total "in court" amount for
industrial credits was TL 2.9 billion (US$ 6.7 m_llion) as of December 31,
1984, and was approximately 6% of total industrial credits. An amount of TL
200 million (US$ 500,000) or 0.41 of the industrial credit portfolio was
rescheduled in 1984. The arrears in the industrial sector are a little higher
than the overall average of EB and are reflective of the problems faced by the
industry in Turkey in the recent past (para 2.15 in the text). It is however
anticipated that the overall recovery of the industrial sector and the
institutional strengthening of HB (paras 12 to 16) would contribute to an
improvement in debt servicing by industrial enterprises.
24.      Audit:  HB's financial statements are audited by Basbakanlik Yuksek
Demetreme Kurulu (High Board of Auditors in the Prime Minister's Office ).  In
addition to the High Board of Auditors, the Bankalar Yeminli Murakiplau
(Bankers' Sworn Supervisor in the Treasury) are authorized to inspect the
accounts of HB and to check the compliance with the banking laws in the event
of any discrepancy or fault-finding by the High Board of Auditors or any other
concerned agency. The audit is carried out in accordance with the
Government's requirements for the state enterprises and HB's accounts have
been found satisfactory by the auditors. HB will submit its annual audited
accounts to the Bank on a regular basis as a condition of the proposed loan.
(iv)     Future Operations and Prospects
25.      Operational Forecast:  HB's loan portfolio is estimated to increase
by 110% (to TL 670 billion) in current prices during the 1985-1988 period.
Short-term working capital loans are expected to increase faster than medium
and long-term investment loans because of working capital shortages faced by
business and industry in general. It is estimated that short-term loans would
be about 65Z of the portfolio by 1988. The relative share of HB's various
credit departments in loan portfolio would remain almost unchanged and would
be 261 for cooperative credits, 23% for industrial credits, 22% for commuercial
credits and 29% for funds credits. The industrial credit portfolio is
expected to increase from TL 74.5 billion at the end of 1985 to TL 150 billion
at the end of 1988; an increase of 262 p.a. The investment loans in the
industrial sector are estimated at about 251 of the total. During 1986-88,
the expected period of commitments of the proposed Bank loan, total
commitments of investment loans for the industry would be about TL 69 billion
(US$ 80 million equivalent) of which about TL 46 billion (US$54 million
equivalent) would be for the procurement of machinery and equipment.

26.      Proiected Profitability and Financial Position:  Projected income
statements and balance sheets of RB for 1985 to 1988 are provided in
Attachments 6 and 7. HB is expected to maintain adequate profits with net
profit before taxes estimated at TL 8.5 billion in 1985 and increasing to TL
15.5 billion in 1988, an increase of 22S p.a. in nominal terms. The return on
equity would be about 18S during the period. Appropriations for taxes and
duties will be equal to 27%, the remaining 732 will be mainly allocated to
reserves. HB's total debt/equity ratio will increase from 12.0 at the end of
1984 to 14.1 at the end of 1988 and would be within the limit of 20.0 imposed
by the Central Bank for all commercial banks. HB's liquidity position would
also continue to be satisfactory.

Draft Terms of Reference for
Review of the Institutional Structure of Halk Bankasi (HB)
1. Obiectives
Halk Bankasi (HB) has had a very rapid growth in the last decade.
During the 1979-1983 period alone, its total credits and investment loans
increased by more than 400% to TL 160 billion, its regional and branch offices
increased by 16% to 610, and its staff increased by 272 to 11,700. The
operations of HB are expected to grow at an accelerated rate in the future as
the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) puts special emphasis on the
development of SSI and the enlarged role of HB for this purpose. The past
performance of HB, as measured by its financial position and quality of
portfolio, has been satisfactory despite little changes in its basic
institutional structure, including policies, procedures, systems and
management controls. However, it would now be appropriate to have an in-depth
review of the institutional structure of RB and to consider appropriate
adjustments which may be called for to effectively respond to future
challenges, particularly the need for a greater development orientation in the
operations of HB. In addition, the review should consider way and means to
improve cost and operational efficiency which is highly desirable for
commercial banks in Turkey. The above objectives are to be achieved through a
study to review the following main areas.
2. Main Components of the Study
(a) Organizational Structure, Policies and Procedures
The organizational structure, policies and procedures of HB should be
reviewed to determine whether they provide for the most effective and
efficient realization of HB's main objectives including mobilization of
savings; provision of various types of credits; promoting the development of
SMI; and the appraisal and supervision of projects. The study should take
into account the grouping of main functions and the division of responsibility
at and the relationship between the head office, regional offices and
branches; and the delegation of authority at various management levels. It
should also examine HB's present policies and procedures including circulars
and instructions for processing, approving and supervising various types of
credits. The study, in consultation with 1B's management and keeping in view
future trends in HB's operations, should (i) make specific recommendations for
further strengthening of the organizational structure of HB with the
objectives of increased efficiency and cost-savings; (ii) propose any change
necessary in the present policies of BB, particularly in respect to resource
mobilization, lending and investments, financial structure, interest spread,
provisions and reserves, and personnel and training; (iii) prepare an
operational manual defining a comprehensive and standard set of procedures for
the appraisal and supervision of investment projects to be financed under
different types of credits; and (iv) determine the adequacy of staffing at

present and projections for 1987-90 at HB's head office, regional offices and
branches on the basis of the review of the organizational structure, policies
and procedures and highlight areas where manpower may be redeployed for
greater efficiency.
(b) Accounting, Auditing and Management Information System
The study should review (i) the application of the new accounting
system and procedures (to be effective from January 1, 1986) in HB and their
functioning; (ii) the internal audit system and standards to ensure the
accuracy of financial transactions and compliance with policies, procedures
and guidelines at various levels in the organization; and (iii) the management
information system to enhance its effectiveness as a tool of management. The
study should also make necessary recommendations including improvements in the
effective functioning of the new accounting system and procedures,
computerization of accounts, internal auditing, and the management information
system.
{c) Developmental Role
The study should review the development role of HB, particularly for
the promotion of SMI. In order to achieve the developmental objectives as
laid down in the articles of incorporation of HB, the study should recommend
new activities and appropriate institutional strengthening at the head office,
regional offices and branches of HB.
3. Cost, Financing and Timing of the Study
It is estimated that the study would cost about $300,000 including
contingencies. The study should commence by June 30, 1986 and should be
completed in about 9 months.
4. Follow-up on Findings and Recommendations
The findings and recommendations of the study will be reviewed by the
management of HB and based thereon, HZ will prepare within three months after
the completion of study an action program and its timetable for
implementation. A copy of the study will also be provided to the Bank upon
completion and the Bank will provide comments thereon to assist HB in the
preparation of the above program. The study may recommend certain action
plans, particularly in the areas of internal auditing, computerization, and
management information system, which may need the serviceb of experts to
prepare comprehensive details and assist in their implementation. Any funds
required for the engagement of such experts will be provided by HB out of its
own budget.

Annex 4
V. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SMI DEVELOPMENT
A. Background
1.       Small and medium scale industrial enterprises (SMI) in Turkey suffer
in varying degrees from the same difficulties that characterize such
enterprises in almost all developing countries, namely poor management,
obsolete and inadequate equipment, limited access to finance and to new and
improved technologies and marketing problems (paras 2.15-2.16 in the text).
The dynamism of Turkish entrepreneurs has helped to mitigate these problems to
a considerable extent but there remains substantial scope for further
improvements. The development of economically efficient SMIs can help to
check the rapidly growing urban unemployment in Turkey. Thus, technologies
introduced must reflect the most appropriate factor relationship between
capital and labor.
2.       The technical assistance required by. SMI should be geared to the
current needs of small enterprises in Turkey aibd this, above all else, is for
improved technology, greater orientation towards exporting, enhanced ability
to produce products that are competitive in price, quality, and delivery, and
improvement in management training and skills of SMI managers. A greater
degree of linkages with larger industries and trading corporations through
subcontracting and exporting contracts Is critically needed to allow access to
national and international markets. Moreover, technical assistance can help
ensure that the financial credits made available through banks can be
effectively used by SMIs.
3.       Until now SMIs have had very limited access to technical assistance
services. Over the years a number of institutions have been established to
provide advice and information in technical and management fields, such as the
National Productivity Center (NPC); Industrial Training and Development Center
(SEGCE), which has evolved programs of specialized training; Scientific and
Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) Turkish Documentation Center
(TURDOK), with excellent technical research facilities and an active
information service; and other more specialized subsectoral institutes such as
that for the leather industry at Pendik. Although these institutions have
been effective in assisting large industry, few of their activities have been
directed towards the small scale sector.
4.       Existing Technical Assistance Programs for SMI.  With the support of
UNDP/UNIDO, the Small Industry Development Organization (SIDO) established a
demonstration center (pilot project) in 1970 in Gaziantep in Eastern Turkey to
help small industries of that district. 1/ The Center which comprises common
facilities for the metal working industries has had very limited impact.
L/ Originally, the project started as an industrial estate with some common
facilities. Subsequently, the project was expanded into a demonstration
center.



- 73 -
Because of its location in a provincial town, the Center has been unable to
attract adequately qualified engineering staff. The emphasis has been on
demonstrating the use of relatively complex machinery and technology involving
metal working operations. Small workshops have been unable to assimilate the
advanced technology or apply it to their production operations. The Center
has not paid sufficient attention to developing effective extension services
which would have assessed the actual technological needs of SSI and helped to
meot these needs. The assistance given to SSI has been limited to general
information and some tool and die-making help. Some large firms in the
Gaziantep area also have been assisted. A UNIDO expert reported in mid-1984
that the common facilities at Gaziantep (machine shops, metallurgical labs,
heat treatment shops, etc..) were being used at below 30X capacity. Recently,
SIDO has made some headway in recruiting qualified engineers by offering
additional incentives. Also, it is recruiting extension personnel to
establish closer liuks with the SSI community. This effort should help
improve the effectiveness of the Center.
5.       In 1975, UNDP/UNIDO proposed to the Government to expand SIDO into a
national institution to help small enterprises. It recommended the
establishment of centers similar to that in Gaziantep throughout the country
with the idea that each would serve a specific industrial sub-sector. Ankara
was selected as the site for the second center specializing in the foundry
industries. After some delays, in June 1983, the Government approved the UNDP
project for the Ankara foundry center and also decided that SIDO would operate
as a semi-autonomous body of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) with
the objective of providing technical assistance'and other extension services
to small and medium scale industries at the national level. Thus a new
direction was given to SIDO.
6.       The immediate objectives of the SIDO/UNIDO project are to convert
Gaziantep to a regional center with a special capability to assist small scale
metal industries, to set up the Ankara center for foundry industries and to
help SIDO develop an extension service. The UNDP input towards the project
for a three-year period starting October 1, 1983 is estimated at US$912,150 of
which about US$400,000 is earmarked for foundry equipment and the remainder
for technical advisory assistance. The Government input for the project is
estimated. at TL1,420 million (US$6.5 million). As of December 31, 1984, UNIDO
had provided a SSI expert to advise and assist in the overall planning and
execution of the project and to formulate a strategy for strengthening SIDO.
The remaining advisory inputs comprise technical experts for the foundry
center and some short term consultants (about 55 man-months).
7.       SIDO currently has a total staff of 72 of which 6 are employed at
SIDO headquarters and the remaining 66 at Gaziantep. Besides the General and
Deputy General Director, SIDO headquarters employs three engineers who are
supervising the implementation of the Ankara foundry center. These engineers
are expected to move to the Ankara center after it is established. The
Gaziantep center has 11 professionals of whom four are business economists.
Because of the difficulty of finding qualified extension sta'f, SIDO
management is building up staff slowly even though adequate budget is
available. Twelve professionals are proposed to be recruited by December
1986. SIDO's operating budget was TL140 million in 1984 and is estimated at
TL240 million in 1985 which is adequate. The SIDO management team appears



- 74 -
competent and qualified. Both managers have had considerable experience in
small industry development. SIDO's operations are reviewed by a governing
body chaired by the Deputy Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Industry and
Technology which includes a representative of the Halk Bank.
8.       SIDO's New Strategy for Technical Assistance.  SIDO's management, in
the light of its experience with Gaziantep, have embarked on a new strategy
for assisting SMI. They have recognized that for SIDO to be effective it
should develop as an extension institution to promote the use of technical
assistance; to stimulate the availability of service programs, training,
consultancies, and financial assistance geared to the needs of SHI; and to act
as a referral agency to other specialized institutions or individuals who
would be able to provide more complete and specialized services. Thus, SIDO
will need to marshall other technical assistance resources available in Turkey
in this effort, as mentioned above, as well as give a new orientation to its
own activities. This will entail: (a) a greater emphasis by staff on
diagnosis of SMI problems and their referral either to specialized
institutions or to short term consultants able to provide solutions;
(b) assisting SMI to become more involved in promoting exports, including
feostering closer linkages with export trading corporations as well as
orienting their product development towards external markets; (c) designing
and presenting training programs for SSI entrepreneurs on its own and with the
assistance of other institutions; (d) expanding management assistance efforts
to improve management of SMIs; (e) giving a stronger focus on providing access
of SMIs to new technologies; and (f) becoming more involved in preparing
projects for sub-borrowers of Halk Bankasi.
B. Proposed Technical Assistance for SIDO
9.       The proposed project will assist SIDO in the implementation of its
development strategy (para 8) with a modest beginning. It will provide
assistance to SIDO over a three-year period to (i) strengthen its overall
organization, management and staff capability; (ii) develop a decentralized
program of extension services; (iii) develop a capability in the field of
technical information and to achieve a faster response to requests for help;
(iv) develop an efficient system to utilize other resource organizations and
consultants in its efforts to improve the operations of SKI. The important
elements of this technical assistance program include consultant services,
training, equipment and reference materiala, and other institutional support
for SIDO. The impact of SIDO's new development strategy as well as the range
and cost-effectiveness of its overall activities, including the role of two
demonstration centers at Gaziantep and Ankara, will be reviewed by the
Government with SIDO in mid-1987 and end-1988 (which would be the middle and
end respectively of the implementation of the T.A. component of the project)
and its findings and conclusions will be discussed with the Bank with the
objective of adjusting/redirecting the strategy and activities of SIDO, if
necessary, in the light of experience gained during the period. The foreign
exchange cost of the program (see summary table below) to be financed under
the proposed Bank loan is estimated at US$1.25 million and the local currency
requirements of SIDO to support the proposed program of technical assistance
are estimated at TL 330 million during 1986-88 in 1985 prices (details in
Attachment 1).

gi)  Organizational Development of SIDO
10.      The proposed project will help strengthen SIDO's organization
structure and management capability to carry out the envisioned program of
developmental assistance to the SMI sector. SIDO will establish six branch
offices in addition to the Ankara and Gaziantep centers to develop a national
program of extension services. It will also need to strengthen its
headquarters staffing by hiring at least 5 professionals by June 30, 1986 to
manage this program and to operate a computerized information system linking
headquarters and branches (see Attachment 2 for details). The overall program
will require SIDO to recruit some 40 professionals during 1986-88, in addition
to its current recruitment plan to hire 12 professionals by end 1986, mainly
for the Ankara center. Given the paucity of experienced staff, the program
includes a substantial training component for SIDO personnel (para 17).



- 76 -
11.      The Establishment of six New Branch Offices.  Between 1986-88 SIDO
will establish six new branches apart from the Centers at Gaziantep and
Ankara. These will be developed approximately at a rate of two per year. The
new branches are likely to be located in Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Adaiia, Konya,
and Eskisehir which are important centers of SMI. Each branch will need a
minimum staffing of 5 professionals within the first two years of
establishment apart from those who will be employed directly in the regional
centers at Gaziantep, and Ankara. To ensure the efficient operation at both
headquarters and branch offices, it will be necessary to recruit adequate
support personnel - at least four support personnel including secretaries and
drivers at each branch office. rhe final actual staffing at each branch will
depend on the development of business.
12.      Organization and Procedural Changes.  With the help of the Planning
and Training Advisor (para 15) SIDO management will introduce appropriate
organizational and procedural changes to allow maximum autonomy to the
branches and centers.
13.      Staff Training.  With the addition of new operational systems and new
activities, SIDO will need to mount internal staff training programs (paras
17-18) to ensure that new staff would carry out their task: in a satisfactory
manner.
14.      The technical assistance component will assist SIDO's organizational
strengthening by financing the following expert assistance.
15.      Planning and Training Advisor.  SIDO will recruit by July 1, 1986 an
advisor to assist in planning the new crganization of SIDO, designing and
developing training programs for SIDO : aff, and developing criteria for
assisting SMIs (para 15). The advisor will also participate directly in the
training of staff for the various programs. Estimated cost: US$54,000.
Detailed terms of reference for the advisor are given in Attachment 2.
16.      Equipment and Reference Material.  SIDO headquarters will expand its
basic information resources by acquiring appropriate handbooks, reference
publications, and periodicals, including small collections of similar
materials for each branch office. Estima'.d cost: US$30,000.
17.      Overseas Training.  (i) Study tours for SIDO management personnel
will be provided to visit effective industrial extension organizations mainly
in developed countries to observe administrative policies, procedures and
programs. This will assist in creating and maintaining an administrative
awareness of international industrial extension practices. Three persons for
an average of one month each will participate to be utilized during 1986-87.
(ii) Training tours for SIDO professional staff will be provided at
appropriate organizations, which will include working assignments and short
tours of relevant industrial subsectors as well as training on management
information sytems for extension activities. Approximately 15 person-months
of training will be made available in all to be utilized during 1986-88.
Total estimated cost: US$70,000.



- 77 -
18.      Local Training on Computer Information Systems.  SIDO will take
appropriate measures to meet the training needs of its headquarters and branch
staff in this area.
(ii) Strengthening of Extension Activities
19.      SIDO's existing embryonic extension services will be strengthened to
include increased emphasis on a number of activities as mentioned below. SIDO
will also hire a Branch Office Manager to coordinate and supervise the
extension activities of the branch offices.
20.      Problem Diagnosis and Referral.  The industrial extension
professionals will continue to handle and resolve problems which fall within
their capabilities. However, many problems will require the expertise of
outside consultants. In such cases, it will be the responsibility of SIDO
personnel to diagnose the SMI problems and to refer the SMIs to qualified
short-term consultants. These consultants will negotiate contracts with the
SMIs using funds provided for their services on a cost-sharing basis (para
35). It is estimated that, at full operations, SIDO staff at branches will be
able to visit about 900 SMI enterprises and provide further technical
assistance to about 350 such firms per year.
21.      Export Promotion.  Assisting SMIs to export requires meeting
international standards of quality and packaging, competitive pricing and an
awareness of export rules and regulations. A program of information, training
and assistance for SMIs to encourage and stimulate their export potentials
will be developed and implemented by SIDO. A number of foreign short-term
advisors will assist in helping to identify new markets for SMI products and
providing guidance and feedback on product acceptability and conformance with
delivery requirements. Assistance from export trading companies will be
sought to meet these objectives. About 40 SMI enterprises will be assisted
per year for export promotion.
22.      Entrepreneur Training.  SIDO will develop training programs for SMI
entrepreneurs to cover specific subject areas to be identified through surveys
and analysis. Other institutions e.g. SEGEM, NPC, will assist in course
presentations. A typical program will be a one- to three-day seminar or
workshop, aimed at improving the problem-solving capabilities of the
participants and improving their managerial and technical competence. SIDO
will hire a Training Manager at headquarters to plan, coordinate and assist in
its training activities. About 200 entreprreneurs per year would participate
in training programs.
23.      To strengthen SIDO's extension activities, the following elements
will be financed under the technical assistance program.
24.      Advisory Assistance.  (i) An Entrepreneur Training Advisor to be
recruited by July 1, 1986 to develop training programs for SMI owners and
managers, and (ii) short-term technical advisors to assist in the development
of SMI exports. These advisors will le recruited during 1986-88 in line with
the estimates in Attachment 1. Estimated cost: US$136,000. Detailed terms
of reference are given in Attachment 3.



- 78 -
25.      Other Institutional Support. Links between SIDO and export trading
companies will be developed; these firms will assist SIDO in undertaking
market research, publication of catalog, and brochures, and other related
activities to help SMI's export activities. Estimated cost: US$10,000.
(iii) Development of Information System
26.      SIDO's problem-solving capability will be strengthened, its technical
resources improved, its response time shortened, and its ability to monitor
the effectiveness of its technical extension activities improved with the
development of an information system made up of the following elements:
27.      Computerized Data Bases.  A computerized information system will be
developed, involving data bases with primary and secondary data from surveys
and other soutrces and linked through a micro-computer network to all SIDO
units. This will expedite the collection, storage and retrieval of
information, the transmission of data, messages and reports, and provide
better managemert control of the extension and technical advisory services.
28.      Inter-firm Linkages.  This will utilize stored company profiles and
other data bases. The system will expedite the development and strengthening
of inter-company linkages to promote sub-contracting, procurement, export
contactu and other needed services.
29.      Technical Information Dissemination.  The computerized information
system will permit the dissemination of technical information and data to SMIs
through the SIDO industrial extension branch offices and centers.
30.      The computer system will also be used for planning, monitoring and
supervising the extension service activities and for promoting inter-firm
Linkages, particularly sub-contracting and export marketing links with trading
companies. The information system will allow SIDO branches to develop a data
bank on the SMI population in their service areas, monitor the extension
services requested and follow up on the impact of the services provided.
Resources devoted to these activities can be altered depending on the effect-
iveness of the programs. The computerized information system will permit SIDO
to maintain an up to date inventory of equipment and facilities of SMI inter-
ested in exporting or sub-contracting and enable SIDO to facilitate such
links. SIDO will hire three information specialists at headquarters to manage
this program.
31.      The project will help in the development of the information system as
follows:
32.      Consultant Services.  A Data Systems Analyst to be recruited by
September 1, 1986: (i) to design the computerized information system which
will link all SIDO offices, (ii) to train SIDO staff in computer system use,
data gathering, storage and retrieval; (iii) to assist in developing needed
data bases; and (iv) to promote use of computer systems for SMIs where
appropriate. Estimated cost: US$60,000. Detailed terms of reference for the
Data Systems Analyst are given irn Attachment 3.



- 79 -
33.      Equipment and Reference Materials.  A basic equipment package will be
financed for each branch office (6 total) and the two existing centers. The
equipment package will consist of the following items: one 256K expandable
microcomputer, with letter quality printer, other peripheral equipment and
software programs, connected by modem to the headquarter's computer; one
electric typewriter; one photocopier; one audio-visual package consisting of
35 mm camera, projectors, portable screens, VCR, TV monitor, and storage
cabinet; two office vehicles; and computer and office supplies. 1/. Estimated
cost: US$300,000.
34.      Headquarters Computer and Office Equipment.  This package will
include a multi-processing computer with peripheral equipment, two electric
typewriters, one word processor, one photo copier, an audio-visual equipment
package for training and one vehicle 1/. Estimated cost: US$ 45,000.
(iv) Technical Advisory Services
35.      The use of resources and capabilities of other organizations can help
SIDO provide a broader range of expertise and specialized assistance to SMI.
SIDW will, therefore, develop and maintain a roster of approved technical
consultants (private consultants as well as consultants from other
organizations in Turkey) able to provide assistance to SMI in various fields.
Following diagnostic surveys by SIDO staff of problems.and of the need for
assistance, firms will be recommended to make use of experts from other
organizations or individual specialized consultants. Assistance to SMIs for
financing such services will be provided on a cost-sharing basis with the
recipient enterprise paying up to one-third of the costs in the beginning and
the balance being provided by SIDO. The -onsultants on the roster vill be
drawn from the public and private sector, from research centers, universities,
consulting organizations and other sources of expertise. Detailed criteria
and procedures for evaluating and approving individual assistance will be
developed by SIDO in the light of the recommendations of the Planning and
Training Adviser.
36.      Advisory services will be available primarily for three main types of
activities: (i) SMI Management. Improvements in organization, procedures,
planning, controls, systems; (ii) Marketing. Market research, distribution
for domestic and export sales, packaging, product development aad
diversification, subcontracting links; (iii) Technology and Productivity.
Product design, production and process improvement, plant layout, material
handling, introduction of new technologies, quality control, etc. The
advisory services will not be available for financing routine business
activities such as auditing, legal services, architectural services for
expansion, etc.. All participating consultants and organizations will agree
to a SIDO prescribed daily fee, an upper limit on the number of days to be
made available to any single enterprise in any one year, and the length and
scope of any single assignment. It is estimated that about 250 enterprises
will benefit from technical advisory services to be supported by US$400,000
allocated in the technical assistance program for SMI. This area of activity
will be of a pilot nature and SIDO will review its effectiveness, cost-sharing
basis for services, and criteria and procedures for evaluating and approving
of assistance to SMI during project implementation, and will make adjustments



- 80 -
an necessary. SIDO will continue to arrange the technical advisory services
for SMI on an appropriate cost-sharing basis subject to satisfactory results
of these services. Satisfactory assurances were received from the Government
to this effect during negotiations.
37.      Procurement:  Goods and services will be procured by SIDO according
to the Bank's guidelines. Bid packages valued at beLow US$250,000 will be
procured through international shopping based on price quotations from at
least three suppliers. Items costing US$250,000 or more will be procured
according to the Bank's ICB procedures. Consultants' selection will follow
Bank guidelines in this regard.
C. Monitoring of SIDO Technical Assistance Program
38.      The proposed technical assistance program would be a substantial
addition to SIDO's activities involving significant increases in its branches
and staff, introduction of a new computerized information system, provision of
extension services, promotion of sub-contracting, etc. The successful
implementation and operation of the program would, therefore, be a major
challenge to the SIDO management. However, no serious problems are foreseen
in this respect in view of the competence and considerable experience of the
SIDO management and the use of advisors. Nevertheless, to ensure that the
technical assistance component is adequately implemented and chat the
expansion of SIDO activities is carried out on schedule, a project monitoring
procedure is recommended in addition to the usual project supervision
procedures: (i) Copies of final reports by foreign advisors to SIDO will be
sent to the World Bank for review and comment. Briefing and debriefing
sessions will be held with the advisors as appropriate.
(ii) SIDO will prepare a semi-annual progress report for the World Bank.
(iii) SIDO will prepare a more complete annual report detailing activities,
expenditures and results as related to the annual goals under the program.
(iv) SIDO will maintain separate accounts for the expenditures under proposed
technical assistance component. These accounts will be audited and submitted
together with the annual accounts of SIDO for the Bank's review.

SIDO: The Computerized Information Syscem
1.        The computerized information system must be regarded as an essential
feature of tha technical aasistance component for SIDO. It will have two main
functions: (1) the gathering, storage and retrieval of data essential to
SIDO's operations; and (2) the improvement of communications and controls.
The establishment of six branch offires, in addition to existing and
contemplated centers, will make SIDO a largely decentralized organization. it
would not be practical or cost effective to suggest that each and every unit
of SIDO establish its own information center. The information system should
be in one location with easy access to that system by all SIDO units.
2.        The logical location for the information system is at SIDO head-
quarters in Ankara. It will be composed of computer data bases and a
collection of resource and reference materials. Each unit of SIDO will have a
small collection of basic handbooks and other printed materials useful in
providing industrial extension services. Each unit will also have a
microcomputer which is linked to the headquarters computer by telephonic
communication.
3.        Such computer networks exist in Turkey at present and they provide
practical solutions to transmittal of various kinds of information and
messages many hundreds of miles and to remote locations. This has been made
possible in the last decade by the marked improvement of the
telecommunications system of Turkey.
4.        As SIDO staff gain experience in the operation of the computerized
information system, additional uses of the information system will be
gradually introduced. A listing of uses includes:
(1) Development and utiliza.ion of data bases:
(a) Company profiles, in sufficient detail (skills, equipment,
capability, etc.) to permit matching of needs and oppor-
tunities with other organizations.
(b) List of qu2 ified consultants, de -;ling areas of expertise,
's* wie in onulting assignments.
(c) Lic of c-466ies with sub-contracting needs to permit
m t    q - th companies capable of producing under
suL Z -A -ct.
(d) List v. companies with export interest and/or potential.
(e) List -E export trading companies and areas of interest and
priM1a-y markets.
