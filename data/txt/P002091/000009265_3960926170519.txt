MEMORANDNM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR AN IMO HEALTH AND POPJLATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$27.6 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be payable over 20 years, including S
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate and would assist the
Government in its efforts to improve the health of the people of Imo State
and to provide voluntary family planning services.
2.        BackRround.  Despite improvements over the past two decades, health
conditions in Nigeria resemble those of its low-income neighbors and are poor
by international standards. Average life expectancy is about 51 years and
the infant mortality rate is 104 per 1,000 live births; maternal mortality is
also high. The population is estimated at around 100 million, growing at a
rapid 3.4Z per annum as a result of a still very high crude birth rate of
about 50 per 1,000 per annum and a crude death rate of 16 per 1,000. About
801 of recorded deaths are due to preventable diseases like pneumonia.
diarrhea, measles, tetanus, malaria, diphtheria, tuberculosis, cholera and
polio. Although data is limited, ttere may also be extensive malnutrition.
only part of it seasonal in nature. High fertility, and poor sanitation and
water also contribute to the poor health status of Nigerians. Health is a
concurrent responsibility of the Federal and state and local governments.
About 8OZ of health establishments and 70? of bed capacity are in the public
sector. Many such establishments, particularly at the primary level, are
undersupplied, inadequately staffed, and in poor condition, resulting in a
loss of public confidence and increasing underutilization.
3.        The problems are compounded by weak health sector institutions and
limited access to and the inefficiency of primary health care (PHC). Insti-
tutional constraints include: (a) overlapping and conflicting organizations
and areas of responsibility; (b) weak planning, management and evaluation
capability; (c) poor financial planning and budgeting; and (d) almost non-
existent health and management data. Service delivery issues include:
(i) an urban and curative bias of care; (ii) the near total dependence of the
sector on constrained budgetary resources; (iii) the failure to mobilize the
community in providing services; (iv) inappropriate skills and deplogment of
manpower; and (v) 'imited efforts to control fertility. Since 1980, there
has been a dramatic decrease in resources for priority health services and,
in addition, available resources have been poorly managed. Resource alloca-
tions between wage and non-wage costs have become highly skewed and more than
90? of recurrent costs now go for wages. This has led to shortages of drugs
and supplies, deterioration of facilities and equipment, and a demoralized
staff. As a result, the quality of curative services has suffered, use has
declined, and preventive activit!es, such as immunization and control of
communicable diseases, are limited and sporadic..



4.        The Federal Government has now opted for a health policy that
emphasizes the expansion of rural caomunity-based PHC and preventive
services. The strategy centers on strengthening the planning, management and
evaluation capacities of relevant agencies, improving PHC services, and
mobilizing additional resources through cost recovery. The Government also
plans to implement the recently approved national population policy by estab-
lishing programs in each state.
5.        Imo State shares many of the features of the national health and
population picture. However, it has three distinguishing characteristics.
Its limited planning, management and evaluation capacity results more from a
lack of essential tools, such as an effective management information system
and requisite equipment, than from the lack of trained manpower. Clinical
health manpower is adequate but maldistributed, with hospitals and urban
clinics overstaffed and rural clinics understaffed. Finally, while access to
health facilities is generally better than elsewhere, the rapid deterioration
of public facilities and growing reliance on private ones have led to growing
inequities in access, particularly in the rural areas. The strategies for
health sector development and population in Imo State parallel those of the
Federal Government, with due modification in their implementation to reflect
Imo0' situation.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the health
and population sector is to help Nigeria develop ite human resources,
through, inter alia, institutional strengthening, increased access to and
improved quality of health services, and by finding a more sustainable
formula fo. the financing of health care, while addressing the overriding
problem of population growth. It follows the key features of the Govern-
ment's structural adjustment program (SAP) by emphasizing improved efficiency
in the health sector, limitin.g unneeded expansion of health facilities,
rehabilitating existing assets, and mobilizing additional resources through
cost recovery. Collaboration with the Government involves policy review,
programs/projects, and sector work at ;he national and state levels. A
sector review initiated in FY87 focuses on health finances at all levels of
government, and is proceeding to a micro-level examination of efficiency and
equity issues. Project lending hitherto has been at the individual state
level. However, a Health System Fund channelling funds through merchant
banks to State Ministries of Health is also under consideration, representing
a 'wholesaling, approach to state projects in order to extend coverage more
rapidly. FMOH is also preparing two Federally-managed programs, for
essential drugs and population, for Bank financing. The proposed project
emphasizes community-based primary health care and increased access to health
services in rural areas. It contributes to strengthening health planning and
project preparation nationwide, and to institutionalizing financial planning,
provision of essential drugs and a population program at the state level.
Components of the project should be replicable in other states and in
national projects. The project also follows the SAP in its emphasis on
efficiency, rehabilitation and resource mobilization.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project aims to assist the Imo State
Government in its efforts to improve the health and nutrition of the people
of Imo State and to provide voluntary family planning services. In addition,
the project aims to strengthen the Federal Ministry of Health's (FMOH)
capacity to assist state-level health planning and project preparation, and



-3-
to prepare Federal health and population projects for internal and external
financing.
8.        Proiect Description.  Part A. Imo State Activities:  (a) strength-
ening the capacity of local and state organizations to plan, implement, and
monitor community-based health, family planning (FP) and nutrition activities
and to improve their financial management and resource mobilization;
(b) creating the institutional framework for a population program by estab-
lishing a State Population Council and a university population studies
center; (c) supporting community-based PHC and FP activities; (d) improving
services in rural areas by upgrading about 60 existing dispensaries and
maternity homes into primary health clinics able to provide priority maternal
and child health/family planning services; renovating approximately 190
existing PHC facilities; and constructing (with community cost-sharing),
equipping and staffing about 40 new primary health clinics in unserved areas;
(e) improving drug supply and distribution by providing essential drugs and
establishing an Essential Drug Service with a drug revolving fund to ensure a
sustained supply; (f) establishing a disease survt-illance and diagnostic
service to support PEC; and (g) supporting inforiiwation, education, and com-
munication activities related to health, population, and nutrition. The
project vould include facility rehabilitation, equipment, vehicles, technical
assistance, training and fellowships. Part B. Federal Activities: Expand
and develop the capacity of FHOH to plan and monitor investment in health
services, including holding state-level workshops and seminars. The project
would provide funds for civil works, drugs and supplies, vehicles, furniture
and equipment, technical assistance and training. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$36.8 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$18.9 million (512). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements as well
as the d&.bursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report (Number 6921-UNI) dated September 1, 1988, is
being distributed separately.
9.        Actions Agreed:  The following agreements were reached with Imo
State Government: (a) review financial plan for health sector with Bank
annually; (b) PRC: reorganize SMOH support facilities; agree, implement and
review staffing plan for facilities; (c) Drugs: establish Essential Drug
Service and drug revolving fund (condition of disbursement for drugs); amend
essential drug list not more often than annually; (d) Cost Recovery: recover
recurrent costs, including full cost recovery of drugs, by bospitals of at
least 262 and PHC of at least 16Z; fees to be available at point of
collection, to be used for non-wage goods and services; (e) Population:
establish State Population Council; prepare state population program, and (f)
budgetary provision of counterpart funding. Conditions of Loan Effective-
ness: (a) adoption of Imo State essential drug policy; (b) execution of
subsidiary loan agreement between the Federal Government and Imo State
Government for on-lending on original terms and conditions; (c) appointment
of three kel staff to Project Coordination Unit; and (d) Imo State Government
opening of, and initial depodit into, project account.
10.       Justification.  The project's location in Imo State reflects a
desire to diversify Bank assistance to health and population to another of



the four major zones into which PMOH divides the country, the commitment of
the State and local government authorities, and lio State's relatively
stronger administrative and manpower situation. The project's support of
institutional development would improve the structure -- for financial plan-
ning, essential drugs and population. The focus on community-based health
and the provision of facilities in areas without either government or private
services would provide a more appropriate and equitable distribution of
services and a closer link between priority problems and resource allocation.
The matching grant program is an innovative way to extend health services to
the local level, building on local community commitment which is strong in
Imo. Cost recovery would generate additional revenues and eventually help
stabilize financing of the sector. The project would increase public aware-
ness of the consequences of rapid population growth and improve access to
voluntary family planni.g services, with the goal of reducing fertility.
Project components, such as the essential drugs service and state population
program are designe4 to serve as pilots for other states and for national
programs. The extensive private activities in the sector would continue, and
selected private sector providers would receive family planing supplies and
training, to complement the public services.
11.       Risks.  Possible risks includes  slow implementation and disburse-
ment due to project complexity and borrower inexperience, ineffective manage-
ment of the cost recovery schemes, lack of broad based commitment to
increased use of family planning, insufficient staff rationalization to
correct the recurrent budget imbalance and to ensure adequately trained staff
for project facilities. To minimize these risks, the project both takes
advantage of Imo's relatively stronger administrative capability and provides
a large amount of training and technical assistance, logistical and Institu-
tional support to both the Project Coordination Unit and other implementing
agencies. In addition, a pilot project is being launched, using PPP
financing, to assess the systems and strategies being introduced. Another
risk associated with Bank-assisted projects in Nigeria is delays in the
provision of counterpart funding. To minimize this risk, the Imo State
financial plan for health and the project work plan and budget would be
reviewed jointly with the Bank before each fiscal year.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
