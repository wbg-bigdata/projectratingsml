                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER



  A. SUMMARY

1.      The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the Chimborazo Development Investment Project
(P094784) identified the need to restructure the Project. Subsequent missions in 2011 and
2012 provided the data and agreements needed to prepare the project restructuring. This
Paper presents the proposed restructuring, which entails: (i) adjustment of the Results
Framework to better reflect Project activities; (ii) adjustments to the location of the
rehabilitated roads segments; (iii) reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect the actual costs at
the component level; (iv) update of the Project financing plan; and (v) change in the name of
the Borrower.
2.     The Project Development Objective (PDO), which is to increase the production and
market access of rural families living in the Chambo and Chanchán-Chimbo river basins,
through investments in irrigation and roads improvement, remains unchanged. The Project
has two Components: Component 1, Subcomponent 1.1, irrigation improvement,
Subcomponent 1.2 roads improvement. Component 2 is Project Management. The PDO
remains relevant and can be achieved by Project closing. During the November 2010 MTR,
Project Beneficiaries reaffirmed their full commitment to the Project, and a recently
conducted independent evaluation has underscored Project achievements to date, describing
remarkable results for already implemented irrigation subprojects and road segments. This
evaluation highlights how beneficiaries are contributing to the Project with both financial
resources and community work, and are effectively organized in Water User Associations
(WUAs), which represents a significant accomplishment. No new safeguards are triggered as
a consequence of the above-mentioned modifications.
3.       The MTR assessed that a few of the targets set for some of the original Project
indicators were unrealistic (for reasons including initial underestimated cost calculations and
overoptimistic beneficiaries estimates, see Annex 1 for irrigation, Annex 2 for roads), and
these have been adjusted to fit the available Project budget and real cost figures. Other
indicators were not readily measurable and have been modified to more meaningful figures
(Table 1). Moreover, one of the initially selected Project road sections was financed with
national funds, which entailed the need to select new sections within the Project area that
complied with Project objectives. The costs of these new sections have been higher than
initially envisioned (Annex 2), and as a result the total cost of the Subcomponent has
increased. However, costs for Component 2, Project Management, were overestimated, and
savings are being reallocated to compensate the overrun of the roads Subcomponent (Table
2).
4.      On the basis of above assessment, the Borrower (now called Decentralized
Autonomous Government of Chimborazo Province, DAGCHP) to request the restructuring
of the Project, through letter dated December 23, 2011.



                                               4
     B. PROJECT STATUS
5.       Actual disbursements (March 2012) have reached 61.6%. The roads Subcomponent is
fully disbursed and completed. The irrigation Subcomponent lags behind, but a feasible work
plan has been prepared and agreed (Annex 3), feasibility studies are ready for all the
irrigation systems that will be financed, and many of them are already entering the
procurement phase. Under this work plan, full disbursement and implementation of activities
is likely to happen before the current Project closing date. However, unexpected difficulties
in procurement processes (due to limited number and technical capacity of local suppliers) or
during the execution of works could imply the need to extend activities beyond the closing
date. Should this be the case, an extension of the Project closing date will be sought.
6.      The overall progress of the Project varies by Subcomponent:
7.       Irrigation systems rehabilitation (Subcomponent 1.1, original IBRD allocation:
US$9.3M): this Subcomponent shows some of the most remarkable achievements by the
Project thus far, including fully operational irrigation systems constructed with in-cash and
in-kind contributions from beneficiaries, who have also created and strengthened their
WUAs. This achievement overcame several challenges which caused delays, mainly from
two different sources: (i) the participatory mechanism implemented for every irrigation
system entailing financing and labor beneficiary participation has been hard and slow to
secure in several cases; and (ii) procurement of works for small and medium-sized irrigation
systems has proven challenging, and specific procurement strengthening plans have been put
in place. Notwithstanding these delays, under this Subcomponent 22 fully operational
irrigation schemes have already been implemented, 4 are in commissioning phase, and works
for 12 schemes are underway, for a total of US$4M disbursed plus committed. The 22
finalized irrigation projects are operating properly, the corresponding Water User
Associations (WUAs) have been trained successfully, and crops cycles have been initiated.
All projects have received the stipulated beneficiary counterpart funds. Given the amount of
remaining funds, and the real costs of irrigation projects (which are now known and are
higher than estimated when the Project was designed, over 4 years ago, see Annex 1), 16 new
irrigation projects will be financed before Project closing date, bringing the total number of
irrigation projects to 54, and the total estimated number of beneficiary families to 7,992.
These values are lower than original Project estimates, as a result of a number of reasons
thoroughly explained hereafter and in Annex 1. All finalized irrigation projects to date have
shown high performance, beneficiaries have achieved improved capacities and WUAs have
been strengthened; an overall increase of productivity and efficiency for each irrigation
subproject has been observed, as documented in several field visits and in the recently-
conducted independent evaluation of Project impact.
8.      Road rehabilitation (Sub-component 1.2, original IBRD allocation US$4.4M): works
under this Sub-component have been completed and are currently under the testing phase,
final payments and closing of contracts will take place by July 2012. The initial design
envisioned the rehabilitation of two road segments for a total of 60.5km. However, the
National Government allocated extra funds to complete one of them (using Project-funded
road designs); therefore two alternative segments have been financed by the Project and are
now fully operational. As explained in Annex 2, the final costs of Project-financed segments
were higher than calculated at Project design over 4 years ago, and as a consequence, the
final cost of the Subcomponent has gone up from US$4.2 to US$4.99 (Table 2). It has to be
noted, however, that although the direct number of beneficiaries of the two new segments

                                              5
seems to be lower than the segment executed by the central Government, these are strategic
as they complete several road rings that, as a whole, have a significant positive impact in the
area. Therefore, a total of 50.4km of strategically chosen segments have been fully
rehabilitated through this Subcomponent and are serving important agricultural production
areas within the Chimborazo Province. All segments, fully operational, greatly facilitate the
transportation and commercialization of agricultural products in addition to connecting
remote communities to infrastructure services such as schools and health centers..
9.      Project management (Component 2, original IBRD allocation US$1.6M) has
improved over the life of the Project, and some of the staff initially contracted with Project
funds have now been hired by DAGCHP and included in their organizational chart. Some
shortcomings in Procurement and Financial Management still exist, but specific action plans
have been agreed to improve performance of the fiduciary team, and implementation is
ongoing. Funds originally allocated to this Component have proven somewhat excessive (to
date, US$360,000 have been disbursed), and as a result, US$760,000 can be reallocated and
used to cover the extra funds needed for irrigation and roads.

    C. PROPOSED CHANGES

C.1 Reduction of target values

10.     The proposed changes are intended to better reflect the nature of the activities carried
out and the achievements expected by the closing date. Although the scope will be reduced
because fewer families than initially calculated will benefit, as explained in the following
sections, the PDO is still expected to be achieved by the closing of the Project. This is
transformational beyond the traditional road and irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation
Project; it is innovative in several ways (including the implementation of a highly
participatory approach), and as such it has provided very useful lessons that are now being
reflected in this restructuring.


    Adjustment of Cost of Irrigation Sub-projects
11.     During Project preparation, it was estimated that the Subcomponent would benefit
17,500 water users’ families and finance approximately 250 small irrigation subprojects and
15 large subprojects. As real costs have shown, these numbers were largely overestimated.
The actual number of projects to be financed will be 54 subprojects, benefiting about 7,992
families. This reduction arises because the rehabilitation investment cost per irrigation
system was under-estimated during the preparation of the Project. The implementation delays
caused by the complexity of the sub-project cycle and the limited experience in procurement
of works and services at the Provincial Government prevented the real cost figures to be
known until recently. Once these updated figures were fully understood, a new estimate of
final number of irrigation subprojects and beneficiary families was made, and the
restructuring of the Project was initiated.
12.    Irrigation Cost Estimates. It was expected that during the first year, the project would
finance around 16 already identified subprojects to serve as demonstration pilots, taking
advantage of the investment proposals prepared under the Bank-financed PRODEPINE

                                               6
Project.1 Each of these subprojects already had a feasibility study for a comprehensive
package of activities of irrigation rehabilitation works, training, and on-farm technology
improvement (micro-sprinkler, drip, or improved on-farm surface irrigation), and they were
supposed to be used as demonstration subprojects to familiarize other WUAs with the project
and encourage their participation. In practice however, only six of them fully met the
eligibility criteria. The identification of other sub-projects to replace the non-eligible ones
took additional time, but it also helped to better estimate the costs.
13.     Unit cost ceilings were established during the preparation phase in order to reach out
to a large number of beneficiaries and ensure cost-effectiveness. Based on this, the Project
was expected to finance approximately 250 small subprojects (less than US$50,000) and 15
large subprojects (US$50,000 to US$500,000). The parent Project document, in its fourth
Annex, calculated an estimated average of US$60,250 per subproject. This estimate was
obtained based on a sample of 11 subprojects, ranging from US$20,000 to US$122,000,
which was the only information available at that time. Although these estimates were based
on the feasibility studies conducted for those subprojects, one of the problems identified was
that the information on water flow/availability was not accurate or was obsolete (partly
because almost two years went by between the costing exercise and the effectiveness of the
Project). Accurate information on water flow is extremely important, because it has been
demonstrated that less water availability implies a higher investment cost due to the
increased infrastructure needed to secure a regular flow.
14.      Although the underestimation in real Project costs was identified early in the
implementation of the Project, it was necessary to carry out new studies to update the costs
based on a larger sample of projects (those with a high probability to meet all the eligibility
criteria, including counterpart financing) and to collect solid baseline data. As a result, a new
classification system for sub-projects was developed. All this information was necessary to
structure the final portfolio of sub-projects to be financed over the life of the Project. More
information is provided on Annex 1.


   Causes of delays in overall implementation
15.     First Sub-national Project. This is the first project implemented with a Sub-National
Government in Ecuador. Some very relevant results have been achieved to date, proving that
the arrangements and the Project objectives and design are working. However, it has implied
a longer than anticipated learning curve for both the Bank and the Provincial Government,
causing some delays. For example, adequate institutional arrangements for procurement and
financial management were critical to ensure a smooth implementation, which entailed
several internal changes at Provincial Government supported by the technical and
administrative team contracted for Project implementation. In spite of its complexity, this
process has proven to substantially strengthen the institution’s capacity to manage projects
financed with multilateral organizations through the adoption of more rigorous fiduciary
processes. More details on the procurement challenges are provided in Annex 1.

  Under PRODEPINE, the preparation of irrigation investment proposals was financed and priority subprojects
identified, but the works themselves remained unfunded. The Irrigation Investment Fund expects to attract
many of these unfunded priority proposals after revision and updating. These proposals were prioritized based
on: water concession level, level or organization, expected increased irrigation area, co-financing level (in-kind
and in cash), poverty level, farm size, rate of return, complexity of works, and previous investments.

16.     Participatory Approach and Project cycle for irrigation sub-projects. The
participatory approach is being implemented for the first time in the Province. It involves a
consultation process with WUAs. For an irrigation subproject to be financed, it first has to be
selected through the annual participatory budget, as stipulated by the framework of the
Provincial Government’s Development Plan. It further requires the engagement of direct
beneficiaries, community consultation and participatory prioritization, awareness of potential
beneficiaries regarding the importance to provide counterpart financing to secure ownership
and long-term operation and maintenance, monitoring and evaluation.
17.     The sub-project cycle continues with the following steps: i) preparation of proposals
by the project technical team and beneficiaries; ii) preparation of pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies (financed by the Provincial Government and the beneficiaries); iii)
screening and prioritization of proposals based on the eligibility criteria; iv) contracting of
civil works; v) construction and operation testing; and vi) training and capacity building of
WUAs. An extremely important aspect is the technical assistance and capacity building
process (performed by the Project both at Regional and beneficiary levels), which has been
incorporated to: (a) strengthen provincial government capacity to identify, evaluate, select,
and supervise irrigation subprojects; and (b) strengthen WUAs and farmers’ capacity in key
areas such as O&M, administration of irrigation systems, on-farm irrigation methods, and
agricultural practices.
18.     The implementation of the participatory approach and the complete sub-project cycle
is a significant success of the Project, together with the actual Project achievements in terms
of number of beneficiaries, water supplied and improved agricultural production. The
participatory approach demonstrates a methodology that has proven to be efficient and
increases the chances for Project success. However, given the number of actors and steps
involved in each cycle, the sources and lengths of delays were hard to anticipate, and they are
now better known.


   Adjustment to the location of the rehabilitated road segments
19.   The road segments to be rehabilitated according to the original design of the project
were Riobamba - Cebadas (35km), and Charicando - Turubamba (25.5km), total length
60.5km.
20.     During the first regular supervision (October, 2008), the Bank was formally notified
of the Provincial Government’s decision to finance the Cebadas-Riobamba road with
resources from the Central Government. This decision was taken by the Provincial
Government for two reasons: i) there was an urgency to spend the funds allocated by the
Central Government, since they were to be included in the Provincial Government’s budget
before the end of the fiscal year (December 2008); and ii) the roads to be eligible under those
Central Government funds should have final technical/ feasibility studies available. The only
road which met the second condition was the Riobamba-Cebadas road, and thus the
Provincial Government chose it for their financing. They also proposed alternative road
segments to be financed under the Project.
21.    Three new road segments were initially proposed: i) Cubijíes-Quimiag - Quebrada
Puchulcahuán (14.9km); ii) Flores-Y de Achullay (12.5km); and iii) Tunshi-San Nicolás
(7km), which jointly with the Charicando-Cocán road amounted to a total length of 60km. A
preliminary analysis was carried out by the Bank and the counterpart team to confirm that
                                              8
these new road segments were: i) part of the priority road network of the province of
Chimborazo; ii) contributing to achieving the Project’s PDO; and iii) falling within the
established budget for the road sub-component. In order to take a final decision, finalized
technical and feasibility studies were required.
22.     The Provincial Government contracted the studies for the three alternative segments
as part of its counterpart financing commitment to the Project. These studies were submitted
to the Bank over the third semester of 2009. After several revisions, they were approved by
the Bank during the first semester of 2010.
23.     The studies conducted showed that the rehabilitation costs of the three new segments
together with the Charicando road, exceeded the allocation of the road Sub-component by
approximately US$1 million. For this reason, the Provincial Government decided to exclude
the Tunshi-San Nicolás segment from the Project and formally requested the reallocation of
US$590,000 from the irrigation to the road Sub-component, to cover the additional costs
needed to complete the two new segments. However, during the preparation of the
restructuring paper, it was agreed that this amount could be reallocated from the Project
Management Component, which has available resources.
24.      The two new segments complete different ring roads that are strategic for the
agricultural production sector of the area. The Government needed to initiate and complete
the rehabilitation of these segments together with their associated roads simultaneously to
fulfill their annual operational plans and secure further financing for the next year. A
restructuring of the Project at that stage as a condition to finance the two new segments with
the loan, would have prevented the Provincial Government from effectively executing such
plans.
25.    It is important to mention that the Provincial Government secured extra funds to
complete the third segment (Tunshi-San Nicolás). As a result, in total there have been
50.4km rehabilitated by the Project, and another 42km financed with counterpart funds, for a
combined total length of 92.4km. As such, the results of this Subcomponent are greater and
have a more profound impact as a whole in the Project area than originally expected. The
financing table shown further below only reflects the contributions of the DAGCHP that
have gone directly to the segments financed with the loan. A broader consideration however
would show that an important amount of resources has been leveraged to improve road
conditions in the area.
26. As a result of this, it is proposed to amend the Loan Agreement as follows: In
Schedule 1 of the Project Description, Part 1 B. (a) stated as “Carrying out of rehabilitation
and improvement works of the Riobamba-Cebadas Road and the Charicando-Turubamba
Road?, should be amended to read: “Carrying out of rehabilitation and improvement works
of the Charicando-Colcán-La Dolorosa Road, Cubijíes-Quimiag-Quebrada de Puchulcahuán
Road and the Flores-Y de Achullay Road.?

C.2 Modification of the Project Results Framework
27.     The Results Framework has been carefully reviewed on several occasions in light of
the changes described in the previous section, and it has been agreed that there is a need to:
(i) adjust the two main outcome indicators to better reflect expected Project results; (ii) revise
the end of Project targets in function of the Project pace of implementation so far and the
work plan for the remaining life of the Project; and (iii) review several Subcomponent
                                                9
indicators to make sure they are measurable within the lifetime of the Project and reflect
actual achievements. The fully revised Results Framework, with new target values and
updated current status, is presented in Annex 4, while Table 1 below shows changes of
indicators and their justification.

C.3 Reallocation of loan proceeds


28.     As described in section C1 and Annex 2, the roads Subcomponent has been more
costly than originally envisioned. Works have been completed and are currently under the
testing phase; final payments and closing of contracts will take place by July 2012. The total
final resources needed for this Subcomponent are US$4.99M (original allocation US$4.4M).
The US$590,000 difference would be taken from Component 2, Project Management, the
cost of which was overestimated. US$170,000 can be taken out of Component 2 and
reallocated to the irrigation Subcomponent without compromising Project Management.
These extra funds in the irrigation Subcomponent will be available for contingencies. If no
contingencies are needed, there are five irrigation subprojects pre-selected who could be
eligible for Project financing in due time (included in the Work Plan on Annex 3). This is
reflected on the following updated disbursement table.

C.4 Financing Plan update


29.      Some adjustments have been made to the financing plan of the project. The costs of
the irrigation Subcomponent were underestimated. Real costs are now available, and result in
the financing of fewer irrigation subprojects than initially envisioned (Annex 1). This
reduction in number of subprojects has the effect of reducing the DAGCHP’s contribution to
the subcomponent, since there are fewer pre-feasibility and design studies to be carried out.
All these studies have been fully financed by DAGCHP and finalized, so their contribution is
currently fully disbursed. This is reflected in the new financing plan, shown in Table 3. The
road Subcomponent was also more costly than expected, and the DAGCHP stepped up to
increase its contribution in order to finance part of the extra needs. Finally, Project
Management is less costly than envisioned, resulting in lower Local Government financing
requirements. Counterpart funds were contemplated for financing and in-kind contributions
to the irrigation works. Due to the fewer number of irrigation systems financed, this amount
has also gone down. Table 3 summarizes these changes per source of funding.


C.5 Change in the name of the Borrower


28.    The 2008 Constitution, changed the denomination of the Provincial Governments to
Decentralized Autonomous Governments. Following the mandate of the new Constitution
and through Administrative Resolution No. 008-2011-C-PCH, the Prefect of the Provincial
Council, as the highest management authority, changed the name of the Provincial Council of
Chimborazo to Decentralized Autonomous Government of Chimborazo. Changing the name
of the executing agency does not imply any change in its functions, but it requires an
amendment to the Loan agreement.

     Safeguards
29.     The proposed restructuring does not trigger any additional safeguard policies and
their implementation continues to be appropriate.
30.     Regarding the roads Subcomponent, the three segments had their respective
Environmental Management Plans (EMP), and their permits given by the Ministry of
Environment. Regarding the irrigation Subcomponent, up to date 41 EMPs have been
prepared and approved, and have been properly implemented in executed works. Social
safeguard implementation continues to be appropriate, with high levels of beneficiary
participation.


     Institutional arrangements
31.    The proposed restructuring does not introduce any changes to the institutional
arrangements.


     Financial Management and Procurement
32.     The restructuring does not change the financial management and procurement
arrangements for the Project. The DAGCHP is the solely responsible entity that manages
the funds of the Project and does all contracting under the Project. Financial management
and procurement performance have recently been rated Moderately Satisfactory. The last
financial audit report was submitted on time and auditors issued unqualified (clean)
opinion.


     Implementation schedule
33.   The adjusted disbursement schedule has been built based on the 2011-2012
Annual Operational Plan together with the projected activities reflected in the work plan
of Annex 3.

    D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY


34.    The proposed changes do not have an impact on the original appraisal summary,
the main change comprises the adjustments of irrigation sub-projects as indicated in the
next paragraph and further explained in the Annexes.


   Economic and financial analysis
35.      The Project’s economic and financial analysis was not revised, however the actual
costs of the irrigation systems were established based on real data generated during the
initial implementation stage.


       Social and Environmental Issues
36.    No new safeguards have been triggered and the assessment of social and
environmental impacts of the type of activities being implemented has not changed. The
Environmental Management Framework has recently been updated and improved.
Implementation arrangements continue to be adequate.


       Risk
37.    Two new risks have been identified, in addition to those originally discussed in
the Project documents:

                               Annex 1. Irrigation Subcomponent

The subcomponent was expected to benefit 17,500 water users’ families and finance
approximately 250 small irrigation subprojects and 15 large subprojects. As real costs
have shown, these numbers were largely overestimated. The actual number of projects to
be financed will be 54 subprojects, benefiting about 7,992 families. There are some
unallocated funds within the subcomponent, which will be used for contingencies. If no
contingency is encountered, in due time they will be directed to financing additional
subprojects already identified. This would increase number of beneficiaries and number
of subprojects implemented. The main reasons to reduce the number of sub-projects and
beneficiaries are explained below.

    I.       Increased Investment Costs

1. Unit cost ceilings were adjusted based on the feasibility studies and additional field
assessments. Unit cost ceilings were established during the preparation phase in order to
reach a large number of beneficiaries and ensure cost-effectiveness. Based on this, the
project was expected to finance approximately 250 small subprojects (less than
US$50,000) and 15 large subprojects (US$50,000 to US$500,000).

The parent project document, in its fourth Annex, calculated a US$60,250/subproject
estimate. This estimate was based on a sample of 11 subprojects, ranging from
US$20,000 to US$122,000 (this is too rough of an estimate, especially when 250 small
subprojects were expected and 15 large). In reality, costs per subproject are higher, as real
numbers have now shown. The main reason for higher costs is that although the initial
estimates were based on feasibility studies, the information on water flow/availability
was not reliable and accurate, and it has been necessary to develop a new classification
system based on this water availability parameter. With real costs in hand resulting from
already finalized subprojects, realistic projections can be made.

The first 6 pilot subprojects that have been financed, most of them small, have an average
cost of US$78,000, as shown in Table A1 and Figure A1 (significantly higher than the
estimated US$50,000 ceiling for small subprojects).

Once the portfolio of subprojects was defined based on readiness (every subproject
meeting all eligibility criteria, including co-financing from WUAs), it was judged
necessary to review the size categories determined at Project design, and generate a new
5 category-classification, as shown in Table A.2. This classification factors in the real
investments costs and the water flow/availability figure.

Under this new categorization system, a portfolio of 41 additional subprojects was
defined, and their investment costs are detailed in Tables A.3 through A.6. Of these, 16
are currently fully operational. As deducted from these tables, the average cost of these
subprojects is US$153,553.00. Again, these real figures are significantly higher than
initial Project estimates.

2. Cost of training and institutional strengthening. Initial Project estimates for training
and institutional strengthening needs were roughly assessed at 20% of total irrigation
cost. As shown on Table A.7, the total estimated investment cost was initially US$ 8.2
million. If the corresponding 20% is added, the total Subcomponent cost would have been
US$10.25 million. However, the real allocated amount as per the Loan Agreement was
US$9.3 million, which again shows that initial predictions were not accurate and the
estimated number of subprojects was significantly above what is feasible given real costs
and available Project resources.

3. The complexity of the irrigation subprojects approach required additional staff to
strengthen the implementation team. Given the complexity of the activities to be
developed within the subproject cycle, there was a need to hire a number of specialists
and technicians not previously envisioned. This translated into devoting more resources
to staffing, implying extra costs for the subcomponent not previously considered.
Specifically, an additional irrigation specialist and an agriculturist were hired. Moreover,
the participatory approach also required the support of two additional social promoters.
Finally, the limited number of supervision staff at the Provincial Government, led to the
decision of contracting two full-time supervisors.

   II.     Real time required to implement project activities


1. The number of irrigation projects to be financed was over-estimated, not only in real
cost figures but also considering time needed to implement the proposed, complex
approach. The approach to implement irrigation subprojects was designed around the
following principles: i) follows a demand-driven, participatory approach in which WUAs
are involved in subproject design, financing, execution, and supervision, and are fully
responsible for O&M; and ii) it comprises an integrated approach to irrigation
improvement, including strengthening of the capacity of WUAs and improving farmers’
irrigation and agricultural practices and the commercialization of agricultural produce in
order to reap the full benefits of irrigation infrastructure modernization.

The sub-component entails the rehabilitation and improvement (water intakes, lining of
canals, and the construction or improvement of small reservoirs) of the existing systems.
It is limited to off-farm irrigation improvements due to government regulations limiting
the use of public funds to the investment of collective, productive infrastructure. The
project is nevertheless financing 20 demonstration subprojects aimed at promoting
improved on-farm irrigation technologies. Such on-farm investments are justified by (a)
the public good nature of demonstration subprojects, and (b) because irrigation
improvement must consider the irrigation system as a whole from the water resource
intake to water application to the crop.

Technical assistance and capacity building have been incorporated to: (a) strengthen
provincial government capacity to identify, evaluate, select, and supervise irrigation
subprojects; and (b) strengthen WUAs and farmers’ capacity in key areas such as O&M,
administration of irrigation systems, on-farm irrigation methods, and agricultural
practices.

The sub-project cycle entails the following aspects: i) preparation of proposals; ii)
preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; iii) screening and prioritization of
proposals based on the eligibility criteria; iv) contracting of civil works; v) construction
and operation testing; and vi) training and capacity building to WUAs.

It is now known that the actual period of time needed to complete the subproject cycle
and comply with all above-mentioned steps is between 18 to 24 months, (some of the
most time consuming parts being the collection of the 5% cash contribution of the
counterpart, without which the contracting cannot begin). These long subproject cycle
periods were not properly considered and factored in under the parent Project design.

2. Readiness of Pilot Subprojects. It was expected that during the first year, the project
would finance around 16 already identified subprojects to serve as demonstration pilots,
taking advantage of the investment proposals prepared under the Bank’s closed




                                            22
PRODEPINE Project.2 Each of these subprojects already had a completed feasibility
study for a comprehensive package of activities of irrigation rehabilitation works,
training, and on-farm technology improvement (micro-sprinkler, drip, or improved on-
farm surface irrigation), and they were supposed to be used as demonstration subprojects
to familiarize other WUAs with the project and encourage their participation. In practice
however, only six of them (Table A.1) fully met the eligibility criteria.

3. Procurement of works. Given the limited experience of the Provincial Government to
carry out procurement under the Bank’s guidelines as established in the Loan Agreement,
the contracting of civil works took much longer than expected. Given that the majority of
works were under the US$250,000 ceiling, they were contracted through the modality of
Shopping. Standard documents were adapted to ensure compliance with the Bank’s
guidelines. The monitoring of the contracts became a very complicated task to the project
team given the resistance by local individual contractors to follow procedures such as the
timely submission of invoices. Currently, all procurement processes will be conducted
using National Competitive Bidding, which increases transparency and promotes
competence but could introduce new sources of delays.

Finally, the limited number of work supervision staff at the provincial government
already mentioned also introduced further delays, as supervision reports were not
available to support payment orders.

  Under PRODEPINE, the preparation of irrigation investment proposals was financed and priority
subprojects identified, but the works themselves remained unfunded. The Irrigation Investment Fund
expects to attract many of these unfunded priority proposals after revision and updating. These proposals
were prioritized based on: water concession level, level or organization, expected increased irrigation area,
co-financing level (in-kind and in cash), poverty level, farm size, rate of return, complexity of works, and
previous investments.

                              Annex 2. Road Subcomponent

Adjustment of Road Segments to be financed under the Project

Originally, this subcomponent was designed to carry out the rehabilitation of the
Riobamba-San Luis-Punín-Flores-Cebadas provincial road (35km) and the improvement
of the Charicando-San Patricio-Turubamba rural road (25.5km). The total estimated
lenght to be rehabilitated was thus 60.5km. These roads were selected based on the
prioritized road matrix prepared under the Provincial Participatory Roads Plan.

At the initial stage of Project implementation (October 2008), the Central Government of
Ecuador provided financing to the Provincial Government to support the Provincial
Participatory Roads Plan. These resources would become effective and could be used
only if final feasibility studies were available. At that time, the only feasibility study
available was the Riobamba- Cebadas road, which had been financed by the Project.
Therefore, in order to leverage those national resources, the Provincial Government
decided to finance the road with the Central Government’s budget and searched for
alternative proposals of prioritized segments to be financed with the loan.

Feasibility studies were developed at that time for three alternative segments: i) Cubijíes-
Quimiag - Quebrada Puchulcahuán (14.9km); ii) Flores-Y de Achullay (12.5km); and iii)
Tunshi-San Nicolás (7km). The Bank assessed the proposed segments and found them
fully consistent with the PDO, as they serve sectors with high agricultural production and
secure access local markets by local communities. The DAGCHP financed in full those
feasibility studies, ramping up its contribution to the Subcomponent.

As indicated in the Table A.8 below, the estimated investment for the four segments (one
segment of the original two, plus the three new proposed) was US$5,871,736, of which
US$3,617,160 were to be financed by the loan. The total allocation to this subcomponent
as per the Loan Agreement is US$4.4 million, the balance would cover the costs of the
works supervision and the road specialist of the counterpart team.

Further analysis allowed to determine that the investment cost would be higher than
initially estimated (as shown on Table A.9). This cost increase arises from the fact that
earlier studies and feasibility assessments did not properly consider important drainage
structures required given segment locations in rainy areas, and did not include other
important technical aspects detailed on Table A.10 for each segment. In the particular
case of the Charicando-Cocán-La Dolorosa road, it is important to mention that this
segment goes through a very steep and mountainous area, with strongly adverse climatic
conditions. These conditions delayed its construction and significantly increased labor as
well as fixed costs (the road is located at 4,000 meters above sea level, with high and
almost permanent rainfall and extremely humid soils, making it necessary to include
additional drainage works and infrastructure).

Once the real cost figures were known, from the three extra segments proposed, the
DAGCHP decided to finance both Cubijíes-Puchulcahuán and Flores-Y de Achullay. At
the same time, the DAGCHP secured other sources of finance to fully construct the
Tunshi-San Nicolás segment. This segment is currently being constructed (expected end
of works is April 2012). In this way, three segments have been financed with the loan,
totaling 50.4km. Additionally, the DAGCHP financed two segments totaling 42km, for
combined total length of 92.4km. The benefits obtained through the implementation of
the Project are thus much greater than those initially envisioned.

Project Beneficiaries
The Project was estimated to benefit 15,000 families through the rehabilitation of the two
originally agreed segments. The calculations performed to arrive at these numbers are not
totally clear. The roads actually financed by the project will benefit approximately 7,000
families. These families have been actually computed since they are located within the
direct area of influence of the rehabilitated roads. However, it is important to mention
that the rehabilitated segments will connect important circuits serving areas with high
agricultural production. Taking this aspect into consideration, the number of beneficiaries
drastically increases. Moreover, the other originally agreed segment was concluded using
national funds, and a third segment chosen on a second prioritization is being constructed.
Therefore, final achievements as a whole go significantly beyond initial Project
expectations.

Arrangements for rehabilitation of roads
As explained in Annex 4 of the Project’s parent document, the preparation works
(placement of base, transporting of materials) was to be conducted by the Provincial
Government using its own equipment, while major works would be contracted out to
national firms through a national competitive bidding process. At the time of initiating
the works under the Project, the Provincial Government received additional resources
from the Central Government and other sources of financing to rehabilitate roads, this
situation caused a significant shortfall on its equipment and consequently a delay on
implementation. In order to avoid further delays, the Quimiag-Cebadas and the Flores-Y
de Achullay roads were fully contracted with national firms and the Provincial
Government provided its counterpart in cash.

                 Annex 3. Work Plan until the closing date of the Project

The following tables show all irrigation subprojects in the Project’s portfolio (total of 54).
An effort has been done to program the estimated beginning and end of works, which
need to be followed by a period of tests and training of the beneficiaries. If all these
subprojects are implemented in the dates shown below, and there are no contingencies,
the Project can be totally finalized by current closing date. Moreover, there will be a
remainder of resources not allocated to any of these subprojects. These resources will be
allocated to fund other already pre-identified subprojects if no extra costs are needed to
complete the current portfolio. Five subprojects are pre-identified, and will be financed as
resources become available and they qualify for all project cycle requirements.
To date, 26 small and medium subprojects have been completed, of which 22 are fully
operational and WUAs are under the training period. The remaining 4 are under the
testing and commissioning period. Other 12 are in the construction phase, 9 are in teh
procurement phase, 5 are completing the co-financing requirements from the
beneficiaries, and 2 projects have studies that have been consulted with the beneficiaries
and counterpart financing has not been provided. Details in the following tables:
