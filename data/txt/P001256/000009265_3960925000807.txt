PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
SECOND AND THIRD INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPfENT BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) covers the experience with
Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE, the second and third of a series. They were
approved in 1975 and 1977 in the amounts of US$10 million and US$20
million, respectively, and disbursed by 1984. A fourth loan, 1817-KE was
approved in 1980 and has now been largely comitted. Both loans under
review were made directly to IDB, with Government providing a guarantee.
The PCR was prepared by the Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department
and is based on documentation prepared by IDB and a review of Bank
documents relating to the project, including correspondence with IDB. A
Project Completion mission visited IDB during February, 1986.
The PCR was forwarded to the Borrower and the Government in draft
form for their comments, but none were received.
The two projects have not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
SECOND AND THIRD INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A previous PPAR (Report No. 3944) covered the first line of credit
to the Industrial Development Bank (Loan 946-KE). The PPAR concluded that
IDB had become a fairly efficient financial intermediary and had largely met
its original institutional objectives. The report noted, however, that
IDB's appraisal quality was declining, supervision and collection efforts
were lax and profitability was low. It also pointed to the importance of
linking DFC lending to discussions of industrial and financial sector
policies.
The experience with Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE largely bore out the
problem3 foreseen by the earlier PPAR. During the period under review (1980
through 1985), IDB's portfolio quality deteriorated bnarply, reflecting
inadequate project preparation and appraisal, poor supervision and intertia
within IDB to tackle these problems (paras. 5.04-5.06). Moreover, difficult
economic conditions during the period, which included initial macroeconomic
disequilibrium and, later, a substanttive -- and successful -- stabilization
program contributed significantly to IDB's poor perforamuce (paras. 2.01 -
2.03). Low domestic demand fo: manufactured goods, constraints on the
availability of foreign exchauige for imported inputs and substantial
devaluations of the Kenyan shilling all had a deleterious effect on IDB's
clients. In addition, the financial sector in Kenya had grown and evolved
significantly since IDB's inception, increasing competition, particularly
for loans to strong projects. Finally, IDB was subjected to political
influence during part of this period, further eroding its portfolio quality
and staff turnover was high.
Beginning in late 1984, IDB embarked on a serious effort to
strengthen its collections performance and profitability. Although IDB's
loan appraisal and supervision functions have improved and it showed profits
in 1985 and 1986, these internal changes will not be enough to turn around
the institution. Because of increased competition for good projects and the
unattractiveness of IDB's products (foreign currency denominated loans), IDB
will not be able to lend its way out of its poor portfolio. At the same
time, it has found it impossible to mobilize local currency resources
because of its owL poor portfolio and lack of collateral. Therefore, IDB's
portfolio requires significant restructuring and a fresh look at IDB's role,
its strategy and its structure is necessary for it to be viable (paras.
6.01 -6.03). This restructuring is beginning now under an Industrial Sector
Adjustment Credit.



- v -
The lessons learned for the Bank from its relationship with IDB
should be instructive for DFC operations throughout Africa and in other
countries. First, it appears that Bank staff underestimated the degree to
which politics could be brought to bear on IDB. Second, our involvement in
the industrial and financial sectors during that period focused very
narrowly on IDB and another DFC client and sup rvision appears to have been
preoccupied with subproject reviews, appraisal criteria and other internal
matters. Despite the Bank's involvement in the development of two
Structural Adjustment Loans during the period under review, little analysis
appears to have been done on the impact of stabilization and liberalization
on the corporate sector and financial system, and in particular, on IDB and
its clients. Consequently, we were not aware of the depth of the financial
distress within IDB's portfolio until very late. Finally, Bank staff and
IDB should have looked much earlier at ways to diversify IDB's resource base
(especially vis-a-vis domestic currency resources) and products so as to
keep up with Kenya's increasingly competitive financial system. The
traditional DFC model as embodied by IDB is nearly obsolete today in Kenya's
financial system. All in all, our involvement under the two Loans reviewed
added little value to IDB and to Kenya's industrial and financial sectors,
particularly in the areas of institutional strengthening and policy reform.
These still-present policy and institutional issues are being tackled under
two upcomirg policy-based operations: the Industrial Sector Adjustment
Credit and a Financial Sector Operation (paras. 6.01-6.03).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
SECOND AND THIRD INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The PPAR (Report No. 3944) chronicles the origins and early
development of 1DB and experience witn the dank's first loan to IDB.
Although during the mid- to late 1970s IDB showed satisfactory progress in
developing its own cadre of staff and building up its portfolio, the early
1980s witnessed a sharp deterioration in the quality of IDB's portfolio,
resulting in lower profitability and tight liquidity.
1.02     Most recently, the upturn in the economy and vigilant attention
to portfolio supervision by IDb have resulted in some improvements in its
profitability, liquidity and portfolio performance. The Bank has played a
significant role in IDB's evolution over the past 13 years, providing four
loans (Nos. 946-KE, 1148-KE, 1438-KE and 1817-KE) totalling US$65
million. The second and third lines of credit, 1148-KE and 1438-KE (US410
million and US$20 million, respectively) were fully disbursed by 1984.
Ihe following table illustrates the terms and conditions of these two
lines of credit:

1.03      Commitments and disbursements for the two loans proceeded more
slowly than anticipated, and US $ 1.8 million was cancelled from Loan
1438-KE. Designed as follow-on projects, Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE
incorporated few changes in IDB's policies or strategy, and emF:asized
strengthening the still new institution. Loan 1148-KE required a one year
extension of the closing date for full disbursement. Loan 1438-KE took 5
months longer than envisaged at appraisal to disburse and US$1.8 million
was cancelled.



1.04      By 1980 the Bank had recognized the need for consolidation within
IDB. In 1979-80 the Bank was negotiating a second Structural Adjustment
credit with Kenya, focusing on rationalizing the country's protective
regime, increasing export orientation, improving project selection criteria
and rationalizing interest rate policies. The Bank hoped to help IDB
embark on a consolidation program, including improverdents in bppraisal and
superviaion procedures, greater selectivity in investment decisiuns through
better fin¶ncial analysis, improved monitoring of the equity portfolio, a
decrease in the level of new equity investments, and restraining
administrative costs.
1.05      Unfortunately, IDB's performance during 1980-1985 fell short of
the Bank's expectations. Projects continued to be import-dependent, and
fey showed much export potential. Although IDB gradually improved its
appraisal procedures, it implemented a consolidation program more slowly
than anticipated, and was particularly slow in developing a strong
portfolio monitoring and debt collection capability. In addition, the
1982-84 recession produced foreign exchange shortages, slack demand and
spiralling debt service burdens for Kenyan manufacturers with
foreign-denominated debt. Thus, lDB's arrears worsened during 1980-85.
Today, despite some recent improvements, IDB's portfolio continues to be
one of the weakest in the region, with serious repercussions for its
profitability and liquidity.
II. MACROECONOMIC AND SECTORAL SETTING
2.01      Although the Kenyan economy and the manufacturing sector in
particular underwent significant expansion during the 1970s, they did so
under policies that would later constitute constraints to further
development. In particular, trade and exchange rate policies turned the
internal terms of trade against agriculture, and encouraged inefficient
production and over-dimensioning of particular subsectors. Moreover, while
the manufacturing sector continued to grow, it remained highly
capital-intensive and import-dependent. In recent years, Government
increasingly emphasized, in its Fourth and Fifth Development Plans (1979-83
and 1983-88), tariff rationalization, export promotion, the phasing out of
quantitative import restrictions, and private sector development rather
than the excessive Government spending of the past.
2.02      Actual growth of the Kenyan economy during the first half of the
1980's has been less bouyant than projected in the Fourth and Fifth plans.
The external terms of trade deteriorated sharply with the second oil
crisis, and an erosion of fiscal discipline arrived in the wake of the
mid-1970's "coffee boom". By 1980, the current account deficit had reached
12.5% of GDP and the Central Government budget deficit was 9.5% of GDP.
After 1980, Government took important steps to redress these imbalances,
trimming its budget deficit, permitting real wages to fall, restricting
imports and allowing interest rates to become positive in real terms. A
major devaluation in December 1982 restored the real effective exchange
rate back to its 1976 level, and Government has continued to adjust the
rate so as to avoid any sustained appreciation of the real exchange rate.



- 3 -
The stabilization program, combined with a severe drought that hampered
agricultural output, led to a decline in real GDP per capita of about 5% in
real terms, and investment declined 25% in real terms between 1980 and
1985. The current account deficit also declined to about 5% of GDP by
1985, and Government reduced its budget deficit from 9.5% of GDP in 1980 to
about 5% in 1985. The manufacturing sector suffered a similar decline,
with 1984 investment levels amounting to only 63% of 1980 levels in real
terms. Manufactured exports also declined from a high of 26% of total
exports in 1980 to 18% in 1984.
2.03      In view of the economy's structural problems and adverse
exogenous developments (deterioration of the terms of trade, drought), the
deceleration of growth and decline in per capita incomes were inevitable.
Fortunately, Kenya has been able to manage the deceleration in a fairly
orderly fashion. Kenya, however, has not been as successful in setting the
stage for renewed growth, and export volumes and investment levels continue
to languish. Prospects for the Kenyan economy, and for the industrial
sector in particular, while currently bouyant because of high world coffee
prices, will depend, in the medium term, on how rapidly Government can
increase the pace of implementation of policy measures to increase the
efficiency and volume of investment, expand exports and mobilize domestic
resources.
2.04      Financial Sector.  Kenya's diverse financial system includes a
central bank, 21 commercial banks, 34 non-bank financial institutions
(NBFIs), 30 insurance companies, a postal savings bank, a social security
system, numerous pension plans, BiX industrial development banks, a stock
exchange and over 900 savings and credit cooperatives. Despite this
diversity of institutions, Kenya's financial sector has not realized its
full potential in mobilizing term resources for the industrial sector.
Although Kenya does mobilize substantial term assets in the form of social
security deposits, pension contributions and insurance reserves, these
funds remain largely either in government securities or short-term
deposits, rather than being lent to the private sector. Banks are
reluctant to make long-term loans because: (i) Government-imposed interest
rate ceilings do not allow differentiated interest rates for different
maturities and/or levels of risk; (ii) the development banks, the primary
vehicles for term financing to industry, have performed poorly and are
considered unattractive investments; and (iii) relatively high inflation in
the past (25% in 1980-81, 18% in 1981-82, and about 9% 1982-85) made
investors wary of holding long-term securities. Indeed, interest rates
were negative during the period 1980-1982, and have only become positive as
inflation declined in 1983.
2,05      The commercial banks dominate the banking system.  Four banks
(Kenya Commercial Bank, National Bank of Kenya, Standard Bank and Barclay's
Bank of Kenya) hold nearly two-thirds of total bank deposits in Kenya,
although this percentage has declined recently, because of the rapid growth
of the NBFIs. NBFIs can charge higher lending rates than commercial banks
(19% vs. 14%) and have also earned more than the nominal ceiling rate by
charging additional fees and altering their basis for calculating
interest. The higher effective lending rates (sometimes as high as 25-30%)
have enabled NBFIs to pay more for deposits. NBFIs have expanded their



-4-
share of credit outstanding from 23% in 1976 to 35% in 1984, and have been
particularly important in lending to manufaeturing firms (largely through
hire-purchase facilities). Recent legislation has removed NBFIs' ability
to charge interest on a flat basis or to add supplemental fees, thus
narrowing somewhat the gap between lending rates for NBFIs and commercial
banks. Several of the NBFIs are also experiencing severe liquidity
constraints.
2.U6      Of the six development finance institutions (UFIs) operating in
the industrial sector, Government directly or indirectly owns four: IDB,
Kenya Industrial Estates (KIt), ICDC and the Kenya Tourist Development
Corporation (KTDC). Government also has minority interests in the other
two DFIs, the East African Development Hank (EADB), which also serves
Uganda and Tanzania, and the Development Finance Corporation of Kenya
(DFCK), which is privately controlled. The Bank group has made funds
available to KIE, IDB and EADB and DFCK (the latter through IFC).
Together, the assets of the six DFIs amouint to about 12% of the combined
assets of commercial banks and NBFIs.  Traditionally, the DFIs have entered
niches largely neglected by commercial banks and NBFIs: term lending,
equity investments and lending to small-scale enterprises.  Political
considerations have also often played a part in lending decisions in many
of the DFIs. At present, the DFIs have high arrears, low profitability and
often have over-extended management and duplicative programs. This poor
financial performance has also contributed to liquidity problems, and in
particular, to a lack of Kenya shilling resources with which to finance the
local cost components of projects. Although the DFIs are classified as
NBFIs, as "development" institutions they have been reluctant to raise
lending rates on local currency loans much above 15-16%. As a result, they
have been unable to offer competitive rates for deposits or local
borrowings, and thus have not been able to tap Kenya's significant pool of
domestic savings.
III. TiHE INSTITUTION
3.01      The Bank's appraised Loan 1817-KE in 1980 presented an
opportunity to discuss the following issues:
(a) Consolidation strategy for IDB: During the late 1970s, IDB's
approvals grew at an average annual rate of 25% in real terms,
and IDB became the leading term lending financial institution in
the industrial sector. This rapid rate of growth, however,
ultimately exacted a high cost in the deterioration of the
quality of IDb's appraisals, project supervision and debt
collection performance. IDB agreed to formalize and implement a
strategy of selective growth and consolidation for the period
1980-82; establish a Loan Committee to screen all new project
proposals and review problem projects; create an asset management
section within IDB's finance department to supervise IOB's equity
investments; and limit total equity investments to not more than
80% of its Class "A" subscribed shares during the commitment
period of the Bank loan. Although IDB's approval rate did not
slow until after 1982, it implemented several of the other reform
measures.



- 5 -
(b) IDB Profitability: IDB continued to make losses in the late
197Us because of high administrative costs, low returns from its
equity portfolio, and increasing bad debt losses. In 1980 IDB
agreed to limit the number of employees to 1979 levels and
control its other administrative expenses. In addition, IDB
agreed to increase loan spreads by raising interest rates on
foreign currency loans to at least 12%. It later increased its
interest rate on foreign currency loans to 13% and its rate for
local currency loans to 14% (although recently it has charged
15-16% for some local currency loans). Profitability improved
marginally in the 1980s (para. 5.09), but continues to be low
because of poor portfolio performance.
(c) Provisions Policy: Until 1979, IDB had no accumulated provisions
for possible losses, and only took writeoffs when realizing
losses. Continuation of the existing ad hoc approach might have
encouraged under-provisions over time, thus misrepresenting IDB's
true financial situation. During negotiations for Loan 1817-KE,
IDB agreed to create provisions in its accounts in accordance
with sound commercial and accounting practices, accumulating by
December 31, 1982 to not less than 3% of the value of its
portfolio. IDB's accumulated provisions now exceed this amount,
but its high level of arrears may necessitate even higher
provisions (para. 5.06).
(d) New activities: IDB is a NBFI under Kenyan law, enabling it to
accept time deposits and thus increase its local currency
resources. 1DB had also considered other activities, such as
financing working capital, letter of credit operations, financing
warehouses, etc. While supporting the direction of these
activities in that they diversified IDB's sources of revenues and
would help generate much needed local currency, the Bank was
concerned that such activities should not add to IDB's
administrative overheads and that they contribute to its
profitability.
(e) Financial Covenants: Annex 11 shows IDB's compliace with the
major loan covenants under Loans 1148-KE, 1438-KE and 1817-KE.
The debt:equity ratio covenant was changed for 1817-KB (moving
3:1 to a 4:1 maximum). Nonetheless, IDB expressed the concern
that a 4:1 debt equity limitation might unduly restrict IDB's
future operations. The subsequent slowdown in IDB's approvals,
however, has eliminated the need for a higher gearing ratio. IDB
has largely complied with the other financial covenants, although
foreign currency risk has presented problems for many of IDB's
borrowers, given the significant decline in the value of the Ksh
vis-a-vis other major currencies. In addition, because of timing
differences (clients repaying IDB after IDB has repaid donor
agencies), to date IDB has made some small profits on its foreign
exchange transactions.



-6-
3.02      Ownership.  IDB's ownership structure did not change during the
period 1980-85, although the existing shareholders provided an additional
US$10.3 million equivalent in additional share capital (Annex 11).
Government directly or indirectly through parastatals owns 100% of IDB's
share capital. IDB's shareholders include Government (58.2%), ICDC
(12.11), Kenya National Assurance Company (9.9%), National Bank of Kenya
(9.9%) and Kenya Reinsurance Corporation (9.9%). Because of IDB's
lackluster performance as well as liquidity constraints for some
shareholders (ICDC and NBK in particular), IDB's shareholders have been
reluctant to provide much additional share capital in recent years, despite
IDB's lack of domestic currency resources.
3.03      Management and Organization.  IDB's Board consists largely of
civil servants and representatives from the shareholding parastatals. Both
the Chairman of the Board and the Managing Director are political
appointees. Because of Government interference in decision-making, IDB's
management and Board have not had sufficient automony in project approvals
or in winding up poorly performing projects. Recently, however, this
interference has been less problematic, although the general
centralization of decision-making in Kenya has resulted in significant
delays waiting for Government approval on many small, administrative
matters. Prior to 1980, IDB had 3 Departments (Finance, Administration and
Operations) with 4 divisions under the Chief of Operations: Investments,
Project Advisory Service, Investigations (appraisal) and Research and
Promotion. The appraisal mission in 1979 suggested that IDB institute a
Loan Committee to review project proposals prior to Board approval and an
asset management function (for monitoring the equity portfolio) within the
Finance Department. The Loan Committee functioned well during project
Implementation, but the asset management function never really materialized
as envisaged, and instead was subsumed into normal project supervision.
Project supervision and debt collection remained the weakest functions
within IDB during the past 5 years. Organizationally, responsibility for
debt collection has often been unclear, moving from operations to finance
and back again. On the positive side, shifting responsibility for project
'.mplementation to the appraisal department enabled the already
overstretched supervision staff to focus more fully on problem projects.
IDB rationalized its organization further in 1985, merging the research and
development division with appraisals, creating a debt collection unit
within the operations department and giving the supervision/debt collection
division a stronger manager. This strengthening of the
supervision/collections function has facilitated the development of more
project-specific action programs for arrears-affected loans.
3.04      Staffing and Training.  Annex I shows the evolution of IDB
staffing during 1981-85. Despite an agreement during negotiations to
freeze IDB staff at its 1979 levels, IDB hired 47 new staff during the
1980-85 period (mostly in 1981). particularly support personnel, finance
and computer professionals. Overall staff levels have remained roughly
constant since 1981 and IDB's administrative costs remained satisfactory at
2% of average total assets. Low morale and salaries helped fuel the loss
of professional staff, who left for other Kenyan financial institutions.
Although IDB was slow at first to fill professional staff vacancies, most
of the key positions have now been filled. IDB has also instituted a
virtual freeze on support staff hirings and has given priority to filling
operations department vacancies, although the supervision function remains
understaffed. IDB, along with the other Kenyan parastatals, received an
11% overall increase in its salary structure for 1986, and similar



-7-
increases are expected during 1987 and 1988. IDB's salary classification
did not change, however, and thus IDB will remain less attractive than
Government-owned commercial banks, whose higher classification enables them
to pay higher salaries. IDB has consistently provided excellent training
to Its staff, both in-house and through overseas seminars and
universities.  During 1981-85, 88 professional staff spent over 500 staff
weeks in training programs. Most of IDB's training costs have been met by
funds from bilateral donors.
3.05      Procedures.  During the course of loan supervision, Bank missions
noted major veaknesses in IDB's procedures and recommended measures for
alleviating tzem.
(a)  Appraisals.  The rapid growth in appraisals during 1980-82
contributed to a deterioration in their quality, particularly in
terms of market and financial analyses, assessing the
capabilities and resources of project sponsors, and determining
adequate implementation and grace periods. The creation of the
Loan Committee and the slowdown in approvals which began in
1983-84 helped facilitate more thorough reviews of project
proposals, although some weaknesses remain in market analysis,
assessing management capabilities and developing viable financial
restructurings for problem projects.
(b)  Supervision.  Supervision staff levels have often been inadequate
for tackling IDB's troubled portfolio. Until recently, IDB's
supervision activities remained monitoring-oriented. In 1984-85,
however, IDB began to prepare individual 'action plans" for
problem projects, and was taking a more active role in solving
the problems of its client firms, by preparing financial
restructuring plans, hiring short-term consultants to assist
projects, etc. It also added professional staff to the
monitoring division, established a consultancy unit and created a
separate debt collection unit to follow-up on projects in
arrears.
(c) Debt Collection. IDB did not have a separate debt collection
unit until 1984. In 1985, IDB moved debt collection to
operations and created a committee of high level officers and
managers (including the Managing Director) to follow up on
individual delinquent projects. IDB rescheduled about 30 loans
in 1984-85, with the new psyment schedules being largely
followed. Consequently, IDB's collections ratios improved
significantly during 1985, although the portfolio as a whole
remains heavily affected by arrears (para.5.04).
(d)  Accounting and Data Processing.  IDB's accounting staff is
relatively strong although audit reports have often been delayed
because of reconciliation difficulties and discussions about
provisions. IDB has experienced difficulty in the installation
and use of its minicomputer system, however, primarily because of
the lack of in-house systems analysis and programming expertise.
In addition, IDB has not regularly prepared forecast and actual
cashflow statements. IDB has now purchased a microcomputer for
portfolio monitoring and project analysis and has hired two
experienced analysts. It has also discussed its computer
problems with its external auditors, and is making the necessary
revisions.



(e)  Money and Banking Activities.  During 1982-83 IDB established a
money and banking unit in the finance department for collecting
short-term deposits, making working capital loans, and providing
letter of credit and foreign exchange services to clients.
Shortly thereafter, however, the Bank became concerned about the
soundness of some of IDB's domestic currency working capital loan
operations, which were often made to delinquent clients at low
margins and were poorly monitored. After strong urging from the
Bank, IDB largely disbanded the money and banking unit and
discontinued making domestic currency working capital loans.
Since 1985 a revived unit has focused more on gathering deposits
and providing letters of credit, and is exploring the possibility
of discounting high quality receivables for selected clients.
IV. ALLOCATION OF THE LOANS
Loan 1148-KE
4.01    IDB committed the full US$10 million allocated for Loan 1148-KE
over a period of about 2 1/2 years. These 13 subloans, all in the private
sector, ranged in size from US$129,869 to US$1.3 million, and 11 were above
the free limit. Total project costs for these 13 projects amounted to
US$123.1 million, with the Bank financing on average about 8% of these
costs. The Bank's share of financing varied widely, however, ranging from
2.4% to 43.3% of total project costs. Interest rates charged on the
subloans ranged from 10% to 11% (no interest rate covenant), and maturities
ranged from 7 to 12 years, including grace periods.
4.02     Annex 2 summarizes the key characteristics of the subprojects
approved under the line of credit. As of March 31, 1986, all but one
project were operational (currently in receivership) and three had prepaid
their loans. Despite the strong bias toward capital intensive subsectors
(plastics, chemicals, metals), the projects have created 7,316 jobs at a
reasonable cost per job of about US$16,800 per job--considerably lower than
for the two subsequent lines of credit. Cost per job ranged from US$8,240
for a glassworks to US$79,000 for an expansion/diversification for a
manufacture of PVC cables. The one failed project, Kenya Furfural, had a
high estimated cost per job of over US$120,000. Were it employing the
anticipated 220 workers, it would have had an actual cost per job of
US$167,000.
4.03     Although at present only two of the 13 projects are categorized as
major problem projects and a third is in receivership, two other project
financed under the line of credit have experienced serious problems and
were rehabilitated and restructured by IDB and the other creditors. These
two, and a third project (all textiles) experienced poor management and
fierce competition from imports and from other domestic manufacturers.
Kisumu Cotton Mills (now Kicomi) has been perhaps the most successful of
the three rehabilitations, as it changed its shareholders and management,
revamped its marketing strategy and substantially restructured its
capitalization. The other two, Rivatex and Yuken, continue to have high
accumulated losses; indeed, Rivatex has negative net worth.



- 9 -
4.04     Overall. performance of the subprojects financed under Loan
1148-KE was disappointing. As of March 31, 1986, all of the loans not
fully repaid were affected by arrears of three months or more and arrears
amounted to about 38% of total amounts outstanding-a level much higher
than that for the portfolio as a whole. Arrears from these loans amounted
to 21% of IDB's total portfolio, while the underlying loans accounted for
16% of IDB's total portfolio. In the case of Kenya Fturfural, Yuken
Textiles, Kenya Glassworks and Salt Manufacturers, arrears of 3 months or
more amount to more than 50% of total amounts outstanding for each loan.
The poor performance of subloans under this line of credit lies in: (i)
poor project design and technological problems; (ii) inadequate market
analysis; (iii) infrastructural constraints (i.e., inadequate water supply
for a textile plant); (iv) price controls which limited margins; (v)
competition from imports; and (vi) rising debt service on foreign exchange
denominated loans with the devaluation of the KSh.
4.05     Subprojects under 1148-KE were also highly import dependent for
their raw materials, which exascerbated pressure on operating margins when
the KSh was devalued. In addition, only two projects of the 13 were
expected to have significant export sales and one of them-Kenya
Furfural-is in receivership and is not operational. Six of the thirteen
projects dependent on imports for 50% or more of their raw materials.
4.06     IDB calculated ex-ante financial rates of return for all 13
projects and economic rates of return for eleven. The average estimated
financial and economic rates of returns were quite close-22% and 19.6%,
respectively--but the divergence is quite wide for projects subject to
price controls or import restrictions. The estimated FRRs ranged from
12.6% to 35% while the ERRs ranged from 12% to 28%. The poor repayment
record and low profitability of the subloans suggests that actual rates of
return are considerably lower than the estimates.
Loan 1438-KE
4.07      IDB committed USS 18.2 million of the original US$ 20.0 million
under Loan 1438-KE for 16 projects. 11 of the 16 projects were above the
free limit (US$ 600,000). Total estimated project costs for these 16
projects amounted to US$ 169.1 million, with the Bank financing on average
about 11% of total project costs. The 12 above free limit subloans ranged
in size from US$ 609,140 to US$ 3,168,530 (37.6% of estimated project
costs) for a wire rod manufacturing plant. The 4 below free limit subloans
ranged from US$ 133,097 to US$ 525,210.  Interest rates charged ranged from
11% (minimum stipulated in the loan agreements) to 12.5%, and maturities
ranged from five to twelve years, including grace periods.
4.08      Annex 3 summarizes the key characteristics of the subprojects
approved under Loan 1438-KE. As of March 31, 1986, all 16 projects had
finished the implementation stage; one had prepaid its loan to IDB, and two
had gone into receivership. The projects were expected to create 2579 jobs
at a high average cost of US$ 65,582 per job. Three projects had average
costs per job above US$ 100,000: Synresins, Pan African Paper Mills, and
Madhupaper. Both Pan African Paper Mills and Madhupaper were expansions of
highly capital intensive operations. Without these three projects, the
average estimated cost per job amounted to a still high US$48,572.



- 10 -
For the projects with actual job creation data, the average cost per job
(again excluding Madhupaper, Pan African Paper Mills and Synresins) was a
high US$ 65,238.
4.09      Significant cost overruns contributed to the high actual costs
per job. Although on average the 16 projects had overruns of about
22%, five had overruns amounting to 50% or more of estimated project
costs. The factors contributing to these overruns included poor project
design, poor choice of equipment or technology, underestimates of time
necessary for implementation, delays in project implementation (restricted
access to import licences, agreements with technical partners or
Government) and some changes in project scope. Significant delays (in some
cases up to 2 years) also led to price escalations arising from inflation
and devaluation of the Kenyan shilling. As a result, the projects often
faced higher debt service obligations than originally anticipated, with
repayments coming due before commercial operations had begun.
4.10      Several projects continued to experience difficulties after
project implementation, due to import restrictions imposed during 1982-84,
shortages of domestic raw materials, or Government policies (low sugar
prices for Nzoia Sugar, change in duties affecting Special Steel).
Additionally, overly optimistic market assessments resulted in poor
performance of several projects. Consequently, subloans approved under
Loan 1438-KE have high arrears, witl 12 of 16 loans having arrears over
three months, and 92.5% of the portfolio affected by arrears as of March
31, 1986. Arrears of three months or more amount to 27% of amounts
outstanding.
4.11      On average the subprojects financed under Loan 1438-KE appeared
less import-dependent and more export-oriented than those financed under
earlier loans, but many projects continued to be inward-oriented. Of the
four hotel projects financed, which were expected to produce significant
foreign exchange earnings, only one has been successful. Only three
manufacturing firms have had significant export sales: Double Diamond, Pan
African Paper Mills and Kaluworks. Of the sixteen subprojects, 6 depended
on imports for 75X or more of their raw materials, and only four
manufacturing projects used primarily domestic raw materials. Tourism
accounted for 4 subprojects and 20% of amounts approved, while metals
accounted for 5 subprojects and 35% of amounts approved. Both subsectors
have experienced difficulties during the period under review.
4.12      IDB calculated ex-ante financial and economic rates of return for
all 16 projects, but has not provided ex-post rates of return. The
estimated FRks ranged from 11% to 52%, averaging 25%, while the estimated
ERRs ranged from 12% to 68%, with an average of 30%. Profitability data
available indicates that for many projects the actual FRR and ERR would be
significantly lower than anticipated. Indeed, seven of the 16 projects
have accumulated significant losses, and several have negative net worth.
4.13      Projects under Loan 1438-KE were largely split between new and
expansion/renovation projects. Although both new and expansion projects
have had difficulties, the greenfield operations were more likely to
experience difficulties during implementation. The expansion projects



- 11 -.
which experienced difficulties were those with weak management (Datini,
African Tours and Hotels). Only three projects were located in rural
areas. Annex 4 contains a description of selected projects financed under
Loans 1148-KE and 1438-KE and their present status.
V. OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
5.01      Operations.  During the 1970s, IDB's total approvals increased
about 14% per annum in real terms, significantly higher than forecast at
the time of appraisal of the first loan. Its growth rate exceeded the
estimated growth in capital formation for manufacturing in Kenya during
this period because of strong promotion and successful resource
mobilization. Annex 5 shows IDB's approvals, commitments and disbursements
(actual and projected) for the period 1981-85. During that time, IDB made
87 loans and 4 equity investments, with a significant slowing down of
approvals occurring in 1983-84. IDB made virtually no domestic currency
loans after 1981 because of its own resource and liquidity constraints.
Total approvals during 1981-85 amounted to Ksh 581.7 million, or 63.5% of
projected levels. Much of the shortfall in approvals arose from (i) the
recession; (ii) shortages of foreign exchange during 1982-84; and (iii)
ID's efforts after 1983 to consolidate its operations.  In addition, IDB's
lack of local currency resources diminished demand for its foreign exchange
loans, as it was unable to offer clients an attractive mix of domestic and
foreign currency funds.
5.02      IDB made all its loans to industrial enterprises, but moved away
from large, Government-sponsored projects and approved more loans to
medium-scale enterprises, often to indigenous Kenyan entrepreneurs with
limited experience. Consequently, average loan size declined
significantly. Unfortunately, these projects were often more highly
leveraged than larger enterprises (loan financing could exceed 75% of total
project costs) with IVB often being the only term lender. Thus, IDB's
exposure in individual projects hes increased over time.
5.03      Commitments and disbursements have also been slower than
anticipated, although during 1983-85 IDB improved its pace of commitments
and disbursements. By December 31, 1985, however, undisbursed commitments
remained high at USS 15.3 million, because of (1) slow completion of loan
documentation; (2) technical problems; (3) insufficient sponsors'
contributions; and (4) delays in securing approval from external
creditors. The delays in implementation often have had an adverse effect
on IDb's portfolio performance (para.5.04), as many projects' grace periods
expired and arrears accumulated before commercial activities could begin
and projects faced significant cost overruns.
Portfolio
5.04      Loans.  As noted in the previous PPAR, by 1980 IDB's portfolio
already showed signs of serious problems. By 1980, 34% of the portfolio
was affected by arrears of three months or more. Annex 6 shows the
evolution of IDB's loan portfolio during 1981-85. As of December 31, 1985,
I1 had 98 active projects in its portfolio, including 22 under
implementation, for a total of Ksh 875 million in principal outstanding.
Although growing 169% over 1981 levels in Ksh terms, the portfolio grew
only 72X in USS terms because of the depreciation of the Ksh since 1981.



- 12 -
IDB's portfolio has sharply deteriorated during the past 5 years, with
arrears as a percentage of portfolio increasing from 18% in 1981 to 31% in
1985. Moreover, the arrears affected portfolio has increased significantly
from 51% of portfolio in 1981 to 82% in 1985. 15 projects, amounting to
12% of portfolio, were under receivership at December 31, 1985. Owing to
more intensive project monitoring and arrears follow-up efforts,
collections ratios improved somewhat during 1985, to nearly 100% for the
year. IDB has found, however, that many of its strongest projects are
prepaying their loans (in order to avoid foreign exchange risk), thus
leaving IDB a generally weaker portfolio for which improvements in
collections will come more slowly. IDB also has a core group of about 20
major problem projects, the prospects for which are generally low.
5.05       IDB's portfolio shows a wide range of subsectors, but is
dominated by three subsectors in particular: metal and engineering (27% of
portfolio), tourism (22% of portfolio) and textiles (19% of portfolio).
Although all three subsectors have many troubled projects (and nearly 98%
of the tourism suLsector is affected by arrears), other subsectors,
particularly automotive, wood and mining/quarrying, have arrears in excess
of 50% of total amounts outstanding. Many of these projects, particularly
in wood, food processing and mining/quarrying, are medium-scale enterprises
which were originally undercapitalized and had weak management. A summary
of IDB's portfolio by subsector is shown as Annex 7.
5.06      IDB has accumulated provisions totalling about 9% of gross
portfolio, biut total provisions may still be less than are warranted given
the pervas. ve arrears problem. A total of 45 projects, amounting to 45% of
total amounts outstanding, have arrears of twelve months or more. Proposed
accumulated provisions for 1985 total Ksh 89.4 million, or less than half
of the amounts in arrears over 12 months. IDB suspends interest income for
projects with arrears in excess of 24 months, and since 1983 has suspended
about Ksh 42 million or 15% of total gross loan income. IDB is currently
reviewing its provisions policies with its auditors, and the status of
several projects with long-standing arrears and low provisions.
Equity Investments
5.07      IDB's equity investments as of December 31, 1985 amounted to Ksh
105.3 million in 27 companies. IDB's share of ownership did not exceed 30%
except for three companies (Amgeco, Kicomi and Booth Manufacturing), and
IDB does not have a majority position in any firm. Of the 27 firms, 13 are
profitable, representing 32.5% of IDB's equity portfolio. The remaining 14
firms, including four in receivership, are performing poorly, and 8 of
these 14 had negative net worth in 1985. IDB's dividend return on its
total gross portfolio has also been disappointing during the past several
years, falling well short of appr.aisal estimates. In 1984-85, IDB's
dividend return for the total gross portfolio remained at about 3%.
Returns on the 13 profitable companies alone have been somewhat higher
(only 9 of these firms pay dividends), amounting to 9.6% in 1984 and 8.5%
in 1985. IDB's equity portfolio covers a wide range of sectors, with the
largest subsectoral representations being food, metal/engineering and
tourism. Food projects account for 18.7% of IDB's equity investments: two
of these, South Nyanza Sugar and Nzoia Sugar, are unprofitable because of
low levels of capacity utilization and low sugar prices. IDB's largest
equity holding (21% of the equity portfolio) is in Kicomi, a large
integrated textile project in Kisumu, which has recently undergone
rehabilitation and financial restructuring.



- 13 -
5.08      On balance, IUB's decision to use scarce domestic currency
resources for equity investments has not been fruitful, as the average
dividend returns have been lower than potential interest income (IDB can
charge up to 19% on local currency loans). In addition, IDB's ability to
capture capital gains on its investments has been low, as it finds sales of
these investments, even profitable ones, difficult. Moreover, IDB's total
unrealized return on the gross portfolio was a negative 10.5%, as IDB's
share of net accumulated losses has wiped out its original investment in 12
out of 27 firms. Had IDB put these funds into local currency loans, the
funds might also have had a greater chance of being recycled than they have
had as equity investments. The poor performance of the equity portfolio
has adversely effected IDi's profitability, as IDB has taken an adequate
Ksh 28 million in provisions and writeoffs against the equity portfolio.
5.09      Financial Condition.  During the 1970s, IDB's profitability was
poor due to insufficient spreads, high administrative costs and poor port-
folio performance which necessitated high provisions expenses. Annexes
8-1U, which show IDB's projected and actual balance sheets, income s~.ate-
ments and ratio analyses for the period 1981-85, demonstrate that IDB's
profitability and liquidity continued to suffer ducing the period uader re-
view. Although actual interest income earned was close to projections,
higher administrative costs and significantly higher bad debt provisions
eroded IDB's profitability. Indeed, IDB made losses in 1981 and 1983, and
its return on assets averaged a low 1.4% during 1981-85 compared to the
projected b.7% at the time of the appraisal of loan 1817-KE. Administra-
tive costs averaged 2.2% of average total assets during the period, with a
declining trend over time, from 2.5% of average total assets in 1981 to
1.9% in 1985. While the appraisal team had estimated that bad debt provi-
sions would amount to about 0.5% of average total assets per year, actual
provisions expense had to be increased to 3.0% per annum during the five
year period. IDB's average spread has also been lower than anticipated,
averaging 1.9% in 1981-1985 vs. the projected level of 3.9%. IDB's spreads
have been lower than anticipated despite an increase in interest rates (to
i3%-14%) because IDB needs to suspend interest on loans with arrears of two
years or more. Indeed, in 1985 IDB's spread was a very low 1.2%, which in
itself was inadequate to cover administrative costs and loan provisions.
IDB showed a small profit in 1985, however, largely due to higher invest-
ment income, proceeds from the sale of some investments, and writebacks of
earlier provisions.
5.10      IDB's balance sheet also reflects the weakness of its portfolio.
Current ratios, adjusted to eliminate amounts in arrears from current
assets, averaged a low 1.2:1 during 1981-85. IDB's liquidity hit its low
point in 1982 (current ratio of 0.9), but subsequently improved steadily,
and reached 1.5:1 in 1985. IDB has experienced liquidity problems because
of its poor collections performance, low profitability and its inability to
mobilize deposits (because it did not offer competitive yields for depo-
sits). IDB's debt: equity ratio has remained well within the 4:1 limit
stipulated at the time of appraisal ot Loan 1817-KE, but has increased
steadily from 2.1:1 in 1981 to 3.2:1 in 1985. IDB's leverage has risen
faster than anticipated at appraisal because of (i) lower profitability,
thus depleting IDB's reserves and retained earnings; (i) slow payment of
new share capital; and (iii) devaluation of the Kenyan shilling, which in-
creased LDB's foreign currency denominated debt in Kenyan shilling terms.
The devaluation has similarly affected IDB's loan portfolio and arrears.

Resource Mobilization
5.11      As shown in Annex 12, IDB has been relativel'  successful in
mobilizing external resources for its foreign currency lending requirements,
receiving US $ 65 million in new lines of credit. Between 1980 and 1985,
IDB received new lines of credit from IBRD (US $ 30 million), BADEA (US $ 10
million), the Swiss Government (US $ 10 million) and the African Development
Bank (US $ 20 million). IDB has been less successful, however, in
mobilizing local currency resources aside from additional share
subscriptions from its existing shareholders. Between 1980 and 1985, IDB
attracted US $ 10.3 million equivalent in new share capital, but found it
increasingly difficult to do so as its own performance lagged and some of
its shareholders (in particular National Bank of Kenya and ICDC) lacked the
resources to meet capital subscription obligations. IDB has not borrowed
locally or raised significant new deposits.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01      Although IDB grew rapidly during the 1970s to become an important
source of term finance to industry, its performance during 1981-85 was
largely disappointing. Although the 1979 appraisal mission's diagnosis
regarding the need for consolidation was largely correct, it was not until
late 1984 that IDB made significant progress in slowing its pace of
approvals and strengthening the institution. IDB has taken important steps
to improve project supervision and collections. Loan appraisals have also
improved somewhat and internal review mechanisms &re generally working well.
Nonetheless, the poor record of the projects financed under the two Loans
demonstrate that the selection of projects remained weak well into the early
1980g.
6.02      These internal reforms, however, are not sufficient to make IDB
viable. Because of increased competition for good projects and the lack of
demand for foreign currency denominated loans, IDB will not be able to lend
its way out of its poor portfolio. It will also need the political will and
the cooperation of Government to restructure its portfolio and liquidate
certain unviable projects. Although IDB has be'n successful at mobilizing
external resources, it has been unable to mobilize local currency resources
and thus diversify its financial base because of its poor portfolio and lack
of collateral. Consequently, a fresh look at IDB's role and its structure
are necessary in order to (i) fashion a viable strategy for IDB and the
other industrial development banks in Kenya; (ii) restructure the existing
portfolio; and (iii) provide the resulting institution(s) with the financial
base, autonomy and professional skills necessary. This restructuring is
beginning now under an Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit.
6.03      The lessons learned for the Bank from its relationship with IDB
should be instructive for DFC operations in other countries. First, it
appears that Bank staff underestimated the degree to which politics could be
brought to bear on IDB. Second, our involvement in the industrial and
financial sectors during that period focused very narrowly on IDB and



- 15 -
another DFC client, while supervision appears to have been preoccupied with
subproject reviews, appraisal criteria and other internal matters. Even as
early as 1980, IDB was considered to be at worst a project with moderate
problems, when in fact the arrears affected portfolio had reached 50 percent
of total portfolio and bad debt provisions were minimal. Since IDB's
profitability had been low through the 19709, IDB's reserves were inadequate
to weather the sharp deterioration in portfolio performance during 1982-84.
Despite the Bank's involvement in the development of two Structural
Adjustment Loans during the period under review, little analysis appears to
have been done on the impact of stabilization and liberalization on the
corporate sector and financial system, and in particular, on IDB and its
clients.  Consequently, we were not aware of the depth of the financial
distress within IDB's portfolio until very late.  The relationship with IDB
also provides a telling example that the traditional DFC model --
channelling term foreign exchange loans to industry -- is finding it
increasingly difficult to compete with other financial institutions,
especially in dynamic financial sectors such as Kenya's. Today, facing a
plethora of financial institutions and increasing bank liquidity in Kenya,
IDB is often reduced to providing the most risky financial instruments to
the riskiest clients. More attention should have been paid to the changing
structure of competition in the financial sector in Kenya and in reorienting
IDB to evolve within that framework.

3.  BACKGROUND
Special Steel Mills Limited was incorporated on 30th May, 1980 to
manufacture high quality wire rods, bars, rounds and squares at Ruiru
Township. The project is fully owned by the Bhattessa Family. It
started with an initial share capital of KShs. 23.0 million which has
since been increased to KShs. 50.0 million through capitalization of
KShs. 10.0 million from inter-company loans and KShs. 17.0 million from
revaluation reserve account.
IDB's investment in the project is in the form of a term loan of USS
3,168,526 equivalent which was approved by the Bank's Board of
Directors on 30th April, 1980.  At the time of approval the loan was
equivalent to KShs. 240 million but because of the general devaluation
of the Kenya shilling against major currencies in which the loan was
disbursed, the loan is now equivalent to about KShs. 52 million.  The
loan had a moratorium of two years on principal to be repaid in
fourteen half-yearly installments commencing June, 1982.
4. PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation: The project was originally expected to start
commercial operations in January, 1982. However, there were
delays of about twenty months resulting from delays in land
sub-division and obtaining import licences for vital tooling and
key machinery parts. Due to the delay, original project cost
underestimates, and increase of duty on plant and machinery the
project cost rose from the original estimate of about KShs. 64
mill'n to VShs. 110 million.  Actual commercial operations



- 20                        Annex 4
Page 2 of 26
started in the last quarter of 1983 and as such the project was
not able to keep to the original loan repayment scnedule. On
August 9, 1982, IDB rescheduled the repayment program by three
installments so as to commence in January, 1984.
(ii) Production: Although commercial production started in the last
quarter of 1983, there was no trading during the year.
Furthermore, whereas duty on imported billets was 10% and that on
wire rods was 30% during project conception, it had now been made
uniform at 25% thus eroding the original duty differential. As a
result the project became non-competitive with imported wire rods
and operated much below economic capacity level. It was not able
to service its loans and on 14th September, 1984 IDB was yet
again forced to reschedule the loan by four installments so as to
commence in January, 1986.
5.  PRESENT STATUS
As at 30th November, 1985 IDB outstanding loan was KShs. 53.06 million
while principal and interest arrears had accumulated to a total of
KShs. 10.8 million. Although production and sales have shown some
marked improvement, the operations are well below economic level and
the project is still niot expected to generate sufficient funds to clear
the arrears.
6. IDB ACTION
IDB is working with the sponsors ways of restructuring the company's
financial obligations including the loan repayment schedule so that it
will be in a position to clear the outstanding arrears. This may also
mean holding discussions with the project's other financiers. In the
meantime, IDB has given support to the company's request to the
Government to restructure import duty on billets and wire rods,

3. BACKGROUND
Gnanjivan Screws and Fasteners Limited was incorporated on 17th May,
1979 to manufacture high tensile and precision fasteners. The
shareholders of the company are the Bhattessa Family (60%) and Nalin
Nailworks Limited (40%).  The latter company is fully owned by the
Bhattessa Family. Originally the project was estimated to cost KShs.
15.8 million but was implemented at a total cost of KShs. 26.5 million.
IDB's investment of USS 1,075,052 was approved on 25th July, 1979 to be
repaid over 10 years (including 2 years moratorium), the first
installment being due in December, 1981. The project was originally
expected to start commercial production by July, 1980 but was delayed
until end of 1982, as a result of which in March 1982 the IDB loan had
to be rescheduled by three installments with the first payment due on
15th July, 1983.
As at 30th November, 1985 the IDB outstanding loan was KShs. 11.93
million while principal and interest arrears were KShs. 1.4 million and
KShs. 228,000 respectively.
4. PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation:  The project implementation was delayed for
nearly two and half years due to a number of reasons. Security
arrangements took a long time to finalize as the plot had not yet



- 22 -
Annex 4
Page 4 of 26
been sub-divided.  Central Bank took a long time to approve the
technical collaboration agreement with GKN of Britain, and import
licences were also delayed. Due to this delay there were cost
overruns of nearly KShs. 11.0 million arising from inflation,
exchange rate fluctuations and pre-operational expenses. The
overrun was financed by the sponsors. Obtaining these finances
also contributed to total delay.
(ii)  Operational:  Problems at this stage were lack of raw materials
due to import licence problems, inability to generate bulk sales
due to lack of vital laboratory testing equipment (hence could
not guarantee the Kenya Bureau of Standards requirements)
resulting in capacity underutilization. The initial problem of
quality was overcome with the installation of quality testing
equipment.
5. PRESENT STATUS
Although operations are *till below projected levels, the company has
continued to service'the IDB loan satisfactorily. However Annual
Accounts Reports are not provided in time.

3.  BACKGROUND
- Kaluworks Limited was incorporated in February, 1968 as a limited
liability company to manufacture and trade in a wide range of household
ware. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kenya Aluminum
Industrial Works Limited which is a holding company and itself wholly
owned and controlled by the Chandaria Group.
IDB's investment of US$ 2,292,993 was approved on 26th April, 1978 for
the expansion of the company's er.amelware and plasticware capacities.
The expansion was to involve the installation of a furnace with
greater capacity and increasing the number of injection -opulding
machines with higher capacities.
By the time of IDB's loan approval the expansion was already underway
and was expected to be complete in the last quarter of 1979. In the
first quarter of 1980 the full project expansion was coroleted and
production started.
4. PRESENT STATUS
The project has been operating without any major problems and its IDB
loan servicing has been satisfactory.

3.  BACKGROUND
Steel Billet Castings Limited was incorporated in 1978 with the
objective of implementing a project to manufacture steel billets using
locally available ferrous scrap. The major shareholders are Steel
Rolling Mills Limited, IDB (12.5%) and individual private investors.
IDB's first loan investment of US$ 1,677,420 was approved on 22nd
November, 1977. At the same time, an IDB equity investmeat of KShs.
125 million was approved by IDB's Board of Directors. A second loan
investment of US$ 1,238,880 was approved on 14th June, 1978. Finally a
local currency loan investment of KShs. 3.50 million was approved on
25th May, 1981.
The company started commercial operations in November, 1980 but
continued to make losses until 1983 as a result of which losses
accumulated to KShs. 22 million and Steel Billets could not service its
loans. In the last three years the company has be~en registering some
profits and is paying IDB in order to liquidate the accumulated
principal and interest arrears. As at 30th November, 1985, principal
and interest arrears stood at KShs. 14 million and KShs. 6.4 million
respectively.
4. PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation:  Production was originally expected to commence
in April, 1979 but was delayfd for nearly 18 months and
commissioning of the plant was done only in October, 1980. The
actual cost of the completed project together with revised
working capital requirements of KShs. 21.7 million was KShs. 62



25                            Annex 4
Pale 7 of 26
million resulting In cost overruns of KShs. 10 million. The
delay In Implementation was due to a delay of nearly 14 months
before the agreement was reached between IDB and Standard Bank
Ulmited on the Issue of securitiei. A further delay of 4 months
was due to non-availability of raw materials and mistakes In
structural fittings which caused the work to be re-done.
Machinery delivery was also delayed due to dock strikes in the
harbors.
(1i)  Production: Initially the performance of the project was below
expectation prlncipally due to low billet price realization,
shortage of scrap and unavallability of adequate Import licences
for essential raw saterial Inputs. While the problem of imported
raw material Inputs has now been solved, the project is still
operating well below capacity due mainly to lack of locally
generated ferrous scrap. A sister company has now been formed to
produce sore scrap through ship breaking In Mombasa, but
continued competition from imported billets may limit their local
production.
5. IDB ACTION
Because of financlal problem  experienced by the project, IDS on 29th
November, 1984 reschiduled the loan repayment by six Installments so
that installments due in 1985, 1986 and 1987 would be payable in 1988.
The company has agreed to make monthly payments of KShs. 500,000/- to
offset the outstanding arrears.

2.  BACKGROUND
Alpharama Limited is the former Double Diamond Tanneries Limited which
was owned by Mr. F.N. Macharia, Mr. K.L. Bhasin and Mr. S.N. Hamawi.
The company changed its name after a change in ownership and management
in December, 1982. The present shareholders in the company are
Mr. F.N. Macharia (46%), Mr. A. Combos and Mr. H. Combos. The latter
two are British citizens (residing in Kenya) and together have 60%
shareholding in the company through a locally incorporated company,
Intralga Limited.
IDB loan investment of USS 333,750 was approved on 28th March, 1979.
Although commercial operation of Double Diamond Tanneries Ltd. started
in May, 1980 on schedule, two main setbacks adversely affected the
company's financial position. First was the imposition of a ban on
export of semi-processed hides and skins in June 1980, which was lifted
six months later. More seriously, in December, 1981, the company had
problems with health authorities in respect of the effluent treatment
plant and discharge of treated water into the Athi River.
Immediately after taking over, the new company embarked on a major
re-organization programme including modification of factory buildings,
improvement of the effluent treatment plant, installation of reliable
water supply and storage systems, and installation of additional
machinery and equipment. This expansion programme resulted in
quadrupling the project's tanning capacity and satisfactory servicing
of the IDB loan. As at 30th November, 1985 the outstanding loan was
KShs. 1.23 million while total arrears in principal and interest were
nil.
3.  PRESENT STATUS
The company is up-to-date in the servicing of IDB loans.   It is,
however, not possible to ascertain the actual financial position since
the company has not yet provided the Bank with performance reports.
However, the position may be assumed to be satisfactory on the basis of
its loan servicing record and increased output.

3.  BACKGROUND
Hotelspan Limited was incorporated on 5th February 1979 as a private
company for the purpose of developing and owning Diani Reef Hotel which
is situated at the South Coast, Mombaz^;  The shareholders of the
company are Sonotels International (75.12%), IDB (15.24X) and Siana
Mara (9.64Z).
IDB approved a term loan of US$ 2.23 million and equity investment of
KShs. 4.9 million on 17th January, 1979.' In November, 1980 IDB
approved a second loan of US$ 1.05 million and further equity of KShs.
1.96 million bringing the total equity investment to KShs. 6.86
million. The original cost estimate for the 300 bed luxury hotel was
KShs. 43 million and provided for expansion to 500 beds. The final
project cost escalated to KShs. 110 million. The first phase of the
expansion is in the process of being implemented using loan finance
from a Scotland Bank and E.C.G.D. guarantee.
As at 30th November, 1985, IDB outstanding loan was KShs. 47.33 million
while principal and interest arrears had accumulated to KShs. 6.831
million and 5.783 million respectively.

Page 10 of 26
4.  MAJOR PROBLEMS
Implementation: This was expected toicom_ence in January, 1979 but
was delayed for one year while allocation of the plot was being
negotiated with the Governmnt. The plot was finally acquired ln
January, 1980 at a cost of K She 880,000 as opposed to the original
assumption of acquiring It free of charge. Construction work began
immediately and the project was comissloned In December, 1981.
Although the original project cost was a mere KShs 43 million, it
finally cost K She 110 allilon to complete. The main causes of these
large cost increases were:
-   delays in project start-up resulting In price escalations In
imported Items and the duties and sale tax. Long implemantation
period also Increased professional and consultancy fees.
-   devaluation of the Kenya shilling
-   poor project planning and management
-   omission of essential cost Items such as land, laundry and kitchen
equipment.
Operation: The company has been having marketing problems; both room
and bed occupancy have been low especially during low tourist season.
The company's losses have resulted in accumulated losses of about
KShs 75 million.
5. IDB ACTION
In 1984 the term lenders agreed to reschedule loans. IDB is
dissatisfied with the hotel's tariff structure and credit policies but
management is adamant that the hotel is realizing the best rates and
good efforts are being put in collecting the overdue accounts. IDB has
decided not to make any further Investment In the company for the
proposed expansion.

3.  BACKGROUND
The current shareholders of Datini Merchantile Limited acquired the
company as a going concern in 1976. The project produces
wheelbarrows, metal shelving and other metal products.
IDB loan investment in the project was approved on 25th October, 1978
for the purpose of completing a proposed expansion programme which Vas
to triple the project's output. The expansion programme was completed
in 1981 almost two years behind schedule; as a result of which
commencement of loan repayment coincided with that of production. The
company found itself in financial problems and after paying the first
two installments it approached IDB for rescheduling of subsequent
installments falling due in 1982. Although this was approved by IDS,
the project was still not able to service its loans and arrears
continued to accumulate.
4.  MAJOR PROBLEMS
(i)   In the last few years, several competitors have entered the
market, particularly that of wheelbarrows. The company was not
able to react appropriately because of poor marketing management.
(ii) The company is also experiencing working capital problems and haa
stretched its overdraft facility with Standard Bank to the limit.
(iii) As a result of the devaluation of the Kenya shilling, the
company's debt level has almost doubled. This has meant higher
service charges.

5.  1DB ACTION
As a result of the continued poor performance by the company, IDB in
November, 1984 carried out a detailed review of the project's
operations and came up with recommendations on marketing, management
reorganization, diversification of the product range and technical
management improvement. With the implementation of these
recommendations, the company's performance has improved with monthly
sales picking up well. With some assistance from the Commonwealth
Secretariat, the company is launching a diversification program which
is aimed at boosting sales. A monthly repayment of KShs. 200,000 has
been agreed on to help clear the arrears.

3. BACKGROUND
The company was incorporated in August, 1975 and commenced commercial
production in October, 1978. The paid up share capital of KShs. 210
million is subscribed by Kenya Government (94.8%), Five-Cail Babcock
(2.8%), and IDB (2.4%). IDB loan investment of US$ 1,975,309 was
approved on 26th October, 1977, while equity investments of KShs. 5.0
million was approved on 26th April, 1978.
4.  MAJOR PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation: There were no major problems during
implementation. The project started operations in time and was
implemented at a cost of KShs. 548 million as opposed to the
estimate of KShs. 542.4 million.
(ii)  Operation: Since the company commenced commercial operations the
trading results have been characterized by continuous losses.
The main reasons for poor financial performance are: capacity
under-utilization resulting from inadequate cane supply, lower
recovery factor due to low quality and machinery inefficiency,
heavy debt servicing due to high debt/equity ratio, poor loan
terms and devaluation of the Kenya shilling and high cost of
inputs and unmatched prices of sugar.

Page 14 of 26
5. PRESENT STATUS
As a result of the poor performance the company was projected to
register total losses of KShs. 606 million as at 31st March, 1985 and
its net worth eroded to negative KShs. 366 million. The company is
therefore technically insolvent.
The Government has continued to settle the long term French loans on
behalf of the company having paid FF 152,667,274 an equivalent of
KShs. 252.6 million as at 31st August, 1985. The company has, however,
been servicing IDB loan regularly.

3.  BACKGROUND
Synresins Limited is owned by Newtech Industries (Kenya) Ltd. which
was incorporated in July 1976 to develop and promote a resins project
in Kenya.  IDB's investment in the project was approved on 19th
December, 1979. The loan was payable in nine years including a two
year moratorium so that the first installment was due in January,
1982. However, by the end of the moratorium period the project had not
started operations and could therefore not meet the repayments. On 7th
January, 1982 IDB rescheduled the loan by two installments so that loan
repayment would commence in January, 1983. Even after the
rescheduling, the company continued to accumulate arrears on principal
and interest. IDB was again forced to reschedule the loan on 29th
November, 1984 by four installments such that installments due in 1985
and 1986 would now be paid in 1990.
4.  MAJOR PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation:  The project implementation was delayed by about
ten months due to delayed approvals of technical franchise and
machinery supply agreement by Central Bank. This delay also led
to cost overruns. There were also delays in commissioning due to
problems in obtaining licences for raw materials required for
project commissioning.



Annex 4
34                               Paoe 16 of 26
(11) Production: During the first year of production, the level of
operation was very low due to Insufficient working capital and
long delays in approvals of import licences for raw material.
Although production Improved in later years, the project still
continued to experience problems of competition from imported
products, lack of local raw materials and working capital. In
1985 the company's performance improved and overall production
and sales were within the budget.
5.  PRESENT STATUS
As at 30th November, 1985 the total IDB outstanding loan was KShs.
18.52 million while total arrears (principal and interest) had
accumulated to KShs. 5.198 million. The company has been making
monthly repayments of KShs. 240,000 so as to liquidate arrears. With
the improved performance 1DB may ask for enhancement of this amount.

2. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
The company has not provided its audited annual accounts and reports
since 1980 because it has not been able to meet audit fees due to the
auditors.
3. BACKGROUND
The Lodge was started as a luxury tented camp in Isiolo Game Reserve,
Samburu. African Tours & Hotels Limited became a major shareholder in
1977 when it acquired 51% of the shares. The balance was held by
Isiolo County Council (41.4%), and other local investors.
IDB's investment of US$ 133,097 term loan and KShs. 810,000 equity
(7.6%) was approved on 23rd March, 1979. The term loan is guaranteed
jointly by African Tours & Hotels Limited, and Kenya Tourist
Development Corporation. The project has continuously made losses
because of poor performance resulting from failure to attract business
as it cannot compete with lodges in the area. As a result, the IDB
loan to the project has not been serviced and as at 30th November, 1985
the outstanding loan was KShs. 2.26 million while principal and
interest arrears had accumulated to KShs. 700,626 and KShs. 598,803
respectively. The ATHL Directors want to reschedule the IDB loan.
4. PRESENT STATUS
The project needs a face-lift estimated to cost KShs. 2.4 million in
order to compete with others in the area.

3.  BACKGROUND
Booth Manufacturing Africa Limited BMAL is a private company wholly
owned by Kenya Aluminum Works Ltd (KALW) which is in turn wholly owned
by the Chandaria Group. KAIW is itself a holding company owning and
charged with the running (in addition to BMAL) of Kaluworks Limited in
Mombasa, and Ideal Casements Ltd in Nairobi.
BMAL came into being in June 1973, when KAIW purchased the present
manufacturing business from Booth Manufacturing Company Ltd., the
latter being part of the British firm of Tombooth, whose activities are
general trade and export.
IDB's first investment which was approved in 1976 was for an expansion
and diversification programme in the industrial area, Nairobi. The
diversification program involved putting up a new factory for the
manufacture of extended aluminum sections. The second investment
approved in 1977 was for re-location of the project (from Nairobi to
Thika) and increasing thp scope of the project to include facilities to
manufacture copper and brass tubes. The Nairobi site was only adequate
for aluminum tubes. Finally the third investment approved in 1978 was
to finance part of the rozt overruns.
4. PROBLEMS
(i)   Implementation:  The changes in the scope of the project and
relocation resulted in long delays in project implementation.
This, plus increase in built-up area, requirement for deeper
foundation and increase in the cost of building materials and



- 38 -
Annex 4
Page 20 of 26
power supply resulted in cost overruns of about KShs. 7.3
million.
(1i) Production: The performance of the Thika plant has been affected
by competition from continued imports. Generally the project's
performance is improving thus increasing the overall
profitability of BMAL.
IDB ACTION
No special action is being taken by IDB apart from regular mopitoring and
pressing for loan repayment. The company is considering prepayment of
the IDB loan.

3.  BACKGROUND
Panafrican Paper Mills Limited was incorporated in 1970 as a joint
venture between the Government of Kenya (33.9%), Oriental Paper Mills
(29.3%), IFC (24.9%), ICDC (5.6%), DFCK (1.6%), EADB (3.6%) and BODC
k1.1%).
In addition to bleached and un-bleached paper, the company has
introduced production of news print by installing a mechanical pulp
section. Because of the diversity in type and quality of paper demand
in the printing and paper conversion industry, the mill has had to
adjust and now produces about 80 different grades of bleached paper.
The mill also has a caustic soda/hydro chloric acid plant that supplies
its own req'irements and supplies a surplus to the local market.
Dividends were declared in 1980, 1982 and 1983 but because of no price
increases for a number of years, dividends were not declared in 1983.
Inspite of a price increase of 7.5% which was granted in 1984 the
trading results for 1985 recorded a loss of KShs. 9.0 million as a
result of continued weakening of the Kenya shilling against major
foreign currencies, rising costs of inputs and spare parts and
inadequate price adjustment for the end products.
The servicing of IDB loan continues to be satisfactory and as at 30th
November, 1985 the outstanding loan was KShs. 9.942 million while total
arrears were only KShs. 12,210.

Company long term debts totalled K Shs 16.74 million as of December, 1984.
IDB Involvement
SMKL was started as a joint venture between local bodies and
Saltex International, an Italian firm. Saltex International organized the
supply of project machinery, and was given an 8 year contract from 1975 to
implement and manage the project. The project was to be carried out in two
phases with the saltworks initially producing 50,000 and ultimately 80,000
tons of raw salt per year; and the refinery producing 10 tons of refined
salt per hour of operation.
In 1974, IDB provided K SHs 2 million equity and US$336,000 in
loans to SMKL, but due to increased costs during implementation, the Bank
had by 1979 invested a total of K Shs 2.5 million in equity (21.7%
shareholding) and US$1,017,851 in two loans in SMKL. The loans were
K Sh 7.1 million equivalent at date of approval and were scheduled to be
fully repaid by December, 1983.
Project Implementation
A major problem of SMKL project has been the prolonged
implementation period and subsequent cost overruns. While the refinery at
Mombasa was completed in 1977, the saltworks implementation dragged on for
4 years. A first salt harvest of 8600 tons were however made at the works
in 1980.



- 41 -
Aainex 4
Page 23 of 26
Due to the poor management and long delay in implamentation,
project total cost increased from an estimated Shs 28.9 million to Shs 40.0
million.
Past Performance and IDB Loan Servicing
The delay in implementation of the saltworks meant that the
refinery had to operate with imported raw salt supplies for longer than
originally anticipated. Importing raw salt more than doubled the estimated
cost of harvesting the raw salt at Gongoni. SMKL's initial performance was
further adversely affected by the increased preoperating expenses and the
poor, costly management under Saltec International culminating in the
termination of the management contract in 1979. Due to these problems the
company continued accumulating heavy losses until 1983. Since 1984,
resulting from IDB active involvement in rehabilitation of the project,
performance has drastically improved with profits increasing from Shs 3.39
million in 1983 to Shs 7.88 million in 1984. This has offset most of the
accumulated losses.

3.  Background
Yuken was originally conceived as a joint venture between a Yugoslav
group (Yugotextil) and ICDC.  IDB was later invited to join as both a
shareholder and lender. The original Yuken was therefore, owned by the
three parties on an equal basis i.e. 33 1/3 per cent.
The company commenced operations in 1978 and since then performance has
been poor. By the end of 1984, the company had accumulated losses
totalling over K Shs 39 million.  In 1983, ICDC took over total
ownership of the company by buying out the shareholding of both the
Yugoslav groups and IDB. The company also opened its own retail
outlets through the incorporation of a subsidiary (Y-Fashions) which
has consistently returned losses.
4.  Major Problems
The problem of this company have been identified as poor management,
lack of working capital and severe competition from other cheaper
manufacturers. During Yuken's existence, various measures have been
proposed and implemented but no appreciable improvement has been
achieved. One major problem here has been that measures have been
implemented on a piecemeal basis with very little contribution to the
revival of the project.

5. Proposed Action
Agreement was reached in September, 1985 between the owners and lenders
on the iumlementation of a proposed rehabilitation programme which
Involve additional equity injection, capitalization of accrued Interest
and loan rescheduling. On its part IDB in principle agreed to spread
the accrued interest over 3 years starting from January, 1986, and
reschedule the principal repayments to January, 1989. The company also
agreed to pay She 75,000 per month beginning September, 1985 to meet
the current interest but has continually defaulted on the arrangement.
IDB is executing more pressure on ICDC who owns the company outright.

DAWA PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED
Backf,round
Dawa Pharmaceuticals Limited was incorporated on April 30, 1974
as a private limited liability company with the objective of owning and
operating a pharmaceutical and veterinary drugs plant in Kenya. The
sponsors of the project were the ICDC, KRKA Pharmaceutical Works of
Yugoslavia and three local Kenyan investors.
In September, 1975 the IDB Board approved a loan of US$1.12
million then equivalent to Shs. 8.0 million towards the financing of this
project whose capital costs had been estiamted at K Shs 42.964 million.
The loan was for a period of 10 years including 2 years moratorium at an
interest rate of 11% per annum. The first instalment of principal was to
be paid on December 30, 1978.
Project lmplementation was completed at the end of 1976 and
commercial production commenced In March, 1977.
Past Performance
Dawa's initial performance was initially vary poor, but over the
years has greatly improved and presently the company is able to service its
debts. The following is a summary of performance over the last five years.

Cumulative Loss  (24,427)   (24,427)   (27,755)  (24,193)   (23,298)
The company profitability is declining due to low sales volume
for some product lines. The company's management is rectifying the
situation by vigorously pursuing the new marketing strategies especially in
the export market.
IDB Action
Debt servicing has been satisfactory and only Shs 16,701 was
outstanding as arrears as at June 31, 1985. IDB is to monitor the project
closely.
