                           Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
        Excellency:

               We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (“the Agreement?) dated December 16, 2005, for
        the above-referenced Project, between the Republic of Mozambique (“the Borrower?) and the
        International Development Association (“Association?).

                As you know, the Association fulfills its fiduciary mandate by conducting Procurement Prior
        Reviews as well as Procurement Post Reviews, for the projects it finances. In an effort to speed up the
        procurement process and in the context of overall simplification and modernization of procurement
        procedures, the Association proposes to increase the minimum thresholds values for contracts subject to
        Association’s prior review by deleting Schedule 3 of the Development Credit Agreement to be replaced
        with the Annex to this amendment letter.

                All other provisions of the Agreement, as amended herein, shall remain in full force and effect.

                Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendments to the Agreement on behalf of the
        Recipient by countersigning and dating the two original copies of this letter and returning one
        countersigned original to us. Upon receipt by the Association of this countersigned copy, this amendment
        shall become effective as of the date of the countersignature.

                                                Sincerely,
                                INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
