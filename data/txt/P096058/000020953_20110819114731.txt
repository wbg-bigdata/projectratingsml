     However, activities in Guinea-Bissau and Cote d’Ivoire have not been eligible for the GEF financing and
     have been financed by WAEMU directly with the budgetary support of the French Development Agency
     (AFD). Niger was not included in the list of countries which benefit from GEF financing as it was not

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A. SUMMARY

1.      The West Africa Regional Biosafety Project is part of the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) Regional Program for Biosafety, adopted in 2007. The
project is funded through two main instruments: a Global Environment Fund (GEF) Trust
Fund (TF091199) in the amount of US$5,400,000 and an International Development
Agency (IDA) Credit to Burkina Faso (Cr. 4368-BUR) in the amount of US$3,900,000.
Both instruments were submitted to Board as one project, a fully blended GEF/IDA
operation, sharing a common Project Development Objective (PDO).2 The project was
approved by the Board on November 13, 2007 and became effective on July 7, 2008 for
the IDA Credit, and October 2, 2008 for the GEF Grant. The Closing Date is June 30,
2012. The project is complemented by the PAFASP (Programme d’Appui aux Filières
Agro-sylvo Pastorales), an Agriculture project, which provides a contribution of US$
1,200,000 million aiming at building capacity in biosafety in Burkina Faso.

2.       The project comprises the following three components:

        Component A: (1) Assessing and evaluating existing tools and guidelines for risk
         assessment and management; (2) Establishing an accredited national reference
         biosafety laboratory in Burkina Faso with a regional profile; (3) Developing
         regional common approaches for risk assessment and management, inspection,
         and monitoring and evaluation of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs); and (4)
         Disseminating the regional guidelines in the WAEMU region through the regional
         Biosafety Clearing House (BCH) central portal.3

        Component B: (1) Preparing a regional law and regulation on biosafety (Regional
         Biosafety Framework – RBF); (2) Creating an institutional framework to
         implement the new legal instruments in the WAEMU Member States; and (3)
         Project management, monitoring and evaluation.

        Component C: Supporting the implementation of the national and regional,
         institutional, legal and regulatory biosafety framework in WAEMU Member
         States who have ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB).

3.      The GEF Agreement finances all project activities except sub-component A2
(biosafety laboratory in Burkina Faso), which is funded through the IDA (Cr. 4368-
BUR). The project is executed by two implementing agencies: WAEMU Commission
for the activities financed from the proceeds of the GEF grant, and the National Biosafety
Agency of Burkina Faso for activities financed from the proceeds of the IDA credit (sub-
component A2) in collaboration with PAFASP for the fiduciary aspects.

 There is a slight difference in the PDO wording of the GEF and IDA agreements. See Section C below.

 The BCH is a mechanism set up by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to facilitate information
exchange on Living Modified Organisms.

4.      This Restructuring Paper outlines changes to be made to both the GEF
(TF091199) and IDA (Cr. 4368-BUR) legal agreements. In specific, it proposes the
following changes: (i) the amendment of the PDO and PDO Level Results Indicator to
reflect a more realistic objective taking into account current level of implementation and
time left before closing date; (ii) introduction of changes in the description of the three
project components in support of the revised PDO and in accordance with the
recommendations of the MTR; (iii) reallocation of GEF Trust Fund and IDA Credit
proceeds; and (iv) addition of a Goods category to the list of categories of Eligible
Expenditures in the GEF Grant Agreement mainly for the purchase of equipments for
eligible Member States’ national biosafety laboratories.

B. PROJECT STATUS

5.      The current PDO performance rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory since under the
current design it is expected that the project would not be able to achieve its stated
objective. This is attributed to the over-ambitious nature of project activities in contrast to
the unequal capacities of participating countries and the insufficient time allocated for
substantive consultations in the ECOWAS space. The project Mid-Term Review (MTR),
which took place between 4 and 15 of April, 2011, indicated that intensive consultations
between countries and stakeholders and additional coordination efforts between
WAEMU and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries
which are not members of WAEMU were essential to achieve a regional harmonized
regulatory biosafety framework that is accepted and sustainable. Therefore, it is essential
to redirect project intervention toward intensifying regional and national capacity
building for the implementation of the CPB and harmonization of risk assessment
procedures and tools (as has been the focus of other GEF biosafety projects in Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and in India). A recent assessment
conducted by the WAEMU Commission indicated weak capacity in the WAEMU
countries, calling for capacity building.

6.      Implementation performances have also been weak, mainly as a result of
WAEMU Commission internal financial management and procurement procedures
centralized at the President’s level, which is not favorable for a timely implementation. In
particular, payment authorizations have been under the responsibility of the President of
the WAEMU Commission, and have not been delegated to the Implementing Department
(DDRE) as initially envisaged. Besides that, the financial management review carried out
in April 2011 concluded that financial management is satisfactory and the risk is
moderate. There is neither pending audit nor interim financial report (IFR). The weak
performances of the procurement specialist and interpersonal tensions between RCU staff
have also strongly affected implementation performance. This has been fixed following
the resignation of the communication specialist, the non renewal of the contract of the
procurement specialist, the recruitment of a monitoring and evaluation specialist. The
Procurement review conducted in April 2011 recommended the recruitment of a
procurement consultant which is underway.



7.     The following progress has been made under the three project components:


                                              5
Component A: A study assessing and evaluating existing tools and guidelines for risk
assessment and management is currently underway. In addition, draft Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment/Environmental Management Plans and an engineering plan
have been prepared for the construction of a national biosafety laboratory with a regional
profile in Burkina Faso and finalization is underway with international technical
assistance. Noteworthy, due to procurement delays, the construction of the national
laboratory and the purchase of necessary equipment are only expected toward the end of
the project. Therefore, the laboratory will not be operational before project closing as
originally planned. Finally, a contract has been signed for the preparation of a regional
manual for risk assessment and management, inspection, and monitoring and evaluation
of LMOs. As a final output, the manual will be validated and posted to BCH central
portal before project closing. The WAEMU Commission will take over further
dissemination of the manual after project closing through its own resources as part of the
WAEMU biosafety program.

Component B: A draft regional regulation on biosafety (the RBF) has been prepared by a
committee of experts from WAEMU, ECOWAS and the Permanent Inter-State
Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS). The regulation covers both West
Africa (the ECOWAS and WAEMU spaces) and Chad, and consultations are currently
underway in all countries. With the addition of ECOWAS to the process and given the
unequal capacity across countries, the adoption of the RBF will take time and this process
should and cannot be rushed. A study identifying the institutional framework for the
dissemination and implementation of the regulation in the WAEMU and ECOWAS
countries is ongoing, but the creation of the institutional framework itself will only
materialize after the RBF and its implementation decree have been adopted. Project
management and M&E are ongoing as planned, with Implementation Performance rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory due to delays in project implementation, and WAEMU’s
internal financial management and procurement procedures which are not favorable for
timely implementation. Disbursement rate stands at 23% of the GEF Grant and 13% of
the IDA Credit. Disbursement rates are low due to delays in project activities and
procurement difficulties. All audit reports have been submitted and reporting is timely.

Component C: All WAEMU countries have established national committees on biosafety
whose role is to coordinate the implementation of the National and future Regional
Biosafety Framework; and a communication strategy has been prepared by the project. A
capacity building needs assessment had been carried out and priority training activities
have been implemented. Due to the fact that the RBF will not be adopted by project
closing, a number of consequent planned outputs will not be realized by the project,
including the strengthening of the regulatory and policy environment in participating
countries, and the strengthening of human, institutional and regulatory capacities to
enable the countries to implement the Framework.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.      This Restructuring Paper proposes the following changes to the GEF and IDA
legal agreements, which will result in a revised project design that is more inclusive and


                                            6
responsive to current physical and human capacities within the participating countries,
allows for broader and deeper consultations about the future Regional Biosafety
Framework, and builds better on current efforts made by WAEMU in the area of
biosafety. Specifically, this paper proposes the following changes: (i) the amendment of
the PDO and PDO Level Results Indicator to reflect a more realistic objective, (ii)
introduction of changes in the description of the three project components in support of
the revised PDO and in accordance with the recommendations of the MTR; (iii)
reallocation of GEF Trust Fund and IDA Credit proceeds; and (iv) addition of a Goods
category to the list of categories of Eligible Expenditures in the GEF Grant Agreement
mainly for the purchase of equipments for eligible Member States’ national biosafety
laboratories.

9.     Project’s Development Objectives

The original PDO for GEF TF091199 was: Support the recipient for the establishment of
an operational institutional, legal and regulatory regional biosafety framework for the
regulation of living modified organisms.

The original PDO for IDA Cr. 4368-BUR was: Support the West African Economic and
Monetary Union for the establishment of an operational institutional, legal and regulatory
regional biosafety framework for the regulation of living modified organisms.

The revised PDO (for both GEF and IDA legal agreements) is: (a) Strengthen the
institutional, scientific and legal capacity of the WAEMU Commission and Member
States in relation to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in the sub-region, and (b)
support the preparation of a draft Regional Regulatory Biosafety Framework.

The revised PDO reflects the recommendations of the MTR as agreed with the WAEMU
Commission and supported by all stakeholders, to focus project activities and funds on
regional and national capacity to implement the CPB as has been the focus of GEF
biosafety projects in the LAC region and in India. The second objective reflects the
outcome of current efforts made by ECOWAS Commission, WAEMU Commission and
CILSS under the project to establish the RBF, which is likely to remain in draft form at
project closing. The proposed revised PDO will be realistically achievable before the
Closing Date, June 30, 2012. It is expected that WAEMU and ECOWAS Commissions
will carry out the necessary consultations and dissemination of information to their
Member States leading to the eventual adoption of the RBF after the project has closed,
and following intensive consultations with all participating countries and key
stakeholders.

10.    Results/indicators

The original PDO Level Results Indicator is: Percentage of applications received by the
national competent authorities for field trials and commercial releases that concern crops
of high priority for the Recipient’s territory, as defined in accordance with the Recipient’s
agricultural policy, which have been processed (approved or declined) and reviewed on
the basis of the science-based risk assessment and management procedures established by



                                             7
the reference laboratory with a regional dimension established under Part A (ii) of the
Project.

The revised PDO Level Indicators are:

         At least 25% of trained researchers and other stakeholders apply the knowledge
          they have acquired in their activities related to biosafety by the end of the project;

         A draft Regional Regulatory Biosafety Framework available by the end of the
          project.

The first indicator would measure the level of capacity built by the project and its effect
on related decision making by stakeholders. These include researchers, professors,
decision makers, inspectors, custom officials, producers’ organization, civil society, Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. The second indicator
measures the impact of ongoing efforts to prepare the RBF to be utilized by the WAEMU
and ECOWAS Member States. The original indicator cannot be maintained since it relies
on the availability of an operational biosafety laboratory and the Framework as pre-
conditions.

Revisions to project intermediate results are proposed as follows (for more details, see
Annex 1):

          Component A
          Original Intermediate Result: Regional risk assessment and management
          methodologies designed and disseminated in the WAEMU region.
          Revised Intermediate Result: The capacity for detection, analysis and
          management of biotechnology risks of WAEMU and its Member states
          strengthened.

          Component B
          Original Intermediate Result: Institutional, legal and regulatory regional biosafety
          framework, taking into account Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) related to
          LMOs, elaborated and monitored at WAEMU level.
          Revised Intermediate Result: A draft Regional Regulatory Biosafety Framework
          on biosafety available, consultations are held and stakeholders ‘comments and
          concerns documented.

          Component C
          Original Intermediate Result: Biosafety framework implemented in the eight
          beneficiary countries, taking into account the views of national stakeholders and
          IPR capacity built.
          Revised Intermediate Result: The capacity of WAEMU Commission and its
          Member States to implement the CPB strengthened.

12. Financing

Reallocations: An addition of a Goods category to the list of categories of Eligible
Expenditures under the GEF Agreement and a reallocation of the GEF Grant proceeds are
required for the purchase of equipment for eligible Member States’ national biosafety
laboratories. The equipment will increase the countries’ capacity to comply with the CPB
by carrying out risk assessment of LMOs and conducting post-release monitoring. For
this purpose, proceeds will be reallocated from the Consultant services, Audits and
Training and Unallocated categories to the newly established Goods category. In-house
training, difficulties to hire international qualified (and francophone) consulting firms,
and the decision to develop the RBF through WAEMU, ECOWAS and CILSS experts
rather than hiring an international firm have allowed cost savings which could be directed
to the purchasing of goods.

A reallocation of the IDA Credit proceeds is required to accommodate the additional
costs which will be incurred by the construction of a new biosafety laboratory in Burkina
Faso. The PAD calls for the rehabilitation of an existing laboratory, based on which the
proceeds allocation was determined. However, during implementation it became clear
that a new laboratory had to be established because the site envisaged initially turned out
to be inappropriate, resulting in a shortfall under the Works category. Therefore, proceeds
will be reallocated from the Goods and Unallocated categories to the Works category.
The above-mentioned reallocation of GEF Grant proceeds will compensate for the
reduction in the IDA Goods amount. For more detail, see Annex 2.

13.    Financing plan: The following revised financing plan is proposed:

More efficient financial management and procurement procedures will be put in place
within WAEMU, especially a signing delegation from the President to the implementing
department in procurement, financial management and budget approval, withdrawal
applications and use of the special account;


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

15.     Technical. Under Component A, the project will produce a regional manual for
risk assessment and management of LMOs and LMO products as planned. The manual
will be validated and posted on the BCH central portal. The planned dissemination at the
national level through workshops and specific trainings for regional and national
stakeholders will be carried out by the WAEMU Commission through its own resources
after project closing. The project will enhance the capacity of the national laboratories to
comply with the CPB which are very weak as highlighted by a detailed needs assessment
carried out by the Commission in the eight participating countries. These laboratories do
not have the basic equipment to carry out risk assessment of LMOs, nor to conduct post
release monitoring. Therefore it is critical to strengthen their capacity in order to reduce
the disparity and move toward regional harmonization of risk assessment procedures and
tools. Component B of the project will produce a draft Regional Regulatory Biosafety
Framework, but its adoption and the establishment an institutional framework for its
implementation is not achievable within the current timeframe. Given the disparity in
capacity across the countries, this will take much more time, intensive consultations with
countries and stakeholders, and additional coordination efforts with ECOWAS countries
(e.g. Nigeria is close to pass its national law and is reluctant to support the proposed
centralized decision making process). These sub-regional consultations are very
important, and the process should and cannot be rushed. This process can be sustained by


                                            12
WAEMU and ECOWAS with their own resources and time-frame. Through its
component C, the project will intensify regional and national capacity building for the
implementation of the Cartagena protocol (as has been the focus of GEF biosafety
projects in other countries and regions such as LAC and India). A recent assessment
showed weak capacity in the WAEMU countries and a strong demand for such capacity
building.

3. The addition of a Goods category to the list of categories of Eligible Expenditures under
   the GEF Agreement and a reallocation of the GEF Grant proceeds are required for the
   purchase of equipment for eligible Member States’ national biosafety laboratories. The
   equipment will increase the countries’ capacity to comply with the CPB by carrying out
   risk assessment of LMOs and conducting post-release monitoring. For this purpose,
   proceeds will be reallocated from the Consultant Services, Audits and Training and
   Unallocated categories to the newly established Goods category. In-house training and
   the decision to develop the RBF through WAEMU, ECOWAS and CILSS experts rather
   than to hire an international firm have allowed cost savings which could be directed to
   the purchasing of goods. A ‘Workshop’ item is added into the category ‘Consultant
   services, Audits and Training’ given the importance of stakeholder consultations in the
   project.

  6. A reallocation of the IDA Credit proceeds is required to accommodate the additional
     costs which will be incurred by the construction and equipment (including
     greenhouse) of a new biosafety laboratory in Burkina Faso. The PAD calls for a
     rehabilitation of an existing laboratory, based on which the proceeds allocation were
     determined. However, during implementation it became clear that a new laboratory
     had to be established because the site envisaged initially turned out to be
     inappropriate, hence the need to increase the amount of the Works category to cover
     the extra cost of the construction versus rehabilitation. Therefore, proceeds will be
     reallocated from the Consultant Services, Training, and Unallocated categories to the
     Works category. The above-mentioned reallocation of GEF Grant proceeds will
     compensate for the reduction in the IDA Goods amount.
