SABAH LAND SETTLEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL MW3AGEMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:             Malaysia
Beneficiaries:        State of Sabah and Federal Land Development Authority
(FELDA)
Loan Amounts          USS 71.5 Million
Terms:                Repayable in 17 years including 5 years grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description: The project would assist the Government in the
implementation of the Sahabat settlement complex and the
Environmental Management Plan for the Dent Peninsula
(EMP), in the eastern part of the State of Sabah. The
project would finance development expenditures over a
period of four years, beginning January 1, 1989. In
Sahabat, the project would focus on consolidating
agricultural development and settlement of same 61,000 ha
including: ti) crop development and early maintenance of
oil palm and coffee; (ii) construction of agricultural
and access roads; (iii) development of four settler
villages; (iv) construction of one palm oil mill; and (v)
provision of vehicles and equipment. Expenditures
related to cocoa, discontinued after 1987, would be
excluded from Bank financing. Under the EMP, the project
woulds (i) implement actions to enhance protection and
management of the Tabin and Kulamba Wildlife Reserves in
the Dent Peninsula; (ii) provide physical infrastructure
and equipment for the reserves; (iii) provide two
technical advisors to the Sabah Wildlife Department
(SWD) and consulting services for the preparation of a
Conservation Strategy for Sabah, financed by UNDP; and
(iv) establish an Envirormental Coordination Unit in
FELDA.
Benefits and Risks:  Consolidation of agricultural development and settlement
of the Sahabat area will ensure a return to past
investments and provide viable/secure income and raise
the living standards of about 8,600 rural families
previously living below the poverty level. Some 3,560 of
those families are expected to be settled during the

proposed finance period. The project would also
contribute to agricultural production and exports, and
the overall economic development of the State of Sabah.
Implementation of the EMP would contribute to
strengthening the new SWD, enhancing environmental
protection practices during agricultural development of
the Sahabat area and in future FELDA land settlement
projects, and strengthening protection and management of
wildlife reserves and natural resources in Sabah.
Settler availability is a potential risk, as Sabahans are
perceived to be reluctant to adopt permanant settlement
and farming conditions. However, the FELDA package
offers a proven and sustainable settlement option.
Settler response in other smaller areas in Sabah has thus
far been positive, and time-slice financing would provide
flexibility to adjust annual investment plans in
accordance with settler response. Success of the
environmental component is partly contingent on
implementation of the proposed actions to enhance
protection and management of the wildlife reserves, but
the State Government is fully committed to the project
strategy and no major problems are expected in this
regard.

SABAH LAND SETTLEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
Agriculture in the Malaysian Econom2
1.1      Malaysia's agricultural sector continues to play a key role in the
economy, although its relative importance is naturally declining as the
country proceeds towards industrialization. In 1987, the sector's share of
GDP was 21Z, down from 24Z in 1980. The share of sectoral employment fell
from about 402 of the total in 1910 to 352 in 1987. Nonetheless, Malaysia's
agricultural growth rate has been high by any standsrds. During the 1960s and
much of the 1)70s, real output grew at 72 per annum. This rate slowed in the
early 198)s to 2.82 per annum (1981- 1985), largely as a result of
decelerating expansion of the land frontier, which in turn is traceable to
reduced public expenditure programs brought or by falling world commodity
prices and their negative impact on Government revenuo. The rate of
agricultural growt.. picked up again in 1986 (4Z) and in 1987 (7.52), mainly
due to the upturn in world commodity price,.s Malaysia is the world's largest
producer a-d exporter of rubber and palm oil.  In 1987, it accounted for about
34Z of the world's natural rubber output and 432 of exports, and 582 of the
world's palm oil production and 692 of exports; these two commodities,
respectively, accounted for 92 and 8Z of the country's total merchandise
exports in that year. Malaysia is also a major exporter of logs and timber
which accounted for about 132 of merchandise exports in 1987.
1.2      Sector Composition.   About one-third of Peninsular (West) Malaysia
an' 82 of East Malaysia are under cultivation; most of the remaining area is
ux..er tropical forest or secondary regrowth. The total cultivated area is
estimated to be about 5 million hectares. Malaysia's climate and soil
conditions provide a strorn  comparative advantage for tree crop development.
Tree crops are planted on about 4 million ha (rubber 1.9 million, oil palm 1.6
million, cocoa and coconut 0.3 million each), padi on 0.6 million ha and the
balance in minor crops. Rubber has long been the largest crop area, but it is
being overtaken by oil palm because of relatively higher profitability.
Rubber's share of cropped area has declined from 662 in 1960 to about 382 by
1986. In contrast, oil palm acreage in the same pariod has grown from 22 to
322 and palm oil has equalled and, in some years, surpassed rubber as
Malaysia's largest agricultural export. Interest in coconuts has declined, but
cocoa area has expanded at 232 a:iually for almost two decades, rising from
2,000 ha in 1960 to 307,200 'I. by 1986.  Food production has generally
stagnated over the same period. as farm incomes have not been competitive with
those from tree crops or off-farm work. Padi production in particular has
fallen steadily.



-2-
1.3      The Government's 1984 Household Income Survey estimated that 864,000
households, 32Z of the national total of 2.6 million, were primarily employed
in farming. Some 155,000 were rubber smallholders, 116,000 padi growers,
100,000 oil palm growers, 81,000 estate workers, and the rest divided among
mixed farming and fishing. To these must be added large numbers of immigrant
laborers in padi and tree crops. Whereas padi growers are almost entirely
smallholders with less than 3 ha each, the organization of tree crops is
characterized by a large private estate sector and government- sponsored
quasi-estates for smallholders.
1.4      Tree Crops Performance.  Malaysian tree crop yields are )igher than
those of its competitors, twice as much for oil palm and around 502 for
rubber.  This is due to strong natural production advantages and good
institutional performance of research, extension and marketing based on
individual commodity specialization. Malaysia's high yields and wide use of
advanced technology, notwithstanding relatively high labor costs, result in
significantly lower marginal production costs compared to those of most of its
competitors. Given its international competitiveness, Malaysia is expected to
retain its strong position in tree crop exports. Future actions, however, must
focus on cost-reduction and closing the productivity gap between private
estates and smallholders. Government tree crop development and poverty
alleviation policies concentrate on organizing smallholders in quasi-estate
arrangeme-ts to transfer the institutional advantages and technology needed to
reach the higher yields (see further Chapter II).
Agriculture in Sabah
1.5      Sabah is one of the two East Malaysian States.  It accounts for about
22Z of the total area of the country, but the population is only 1.3 million,
or 8? of the country's total. Forestry, agriculture and fisheries contribute
about 40S of the State's GDP and 502 of exports, with forestry being the
largest contribitor. About 3.3 million ha, or 442 of the State's 7.4 million
ha, are under forest reserves. About 2.15 million ha or 30X is suitable for
agriculture, but less than one-third (600,000 ha) wPs under cultivation in
1986.
1.6      As in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah's climate and soil conditions
provide a strong comparative advantage for tree crops, in particular oil palm
and cocoa. In 1986, about 79Z of the cultivated area was in oil palm (210,000
ha), cocoa (180,000 ha) and rubber (86,000 ha). Other crops include coconut,
upland padi, fruita, coffee and tea. The cultivated area doubled from 300,000
ha to 600,000 ha between 1970 and 1986, with a significant change in cropping
pattern. During this period, rubber declined in both absolute terms (from
about 117,000 ha to 86,000 ha) and relative terms (from 372 of the total
cultivated area to 142), while oil palm increased seven-fold au.d cocoa fifty-
fold, and these two crops now account for about 352 and 302, respectively, of
the total cultivated area. Sabah presently accou.nts for about 55-602 of
Malaysia's cocoa production, 8-92 of palm oil production and 2? of rubber
production.

1.7      The expansion of perennial crnps in Sabah has 'seen significantly due
to Government policies and programs which, on the one nand, focus on
modernization of traditional agriculture and, on the other, on the development
of new land for commercial production. While the private sectrr has played
the leading role in this expansion, the public sector, represented principally
by the Sabah Land Development Board (SLDB) and FELDA, has made an equally
significant contribution.
1.8      About 752 of Sabah's population lives in rural areas, and they are
mostly indigenous peoples. Traditionally, they have been shifting
cultivators, hunters and fishermen. Many are still engaged in shifting
cultivation centered on production of hill paddy. While others now practice
permanent farming and have incorporated cash crops to some extent into their
farming systems, their attitudes are still significantly conditioned by their
traditional attacbment to shifting cultivation and subsistence farming. The
rural population is largely concentrated on the West Coast where demographic
pressure on scarce land resources is considerable. In 1984, it was
officially estimated that about 332 of the whole Sabah population was below
the poverty level. There is a continuous influx of labor from neighboring
Indonesia and Philippines, most of which is employed in tree crop plantations
on the East Coast.
Agriculturel Development Issues
1.9      Diversification.  Malaysia's agriculture, and to a significant extent
the whole economy, is sensitive to what bappens in the rubber and palm oil
industries. Hence the need to diversify has prececupied policymakers for some
time and quite substantial resources have been invested in diversification
programs.11 Diversification within the tree crop group has been very
successful (from rubber to oil palm, cocoa and coffee), but diversification
into annual food crops has had only mixed results. Despite the relatively
high subsidy for food production, the long-run average returns to growers are
still in favor of unprotected tree crops. Padi, which has been the focus of
the Goverrment's food security program, enjoys free fertilizer, subsidized
credit, guaranteed purchase prices and other transfers, but production
continues t. fall. The Government is now reviewing the problems and the need
for adjustmet.s in the padi and rice industry. Diversification possibilities
for Malaysia, given its climate and soils, seem limited but would include some
fruits, especJLlly bananas, and ve.-tables.  However, progress over the medium
term in thes" crops will be quite slow, as major efforts are needed to develop
suitable production and post-harvest technologies, particularly for fruits.
1.10     Rural Poverty.  Absolute poverty defined as not having a,'cess to
basic subsistence requirements is not considezed significant in Malaysia,
although relative poverty defined as not having access to the country's
1/ Report No. 6226-MA, September 17, 1986, Malaysia - An Assessment of
Agricultural Diversification Prospects.



-4-
average level of consumption goods and services remains high at about 242 in
rural areas, compared with only about 82 in urban areas (Household Income
Survey, 1984). Rural poverty is most prevalent among padi, coconut and rubber
smallholders, fishermen and shifting cultivators, and it is more intense in
Sabah with an estimated 332 incidence. The estimated 1988 poverty level in
Sabah is M$460/month per family, compared with M$380 in Peninsular Malaysia.
The incidence of rural poverty has declined significantly in Peninsular
Malaysia ( by more than half) and 'An Sabah (by 43Z) from its level in 1970,
under the impact of expanding government-sponsored schemes to resettle poor
farmers and to group smallholders into more efficient and remunerative
production units, and of accelerating industrialization which has increased
farm family incomes through access to off-farm work. Government strategy
continues to focus on improving productivity and incomes of the unorganized
smallholders and the poorer section of the rural population through
resettlement and land rehabilitation and consolidation programs, based
primarily on production of tree crops, which offer the highest returns to
labor.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.11     To date, the Bank has made 25 agricultural loans, amounting to US$847
million, or nearly 45Z of total lending to Malaysia. Of these, the
most successful have been the loans made to FELDA to assist implementation of
its land settlement schemes, based on tree crop development (para. 2.16).
Results from two FELCRA projects have also been quite good, and a third one is
now underway. There have also beca notable achievements under large scale
irrigation projects (e.g., the Muda Irrigation Projects financed under Loans
434-MA and 1717-MA, which have led to a doubling of cropping intensity,
increased yields and strong institutional development). However, success has
been mixed among area development projects, which focussed on existing small
farms producing foodcrops, particularly rice. Problems have included
smallness of farm size and shortage of irrigation water leading to out-
migration of labor. Though some Bank agricultural projects have included
components for Sabah, the only exclusive operation to date is the Sabah
Forestry Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2550-MA), which is progressing
satisfactorily except for the research component which is moving slowly, due
to staffing constraints. Government policy continues to support new land
development, but also emphasizes the need to concentrate on development of
older areas with entrenched rural poverty. The Bank supports this view.
Future Bank financing for agriculture will support completion and
consolidation of land settlement schemes, consolidation of older areas,
forestry and environmental management, crop diversification, insti.utional
improvement and policy changes to foster increased agricultural efficiency.
Also, more emphasis will be given to agricultural development, poverty
alleviation and natural resources conservation and management in Sabah and
Sarawak.



II. LAND DEVELOPMENT AND SETTLEMENT
A. BACKGROUND
2.1      Malaysia has a long and successful history of government-sponsored
land development and settlement of poor rural families. The factors behind
this success include the availability of large tracts of agriculturally
suitable land; the introduction of commercially valuable cash crops (rubber
and oil palm); well-designed and profitable large-scale agricultural
development programs and management models adapted from the Malaysian private
estate sector; and substantial mobilization of government resources. Land
development and settlement schemes have been implemented by several Federal
and SLate agencies, among which FELDA is the leading institution.
B. FEDERAL LAND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (FELDA)
Organization and Management
2.2      FELDA was established in 1956 as a Federal Statutory Body.  It
operates within the Ministry of Land and Regional Development and under policy
guidance and general supervision of a Board consisting of 13 members including
Government, settlers and private sector representatives. Day-to-day adminis-
tration is under the Director General assisted by a Deputy Director General
of Services, two Senior Directors of Development and 18 specialized
departments. At field level, FELDA is organized on the basis of regional
offices each covering an average area of 30,000 ha, and development schemes.
FELDA has established twelve subsidiary corporations and seven joint venture
companies with the private sector, to provide specific development services
and down-stream activities to the settlement programs. Each of these
undertakings is headed by a General Manager and operated on a commercial basis
largely independent from FELDA, with its own staff and resources.   A Group
Managing Director oversees operation of the subsidiary corporations and a
Group Executive Director (Commercial) is responsible for the joint ventures;
both Directors report to FELDA's Group Chairman. The current organization
structure of the FELDA group is shown in Annex 1.1 and a brief description of
FELDA's subsidiary corporations and joint venture companies is given in Annex
1.2.
2.3      FELDA staff total around 8,500, of which about 74Z are in the settle-
ment schemes, 142 in regional offices, 1OZ in the head office and 2Z in
training facilities and schools. About 13,600 staff work in the corporations
and joint venture companies, for a grand total of about 22,100 in the FELDA
group. FELDA management and staff are generally experienced and dedicated.
Most senior managers began in junior positions, many of them in the settlement
schemes. Staff promotions are based on a vigorous in-service training,
supplemented by technical instruction conducted in FELDA's Institute of Land
Development, training centers and schools, and academic and professional
courses in local institutions and abroad.



Development Strategy
2.4      FELDA's land develcopment and settlement strategy consista of an inte-
grated package comprisings land c'earing, crop planting and early mainte-
nance; construction of basic infrastructure and housing; selection and
emplacement of settlers; provision of agricultural services such as credit,
technical assistance, inputs, processing and marketing; and community
organization and social amenities. Agricultural development is based on tree
crops, particularly oil palm and rubber, and to a lesser extent cocoa,
sugarcane and coffee.
2.5      Following the commercial estate concept, for development and
operational purposes, large settlement projects are divided into settlement
schemes, which are self-contained agricultural production units, with their
own supervisory and technical staff and labor. Families are settled in
villages, where they are provided with a house on a 0.1 ha garden lot. Each
village groups settlers from four to six schemes. Settlers are normally
placed in the schemes after the first year of harvest, which is usually four
years after planting in oil palm schemes and six to seven years in rubber
schemes. However, in Sabah, emplacement has taken somewhat longer due to
delays in village development. In schemes that started loan repayments to
FELDA before 1986, settlers are guaranteed a minimum monthly income of M$350;
in schemes that started repayment in 1986, settlers' guaranteed income is
M$2501month.
Settlement Arrangements
2.6      Initially, FELDA settlement projects were exclusively for rubber, and
settlers were given individual 10-ac farms. In January 1971, FELDA
established the block system under which oil palm settlers were allocated an
unidentified 10-ac landholding within a 96 ha block shared by 24 settlers.
The block was jointly farmed by the group which shared profits. Under both
individual and block systems, the settlers would receive agricultural land and
houselot titles upon full repayment of their agricultural development loans.
2.7      In 1984 FELDA introduced the Share System under which setters joining
the schemes after January 1985 were to become shareholders of estate
development corporations (EDC) managed by FELDA. Settler incomes would then
consist of wages, bonuses in proportion to work done and corporate dividends.
This system was introduced to enhance field management and to increase
productivity. By mid-1988 about 15 EDCs had been formally established, and
all new areas, including Sahabat, were to operate under the share system.
2.8      In October 1988 the Government, responding to settler demands,
abolished both the block and share systems of settlement and, instead agreed
to grant to settlers individual land titles upon fuli repayment of development
loans. FELDA will continue to provide technical assistance and other
agricultural services, will assist settlers in the day to day management of
the schemes, and will approve land sales and have the first option to
purchase. Also in future schemes as well as in those previously established



- 7 -
under the share system, FELDA will retain and manage 20Z of the land as a
reserve, with the proceeds going to: (a) finance part of the schemes
administrative costs; and (b) an income stabilization fund to supplement
settler incomes during periods of low commodity prices. Settlers will be
given 10-ac (4-ha) farms in Peninsula Malaysia and 14-ac (5.7 ha) farms in
Sabah. Implementation of the Government decision is underway starting in
older schemes established under the block system, where settlers have
completed or are close to completing loan repayments.  In schemes more
recently established under the share system action is also being taken to
demarcate individual farms.
2.9      The impact of these changes on the overall FELDA program is likely to
be important, but it is still early to fully assess it. On the one hand,
settler interest and commitment to the program, which was already very strong,
will no doubt increase. There will be more active settler participation in
the decision-making process, and a gradual disenagement of FELDA from day-to-
day management of the schemes. On the other hand, field quality standards and
production may be somewhat affected. The overall process and its consequences
will be closely monitored and evaluated during implementation of the proposed
project.
Financing
2.10     FELDA's main sources of finance are GOM grants and loans and income
from its subsidiaries and other investments. Grants cover basic infrastruc-
ture investments and administrative costs. Loans are used to finance agri-
cultural development, settler housing and processing facilities. GOM loans to
FELDA for agricultural development and settler housing are at 42 p.a. interest
for 25 years, including a 10-yee.r interest-free grace period. FELDA on-lends
to settlers at 42 p.a. interest for 20 to 25 years, including 5 to 10 years'
grace (depending on crop), during which interest is capitalized. GOM loans tc
FELDA and corresponding subloans to FELDA subsidiaries for processing
facilities are at 8.02 p.a.interest, for 15 years including 3 years of grace
during vhich interest is capitalized. With the exception of the on-going Palm
Oil Mills Project (Loan 2530-MA), which was made directly to FELDA, Bank loans
have been made to GOM and channeled to FELDA under the conditions stated
above. These loans have been used for basic infrastructure, agricultural
development, settler housing, roads, water supply works and processing
facilities.
2.11     FELDA's financial position is healthy, the result of sound
management.  It has accrued surpluses from differential terms of borrowing and
relending of Government funds, returns from investments in its subsidiaries
and other ventures, arLd management fees. FELDA's financial strength has helped
it to reduce its depersdence on Government funds and has permitted it to make
contingency loans to supplement settlers' income in times of low commodity
prices. In 1986 5nd 1987, for example, the Government provided onlf 502 and
332, respectivciy, of agricultural investments (about M$ 300 million per
year), and FELDA covered the balance from its reserves.  Likewise, in 1986
when palm oil prices fell drastically, FELDA made contingency loans to
settlers amounting to M$ 65.0 million. FELDA has also begun to reduce its
dependence on Government for its commercial operations. The FELDA Palm Oil
Mills Project (Loan 2530-MA), under which FELDA borrowed directly from the
Bank and bears the full cost of borrowing, was a step in this direction.



2.12     Settler loan repayment record is excellent, and bad debts are practi-
cally nil. Since FELDA carries out all processing and marketing operations
through its subsidiary corporations, loan repayment installments are automati-
cally deducted from payments for settlers' produce. Only in 1986, when oil
palm revenues fell below minimum guaranteed income levels, did FELDA
reschedule loan repayments on an exceptional basis.
Past Achievements
2.13     As shown in Table 2.1 below, as of December 31, 1988, FELDA had
settled 111,728 families in 441 settlement schemes comprising about 752,000
ha, with a total area in production of about 540,000 ha. Until 1978, FELDA'S
program was limited to Peninsular (West) Malaysia. However, with increasing
scarcity of suitable land in the peninsula, FELDA began operations in Sabah in
1979 and in Sarawak in 1987. Under the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90), FELDA
intended to develop 175,000 ha and emplace 30,000 settler families, with a
total investment of M$ 2.7 billion (US$ 1.06 billion), about one-third of
which would be in Sabah. However, during the first three years of the Plan,
budget allocations and government outlays were lower than projected and
implementation has fallen behind target.

2.14     FELDA's long-term Sabah program consists of three projects with a
gross target area of 119,600 ha: Umas (9,700 ha), Kalabakan (6,900 ha) and
Sahabat (103,000 ha). Land development and planting of the first two
complexes is substantially completed, and some 324 families have thus far been
settled in Umas.   Agricultural development and infrastructure works in the
larger Sahabat program are still in progress, and settler emplacement is
starting.

Settler Incomes
2.15     FELDA settlers are recruited from smallholder and landless rural
families living below the relative poverty line, which in 1988 was estimated
at M$380/month per family in Peninsular Malaysia and M$460/month per family in
Sabah. Actual average monthly incomes in FELDA settlement schemes, even for
rubber, which through 1985 yi4lded incomes much lower than oil palm, have been
consistently above the poverty threshold (Table 2.2). The only exception was
in 1986, when incomes of oil palm settlers fell close to the pover', line due
to the drastic decline in world palm oil prices. Incomes rebounded in 1987.
with rubber still yielding marginally higher returns than oil palm. Lower
profitability and farm incomes from rubber schemes in the early 1980's led
FELDA to limit new rubber plantings to areas with soils and climatic
conditions not suitable for oil palm.

C. Performance of Bank-Financed FELDA Projects
2.16     The Bank has made eight loans to support FELDA operations, six of
which have been successfully completed in the States of Pahang, Johor and
Negeri Sembilan (Annex 1.3). Implementation of the other two, FELDA Palm Oil
Hills (Loan 2530-MA) and Land Settlement Infrastructure (Loan 2642-MA), is
also proceeding satisfactorily.  Through involvement in these projects, the
Bank has been able to assist FELDA in its settlement program and institution-
building through development of long-term integrated planning and



- 10 -
implementation strategies; improvements in accounting, management and
procurement procedures; strengthening of staff and operations of palm oil
mills; containment of seLclement costs per family; introduction of improved
planting materials; and development of wildlife conservation and pest control
measures. Four OED PPARs and &n IER 2/ concluded that all these projects were
successful in meeting their objectives. Achievements in land development,
crop yields, settler emplacement, income and economic returns were
satisfactory. although there were delays in settler emplacement due to slower
than expected construction of inf' 3tructure.
2.17     FELDA has been generally responsive to environmental concerns.
Learning from experience, it has corrected planning and implementation short-
comings that affected initial projects. Land with slopes above 200 have been
generally excluded from cultivation; cleared land is promptly planted to tree
crops and fast-growing cover crops to prevent erosion; effluents from crop
processing facilities are treated to reduce pollution in accordance with
government environmental quality standards. Provision of health services and
potable water to settlers prevents the occurrence of endemic diseases.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.1      The project area comprises the Sahabat Land Development and Settle-
ment Complex and the Tabin (TWR) an;t Kulamba (KWR) Wildlife Reserves, located
at the eastern end of the Dent Peninsula in the State of Sabah.   A 65-km
gravel road from Lahad Datu to Tungku provides access to the Sahabat area.
Improvement and asphalt pavement of the first 30 km of this road between Lahad
Datu and Bakapit is in progress, being financed under the, Sabah-Sarawak Rural
Roads Project (Loan 2291-MA). The second 35-km section, between Bakapit and
Tungku, is in poor condition and, if not upgraded, would constitute a serious
bottleneck for inputs and produce transport in and out of Sahabat. Access to
the TWR is through logging tracks and plantation roads from the Lahad Datu-
Tungku road and Silabukan; access to KWR is through logging tracks and
plantation roads from TWR and by boat from the Sulu Sea (eee IBRD Map 20966).
A. The Sahabat Settlement Complex
3.2      The Sahabat Settlement Complex is located on the eastern tip of the
Dent Peninsula and comprises a gross area of 103,000 ha which the Sabah State
Government gazetted for land development by FELDA. The complex is bounded by
the Kuala Segama and Kuala Maruap forest reserve to the North, the Sulu Sea to
the east, the Celebes Sea to the south and the Tabin Wildlife Reserve to the
west. The Sahabat, TWR and KWR areas have similar characteristics and, with
the exception of the core area in Tabin, they have been logged twice.
Topography and Soils
3.3      The topography of the Dent Peninsula is uneulating.  About 85? of the
area is less than 60 m above sea level, with slopes of less than 20Z. The

southwestern corner is hillier and reaches the highest elevation of about 160
meters.  The entire area can be divided into four physiographic regionst the
southern Dent hills, the central peneplain, the wide northern coastal flood
plain and the narrow eastern coastal terraces.
3.4      AIout 75Z of the Sahabat area consists of sedimentary soils developed
over mudstones, shales and sandstones, on sloping land, with fairly deep
prof±l#s and sandy clay loam to clay textures. The rest of the area consists
of alluvial soils formed along low relief, low-lying valleys, alluvial plains
ana terraces; the alluvial plains are often wide, include patches of swamps,
and are subject to periodic flooding. Fringing the coastal areas in all but
the northern portion are narrow stretches of beach sands. Except for steep
sloping terrain which is subject to severe erosion, and swampy mangrove areas,
most soils in the project area are suitable for tree crops including oil palm,
cocoa and coffee. Marine sands fringing the coastal area are suitable for
coconut.
Climate
3.5      The Dent Peninsula has a tropical maritime climate tempered by two
monsoonal seasons occurring between November and January (NE Monsoon), and
between May and July (SW Monsoon). The average mean annual rainfall is 2,600
mm, ranging from 2,000mm in the south to over 3,000 mm towards the northern
coast. Rainfall is well distributed with a minimal 10Z-15Z variation between
wet and dry seasons. Temperatures are generally uniform throughout the year;
mean monthly values vary from 300C inland to 250C in the coastal areas. Rela-
tive humidity is also uniform throughout the year, with mean monthly values
from 802-852.  Annual evaporation is estimated between 1400 mm and 1700 mm.
Hydrology
3.6      The Sabahat River is practically the only surface water source in the
project area. It has a catcbment area of about 67 km2 and flows through the
southwest corner of the area towards the Celebes Sea. Other small streams such
as the Labian and Lung Pulau have very small catchments and low flows.  Ground
water aquifers have been identified as alternative sources for domestic and
industrial supply.
Population
3.7      There are no records of indigenous populations in the Dent Peninsula.
The population of Sahabat consists of scattered groups of fishermen and
coconut farmers living in small coastal villages and immigrants working on
plantations. Tungku (population 2,000) and Tambisan (population unknown) are
the only villages of appreciable size close to the area. Lahad Datu (district
population estima#-ed at 65,000 in 1987), located 72 km to the west of the
area, is the urban and economic center nearest to Sahabat, and is an important
entry point for immigrant labor into Sabah.
Long-term Development Program for the Sahabat Settlement Complex
3.8      FELDA's long-term program for Sahabat (gross area of 103,000 ha)
includes development and planting of about 90,000 ha and settlement of about



- 12 -
12,700 families. Agricultural development will be based mostly on oil palm
(901) , with smaller proportions of cocoa (7Z), intercropping (21) and coffee
(1X). Early plans called for a 202 proportion of cocoa area, but due to
disease problems and gloomy international price prospects, new cocoa
development was discontinued after 1987. However, in those areas where the
planting of shade trees and nurseries had started before this decision was
made, planting will be completed with cocoa; (shade trees are planted and
nurseries established after land clearing and one year in advance of field
planting). The Sahabat Complex is divided into 54 schemes, which in turn will
be grouped into 13 villages (A through M), with an average production area of
7,000 ha per village.
3.9      Some 126 km of roads, consisting of a main road (21 km), a ring road
(80 km) and a diagonal road (25 km), would provide access to villages and
production areas. Village infrastructure would include about 320 km of roads,
domestic and industrial water supply treatment and distribution works,
administrative buildings, staff housing, settler houses, primary and secon-
dary schools, health centers, places of worship, police posts, community
centers and commercial areas.
3.10     The Sahabat long-term development program also includes construction
of eight palm oil mills, two cocoa fenmentaries, and the establishment of an
'Industrial Complex, ir. the southwest corner of the area, adjacent to village
D. This complex would include FELDA's regional office, staff quarters, a
rest-house, a training school, warehouses, workshops, laboratories, palm oil
bulking installations and a jetty. An oil palm refinery and other downstream
processing facilities would be established at a later stage when production
volumes justify them.
ProRress to Date
3.11     By end-1988, some 61,000 ha had been cleared in schemes 1 to 35.  Of
this area, some 39,300 ha had been planted, consisting 901 oil palm (including
about 3X intercropped with cocoa), 91 cocoa and 1X coffee. Also 3,100 ha
started under cocoa before the decision to discontinue this crop was made
(para. 3.8) are partially planted and would be completed in early 1989.
Planting of the remaining 18,600 ha of cleared area is scheduled for
completion during 1989 and 1990 with oil palm (18,300 ha) and coffee (300 ha)
(Table 4.1). Due to initial fielC management shortcomings, nearly 601 of the
areas planted during the first two years of development were destroyed by wild
animals (particularly wildboars and elephants) and had to be replanted,
leading to production delays. Field management problems have been
substantially overcome, and crop production has already started on about
13,700 ha, but harvesting and fruit transport from the field to processing
facilities is seriously hampered by an almost total lack of agricultural roads
and an incomplete access road network. Some 41 km of access roads have been
substantially completed, and an additional 8 km are under construction.
Shortage of laterite has been a constraint and the major reason for high road
construction c-eX-s and delays. Domestic water supply works for five villages
(A to E) and the industrial Complex are in progress. Installation of eight
tubewells and mains to village D and the Industrial Complex are near
completion. A pumping house on the Sabahat river, a bounded reservoir, a



- 13
treatment plant and additional pumping and storage facilities are delayed and
expected to be completed during the first half of 1989. A palm oil mill
(financed under Loan 2530-MA) and two cocoa fermentaries are in operation:
construction of a second Bank-financed palm oil mill is in progress at Sahabat
11. Construction of civil works, staff quarters, rest house, warehouses and
the jettv is near completion at the Industrial Complex. Developments of
villages A and D an settler recruitment is in progress, and a first group of
112 families were emplaced in 1938. Total expenditures through 1988 amounted
to M$ 313.5 million (USS 125.4 million) (Annex 8.1).
3.12     At this stage, priority must be given to consolidating the
development of cleared and planted areas (schemes 1 to 35) by constructing
urgently needed agricultural and access roads, establishing settlement
villages and other infrastructure, and accelerating settler emplacement. The
rehabilitation of the Bakapit-Tungku road is also urgently required to provide
an adequate land communication link between Sahabat and Lahad Datu, the urban
and commercial center for the area.
B. The Tabin and Kulamba Wildlife Reserves
3.13     The Tabin Wildlife Reserve (TWR) (120,500 ha) is the largest forest
area in Sabah (and in Borneo) established specifically for the protection of
wild breeding populations of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), the Asian
two-horned rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and the wild cattle (Bos
javanicus), known locally as banteng or tembadau.  Gazetted in March 1984
under forest legislation, TWR had previously been commercial forest reserve
selectively logged for large dipterocarp trees for export. After gazettement,
commercial logging has continued in all parts of the Reserve except in a *Core
Areag of 8,616 hectares, which has no special legal status but is retained as
a sanctuary for rhinos and other mammals displaced by logging in surrounding
areas, as well as a source of plants and animals to regenerate neighboring
forest after logging. With the development of the adjacent Sahabat area, the
importance of TWR has increased, since it will also have to provide sanctuary
to wildlike displaced by land clearing and agricultural development within the
Sahabac scheme. Also located in the Dent Peninsula north of Tabin are the
Kulamba Wildlife Reserve (KWR) (20,682 ha), the Kuala Segama and Kuala Maruap
Forest Reserve (24,000 ha), and the nipa swamp state land currently set aside
for fisheries. Along with Tabin, they provide sanctuary for wildlife and,
therefore, should be protected and adequately managed. Tabin and Kulamba are
the only wildlife reserves in the State of Sabah.
3.14     Until recently, wildlife conservation and management was the
responsibility of the Sabah Forestry Department, through its Wildlife Section.
In 1987, this Section was transferred to operate as a Department under the
State Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Development (MTED). The new
Department is still weak and needs considerable strengthening to be able to
develop and implement the required management and conservation policies and
programs.
3.15     The transfer of the Wildlife Section has led to ambiguity in
responsibility for management of the wildlife reserves. Since the reserves
were gazetted under forest legislation, responsibility for management of the



- 14 -
fauna and flora within them rests with the Forestry Department. Under State
legislation, there are no conditions attached to the status of the Tabin
Wildlife Reserve--logging may, therefore, continue without referesnce to the
new Sabah Wildlife Department (S'WD). A recent amendment to the Fauna
Conservation Ordinance (Sabah's wildlife conservation/management legislation)
has placed responsibility relating to wild animals (except fish) with the
Wildlife Department. However, aa the distribution and abundance of wild
animals depends primarily on habitat, the Forestry Department effectively
retains control over all wildlife in the reserves. Furthermore, existing
forest legislation is such that any kind of management activity prescribed by
SWD for animals requires the support of the Forestry Department; for example,
S'WD personnel wishing to conduct surveys in wildlife reserves or hunters
wishing to hunt there, must still seek permission from the Forestry
Department. Thus, additional amendments to existing provisions are necessary
to ensure that wildlife habitat is protected and the SWD is empowered to
enforce its protection. The Government of Sabah (GOS) has indicated its
commitment to pursue these amendments and to strengthen the newly-established
SWD. The proposed project would support this endeavor.
C.  Environmental Imsact Assessment
3.16     As part of project preparation, FELDA, in cnoperation with the
Federal Economic Planning Unit (EPU) and the Federal Department of the
Environment (DOE), commissioned a project Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) under terms of reference agreed with the Bank. The EIA was carried out
by a local consulting firm using a team of local environmental scientists and
university professors, and the final report was issued in February 1988. It
identified a number of environmental concerns, including physical, biological
and social constraints likely to affect project development, and proposed
aileviating measures. While the assessment highlighted the importance of
integrated management of Sahabat and the neighboring wildlife, forest and
swamp areas in the Dent Peninsula, it did not provide a clear framework in
which to address this objective. Therefore, in March 1988, the Federal and
State Governments agreed to the preparation of an Environmental Management
Plan for the Dent Peninsula (EMP). This was undertaken by two consultants
from the World Wide Fund for Nature, Malaysia (WWFM), and completed in May
1988. The EMP recommendations were substantially accepted by GOM and GOS, and
would be implemented under the proposed project. The following are the main
findings and actions proposed under the EIA and subsequent EMP:
(a) FELDA's land clearing and development pattern from the coast inland
in a northwesterly direction ensures the movement of animals such as
elephants, rhinos and banteng to the adjacent wildlife reserves, and
it should be maintained. Unless reserved for specific purposes, no
isolat_d areas should remain uncleared to avoid the entrapment of
wild animals, and FELDA and SWD should take action to ensure the
transfer of isolated or entrapped animals.
(b) FELDA's cover crop and conservation practices ensure that erosion and
sediment transport, as a result of land clearing and planting, are
held within acceptable levels. Clearing of steep areas (above 180



15 -
gradient) and of swamp end mangrove areas should be avoided. The
long-term effect of deforestation on surface and ground water
resources may be significant and requires continuous monitoring. The
Sabahat river catchment should be declared a reserved area and, to
the extent possible, should be reforested.
(c) Although the adverse impact of pesticides on wildlife and water
quality are difficult to predict, the amounts used are expected to be
within tolerable levels.  The least noxious and persistent toxic
chemicals should be used, and the choice of pesticides should depend
on local conditions within FELDA's guidel4nes. 31 To the extent
possible, natural predators should be considered as pesticide
substitutes.
(d)  State legislation thould be amended as necessary to ensure that
Tabin and Kulamba Reserves are conserved and adequately managed. The
Reserves should be provided with the staffing, technical assistance,
physical infrastructure and other resources necessary for their
sustainability.  The nipa swamp, adjacent to TWR and which is
currently set aside for fisheries use, should be mainta!.ned under
natural cover to 1huffer both TWR and the Kuala Segama And Kuala
Maruap Forest Reserve, as well as to lirk the two reserves.  It
should be managed for capture fisheries, as well as being an animal
and Dird santtuary under the Fauna Conservation Ordinance.
(e)  The Sahabat settle,.ent complex, the Tabin and Kulamba Wiidlife
Reserves and the coastal wetlands constitute inter-dependent natural
systems, the monitoring of which should be the collective
responsibility of the Sabah State Government (GOS), FELDA and other
concerned Federal agencies.   In this regard: (i) PELDA's
envirormental expertise should be increased through additional
staffiag; (ii) SWD should be strengthened with additional technical
staff, physical resour-es and technical assistance for conservation
and management of the wildlife reserves; and (iii) policies,
programs, research work and studies aimed at effective planning and
management of natural resources in Sabah should be developed and
implemented.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Formulation and Status of Preparation
4.1      Bank staff first reviewed the Sahabat settlement complex development
program in 1985 during preparation of the Palm Oil Mills Project (Loan 2530-
MA), which included two mills in Sahabat.  At that time it was determined that
the Federal and State Governments were committed to implementing this project.
It was also felt that since the project involved land clearance of some
3/ Malaysian law Lans the use of harmful chemicals and pesticides, and
none of those currently used by FELDA is included in the Bank's
Checklist of Pesticides not Recommended for Use in Agriculture or
Suitable only for Restricted Use (OPN 11.01).



- 16 -
100,000 ha of secondary rain forest and wildlife would be lost or displaced,
Bank involvement could be instrumental in bringing about wildlife and other
natural resource protection measures. Thus, after initial discussions with
FELDA and the central agencies, a preparation mission visited Malaysia in July
1986 and agreed with FELDA on the scope and timetable for a Preparation Report
(PR) and terms of reference for the EIA. rELDA issued the PR in June 1987 and
the EIA was completed in February 1988.  A follow-up Environmental Management
Plan for the Dent Peninsula (EMP) was completed in May 1988 (para. 3.16).
Sahabat's progress and future implementation targets were updated in February
1989. Project processing took somewhat longer than anticipated to allow for
more detailed preparation of the environmental management component.
B. Proiect Obiectives and Brief Description
4.2      The project aims to assist the Government in the implementation of
the Sahabat settlement program, thereby contributing to rural poverty
alleviation and economic development of the State of Sabah, and at the same
time to implement an Environmental Management Plan for the Dent Peninsula,
with emphasis on strengthening management and protection of the Tabin and
Kulamba wildlife reserves, and on institution-building. The FELDA settlement
package offers a proven sustainable option to improve the living standards of
the Sabahan rural poor, and their rnsponse in other smaller projects in Sabah
has thus far been positive. The project would focus on consolidating
agricultural development and settlement of some 61,000 ha comprising the
southern and eastern parts of the area, by providing the infrastructure and
agricultural inputs and services necessary to bring about agricultural
production benefits and settler emplacement. In the long term, consolidating
agricultural development of this area would provide economic farming units and
permanent employment, and thereby would conside&ably raise incomes and living
standards of about 8,600 families. It would also increase agricultural
production aud exports, and contribute to the creation of employment in
project-related services end processing industries.
Project Description
4.3      The proposed project would consist of a four year time-slice
financing (from January 1989 through December 1992) of the Sahabat program
(para 3.3 - 3.10) and the Dent Peninsula Environmental Management Plan and
would include support to the following componei. s currently in progress, or to
be initiated during the project period:
A. Sahabat Settlement Complex
(a) Crop development and early maintenance of oil palm and coffee and
construction of about 500 km of agricultural roads;
(b) Rehabilitation of 35 km of the project area main access road,
bituminous treatment of 36 km and construction of 44 km of internal
access roads;
(c) Development of four settlement villages (A to D), including
construction of village roads, water mains and reticulation works,
settler houses, offices and staff houses;



- 17 -
(d) Construction of one palm oil mill; and
(e)  Prevision of vehicles and equipment, salaries and other operating
expenditures for field management and operation of the schemes.
B.  Dent Peninsula Environmental Management Plan
(a) Implementation of actions to enhance conservation and management of
the Tabin and Kulamba Wildlife Reserves, including provision of staff
and other resources to the Sabah Wildlife Department,
(b)  Provision of infrastructure facilities and equipment for the wildlife
reserves;
(c)  Provision of technical assistance, including: (i) two technical
advisors for the SWD; and (il4 consulting services to Assist GOS in
the preparation of a Conservation Strategy for the State of Sabah;
and
(d)  Establishment of an Environmental Coordination Unit in FELDA to
ensure enhancement of environmental protection practices during
agricultural development of the Sahabat area and in future FELDA land
settlement projects.
C. Proiect Features
Agricultural Development
4.4      Crop Development and Maintenance.  The total agricultural area in
schemes 1 to 35 is 61,000 ha, all of which have been cleared, and of them
39,300 ha had been planted by end-1988 (para. 3.11). Excluding the areas
developed v4th cocoa, thk project would support: (i) completion of planting
of 18,300 ha of oil palm and 300 ha of coffee in 1989 and 1990; and (ii)
early maintenance of 51,155 ha, including 32,555 ha of oil palm and coffee
planted from 1984 through 1988 and 18,600 ha to be planted 1989 and 1990
(details in Table 4.1 below and Annex 2.1). Under FELDA practice, which has
been used for project costing, the early maintenance period for oil palm
and ccffee extends up to the sixth year after planting, when the schemes
are expected to reach breakeven. E-oval area under early maintenance vould,
therefore, change yearly as old areas reaching the six-year maturity Are
excluded (Table 4.1). While crop development and maintenance on 51,1j5 ha
under the project excludes cocoa in conformity with the prevailing Bank
policy, agricultural roads and other infrastructure supported under the
project would cover the totality of the Sahabat schemes 1 to 35 area. At
full development the total area of 61,000 ha, would be planted as follows:
52,450 ha (86Z) with oil palm, 6,600 ha (11Z) with cocoa, 1,150 ha (2X)
with oil pal.m intercropped with cocoa, and 800 ha (12) with coffee (Annex
2.1).

4.5      Oil palm and coffee development and early maintenance items to be
financed under the project include planting, planting material, sanitation,
manuring, pest and disease control, fertilizer, chemicals and miscellaneous
services and charges. Details of agricultural development costs are given in
Annex 2.2.
4.6      Agricultural Roads.  Construction of unsurfaced road tracks (jeep
tracks) is included in the land-clearing and planting contracts. Track
realignment, surfacing and construction of culverts and drainage works is
usually carried out shortly before first crop harvesting. However, in
Sahabat, laterite quarries are not available and gravel has to be hauled from
as far away as Lahad Datu. Thus, to reduce costs, only 30? of the road tracks
were initially surfaced %hich, due to soil conditions, turned out to be
inadequate, and has led to transportation difficulties and substantial crop
losses. The project includes realignment, regrading and 1002 gravelling of
existing road tracks and construction of bridges and culverts in schemes 1 to
35.  Average agricultural road density would be 90 m/ha.  Gravel pavement
4/  New cocoa development was discontinued by FELDA after 1987.  This
represents completion of field planting activities already initiated in
areas where shade trees and nurseries had already been initiated (para.
3.8). Cocoa planting and maintenance expenditures would be excluded
from Bank financing.

would be 3.6 m wide and 12.5 cm thick, for an average of 450 m3  (620 yd3)
compacted material per km. The road-sub base and gravel surface would be
rolled over 3 to 4 times by passing a 6-ton roller. Bridges would be built of
timber and culverts of cement pipe. Constructirc in each scheme would be
staggered over two years. Thirty-cm wide side L.'tches would be cut alongside
the roads as required. Construction cost is estimated at MS 41,100/km, or
M$ 3,700/ha.
Access Roads
4.7      The project would support completion of the Sahabat area main access
road, and schemes 1 to 35 internal access road network, including: (a)
rehabilitation of the Bakapit-Tungku 35 km main access road, and construction
of a weighbridge; (b) asphalt pavement of 36 km of the Tungku-Village D road;
and (c) ongoing works (8 km) and additional construction (26 km) of the
eastern ring to village I and 10 km of the diagonal road (to scheme 13) (IBRD
Maps 20966 and 20967R).
4.8      All roads would be designed and constructed to the Public Works
Department's (PWD) rural roads standards (Annex 3.1), which are currently used
in the ongoing Sabah-Sarawak Rural Roads and Land Settlement Infrastructure
Projects (Loans 2291 and 2642-MA), and are satisfactory. The Bakapit-Tungku
road would be upgraded to R4 standard (6.50 m pavement width and DBST, 5/ for
500-1000 ADT 6/ ). The main internal access road was designed and
constructed to R3 standard (6.0 m pavement for 200-500 ADT) and upgrading
would consist of increasing base thickness by adding a 17.5-cm layer of
crushed gravel and DBST. The ring road would be constructed and gravel
surfaced to R2 standard (5.5 m gravel pavement for 100-250 ADT) and the
diagonal road to R1 standard (5 m gravel pavement for less than 100 ADT).
Estimated construction costs per km are: MS 500,000 for upgrading the Bakapit-
Tungku road; MS 131,200 for upgrading of main road; M$ 550,000 for R2 and
M$ 350,000 for RI new road constructions; plus 1OZ for engineering and
supervision. Detailed costs of the road program are given in Annex 3.2.
Village Infrastructure
4.9      The proposed project would include infrastructure development of four
villages (A through D). Each village would group on average four settlement
schemes. Basic village infrastructure included in the project would be roads,
water mains and household connections, settler houses and office buildings.
Details of village infrastructure targets and costs are given in Annex 4.1
4.10     Village roads would be constructed to PWD Rl design standards (para.
4.8). Based on 0.1 ha houselots and allowing for staff housing and public
areas, each village would require about 24 km of roads, for a grand total of
96 km for the four villages in the project. The average cost per km is
estimated at MS 350,000 plus 102 for engineering and supervision.
5/ DBST: Double Bituminous Surface Treatment.
6/ ADT: Average Daily Traffic



- 20 -
4.11     Settler houses would be built of timber to FELDA standard layout,
which consists of a common area, 2 bedrooms, kitchen, potable water connection
and sanitary facilities. Some 3,560 houses would be built during the finance
period at an estimated unit cost of M$ 6,800. Buildings include office
facilities, workshops, warehouses, community halls, grocery stores and lock-up
stalls. Family and single houses would be provided for all managerial
technical and clerical staff. Staff houses and office buildings would be
built of timber to FELDA's standard design. In all, some 76 buildings and 209
staff houses would be constructed in Villages A to D, as detailed in Annex
4.2. Health and education facilities, and other social infrastructure would
be provided by specialized agencies as part of their own investment programs,
and would not be included in the project.
Palm Oil Mill
4.12     The project would support construction of one palm oil mill  at
scheme 22. This would be the third palm oil mill in the Sahabat Complex
(para. 3.11) and would be ready for operation by late 1992. The mill would be
constructed to FELDA standard design consisting of two lines of production,
each of 30 tons of fresh oil palm fruit bunches per hour (ffb/hour) nominal
throughput, which is being used under the FELDA Palm Oil Mills Project (Loan
2530-MA). The mill would provide for the milling of about 10,600 ha of crop
based on an assumed peak monthly harvest equivalent to 12.5? of an average
annual ffb production of 22.5 tons/ha over the years 1993-2000,a throughput of
60 ton ffb/hour and 500 hours/month operation (20 hours/day in two shifts, 25
days/month). The mill would have liquid effluent biological treatment
facilities. After treatment and before discharging to natural drainage
courses, liquid effluent characteristics would be as follows: BOD: max 100
ppm; TTSs max 400 ppm; PH: 5-9: Temperature 450C. These characteristics are
in compliance with Malaysian environmental standards, which are satisfactory.
Construction and commissioning costs of the mill are estimated at
H$23.0 million (Annex 5.1).
Vehicles, Equipment and Operating Costs
4.13     The project would include first time purchases and replacement of
vehicles and equipment, and management and operating expenditures of the
schemes during the first six years after planting. Each scheme would be
provided with a four wheel drive vehicle, an agricultural tractor and
trailer, and office equipment. It is anticipated that some 21 vehicles and 9
tractor/trailers would be purchased during the finance period. Total cost of
this component is shown in Annex 6.1.
Dent Peninsula Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
4.14     Environmental actions under the project are sunmarized below and
implementation arrangements are further elaborated ini paras. 5.12 - 5.16.
4.15     Legislative and Administrative Actions.  To enhance conservation and
management of Tabin and Kulamba wildlife reserves, the project would support
GOS plans to: (a) amend existing legislation so as to define wildlife reserves
as areas set aside for the conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat and



- 21 -
to eliminate commercial forest exploitation therein, and give responsibility
for the management of wildlife reserves to SWD; and (b) provide the Wildlife
Department with the staff and resources necessary to carry out its
responsibilities, in particular, the management and protection of TWR and KWR.
4.16     Infrastructure and Equipment.  The project would provide for the
construction of a TWR Headquarters building on the western border of Tabin
south of the Lipad River, and for the upgrading of an access road to the
Headquarters from Silabukan (Map IBRD 20966). The Headquarters would be
constructed of timber and would consist of office and conference facilities,
living quarters for staff, and water and power facilities, at an estimated
base cost of MS 880,000. Access to the Headquarters would continue to be
through 30 km of existing plantation roads which would be upgraded to the
agricultural roads standards of the Sahabat area (para 4.6), at an estimated
base cost of MS 2.0 million, inclusive of engineering and supervision. The
project would also provide for vehicles and equipment for operation of the
Reserve estimated at MS 120,000 (details are in Annex 7.1).
4.17     Technical Assistance.  The project would provide for two technical
advisors who would assist SWD, each for a period of 30 months starting not
later than September 30, 1989. One of the advisors would be attached to the
office of the Director and would assist in developing objectives, policies
and programs, and in assessing staffing, staff training and other resource
requirements for the operation of the Department.   The second advisor would
assist the manager of the Tabin and Kulamba wildlife reserves, and would
assist the SWD in developing a long-term operational and research program, in
staff training, and in the initial operation of the reserves. Also, some 18
man-months of consulting services would be provided under the project to
assist GOS in the preparation of a Conservation Strategy for the State of
Sabah. Funding would be from UNDP's country allocation for Malaysia, with
counterpart funds provided by GOS. EPU has approved and submitted to UNDP's
Regional Office in Kuala Lumpur a GOS application for T.A. funding (Project
Formulation Framework: PFF). UNDP's Office of Project Services (OPS) is
expected to be the executing agency.
D. Project Costs
4.18     Total project costs from January 1989 through December 1992 amount to
USS 216.0 million (MS 583.3 million), USS 12.3 million of which are for cocoa
expenditures. The foreign exchange component amounts to US$ 75.7 million or
352 of total costs. Base cests were estimated using 1988 contract prices for
agricultural development, ro.ds, inputs, etc, and include about 52 of
identifiable taxes and duties.  PI-aical contingencies were estimated at 102
for roads and 5Z for palm oil mill and equipment. No physical contingencies
were included for agricultural works and crop maintenance, since these are
standardized operations contracted on a per ha basis. Likewise, numbers and
standard designs of settler houses and administrative buildings are well
defined and no significant changes are expected during implementation.   Price
contingencies amount to 82 of base costs plus physical contingencies, based
on: domestic inflation rates of 2.72 for 1989, 3.OZ for 1990, 1991 and 1992;
and foreign inflation rates of 5.32 for 1989 and 1990 and 4.12 for 1991 and
1992. Project costs are detailed in Annexes 8.2 to 8.4 and summarized in
Table 4.2 below.

E. Financing
4.19     The proposed Bank loan to Malaysia of US$ 71.5 million would finance
35? of total costs, exclusive of cocoa expenditures. UNDP grant financing
would total about US$ 450,000. The Federal Government (GOM) would contribute
US$ 143.8 million equivilent through annual budget allocations to FELDA and
C-OS, and GOS would make a contribution of about US$ 240,000 equivalent. The
financing plan is shown in Annexes 8.5 and 8.6 and summarized in Table 4.3
below. Transfer of Bank loan proceeds to FELDA and GOS would be on the same
terms and conditions as currently followed by the Government (para. 2.10) and
consistent with arrangements under the Second FELCRA Land Development Project
(Ln. 2917-MA). About US$ 55.2 million of the Bank loan would be onlent by the
GOM to FELDA for agricultural development, settler housing and processing
facilities; about US$ 15.2 million would be a grant to FELDA for access roads,
village infrastructure (other than settler housing) and schemes management;
and about US$ 1.1 million would be a grant to Sabah Government for
infrastructure, vehicles and equipment for the Tabin and Kulamba Wildlife
Reserves.

F. Procurement
4.20     Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.4.
4.21     Works.  About 85Z of -^cess and village road construction contracts
costing USS 25.0 million, inclusive of physical and price contingencies, would
be grouped in contracts of US$ 2.0 million or more, and procured through ICB,
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Settler houses and buildings costing US$
18.6 million would be procured through LCB procedures,which have been reviewed
by the Bank and are considered acceptable. Agricultural works, planting and
crop maintenance operations costing US$ 29.0 million and construction of
agricultural roads costing USS 53.2 million would be carried out through LCB
procured contracts. International contractors are active in Malaysia and
would be allowed to participate in locally advertised tenders. However,
agricultural development contracts are more suitable for medium size
contractors, and international contractors have not shown interest in these
kind of works in other Bank-financed FELDA projects. Local contractors,
currently facing a substantial slow-down of government projects and a very
competitive environment, are having financial difficulties, but, when well
selected, they are capable of carrying out the works included in the project.
During implementation, special attention would be given to strengthening
contract registration and bid evaluation procedures to ensure selection of
contractors with adequate plant and financial resources. Engineering design
and supervision services would be provided by local consultants.
4.22     Goods.  Fertilizers and chemicals totalling USS 46.7 million and
equipment for the palm oil mill costing US$ 1.1 million would be procured
through ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A margin of preference equal
to 152 of the c.i.f. bid price of imported goods, or the actual custom duties
and import taxes, whichever is less, would be allowed for domestic
7/ UNDP is expected to finance about US$0.5 million and GOS US$0.2 million
of the EMP.

manufacturers. Vehicles and equipment totaling US$ 4.7 mia.±on would be
procured annually through LCB, in which foreign suppliers would be eligible to
participate.
4.2i     Procurement Review.  FELDA procurement procedures, developed through
many years of association with the Bank, are acceptable. Standard procurement
documents and contract processing procedures have been agreed on and are in
use in ongoing loans. Given the nature, size and number of contracts
involved, only ICB civil works contracts for access and village roads
(US$ 25.0 million) and fertilizers, chemicals and palm oil mill equipment
(US$ 47.8 million) would be subject to prior review. This would covar abcut
392 of the total value of all contracts and consist of approximately 15
contracts. Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award review.
G. Disbursements
4.24     The proposed loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 382 of expenditures on civil works, engineering services, land
development, crop planting and maintenance through maturity (except
for cocoa), equipment and vehicles incurred by FELDA in the Sahabat
Settlement Complex; and
(b) 80Z of expenditures on civil works, engineering services, equipment
and materials for protection of the Tabin and Kulamba Wildlife
Reserves.
4.25     Disbursements for expenditures on construction of access and village
roads, supply of fertilizer and chemicals, and vehicles and equipment under
contracts costing US$ 200,000 or more would be made on the basis of full
documentation. Disbursements for other eligible expenditures would be made
against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs); documentation supporting these
withdrawal Epplications would be retained by the executing agencies for review
by Bank missions.
4.26     The loan is exp.!rcted to be disbursed over a four-year period
(schedule shown in Annex 9). -A one-year lag between projected investments and
disbursements has been allowe; for submission of disbursement applications.
Since tlit is an ongoing project, disbursements would not follow the typical
profile of Malaysian agricultural projects, and are expected to be faster. The
Loan Closing date would be December 31, 1993. Retroactive financing of
US$ 7.1 million for all eligible project expenditures after December 31, 1988,
would be provided.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.1      A  project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10.1.
Development of the Sahabat settlement project would be the responsibility of
FELDA and its subsidiary corporations in line with the long-established land
development and settlement approach. Rehabilitation of the Bakapit-Tungku



- 26 -
access road would be carried out by the Sabah Public Works Department.
Implementation of the Environmental Management Plan would be the primary
responsibility of GOS, with cooperation from FELDA and relevan' ?ederal
agencies.
A. Sahabat Complex Organization and Management
5.2      At FELDA's head office, overall planning and implementation supervi-
sion of the Sahabat project would be the responsibility of one of the Senior
Director of Development in cooperation with the Planning and Budget and other
central departmentq. Actual implementation would be under the Director of
Development 6 (Saban) based in Rota Kinabalu.  Field level operations would be
carried out by two Regional Directors based in Lahad Datu, each responsible
for an area of about 30,000 ha. A team consisting of a manager, two assistant
managers, fot.r supervisors, eight field assistants, and auxiliary and clerical
staff would be responsible for day to de, scheme operations. During the
implementation period the regional management office would be transferred to
the new site office facilities At the Industrial Complex.
Agricultural Development
5.3      Agricultural development would be the responsibility of the Regional
Directors and Scheme Managers. Crop planting and maintenance (prior to
settler emplacement) would be carried out by contractors which usually employ
immigrant labor. Fertilizers and chemicals would be purchased in bulk and
oupplied to the contractors for application. Research and technical
assistance would be carried out by FELDA Agricultural Servicvs Corporation
through periodic visits of specialized staff from headquarte:s and the Tekam
Research station. For new areas to be developed later on in Sahabat due
attention would be given to river catchment and banks protection and
reforestation --- in particular, to the Sabahat - '-r, and other resource
conservation practices, as recommended in the EMP. Assurances in this respect
were obtained during negotiations.
Civil Works Construction Supervision and Maintenance
5.4      Planning, design and construction of internal access and agricultural
toads and buildings would be the responsibility of FELDA's Engineering
Department assisted by FELDA Construction Corporation (BINA). Designs would
be prepared in-house or by local consulZants, and construction would be done
by contractors. Works construction supervision would be done by BINA under
contract with FELDA.   Given the implementation backlog, agricultural roads
construction activity would be rather intensive during the project peliod, and
would require an efficient organIzation to handle it.
5.5      BINA has established within its organizational structure a Sabah
Division, consisting of some 15 civil and mechanical engineers responsible for
desi3n and construction supervision work for all FELDA projects in Sabah.
Also, given past difficulties fa-ed in obtaining gravel material, BINA has
acquired rights, constructed access roads and erected crushing plants in two
quarries to supply gravel to contractors.



- 27 -
5.6      Agricultural roads maintenance would be carried out by BINA under
contract and charged to crop development and maintenance costs. After
construction, access sand village roads would be gazetted as FLderal Roads and
maintained by PWD-Sabah with annual federal budget allocations specifically
earmarked for this purpose.  Assurances in this respect were obtained during
negotiations. 11/
Palm Oil Mill Construction and Operation
5.7      The palm oil mill design, construction  and operation supervision
would be under same arrangements as agreed for the on-going FELDA Palnu Oil
Mills Project (Loan 2530-MA). FELDA Process Department would be responsible
for engineering design and construction supervision. After construction, FELDA
would transfer mill ownership to FELDA Mill Corporation (FELMILL) as a loan,
for operation on a commercial basis. Assurances in this respect were obtained
during negotiations.
Settler Recruitment and Emplacement
5.8      Some 8,600 rural families would be settled in Villages A to I
(schemes 1 to 35) by year 1995. Some 3,560 of these families would be
emplaced during the project period in villages A through D as shown in table
5.1 below. Settlers will be given individual 14-ac (5.7 ha) farms, and FELDA
would reserve and manage 202 of the agricultural area. (see para. 2.8).
Table 5.1s SETTLER EMPLACEMENT IN VILLAGES A TO D
Year          1989       1990      1991      1992       Total
Families      750        910       950       950        3,560
5.9      Settler families would be recruited from among Sabahan nationals,
married, between 18 and 40 years of age and owning no more than 3.0 ha of
rural land or an -rban lot. Settler promotion would be carried out by FELDA's
regional office with GOS participation. Settler selection from eligible
candidates would be done on the basis of health, education, occupational
background and family size by a Selection Board made up of GOS and FELDA
representatives, and would be subject to confirmation by GOS. FELDA has
successfuliy recruited and emplaced some 324 settler families in the nearby
Umas (Tawau) project and 112 families in Sahabat, relying mostly on regional
candidates. However, given the small population of Sabah and the remoteness
of the Sahabat area, there is justified concern that there may not be a
sufficient number of families willing to settle in the project at an average
rate of about 950 per year. The FELDA package offers a proven and sustainable
option -- that should be a major incentive to join the project. Nevertheless,
11/ PWD-Sabah has already assumed maintenance responsibility for the first
13 km of the main access road.



- 28 -
to ensure settler availability, FELDA, in close cooperation with the Sabah
State Government, would carry out an aggressive promotion and recruitment
campaign, particularly in the western part of Sabah, where the bulk of the
poor, shifting cultivator population lives. It should be noted that if settler
recruitment is delayed, FELDA could in the meantime operate the project with
hired immigrant labor, which is available in the vicinity of the project area.
However, during negotiations assurances were obtained that FELDA would
annually review with the Bank progress with settler emplacement in the Sahabat
Complex and adjust the pace of future project implementation accordingly.
B. Bakapit-Tungku Road
5.10     Engineering design and construction of the Bakapit-Tungku main access
road would be carried out by PWD-Sabah under the same arrangemer.ts as
currently in use for construction of the Lahad Datu-Bakapit section under the
Sabah-Sarawak Roads Project (La. 2291-MA). A major problem observed during
implementation of this project has been the rapid destruction of the Sabah
roads by overloaded timber and palm oil trucks, due to inadequate enforcement
of the legal axle limit. Thus, under the project, PWD-Sabah would establish
and operate on a continuous basis a weigh-bridge to control axle weights on
the Lahad Datu-Tungku road. Engineering designs and construction supervision
would be done by consultants recruited in a.ccordance with Bank Guidelines.
Construction would be through an ICB-procured contract. For expedience,
funding for this road would be included in FELDA's annual budgets. Upon
construction, the road would be gazetted as a Federal road and maintenance
funds would be made available from the Federal Government to PWD-Sabah for
this purpose.   Assurances in this respect were  obtained during negotiations.
C. Environmental Management
5.11     Primary responsibility for implementation of the EMP would rest with
the Sabah Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Developmert (MTED). The
Ministry would liaise with GOM and FELDA, coordinate and oversee
implementation of the Plan at the State level, expedite legal and
administrative actions, and ensure counterpart funding.   The main state
executing agencies would be the Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) of MTED.
Wildlife Department
5.12     Since the Wildlife Department was only recently established, it is
still managerially and operationally weak, and lacks the staffing and
resources to carry out its responsibilities. Under the Project the staffing
of the Department would be increased from 48 existing and temporary positions
to 124, and its organization would be developed, reflecting functional and
geographical responsibilities (Annexes 10.2 and 10.3). One of the Advisors
provided under the T.A. component (para 4.17) would assist the Director in
developing policies and programs, assessing staff and staff training and other
resource requirements, and in the initial operation of the Department, in
accordance with terms of reference included in Annex 10.4. It is expected
that as legislative amendments are approved and the SWD is strengthened,
responsibility for management and protection of the reserves would be
gradually transferred from the Forest to the Wildlife Department.



- 29 _
Management of Wildlife Reserves
5.13     Management of the Tabin and Kulamba wildlife reserves would be the
responsibility of a Manager assisted by a team of 16 rangers and assistant
staff to be appointed under the Project (Annex 7.1). During the first 30
months, the Reserve Manager position would be held by one of the advisors
provided under the T.A. component in accordance with terms of reference
included in Annex 10.5. He would be assisted by a Deputy Manager, who after
this period of on-the-job training, would take over management from the
advisor. The Manager would develop and initiate the Implementation of a long-
term operational and research program, assess staff and staff training
requirements, and provide on-the-job training. In particular, the Manager
would propose policies for future public use of the reserves, including
tourism and other activities, as well as infrastructure requirements to
achieve these objectives. The Manager would also ca;:zy out surveys and would
propose and implement a large-mammal conservation program, particularly for
rhinoceros and elephants.
Sabah Conservation Strategy
5.14     Preparation of the Sabah Conservation Strategy, to be completed by
December 31, 1990, would be the joint responsibility of the State Department
of Development, MTED and SWD, with the cooperation of relevant state agencies
and assisted by consultants provided under the T,A. component.  A Steering
Committee, chaired by the State Director of Development and comprising
representatives of the participating agencies, would oversee implementation
and ensure participation of all sectors.  Terms of reference for the Strategy
are included in Annex 10.6. Assurances in this respect were obtained during
negotiations.
Lesislative and Administrative Actions
5.15     Prior to loan negotiations, GOS furnished to GOM and the Bank a
letter dated March 15, 1989 outlining its environmental policies and
confirming its intentions and timetable to implement the Dent Peninsula
Environmental Management Plan. During negotiations assurances were obtained
!            that GOS would:
(a) by December 31, 1989, complete measures satisfactory to the Bank
tot
(i)   define Class VII Forest Wildlife Reserves "for the
conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat";
(ii)  prohibit all commercial exploitation of forest produce in
wildlife reserves; and
(iii) transfer responsibility for wildlife reserves and wildlife
habitat from the Forestry to the Wildlife Departmeat.
(b) provide SWD with adequate staffing and resources to carry out its
State-wide conservation and management responsibilities,
particularly for wildlife reserves in the Dent Peninsula;



- 30 -
(c) by September 30, 1989, appoint two technical advisors with
qualifications acceptable to the Bank, each for a period of 30
months, to assist the SWD: (i) in developing policies and
programs, assessi3g staff and staff training and other resource
requirements, and the initial operation of the Department; and
(ii) in establishing and initiating the implementation of a long-
term operational and research program, assessing staff and staff
training requirements and providing on-the-job staff training for
TWR and KWR.
FELDA Environmental Coordination Unit
5.16     To assist in the environmental planning and management of its current
and future projects, FELDA would establish by September 30, 1989 an
Environmental Coordination Unit within its Department of Planning and Budget,
with staffing and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The Unit would
coordinate implementation of the EMP in the Sahabat area, and the execution of
environmental studies of new projects, as required by the Federal
Environmental Act of 1974 and its 1985 amendment. Initially, the Unit would
be staffed by one graduate specialist with experience in environmental
planning and management, and additional staff would be added later as
necessary. Assurances in this respect were obtained during negotiations.
D. Accounts and Audit
5.17     FELDA financial accounts are fully computerized and are disaggregated
by schemes as well as by category of expenditure, and are audited within five
months of the close of the fiscal year by independent private auditors
appointed by the Auditor General. As has been the case with previous Bank
projects, FELDA accounts and audit reports would incorporate the project
accounts. Likewise, general accounts of SWD and PWD Departments would also
incorporate separate Project accounts, which would be audited by the Auditor
General.   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that FELDA and GOS's
SWD and PWD would furnish to the Bank their audited accounts and financial
statements, inclusive of project accounts, within nine months following the
close of the fiscal year. The audit reports would include a separate opinion
as to whether funds d4sbursed against SOEs were used for the purpose for which
they were provided.
E, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
5.18     FELDA's Department of Planning and Budget would be responsible for
implementation monitoring and reporting of the Sahabat settlement program.
MTED would monitor and report implementation of the EMP. Project
implementation reports would be submitted semi-annually and a Project
Completion Report would be prepared within six months of the loan closing
date. In addition, during project implementation, FELDA and Bank supervision
missions would closely monitor the impact of the Government's decision to
abolish the block and share systems of settlement and replacing it with
individual land titles (paras. 2.8 and 2.9).

VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES
A. Crop Technology
Oil Palm
6.1      Crop Establishment.  Palms planted at 10-12 months of age are derived
from elite progeny seed produced in FELDA's West Malaysia seec' gardens.
Planting density is 136 palms/ha, some 8! less than the industry norm,
reflecting the high fertility of Sahabat soils. Replacement planting v) cover
losses by pests, especially wild boar, had been high during early development
years, but is not expected to exceed about 152 in the last planted group of
schemes 26 to 35. Legume cover crops are routinely established between the
palms to provide soil protection against erosion and enhance soil nutrient
status. Pest and disease control, field sanitation and use of fertilizers
would all follow standard industry practices. Fertilizer requirements for
palms in production, however, would be determined by annual foliar analyses
carried out by FELDA laboratory services.
6.2      Yields. The projected yield profile for oil palm is given in Annex
2.3. Palms enter in production in year 3 after planting and are projected to
reach a peak yield of 24 tons fresh fruit bunch/ha in years 9-11. The average
yield over the 27 years of production would be 17.7 tons ffb/ha. Total
production is estimated at 477 tons ffb/ha, producing some 100 tons nf palm
oil and 24 tona of dry kernels.
Cocoa, Coffee and Intercropping
6.3      Cro  Establisbment.  Both cocoa and coffee are planted in the second
year after land clearing under fast growing shade trees planted in the first
year. Coffee of the Liberica type is established from seed produced in
FELDA's seed garden in West Malaysia and planted at a density of 1,330
trees/ha with Glyricidia shade trees. Cocoa seedlings, progeny of Upper
Amazon hybrids, are planted at a density of 1,300 plants/ha. The intercrop
regime has consisted of oil palm at a density of 110 palms/ha interplanted
with cocoa at 760 trees/ha and Glyricidia shade trees. The establishment and
culture of these crops including manuring, pest and disease control and field
sanitation follows standard industry practices.
6.4      Yields.  The projected yield profiles for coffee and cocoa (for the
earlier monocrop and intercrop plantings) are given in Annex 2.4. Both crops
would enter into production during the third year after planting. Cocoa
(monocrop) yields would peak around year 12 after planting at about 1200 kg of
dry beans/ha. Coffee yields would peak at about 1,000 kg of dry beans per ha
at year 11 after planting. For intercrop, the oil palm ffb yield is projected
at 80Z of the monocrop areas, in line with relative palm density; while cocoa
yield is estimLted at 502 below that of the monocrop, due to increasingly
adverse effects of palm shading. Intercrop yields for palm ffb are estimated
to average 14 tons/halyear over 27 years, producing a total of 78 tons of
oil/ha, while the yield of dry cocoa beans would total 12 tons/ha over 27
years (compared to 23 tons/ha of the monocrop).



- 32 -
B. Crop Production, Processing and Marketing
6.5      Palm Oil.  Production from schemes 1 to 35 would peak at about 1.23
million tons of ffb, which would yield some 258,000 tons of crude palm oil
(CPO) (at an average extraction rate of 21X) and 62,000 tons af palm kernels
(PK) (at 52 recovery rate) around 1997. ThJs production would be about 2.92
of Malaysia's CPO and PK projected production in 1997.
6.6      Processing, transport and marketing of palm oil is carried out by
FELDA subsidiary corporations.  FELMILL buys ffb at market price, which is
based on Palm Oil Regulatory and Licensing Authority (PORLA) gazetted price12/
less processing, CPO and PK transport, and other incidental costs. Processing
costs, currently at M$ 30/ffb-ton, are determined periodically based on
FELMILL operating costs. Current transport and handling costs from Sabah are
M$112/CPO-ton due to surface transport to Lahad Datu and double port handling
and storage, and sea transport to Johor refineries, compared to only M$25/ ton
in Peninsular Malaysia. As a result, mill gate ffb price in Sabah is
currently about M$15/ton less than in Peninsular Malaysia.
6.7      Cocoa and Coffee.  Project incremental production of cocoa would peak
at about 8,290 tons and coffee at 800 tons in 1999. Malaysia, which is not a
member of the International Coffee Organization, is a net importer of coffee.
In 1986/87, imports of coffee were about 7,340 tons and exports 1,800 tons;
domestic production and demand were about 11,800 tons and 18,500 tons,
respectively. Both cocoa and coffee beans would be dried in the project and
sold to local traders.
C. I.ternational Market Prospects
6.8      World demand for palm oil is expected to grow at about 5.72 per annum
over 1987-2000, based on the apsumption that palm oil would continue to
compete strongly with other -:getable oils and make heavy inroads into the
animal fats market. Malaysia's share of world production is expected to
increase from 582 in 1987 to 641 in year 2000, and exports from 692 to 83Z
during the same period. In absolute terms, Malaysia's national production and
gross exports of palm oil are expected to reach 10.4 m tons and 9.8 m tons,
respectively, in year 2000 compared to the actual 4.6 m tons and 4.5 m tons,
respectively, in 1987. The above projections by the Bank's International
Economics Department (IEC) include incremental production from the Sahabat and
other FELDA schemes in Sabah and elsewhere.
6.9      Market prospects for Malaysia's palm oil are further enhanced due to
quickly expanding local downstream processing and considerable ongoing
research, principally at the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM),
in new uses of palm oil. The most promising development of the industry is in
the area of oleochemicals. Since 1984, Malaysian palm oil processing has
moved downstream and about 75,000 tons of oleochemicals (fatty acids,
methylesters and glycerines) were produced in 1986. The estimate for 1987 is
150,000 tons and projections for the end-1990s are 750,000 tons a year. In
1980, less than 12 of world production of oleochemicals was derived from palm
oil. By 1986, this had jumped to 1OX, with Malaysia accounting for 70-802 of
12/ PORLA gazetted price is published monthly based on the industry-wide
average price of traded CPO in the preceding month.



- 33 -
the total. Another potential area is pharmaceuticals and in March 1988 PORIN
set up the first pilot plant in the world to extract vitamin E from palm oil.
The plant will produce high purity (over 90Z) vitamin E from palm fatty acid
distillate, a by-product of physical refining of palm oil.
D. Commodity Prices
6.10     Real palm oil prices are projected by IEC to be about lOX lower in
the year 2000 compared to 1988; palm kernel and cocoa prices to be at about
the same level as in 1988; and coffee prices to be about 4Z lower.
6.11     For economic analysis, IEC projected prices, converted to 1988
constant terms on the basis of the MUV index, were used. For palm oil and
kernel, which are exportables, economic mill-gate prices were estimated from
f.o.b. prices. For coffee, which is an importable, domestic prices were used
in the economic analysis, since projections for Liberica coffee, which is
consumed in the country and which would be the type produced in the project,
are not available and no significant distortions in domestic prices were
noted. Economic mill-gate prices for cocoa, an exportable, were also
estimated since cocoa is included in the economic analysis of the Sahabat
Complex (see para. 7.6), even though project financing excludes cocoa. A
deduction of about US$ 100/ton from world cocoa prices was made to reflect
quality discounts on Malaysian cocoa. Economic mill-gate price calcalations
for palm oil, kernel and cocoa are shown in Annexes 11.1 and 11.2.
6.12     Financial mill-gate prices for cocoa and coffee are about the same as
economic mill-gate prices due to the absence of distortions. Financial mill-
gate prices for oil palm ffb diverge from economic mill-gate prices due to
export duties on CPO, with graduated duty exemption on PPO according to the
stage of processing. However, these divergences are small (under 5X) and,
therefore, economic mill-gate prices have been used for analysis of settler
incomes.
VII. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
7.1      The project would bring about social, economic, environmental and
institutional benefits. Consolidation of agricultural development and
settlement of 61,000 ha in Sahabat schemes 1 to 35 would ensure an economic
return to past investments, and provide viable/secure income and raise the
living standards of about 8,600 rural families, previously living below the
M$460/montb poverty income level. Some 3,560 of those families would be
settled during the project period. The project would also contribute to
agricultural production and exports, and the overall economic development of
the State of Sabah. Incremental production would be primarily of palm oil and
kernel and, to a smaller extent, of cocoa and coffee. At full development
around end-1990s, net foreign exchange earnings and savings from project
incremental production (using projected world market prices for the year 2000
in 1988 constant dollars) would be about US$106 million per year.
Implementation of legal and administrative actions under the EMP would
significantly contribute to ensuring protection and adequate management of



- 34 _
wildlife reserves in Sabah, enhancing environmental protection practices
during agricultural development of the Sahabat area and in future FELDA land
settlement projects, and building up the Sabah Wildlife Department. This
would be the Bank's first environmental initiative of this kind in Malaysia.
B. Financial Analysis
Settler Incomes
7.2      Settler farm incomes have been analyzed on the basis of a typical 5.7
ha (14 ac) family farm planted with oil palm. Annex 12.1 presents the
analysis for a 25-year period.
7.3      A positive cash flow would be reached by development year 6 and it
would remain very satisfactory over the 25-year period. Settler family
incomes would be substantially above Sabah's poverty level of M$460/montb (in
1988 constant terms). Starting at M$272 in year 6, incomes would peak at
MS1,265 in year 10. AfLer year 20, when settlers would have fully repaid
development loans, and earned the right to receive land titles, monthly
incomes would average M$986 in 1988 constant terms.
Cost RecoverY
7.4      Investments in basic infrastructure, including roads, water supply,
staff houses and public buildings would not be directly recovered.
Agricultural development expenditures, including land development, planting
and crop maintenance, and settler houses would be fully repaid by the settlers
over a period of 25 years (para. 2.10). Settler repayment record is excellent
and bad debts are practically nil, since FELDA carries out crop processing and
marketing through its subsidiaries and repayments are deducted from sales
revenues (para. 2.12).
C. Economic Analysis
Economic Rate of Return
7.5      The economic rate of return (ERR) based on costs and benefits from
1989 onwards is estimated at 25Z (Annex 12.2) under the following assumptions:
(a) costs and benefits of cocoa were included since agricultural roads and
other infrastructure supported under the project would unavoidably cover cocoa
areas, even though cocoa crop maintenance is not included for Bank financirn
(para. 4.4); (b) benefits from oil palm and cocoa sales are calculated on the
basis of mill-gate prices derived from the Bank's price projections of OctobeL
1988, adjusted to 1988 constant dollars using the MUV index, and converted to
Malaysian ringgits at the official exchange rate (Annexes 11.1 and 11.2).
Benefits from coffee are calculated on the basis of domestic prices (para.
6.11); (c) costs are estimated in 1988 constant ringgits and include all
capital and operational expenditures in the Sahabat area from 1989 onwards.
Expenditures on the EMP are not included since related benefits are difficult
to assess; and (d) market wage rates are used as no significant distortions in



-35-
the labor market are evident. If all costs and benefits for the Sahabat
Complex since 1981 were included in the economic analysis, the ERR would drop
to 11? (Annex 12.5), which is also satisfactory. The results of applying a
sensitivity analysis show that the project remains viable across a range of
assumptions on costs and benefits.  The switching value test shows that costs
would have to increase by 302 or benefits decrease by 29? to lower the
project ERR from 252 to 102, the opportunity cost of capital in Malaysia.
While the probability of cost increases is low, a decline in benefits,
particularly if prices turn out to be lower than projected, cannot be ruled
out. However, a price level 192 lower than projected, while possible in some
years (particularly for palm oil, given its high price volatility), is
extremely unlikely over the entire 30-year period of the analysis.
D. Risks
7.6        Settler availability is a potential risk, as Sabahans are perceived
to be reluctant to adopt permanent settlement and farming conditions.
However, the FELDA package offers a proven and sustainable settlement option
and settler response in other areas in Sabah has thus far been positive.
Time-slice financing would provide flexibility to adjust investment plans in
accordance with settler response (para. 5.9). Also, delay in settler
recruitment would not affect the economic viability of the project since FELDA
could operate in the meantime with hired labor, which is available in the
project area. Successful implementation of the EMP is partly contingent on
the implementation of the measures proposed under the project. Since the
State Government is fully committed to the objectives of the project, no major
problems are expected.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMM.NDATION
8.1      GOS furnished to the Federal Government and the Bank a letter dated
March 15, 1989 outlining its environmental policies and confirming its
intentions and timetable to implement the EMP (para. 5.15).
8.2      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following:
(a)   FELDA would ensure that future land development  would be
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Dent
Peninsula Environmental Management Plan, in respect of land
clearing, watershed and wildlife protection (para. 5.3);
(b)   GOM would ensure that after construction, all project internal
access and village roads would be gazetted as Federal Roads and
maintained by PWD-Sabah with annual Federal budget allocations
specifically earmarked for this purpose (para. 5.6);
(c)   after construction and commissioning, FELDA would transfer
ownership of the palm oil mill constructed under the project to
FELMILL for operation on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank (para 5.7);



- 36 -
(d)   FELDA would annually review with the Bank progress with settler
emplacement in the Sahabat Complex and adjust the pace of
future project implementation accordingly (para. 5.9);
(e)   GOM would ensure that upgrading and subsequent maintenance of
the Bakapit-Tungku access road and weighbridge would be carried
out by SabIh's Public Works Department to the same standards
and under the same arrangements being used for the Lahad Datu
road section under the ongoing Sabah-Sarawak Rural Roads
Project (Ln. 2291- MA); and PWD-Sabah would establish and
operate on a continuous basis the weigh-bridge to control axle
weights on the Lahad Datu-Tungku road (para. 5.10);
(f)   by December 31, 1990, GOS would prepare a Conservation Strategy
ior the State of Sabah in accordance with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.14);
(g)   by December 31, 1989, GOS would complete measures satisfactory
to the Bank to: (i) define Class VII Forest Wildlife Reserves
"for the conservation of wildlife and wilelife habitat"; (ii)
prohibit all commercial exploitation of forest produce in
wildlife reserves; and (iii) transfer responsibility of
Wildlife Reserves from the Forestry to the Wildlife Department
(para. 5.15);
(h)   GOS would provide Wildlife Department with adequate staffing
and resources to carry out its Statewide conservation and
management responsibilities, particularly for the wildlife
reserves on the Dent Peninsula (para. 5.15);
(i)   by September 30, 1989, GOS would appoint two technical advisors
with qualifications acceptable to the Bank, each for a period
of 30 months to assist the SWD: (i) in developing policies and
programs, assessing staff and staff training and other resource
requirements, and the initial operation of the Department; and
(ii) in establishing and initiating implementation of a long-i
term operational and research program, assessing staff and
staff training requirements, and providing on-the-job staff
training for TWR and KWR (para. 5.15) and;
(j)   by September 30, 1'89,  FELDA would establish within its
Department of Planning and Budget an Envircnmental Coordination
Unit responsible for coordinating implementation of the EMP in
Sahabat, and the execution of environmental studies of new
projects, with staffing and terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank (para. 5.16).
8.3      With the above assurances the proposed project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of US$71.5 million to be made to Malaysia. The loan would have a
repayment period of 17 years, including a grace period of five years at the
standard variable interest rate.
