MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A SABAH LAND SETTLEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Malaysia for US$71.5 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have a repayment period of 17 years, including a grace
period of five years, at the standard variable interest rate, and would
help finance a land settlement and environmental management project in
Malaysia. UNDP would cofinance the project's environmental component in
the amount of US$0.5 million equivalent.
Background
2.        The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) has a history of
successful land development and settlement of poor families based on
cultivation of tree crops, primarily oil palm, rubber and, to a lesser
extent, cocoa. FELDA's development approach consists of a fully integrated
package comprising land development, construction of basic infrastructure
and settler housing, provision of technical assistance, inputs, credit,
processing and marketing services. FELDA clears and plants the land using
private contractors, and settlers are placed in the schemes vhen crop
production starts. Through 1988, FELDA had developed around 750,000 ha and
settled over 111,000 poor families. Most of FELDA activities have been
carried out in Peninsular (West) Malaysia. The Bank has supported the
FELDA program since 1968 through eight loans, with positive results.
3.       In 1979 PELDA began operations in the State of Sabah, in East
Malaysia. Sabah accounts for 20? of the total area of Malaysia. About
one-third of the State is suitable for agriculture, particularly oil palm
and cocoa, but most of this area is still largely underdeveloped. Some 75Z
of Sabah's population is rural, consisting mainly of shifting cultivators
living below the poverty level. FELDA's long-term plans for Sabah include
agricultural development of about 90,U0O ha of tree crops, primarily oil
palm, and settlement of about 12,700 families in the Sahabat settlement
complex located in the Dent Peninsula (East Sabah). Implementation of the
Sahabat project started in 1980 and full development is expected by the
late 1990s. By end-1988, development of about 65t of this area was
underway. Agricultural production has started, but harvesting and fruit
transport from field to processing facilities is seriously hampered by an
almost total lack of agricultural roads and an incomplete access road
network. Also, in the Dent Peninsula and adjacent to the Sahabat
agricultural area are the Tabin (TWR) (120,500 ha) and Kulamba (KWR)
(20,700 ha) Wildlife Reserves which, together with other neighboring forest
reserves, are the habitat for breeding populations of endangered Sumatra
rhinoceros and Asian elephants, and are the only two areas gazetted as
wildlife reserves in Sabah. Responsibility for managing these reserves is
now in transition from the Sabah Forestry Department to the newly
established Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD), and legal and administrative
actions are needed to ensure preservation and adequate management of the
reserves.



- 2-
Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.       FELDA's land development and settlement activities have been the
key element in the Government's rural poverty alleviation program, which
the Bank has consistently supported.  By becoming involved during project
preparation, the Bank has been able to suggest adjustments to the long-term
development program for Sahabat and has helped erhance FELDA's in-house
capability for environmental planniug and monitoring. Also, involvement in
project preparation has enabled the Bank to make a contribution to wildlife
conservation and management. and to help lay the basis for future natural
resource planning and conservation work in Sabah. Preparation of these
activities was carried out with the participation of the major
environmental NGO in Malaysia, the World Wide Fund for Nature, Malaysia
(WWFM); implementation would be supported by UNDP-financed technical
assistance.
ProAect Obiectives
S.       The project would assist the Government in the Implementation of
the Sahabat land settlement program, vith emphasis on consolidation and
settlement of already planted areas. It would also support the
Implementation of an Environmental Management Plan for the Dent Peninsula
(EMP), designed to strengthen management and protection of wildlife
reserves and institution-building in the State of Sabah.
Proiect Description
6.       The project would consist of a four year time-slice (1989-1992) of
the Sahabat program and the EMP. In Sahabat, the project would focus on
consolidating agricultural development and settlement of some 61,000 ha
including: (i) crop development and early maintenance of oil palm and
coffee, 11 and construction of agricultural roads; (ii) upgrading of the
project's main access road and construction of internal access roads; (iii)
development of four settler villages; (iv) construction of one palm oil
mill; and (v) provision of vehicles and equipment. Under the EMP, the
project would: ti) Implement actions to enhance protection and management
of wildlife reserves in Sabah; (ii) provide physical infrastructure and
equipment for TWR and KWR; (iii) provide two technical advisors for the SWD
and consulting services for the preparation of a Conservation Strategy for
Sabah, financed by UNDP; and (iv) establish an Environmental Unit in FLDA.
The total project cost is estimated at US$216.0 million equivalent,
US$12.3 million of which are for unreimbursable cocoa expenditures. The
foreign exchange component is US$75.7 million or 35?.  The proposed loan of
1/ Maintenance of cocoa already planted (6,600 ha) would not be financed
under the project, and FELDA has no intention of planting additional
cocoa in Sabah because of projected low international prices.



- 3 -
US$71.5 million would finance civil works, engineering services, land
development, crop planting and maintenance through maturity (except for
cocoa), equipment and vehicles for the Sahabat settlement complex and civil
works, engineering services and equipment and materials for protection of
the TWR and KWR. Retroactive financing of US$7.1 million for eligible
project expenditures after December 31, 1988 would be provided. A breakdown
of the project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Malaysia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7381-MA, dated March 30, 1989 is being distributed separately.
IBRD Maps 20966 and 20967R are attached.
Agreed Actions
7.       As a condition of negotiations, the Government of Sabah has
furnished to the Federal Government and the Bank a letter dated
March 15, 1989, outlining its environmental policies and confirming its
intentions to implement the EMP, along with a timetable. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Federal Government, the
Government of Sabah and1 FELDA that: (a) FELDA's future land development in
Sahabat would be carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the
EMP in respect of land clearing and watershed and wildlife protection; (b)
after construction, all project access and village roads would be gazetted
as Federal Roads and maintained by the Public Works Department-Sabah with
Federal funding; (c) after _onstruction and commissioning, FELDA would
transfer palm oil mill ownership to FELDA Mills Corporation (FELMILL) for
operation; (d) FELDA would annually review with the Bank progress with
settler emplacement in the Sahabat complex and adjust the pace of future
project implementation accordingly; (e) upgrading and subsequent
maintenance of the Bakapit-Tungku main access road would be carried out by
Sabah's Public Works Department to the same standards and under the same
arrangements as currently in use under the ongoing Sabah-Sarawak Rural
Roads Project (Loan 2291-MA); (f) by December 31, 1990, the Government of
Sabah would prepare a Conservation Strategy for the State of Sabah; (g) by
December 31, 1989, the Government of Sabah would complete measures to
enhance the status of wildlife reserves, exclude commercial exploitation of
forest therein and give responsibility for their management to SWD; (h) SWD
would be provided with adequate staffing and resources to carry out its
Statewide conservation and management responsibilities, particularly the
protection and management of wildlife reserves in the Dent Peninsula; (i)
by September 30, 1989, two advisors would be appointed, each for a period
of 30 months, to assist SWD in developing policies and programs, and in
managing TWR and KWR; (j) by September 30, 1989, FELDA would establish an
Environmental Unit within its Department of Planning and Budget.
Benefits
8.       The project would bring about social, economic, environmental and
institutional benefits. Consolidation of agricultural development and
settlement of 61,000 ha in Sahabat schemes 1 to 35 would ensure economic
return to past investments, and provide viable/secure incomes and raise the
living standards of about 8,600 Sabahan rural families, previously living



- 4 -
below the poverty level. Some 3,ZVl cf those families would be settled
during the project period. The proJect would also contribute to
agricultural production and exports, and the overall iconomic development
of the State of Sabab. Incremental production would be primarily of palm
oil and kernel, and to a small extent, cocoa and coffee. At full
development around end-1990s, net foreign exchange earnings and savings
from project incremental production (using the projected world market price
for the year 2000) would be about US$106 million per year, in constant 1988
dollars. Implementation of legal and administrative actions under the EDP
would significantly contribute to ensuring the protection and adequate
management of wildlife reserves in Sabah, enhancing envirormeatal
protection practices during agricultural development of the Sahabat area
and in future FELDA land settlement projects, and strengthening the new
SWD. This would be the Bank's first environmental initiative of this kind
in Malaysia.
Risks
9.       Settler availability is a potential risk, as Sabahans are
perceived to be reluctant to adopt permanent settlement and farming
conditions. However, the FELDA package offers a proven and sustainable
settlement option, and settler response in other smaller areas in Sabah has
thus far been positive. Time-slice financing would provide flexibility to
adjust investment plans in accordance with settler response. Also, delays
in settler recruitment would not affect the economic viability of the
project since FELDA could operate in the meantime with hired labor, which
is available in the project area. Successful implementation of the SMP is
partly contingent on implementation of the measures proposed under the
project. Since the State Government is fully committed to the objectives
of the project, no major problems are expected.
Recovmendation
10.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
