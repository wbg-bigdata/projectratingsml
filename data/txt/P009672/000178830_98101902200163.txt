INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR
THE MYSORE AGRICULTURAL WHOLESALE MARKETS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recammendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$8.0 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance the Mysore agricultural wholesale markets
project in India.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-32a, dated May 10, 1972), was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 2, 1972. This report estimated that for the
Indian Fiscal Year ending on March 31, 1972, the economy grew at less
than 4 percent. For the current year, growth is expected to be even
lower and, indeed, there is the prospect that there may not be any growth
at all. The principal factor has been the serious failure of the
monsoon. In comparing the rate of economic growth achieved over the
past two years with the average of 5 percent per annum experienced during
the preceding two years account should be taken of the fact that the
Indian economy underwent two years of bad weather in a period of sharply
falling foreign aid and provided substantial economic assistance to
Bangladesh.
3.        Until the beginning of 1972, performance in the industrial
sector had been especially disappointing with a downward trend from a
growth rate of 7.1 percent in 1969 to 4e5 percent in 1971. However, the
figure for 1971 obscures some improvement which began to take place
during the last quarter and which was sustained during the first quarter
of 1972. Over these six months industrial production increased by 7.2
percent compared with the same period the year before. But this improve-
ment has to be qualified,first,because much of it was confined to the
textile industry which recovered from the effects of a severe shortage of
raw cotton and, secondly,because recent data indicate that no further
increase in industrial output occurred during the latter part of 1972.
The factors which have brought about this situation include lack of
demand for certain capital goods, shortage of imported raw materials,
labor unrest, power shortages, as well as managerial difficulties,
especially in the steel industry. Cumbersome administrative procedures
in applying industrial policy have also aggravated the situation. These
factors have been present in varying degrees almost continuously over
the past decade with the result that India's industrial potential has
yet to be fully realized. What marks out the last 3 years is the severity
of the deceleration in industrial activity notwithstanding the modest
reprieve gained in the early part of 1972. The Government of India (GOI)



-2-
recognizes that fresh initiatives must be taken through industrial
policy measures. Revisions of the industrial licensing policy have been
acnounced recently; it is as yet too early to evaluate the effects of
these rev-isions on investment and output.
4.s        Agricultural production registered. an increase of over five
percent irn each of the first two years of the Fourth Plan, with foodgrain
production reaching 108 million tans in 1970/71. In 1971/72 foodgrain
productioyn was affected by rather indifferent weather with the result
that only qn estim.ated 106 million tons were produced. This year weather
co.nditions have been disastrous wmith a complete failure of the monsoon
in both t.he west and east sides of the country, an unusual occurrence.
Meanaingful estimates have still to be made but clearly production of
suirmier foodgrains will be substantially below last year's level, with
the result that India is enduring very serious food shortages over large
parts of the country. The Government had hoped that large foodgrain
stoclks built up between 1 968 and 1 970 would be adequate to meet require-
meY,t,s in bad years. But the combined effect of supplying foodgrain to
13B:r.flaadesh and the severity of the drought this year has led to foodgrain
st.ocks being reduced by aibout half, to 3-4 million tons at the end of
1972. These s-tocks are now being depleted at a rate of one millioln tons
a month0  The Government has decided to import about two mil'ion tons of
foodgraiIns and more may be required if the winter crop fails to exceed or
falls short of last year's level of output. Other crops have also been
affected. Jute and, to a lesser extent, cotton production are expected
to lhe lower, while the shortage of oilseeds could be quite severe with
the resulting need for hiigher imports.
in the present situation, the generallyr favorable trend in
agri,cultural production over the past several years should not be over-
'Eooked   v Ezven if this yearIs foodgrain crop should be between 95 and 100
mil-lion tons it would stiLl be significantly above that obtained in the
last serious drought year, 1965/66, wihen production reached only 72
million tons0  This would indicat.e that the considerable investments in
irrigation facilities, fertilizer, ancl other agriculltural inputs have had
the ef.tect of reduLcing thze impact of droughts. If yields this year remain
h-igh on irrigated land in spite of adverse -weather conditions, and reports
of good crops in the Punjab and Haryana are favorable indications, this
wllM confi.rm the success of the new technology and highlight the need to
broaden its use within India.
6.        The -wholesale price index has increased at a rate of 6.5 percent
bet-wefen July 1 972 and December 1972. An important factor has been the
rapid increase of food prices, which went up at the same rate over this
periLod reflecting expected foodgrain shortages0  In an effort to control
inflation, the Government has limited the overdraft facilities available
to State gorernments, previously a source of defici-t spending, and is
considering measures to control more effectively the level of foodgrain
prices, but such steps are likely to be offset by the relief programs
necessitated by the droaug,ht.



-3-
7.        India's net reserves position at the end of September was
US$1 ,188 million or the equivalent of 39 percent of annual imports, plus
debt service payments. Reserves have fallen by nearly US$100 million
since March 1972. Further pressure on the country's declining reserves
from foodgrain imports is inevitable. On the export side, recent
estimates indicate a 23 percent increase in exports between April and
November this year, as compared with the corresponding period last year.
But overall, the rate of growth of ex.ports has been slow in the recent
past and uncertainty surrounds future levels of net aid. In the circum-
stances, India should clearly continue to receive substantial aid from IDA.
8e        A document setting out the approach to the Fifth Plan for
the period 1974/75 to 1978/79 hIs recently been published by the
Government. Economic self-reliance and the elimination of poverty are
held to be the major tasks of the Fifth Plan. In the light of the
experience of the Fourth Plan, considerable effort will be required to
achieve the 5.5 percent annual grawth which is the target for the Fifth
Plan period.
9.        A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
10.       Since 1949 the Bank has made 40 loans and 48 development credits
to India totalling US$1,110 million and US$2,014 million (both net of
cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$564 million has been
repaid and US$770 million is still undisbursed. Annex II contains a
summary statement of disbursements as of January 31, 1973, and notes on
the status of currently active loans and credits.
11.       Since 1957 IFC has made 13 cammitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million of which US$4.3 million has been repaid, US$7J6 million
sold and US$6.0 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$24.4 million,
US$16.9 million represents loans and US$7.5 million equity. A summary
statement of IFC operations as of January 31, 1973, is also included in
Annex II (page 2).
12.       The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent
years has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This
reflects the importance of agriculture, which contributes about 50
percent of India's GNP, and the corresponding investment priorities of
the Government. In addition to the Agricultural Universities project,
which was signed on November 10, 1972 and the Nangal Fertilizer
project, signed on February 9, 1973, two agricultural credi1% one agro-
industry (apple processing) and an additional markets project are expected
to be ready for consideration by the Executive Directors this fiscal year.
13.       Lending to industry will also be a prominent feature of the
program for this fiscal year. Assistance to the industrial sector will
concentrate an the support of development finance institutions through
the credit to the Industrial Development Bank of India, which was signed
on February 9, 1973 and a tenth loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment



Corporation of India. Industry will also benefit from an Industrial
Imports credit.  In addition, assistance to infrastructure development
is provided for in this year's program through a credit for power
transmission, and a credit in support of the Government's tele-
communications investment program which has been appraised.
India's large cities, particularly Bombay and Calcutta, require major
investment in public services to keep up with the growth of their
populations; accordingly, a Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage project and
an Urban Development project in Calcutta are also included in this year's
program.
1h4       The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external
resources in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of
Bank economic reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium.
We recognize that emphasis on lending for such critical sectors as agri-
cuture or urban development is inevitably leading to a relatively slow
transfer of IDA's resources. In order to balance our program we have in
the past included lending for more rapidly disbursing projects, such as
power transmission, telecommunications and industrial imports. We plan
to continue to provide assistance for such projects in the curn mt
fiscal year. Because of the capacity of the capital goods sector of the
Indian economy, India imports relatively few capital goods. As in the
case of the credit now proposed, the Association should, therefore, be
prepared to help finance the local costs of high priority projects in
support of India's efforts to secure a transfer of resources adequate to
sustain a satisfactory rate of growth.
FPART III  - THE PROJECT
15.       This credit, if approved, will be the Bank Groivp's second
lending operation in India in support of an agricultural markets project.
The project pursues objectives similar to those of the Bihar Agricultural
Markets project, which is progressing satisfactorily.  The Mysore project
was appraised in May and June 1972. Negotiations were held in January
1973.  The Borrower's delegation was headed by Messrs. M. K. Mukherjee,
Joint Secretary, Mtnistnr of Food and Agriculture and G. V. K. Rao,
Development Commissioner, State of Mysore and included Messrs. A. N.
Choksi, V. N. Rajagopalan, S. Varadhan and J. Alexander.  A project
summary is attached as Annex III.
16.       The Government of India considers development of regulated
wholesale markets aimed at increasing trade efficiency and reducing
produce losses to be one of the key elements in its strategy to induce
increased agricultural production. Traditional marketing systems are
characterized by scattered marketing opportunities, location in congested
areas, inadequate storage and auction facilities, inefficient produce
grading and a dearth of other facilities. There is also a marked lack
of market intelligence. These circumstances which fail to assure fair
prices leave the farmer little incentive to improve the quantity or
quality of his production. In order to rectify this situation, the
Government of India has encouraged State governments to establish modern
regulated markets under appropriate legislation.



17.       Mysore is primarily an agricultural state; 62 percent of its
total area, predominantly dry land, is cultivated, and agriculture
accounts for about 61 percent of the State's gross product. The prin-
cipal crops are foodgrains (almost 6 million tons in 1970-71), sugarcane
(8 million tons), oilseeds (0.7 million tons), and cotton (483,000
bales). Mysore is also India's largest producer of coffee and raises a
wide variety of spices, nuts, fruits and vegetables. About 50 percent
of foodgrains and oilseeds production constitutes marketable surplus
and about half of this amount passes at present through regulated markets.
18.       The State government is giving great emphasis to increasing
agricultural production through investments in irrigation and through a
variety of programs aimed at spreading high yielding varieties and more
intensive cultivation practices. Considerable increases in agricultural
production have occurred in recent years and further increases are likely
and woald boost principally the *olume of marketable surpluses. In the
circumstances, improvements in agricultural marketing deserve high
priority. Agricultural marketing is regulated by a comprehensive Agri-
cultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act which was passed in 1966.
Ninety-nine Regulated Market Committees have been established under the
Act and regulate the trade in designated market areas. Each Market
Committee includes representatives of farmers, the State government and
the trading community. The Committees license middlemen, specify charges
that may be levied and supervise the conduct of trade by auction or
tender. The State government supervises the election and activity of the
Market Committees through the State Marketing Department.
19.       Modern marketing facilities are required if the purposes of the
Marketing Act are to be accomplished and the Market Committees to operate
effectively. The proposed project is designed to provide these facili-
ties. It covers the development of new markets or improvements to
existing markets operated by Market Committees throughout the State. The
facilities to be provided, depending on the needs of the particular
location and the commodities handled by a particular market, would include
access roads, auction platforms, fencing, shops and go-downs for market
intermediaries, internal roadways and parking areas, utilities, equipment,
such as grain dryers, scales, testing and comnunications equipment, and
buildings for the Market Committee. The project also provides for training
of staff of the State Marketing Department and Marketing Committees and
for an economic evaluation of the results of the investment by a qualified
research institution under contract with the State Marketing Department.
20.       The State Marketing Department would be the principal agency
directing project implementation. The Department is well staffed to
exercise detailed supervision and give assistance to the Market Committees
participating in the project. It requires some strengthening in technical
and economic matters and the State govermment will make available, as a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit, an experienced and
qualified civil engineer, an architect with experience in designing
market layouts and structures and an economic adviser. The Public Works
and Town Planning Department of the State government would assist



-6-
Market Committees at the direction of the State Marketing Department in
the preparation of designs and specifications, tender documents and
loan requests, in calling for tenders, analyzing bids and supervising
construction by contractors.
21.       The Market Cormitteeswould be responsible for the construction
and improvement of market facilities and for their operation. It is
expected that most Market Committees participating in the project would
have been operating for some time, although more recently established
Market Committees would not be excluded. Markets to be developed under
the project would be selected by the State Marketing Department according
to projected grawth in arrivals, location relative to adjacent markets
and road network, extent of existing congestion and financial ability
to support the investment, including the resulting debt service. Although
99 committees operate in the State, many of these are very small
markets and operate only one or two days per week with little need for
additional investment at this stage. The Market Committees would
provide all land required. for project development and would own all
common facilities. Shops< and go-downs for use by market intermediaries
(traders, cooperatives arid other corporate or statutory bodies) would
be built by Market Committees for rental or by the intermediaries
themselves on land leased. ±rom Market Committees.
22.       The cost of the project (exclusive of land) is estimated at
about US$12 million equivalent, including indirect foreign exchange expen-
ditures of about US$3 million. The investment by Market Committees is
expected to be US$4.1 million, that of traders and other intermediaries
US$4.7 million equivalent. Expenditure    categories would be civil works
(US$1.5milli;a), structures (US$5.8 million), utilities (US$1 .1 million),
and equipment (US$0.4 million). The cost of training and project evalua-
tion would be about US$0.1 million. US$2.9 million equivalent are
physical and price contingencies. Cost estimates were prepared using
exchange rates in effect prior to the recent dollar devaluation. At
current exchange rates project cost expressed in terms of US$ would be
approximately 5 percent higher.
23.       The proposed credit would finance two-thirds of the project
cost, excluding land, covering the indirect foreign exchange cost and
about 55 percent of local cost. The balance of the project financing
would be contributed by the Market Committees (3 percent), market inter-
mediaries (13 percent), participating commercial banks (15 percent) and
the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) (2 percent). The IDA
credit to the Government of India, except for about US$80,000, would be
passed on to the ARC for up to 15 years at 5-3/4 percent interest. ARC
in turn would refinance up to 82 percent of loans made by participating
commercial banks to Market Committees and market intermediaries for up to
15 years at 6-1/2 percent interest. Loans by participating banks at 9
percent interest would cover up to 95 percent of the investment by
Market Committees and up to 75 percent of investment by market interme-



-7-
diaries. Loans by participating banks would be for terms up to 15 years
to Market Committees and up to 9 years to market interniediaries. Dis-
bursements from the IDA credit would cover 80 percent of sub-loan
disbursements by participating banks. Approximately US$80,000 of the
IDA credit would be passed on by the Government of India to the State
government to help finance the training cost and the cost of project
evaluation.
24.       ARC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India and is a
familiar lending channel for IDA assistance to the agr cultural sector in
India. ARC is a sound financial institution with experienced and quali-
fied staff.  There is ample proof for its capability in supervising, the
selection, sol-ndness and appraisal of sub-loans refinanced by it.  The
Canara Bank, State Bank of India, and the Syndicate Bank are expected to
be among the participating commercial banks. All three are financially
strong, well managed and experienced in agricultural lending in the State.
All are large banks whose operations extend well beyond the State of
Mysore. Each participating bank would enter into a specific refinance
agreement with ARC for the purposes of the project. The refinance agree-
ments would follow an agreed pattern and would be reviewed by the Asso-
ciation. Both participating banks and ARC should be able to cover over-
heads and risks out of the spread available to them. Other commercial
banks may also take part in the project.
25.       The markets to be developed differ greatly as to size, mix of
commodities iandled, and current stage of development; each market would
therefore, be designed according to its unique needs and following
schedules established by the beneficiaries at each site, i.e. the ,1IC and
the market intermediaries. Because of the diversity of the markets and
because the structures of simple brick and concrete construction would
differ in design, each market sub-project would require at least one
contract. In addition, construction of shops for market intermediaries
within each market would normally require additional works, for which
each shop owmer would make arrangements. Construction of project facili-
ties would be phased over four and one-half to five years. This means
that on average six to eight aICs contracts in this many market centers
would be let each year for a total value of US$1-1.5 million and ranging
fran about US$100,000 to USt400,0o0 per market. Bulking of such small
diverse and geographically dispersed contracts for international competi-
tive bidding would not be practical. Procurement would thus follow local
competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfac-tory0 Many local
contractors in Mysore can carry out the works. SMD would be responsible
for preparation of tender documents, detailed drawings, and construction
contracts and for supervising construction of works for the RMCs.
26.       Under the Marketing Act, Regulated Market Committees are
empowered to charge marketing fees to cover operating expenses and
provide funds for the expansion of market facilities; The fees levied
as a percentage of market arrivals, are presently subject to a ceiling of
0.3 percent which is inadequate to meet the cost of expansion and debt
service. Accordingly, the Marketing Act will be amended and permit
market fees to be charged up to 1 percent of the value of produce.



0
The participating Market Committees will .charge this fee and should be
finaancially v,Tiable.
27.       Financial returns to Regulated Mairket Corariittees have been
calculated for four typical. models representing markets of different
sizes requlrinig differing inveStMenUts e On the basis of a one percent
market fee the retuams vary from 36 to 1 8 percent. They are sensitive
to changes in product prices and volumes. We are satisfied, however,
that. Regulated h1arket Cormitteasshould be able to repay and service
their loans without undue difficulty0  The gross financial return to
market intermediaries on their investments ,as been estinated at about
18 percent; this shou-ld enable therr, to servrice and repa y loans in eight
years5 including a one year grace period.
28l       The project would provide a nmtu'ber of 'iitrqO'-ban.t economic and
Social benefEits. It would. facilitate nulnimplementat'ior^ of the Regulated
r!-rets Act and promote competitive marketirng thlereby promot'ing one of
the pr.incirpal agricultural development obJectives of bDoth the Central and
State governments      [ Malpractices would be mirnimized, w th resulting
benef-its to farmers. More farmers would be persuaded to uati±iize the
regulated markets where competition i.s 'reat,est and p-rodi c:er prices pro-
ba.bly highest. As a result, prices to fanrmers would pro'bably show an
overall increase with a resulting posit-iv-e supply reasponse. Trade would
be cond:ucted in better lai.d. out areas at less overall coste  It would
piermit the use of sale by tender -with resulting t.imTe sa-vig for users
It would also reduce: congestion, xmunicipal costss end product losses.
The project, would also assist in devrelplng irfriroloved grading and standards

C. P1OJECTS IlNl EXECUTION -
Ln No. 307    Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$1).5 million loan of
December 22, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan sas made in 1961 and the original closing date was
January 31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by
technical and managerial difficulties conn-:cted with the opening of new
collieries to supply IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with technical
consultants, has been providing constant supervision and progress is being
made in resolving the technical issues.   On the managerial side, the
Government of India announced on July 20, 1972, that it was takingf over
the management of IISCO for two year<.   The Governrment has assured us that
this action wrill not interfere with IISCO's obligation to the Bank. On
January 31, 1;73, US$2 million remained undisbursed of which about USQ`.25
million has been earmarked for equipment on order and technical services,
while USV.O.75 million may be cancelled by the closing date of December, 1973.
The Bank has approved some increase in the short-term indebtedness and reha-
bilitation program and has agreed in principle to a reduction in the Bank's
mortgage cover.
Ln No. 414    Sixth industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$48.3 rmillion loan of May 28, 19653 Closing
date: June 39, 1973
Ln No. 515    Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$2 .0 million loan of September 10, 1967;
Closing date:  Dece.mber 31, 1973
Ln lNo. 683   Eighth industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of

Closing date:  September 30, 197
Ln No. 789    Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of india
Prolect; US765.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of the
business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them.  They should be read in this sense and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

June 30, 1970, for 41I4-IN has been extended three times to June 30, 1973
and that for 515-IN twice, from Decemiber 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973. An
uncommitted balance of approximately US$0.8 million under this loan is to
be cancelled; Loan 683-IN has 'been fully committed as of December 31, 1972.
Commitments under Loan 789-IN are slightly ahead of schedule and disbursement
substantially ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89    Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966:
Closing date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of' the f'oreign ex-
change cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas iftver, to extend i rrigation in the Punjab and
RZajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has
been subject to some delays, is part ol' a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern riviers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled for deli-very over the
next 12-18 mionths. As a result, the original closing date oi' December 31,
1,972, has been postponed to December 31, 1973.
Ln No. 614    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation (TDC) is to assist
in the development of' seeds of high yielding varieties oI' crops. Project
performance has been satisf'actDry except for delays with respect to two major
components: (a) the expansion of the seed processing plant and (b) the land
levelling component of on-farm development works. 'With respect to (a) suitable
plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant and construction
of a new plant have been prepared and approved by the Association. Orders have
been placed for the equipment required for the former. With respect to the
latter, tenders for equipping the plant are being readvert i sed, since
earlier bidding had met with an inadequate response (no fully responsive bid
was obtained). With respect to (b), 23,,000 acres were expected to have been
levelled by the end of 1972 but in fact only 8,000 acres have been levelled.
This delay is mostly due to lack of' response by contractors for land levelling
due to uncertainti-es regarding the type of equiprnent which mrrust be procured
by TDC and lack of experience in large-scale land levelling. These problems
are being overcome through land levelling demonstrations under field conditions
in the project area and an agreement that contractors should be permitted to
purchase imported equipment of their choice for land levelling.
In No. 615    Telecommunications III: US$27.5 million loan of June 1.8,
1 969; Closing date: June 30, 1973
The project, which was f'inanced 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153-IN) was designed to assist in financing the
telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the F'ourth
Plan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three months
pri-or to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN has had to



ANNEX II
Page 5
be postponed from December 31, 1'72, to June 30, 1973. Although disburse-
irents have taken place broadly in line with the original schedule, there have
been delays in meeting project targets of about nine months for local exchange
ins tallations and up to two years for long distance network, resulting from
difficulties experienced by local f'actories and delivery delays of some key
items. IIn recent months the situation has improved, especially at the local
factories.
Cr No. 176    Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of F'ebruary 9,
19703 Closing date:  September 30, 1976
This project wLIl finance in part the construction of Kadana
Dam on the Mahi liver, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam,
and the resettlernent of inhabitants in the r eservoir area in the States of
Gujarat and Rajasthan. The project also included canalization, land levelli ng,
the construction of i'ield channels, drainage workd and roads, and a program
to support agricultural development. The project is likely to be completed
about tl.io years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the
prime contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to discharge
the contractor in October 1 971 and to undertake the work by department force
account. Since that time the Public Works Department has been making satis-
factory progress. The outlook for other comnponents of the project remains
satisfactory. As the delays in implementation have occurreo at the start of
the project, and also before major investments have been r;ade, both invest-
ment costs and benefits wIlil be deferred. Thus the effect of' these delays
upon the economic justification is not likely to be significant.

of June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
