FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Credit 2061-GH
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fifth Power Project
in Ghana, for which IDA approved a credit of US$40 million on August 29, 1989. The
Credit became effective on January 9, 1990.
The credit closed on December 31, 1996, three years after the original closing date
of December 1993. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement took place on April
28, 1997. Co-financing was provided by the Caisse Francaise de Developpement
Economique (CFD) of France and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
of the United Kingdom. A copy of the ICR was sent to the borrower and the co-
financiers for comment.
The ICR was prepared by Mark Segal, Team, leader of the Water, Urban, Energy
II (AFTU2) Infrastructure Family, Africa Region and reviewed by the Ghana country
team.
The ICR is based on material in the project files. The Borrower contributed to the
ICR by providing information and reports. Borrower's contribution is in Annex A.

Credit 2061-GH
PROPOSED OPERATIONAL PLAN
The Government of Ghana is undertaking a comprehensive power sector reform
programn, part of which is supported by the Thermal Power Project (Credit 2682-GH).
The main thrust of the reform is to unbundle the sector into separate market entities for
generation, transmission and distribution, invite competition into the generation business,
and open both generation and distribution to private sector participation. A power sector
tariff framework has been created to be consistent with this -structure. A new regulatory
framework and agency is to be established for regulating the non-competitive aspects of
the industry.
The specific plan for restructuring the distribution segment is firstly to convert
ECG (the electricity distribution utility) into a limited liability company (which has been
done), and then to restructure it into five geographic business units. This involves a
financial and managerial restructuring which the Bank will support under the Public
Enterprise Privatization Technical Assistance Project (PEPTA). Thereafter, it is the
Government of Ghana's intention to invite the private sector to operate them as
concessions, which would also include private investment in distribution system
expansion.
The combination of sector restructuring, new tariff regime, regulatory agency and
private concessions in the distribution business will help to sustain a commercially viable
service.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
IntroductioL
1.   The Fifth Power Project was part of a broad program of improving infrastructure to
support economic expansion and reforming public enterprises to deliver goods and
services more efficiently. In the power sector, the focus was on improving the capability
of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana to meet expected increases in power demand
efficiently and improve its commercial operations. IDA considered power development
in Ghana a high priority; at time of project appraisal in 1988, it had financed virtually all
power development in Ghana and had lent more to the power sector than to any other
sector in the country. Past project experience had emphasized the need to improve the
use of existing capacity before building new capacity. In support of this approach, Power
V was to concentrate on investments to improve and extend existing distribution system
capacity and overall sector performance.
EWoject bLectives
2.   The main objectives of Power V were to enhance ECG's capability to deliver a
technically and commercially viable supply of power to its customers and develop a long-
term power development strategy and electrification program. The objectives were
reasonable and supported IDA's strategy for economic development in Ghana. The
design of project components to implement the objectives was adequate.  These
components consisted of: the financing of capital expenditures for improving the
distribution system, related equipment and supplies, an institutional development
program for management reorganization and financiat restructuring, and plans for
distribution system expansion and electrification. The key project covenants concerned
monitoring progress in implementation of a performance agreement, annual reviews of
electricity strategy, the preparation of a program for improved revenue management and
financial indicators specifying the minimum rate of return on net revalued fixed assets,
debt/equity ratio, and investment limits to maintain the ECG's commercial viability.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.   The project partially met its objectives. It strengthened ECG's technical and
commercial capability and improved the reliability of power supply. However, ECG was
not able to comply fully with important financial covenants throughout the project's
implementation period (Part II, table 14). In some years, financial covenants were in



- iv -
compliance but in others they were not. Originally the project was to be effective over a
five year period (1989-93) corresponding to ECG's investment program. The original
closing date was December 31, 1993 (Part II, Table 3). IDA extended the closing date
three times to enable ECG to complete the project. The actual project cost was US$128.0
million slightly higher than the US$124 million estimated at appraisal (Part II, Table 8
A.). IDA disbursed US$42.8 million toward financing the project costs compared to the
US$ 40 million planned at appraisal. The actual cost of the project and the IDA credit
amount were higher than appraisal figures because of the devaluation of the US$ relative
to the SAR, the original currency of the credit. The key factors that helped the project
were ECG's good technical capability and the harmonious relationship between IDA and
the Borrower. The main factor external to the project which hindered its implementation
was the devaluation of the national currency (the cedi) which increased ECG's cost of
meeting foreign obligations. External factors which constrained project performance
were the long, bureaucratic approval process for contracts, delays in implementing tariff
increases, and inadequate control over customer arrears. Taking all of these factors into
account, the overall outcome of the project was satisfactory; IDA's performance was
satisfactory (para. 20) and the Borrower's performance was satisfactory for works, but
deficient for financial performance (para. 21).
Summary of Findings. Future Operations and Lessons Learned
4.   The project helped meet increased demand from existing customers and made
significant operational improvements in the areas of system control, protection and
reliability. Without this project, the country's power supply would not have been
technically sustainable1. However, adverse economic conditions and some deficiencies
in commercial operations prevented the project from fully achieving its financial
objectives. A power sector reform program, currently in progress, and related follow-up
power projects should help to sustain and enhance the project's institutional achievements
as well as improve ECG's capability to meet financial objectives. The main objective of
reform, which the Thermal Power Project (Credit 2682-GH) is supporting, is to separate
generation, transmission and distribution operations, and to promote competition and
private sector participation in their operation. This program is to be implemented
between now and 1999 (Operational Plan). The Thermal Power Project is also providing
additional thermal capacity as part of the least cost program to meet expected demand
growth (Part I, para. 19). In addition, the National Electrification Project (Credit 2467-
GH) is extending connection of outlying areas to the grid and helping to improve
commercial operations by consolidating these operations under one directorate and
managing them under a performance-based management contract. In May 1997, the
Government increased the tariffs; the expected average tariff yield should

1996, customers increased from about 350,000 to 500, 000).



be about 200% above that in effect before May 1997. Also, a working party is being
established to resolve ECG's indebtedness.   The key lessons learned in the
implementation of this project are the following:
(a) Efficient operation of a power company requires a supportive operating
environment and in the case of Ghana will require fundamental changes in the
power sector's structure and operations, including the introduction of
competition and private sector participation.
(b) Co-financing and related agreements, which are crucial to timely, efficient
project implementation, should be in place before the presentation of the
project to the Board.
(c) Improvements in procurement efficiency may involve actions outside the
scope of the project and even the sector, since many governments organize
their procurement operations centrally often with many bureaucratic
procedures, making it difficult to resolve procurement problems at the project
level.
(d) When problems related to tariffs, billings and collections are known at the
time of project preparation, these should be addressed up-front with direct
measures to resolve them; it is not sufficient only to rely on the covenants.
(e) In a highly inflationary environment, special measures are needed to maintain
tariffs at real levels of cost recovery, so as not to impair the utility's ability to
meet its obligations.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT

PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
L. INTRODUCTION
1     The Fifth Power Project (Power V) was part of major economic recovery and
expansion program, including public enterprise reform. The reform program had an
impact on the power sector in two ways. First, economic expansion led to increased
power demand and there was a need to rehabilitate the existing system and invest in new
capacity in order to meet this demand. Second, the reform program called for the
commercialization of Ghana's two key public utilities: the Volta River Authority (VRA)
and the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG). VRA was responsible for providing
bulk electricity to ECG, and a few other bulk electricity users. To meet power generation
needs during the 1990s, the investment program included the installation of 300 MW of
gas turbine capacity and the retrofitting of the Akosombo hydroplane. ECG also needed
to rehabilitate and expand its sub-transmission and distribution system . Also, a long-
term goal of the Government of Ghana (GOG ) was to provide most of the population
with electricity, over a thirty-year period, amongst other means by extending the
interconnected transmission grid to towns and villages, substituting hydro-power or other
energy for less reliable and more expensive isolated diesel-based power.
2.    At the time of project appraisal (July 1988), VRA was an autonomous, financially
viable company. In contrast, ECG was the successor of the Electricity Division of the
Ministry of Works and Housing. It had not successfully made the transition from
government department to corporate entity. Although a consultant study had
recommended merging both organizations for future power system development, GOG
and IDA believed that such a merger would constrain VRA's capabilities, without
necessarily solving the structural problems ECG was facing. Instead, GOG with the
support of IDA, decided to improve ECG's management and financial situation through
further commercialization of the power sector.
3.    Power V was an integral part of a detailed program to progressively strengthen
ECG. In 1988, the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB) was preparing a complete
diagnostic study of the company under the Power System Rehabilitation Project (Credit
1628-GH), then effective. The World Bank Group had been lending to Ghana's power
sector since 1961. Lending to the power sector (US$150 million ) had exceeded that of
lending to all other sectors and had helped finance virtually all of the country's major
power sector investments since its independence. Performance audits for past projects
had emphasized the need to fully utilize existing facilities before constructing capacity.



-2 -
The Bank's lending operations supported that approach. Power V was to continue
investments to improve existing system capacity, distribution, and overall sector
performance.
II. STATEMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Statement of Objectives and Components
4.    The main objectives of Power V were to: continue ongoing sector policy reforms,
which had begun under Credit 1628-GH, help improve the technical and commercial
efficiency of ECG, enhance ECG's capability to deliver a reliable, economic supply of
electricity to its customers, and assist GOG in developing a long-term power sector
development strategy and an electrification program. To implement these objectives, the
project had three major components: institutional development, support for ECG's
investment program, and formulation of a sector development strategy. The institutional
development program was to focus on completing the management reorganization and
financial restructuring. It also was to improve efficiency through a technical assistance
contract, staff reduction/training, continued technical assistance from ESB, and the
development of a computer-based management information system. The investment
component consisted of support for ECG's capital expenditures through 1993 on sub-
transmission, distribution, telecommunications equipment and works, vehicles, staff
housing, and working capital. The component for sector development strategy included
a national electrification planning study and a distribution and sub-transmission master
plan.
Achievement of Objectives
Overview
5.    Overall the project partially achieved its objectives (Part II, Table 1). While it
strengthened ECG's technical and commercial operations and improved the reliability of
electricity supply, the financial impact of these developments was disappointing. During
most of the project, ECG experienced financial problems due to inflation, currency
devaluation, insufficient tariff increases and inadequate billing and collection
performance. As a result, ECG was not able to comply with financial covenants designed
to make ECG financially viable.
Sector Reform and ECG Commercialization
6.   Improving Management and Operations.  The project helped to improve
operations, planning and financial control functions through facilities improvements and
studies. These led to the introduction of measures to enhance efficiency in the company's
various operating departments (Part II, Table 7). Operational improvements consisted of
an overhaul of control procedures relating to materials, vehicles, office equipment and



-3 -
civil works. A System Protection study examined ECG's approach to system protection
and define policy changes necessary for improvement. As a result of the study, ECG
created a Protection Division within its Operations Department. The computerization
master plan which the project produced helped ECG focus on priorities for
computerization; follow-up work will continue in the context of the current power sector
reform  program.  To improve financial operations, the project provided for a
computerized financial management system and upgrading of the asset register. The
project also identified ECG's short and medium term staffing requirements which ECG is
using as a basis for future planning.
7.    Meeting Financial Objectives. Despite greater commercialization of ECG's
operating systems and tariff increases, the company did not consistently meet most of the
financial objectives for rate-of return on assets, accounts receivable, and avoidance of
high capital expenditures outside the project (Part II, Table 10). The major constraining
factors were devaluation, inflation, problems in revenue collection and billing system
losses, which led to increased costs and under-recovery of potential sales revenues. Also
there were higher than expected demands on ECG for electrification works. Significant
tariff increases during the project did not compensate for the adverse impact of these
factors. During project implementation, ECG established a Revenue Management
Division, under the control of the Director of Finance, for the purpose of improving the
billing and collection process. Except for a computerized billing and payroll system,
ECG's accounting system was mainly manual, which made the production of reports time
consuming and subject to error. Therefore, in addition to upgrading the billing system,
the project included plans to develop a comprehensive Management Information System
(MIS).
Improvements in System Operations
8.    Satisfying Customer Demand. The main contribution of Power V was to meet
demand from existing customers and improve the quality of the service they received. At
project appraisal, demand projections covering the period 1989-94 indicated an increase
from 120 GWh to 153 GWh at an average annual growth rate of about five percent.
Instead, the rate of growth was closer to 9.5%, with demand increasing from 117 GWh to
184 GWh. In the time elapsed between the load surveys and start of construction system
needs grew more than expected, and suppressed demand exceeded the estimates in the
load surveys.
9.    Enhancing  System  Reliability.  The expansion and reinforcement of the
distribution system improved reliability, allowing the system to meet higher demand
levels from existing consumers and substantially reduce power outages. The project
completed a significant amount of distribution rehabilitation and expansion in several
major cities. This work consisted of 605 kilometers (km) of low-voltage lines, 349 km
of overhead and underground distribution lines, over 200 distribution substations along
with various substation and sub-transmission line improvements. The extension of grid
supply to some isolated locations not only has replaced less efficient local generation but



-4 -
has allowed a continuous supply of electricity where before supply was confined to
certain hours of the day. The planned improvement of ECG's telecommunication system
and SCADA system did not take place due to problems encountered between ECG and
the consultant during the design phase.  Also the amount of investment required to
improve the system was larger than originally anticipated and there were not enough
funds in the project to finance it.
10.   Reducing Losses. The rehabilitation of the sub-transmission and distribution
network has led to a substantial reduction in technical losses. However, at the same time
non-technical losses have increased. As a result there were times during the project when
total system losses actually increased and overall losses have remained fairly high, in the
range of 17-20 percent. In an effort to determine the cause of the non-technical losses,
ECG conducted a survey of the status of meters in Accra, and other locations. This
survey showed a significant number of un-metered premises and faulty meters. The
company decided to place control of meters with the project unit and made an effort to
coordinate this activity with the Customer and Data Processing directorates of the
company.
Long-Term Power Development
11.   The project supported the preparation of a master plan for the future development
of ECG's sub-transmission and distribution networks. This plan has recommended-
improvements to facilitate projected load growth over the next ten years. ECG is
reviewing the plan, including the validity of the assumptions made and the potential
impact of the proposals.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
Implementatio Record
12.   According to the SAR, the project was to be effective over a five-year period
(1989-93) corresponding to ECG's investment program in the sub-transmission and
distribution system. The original closing date of the project was December 1993 (Part II,
Table 3). The actual project cost was US$128.0 million equivalent compared to
US$124.8 million estimated at appraisal (Part II, Table 8A). Project financing
arrangements (Part II, Table 8B) remained as planned except that ECG and the
Government of Austria could not conclude a financial contract for US$10.5 million and
this portion was funded by CFD. An unspecified US$3.7 million was to cover the
telecom component of the SCADA system in Accra but did not materialize and IDA
transferred this component to Credit 2467-GH. IDA disbursements amounted to US$42:8
million, which, in US dollar terms, was slightly higher than the original credit amount
because of fluctuations between the values of the US dollar and the SDR, the currency of
the credit. (Part II, Table 4). The project's supervision reports indicated that during most
of the period implementation was satisfactory but there were problems in the areas of



- 5-
finance, management, and covenant compliance. (Part II, Tables 13 and 14). The project
experienced considerable delays resulting in IDA 's extension of the closing date three
times.
13.   The first extension of the closing date noted an 1 8-month delay due to difficulties
in completing agreements with other financiers, including lengthy bureaucratic
procedures in Ghana, and protracted negotiations with various financiers. IDA justified
the extension noting that ECG had overcome initial implementation difficulties and was
making good progress in project implementation, especially distribution works. These
works were important to service quality, technical loss reduction, and the provision of
capacity to meet suppressed demand. The extension also included a detailed action plan
which ECG had prepared to complete project components.
14.  IDA extended the closing date a second time, to December 31, 1995, because it
was evident that the activities included in the action plan could not be achieved by the
end of 1994. The justification for the extension was ECG's satisfactory progress in
implementing the action plan prepared for the first extension. However, the extension
request noted that it was likely that one additional year would not provide enough time to
complete the project's communication component.
15.   A third extension, to December 31, 1996 was necessary to complete additional
distribution works, the supply of distribution materials, the completion of a distribution
system master plan, and implementation of the customer billing system and training. The
completion of these components required a reallocation of remaining funds. IDA granted
the extension in the interest of maintaining the technical reliability of the power system,
in consideration of the importance of the work which remained to be done, and in light of
the progress being made in the power sector reform dialogue.
Mjor Factors Affecting Implementation
16.   Factors outside the control of the Implementing Agency (ECG). The main
factors external to ECG affecting project implementation were devaluation of the national
currency (cedi), which increased the cost of servicing ECG's foreign debt and inflation
which increased local costs of goods and services. Inflation and devaluation were less
severe before 1992 and relatively more so thereafter. To mitigate the adverse impact of
devaluation on ECG, the company's Board introduced two funds: (a) a debt contingency
fund to protect the company against short-term domestic currency fluctuations, which
operated by creating a reserve to meet foreign exchange obligations, and (b) an asset
replacement fund, which was to serve as a standby source of funds for financing critical
development projects in the case of financial distress. ECG was also required to meet
greater than expected demands for rural electrification.



- 6-
17.   Factors subject to control of the Borrower (GOG) and Implementing Agency
(ECG). ECG's good capability for executing the project's technical components and the
generally harmonious relationship between IDA and the Borrower were helpful to project
implementation performance. However, there were also several factors that contributed
to project implementation delays and constrained the project in meeting its financial
objectives.  First, the Borrower had a long, bureaucratic process for the approval of
contracts. Second, although GOG allowed substantial tariff increases several times during
the project, delays in implementing them diminished their real value and their
effectiveness toward improving ECG's financial situation. Although the tariff increases
helped to reduce financial losses they were not sufficient to offset inflation and currency
devaluation (paragraph 16) and to recover the economic cost of supply. Third, GOG and
ECG did not exercise adequate control over high levels of customer arrears, which
fluctuated during project implementation and were as high as five months, well beyond
the agreed 1.5 months limit in the project's legal agreements. The cross-debt cleaning
mechanism has failed to operate satisfactorily in 1995 and 1996 on account of ECG's
financial difficulties and periodic disagreement between the government and ECG
concerming the accuracy of electricity bills for government electricity consumption.
IV. PROJECT OUTCOME, SUSTAINABILITY, AND FUTURE OPERATIONS
18.   The project's outcome overall is satisfactory with respect to most of its technical
and institutional objectives. Without this project, Ghana's power supply would not have
been technically sustainable. Between 1991 and 1996, ECG met substantial load growth,
customers increasing from about 350,000 to 500,000. The National Electrification and
Thermal Power projects now being implemented, and in particular GOG's own
restructuring program, will further assist in sustaining these objectives. However, ECG
was unable to meet most financial objectives of Power V. The major benefits of the
project were to be improvements in the reliability and efficiency of power supplies. The
SAR quantified efficiency improvements by valuing the benefits of reduced technical
losses compared to the costs of investments required to reduce them. On that basis, the
SAR estimated an internal economic rate-of-return of 20 percent (Report No. 7405-GH of
July 1989, Annex 2-7) On this basis, the re-estimated IERR based on actual figures is 28
percent. The SAR adequately assessed the major risks which could delay efficiency
achievements. The presence of a strong technical assistance team was intended to
minimize these risks.
19.   Two ongoing projects are helping to further commercialize the sector, connect
new customers and expand generating capacity. The National Electrification Project
(NEP), approved in March 1993 and supported by an IDA Credit of US$80 million
(2467-GH), is designed to improve the existing network, connect new areas to the grid
and improve ECG's operational efficiency through institutional reforms. About 25
percent of the NEP is for reinforcement of ECG's network. To improve financial
performance, the project provides for the regrouping of all commercial services under one
directorate managed through a performance-based management contract. The second

project is the Thermal Power Project (Credit 2682-GH), approved in February 1995, and
supported with a Credit of US$175 million. This project is providing additional thermal
capacity as part of the least-cost program to meet demand growth. It also has an
important component for power sector reform, the objective of which is to support
GOG's program to improve power sector efficiency by introducing competition, private
sector participation and an appropriate regulatory mechanism. These measures should be
phased-in between now and 1999. In May 1997, the Government increased the electricity
tariff by about 200% and it is establishing a working party to resolve ECG's
indebtedness.
V. IDA PERFORMANCE
20.  IDA's performance overall was satisfactory. Its identification and appraisal of the
project adequately addressed the main sector issues at the time within the context of
IDA's assistance priorities for Ghana. During most of the project's implementation IDA
supervised two or three power projects at the same time. To improve results, IDA formed
a special power sector implementation review team which took a sector-wide approach in
project supervision. Supervision teams usually included a power engineer an economist
and a financial analyst. IDA showed considerable flexibility and commitment to the GOG
and ECG in providing three extensions of the project's closing date. ECG reported a
good working relationship with IDA and noted that a change in IDA's supervision team
toward the end of the project was smooth without any disruption to project
implementation. During most the project's implementation, IDA rated the overall status
of the project as "1" (minor problems), "2" (moderate problems) or "S" (satisfactory)
often while rating financial objectives, management, and compliance with covenants as
"3" (major problems). Based on this rating it appears that IDA, in assigning the overall
rating, was reflecting the progress in the process of commercialization rather than the
impact.
VI. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
21.   The performance of GOG and ECG was satisfactory overall. ECG performed well
in the tendering and bid evaluation process, however delays occurred mainly on account
of governmental approval procedures. ECG was successful in implementing the technical
and institutional components to establish a framework for commercially viable
operations. GOG raised power tariffs substantially in a difficult economic environment.
However, due to factors exogenous and endogenous to the project, ECG's financial
situation suffered and the company did not comply with most of the project financial
covenants (Part II, Table 14). The financial performance of ECG was better during the
original period of the project (1989-93) than during the period of project extension,
mainly because inflation and devaluation accelerated after 1992 as did demands for rural
electrification. Nevertheless IDA extended the credit because of the need to complete



-8 -
important components for maintaining the technical reliability of the power system.
Also, the extension occurred in the context of a policy reform dialogue addressing
fundamental financial and structural problems in the sector.
VII. MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED
22.   The major lessons learned in project implementation were the following:
(a) Promoting commercialization in an adverse structural environment. In
many IDA-financed power projects there is a tendency to rely on tariff
increases to make power companies viable; it is equally important to focus on
the more difficult process of identifying and implementing appropriate
measures to reduce costs and sustain efficiency. This is all the more important
when consumnption is growing rapidly because the utility is under great
pressure to expand service and tariffs are too low. At the outset of Power V,
the policy environment was not conducive to the introduction of major
structural reforms in the sector. GOG has recognized that efficient operation,
cost control and appropriate tarification requires a fundamental rethinking of
how the power sector is structured and operated, and has taken ownership of
this issue through a major program, which it is designing to restructure the
sector. This process is being supported in part by the Thermal Power Project.
(b) Performance management contract. The management contract for the
Commercial Services Directorate is a component of the NEP project.
However, the management of ECG's commercial activities by an external
contractor clearly influenced ECG's financial and commercial performance
during the last three years of this project. Important improvements were
achieved in the way the company is managing commercial operations. The
operator succeeded in substantially improving billing and collection results
but to date has not succeeded in adequately reducing non-technical losses.
Lessons learned from that experience will be developed in the completion
report of the NEP project. Among those, one could anticipate the following
two: (a) by limiting the transfer of management to commercial operations, the
operator's effective authority and control over other aspects of company
policy and operations affecting commercial operations is ambiguous; this
suggest the importance of ensuring that such contractors have sufficient
control over the variables which could influence their operational
effectiveness; (b) the specification of indicators to evaluate the performance of
the operator is very difficult due to inadequacies in the data available for
setting the initial conditions and measuring progress; it may be preferable, for
example, to remunerate the contractor solely on the basis of paid-up energy;
but to do so requires that the contractor has the kind of control suggested
immediately above.



- 9-
(c) Structuring co-financing arrangements. In projects with a large number of
co-financiers, the likelihood of delays in reaching agreements increases.
Securing co-financing and related agreements is an important part of project
implementation, hence these agreements should be in place before Board
presentation.
(d) Streamlining the procurement process. The project experience indicated
that it is difficult to resolve procurement problems within the context of a
particular sector alone. Since other government agencies are involved across
many sectors, it is important to press for an overall solution. In the case of
Power V, this approach helped to improve procurement efficiency.
(e) Utility Finances. When problems related to tariffs, billings and collections
are known at the time of project preparation, these should be addressed with
direct measures to resolve them: it is not sufficient only to rely on the
covenants. As well, in a highly inflationary environment special measures are
needed to maintain tariffs at real levels of cost recovery, so as not to impair
the utility's ability to meet it obligations.

Annex B
World Bank Energy Sector Mission of February 1997
Aide-Memoire
Introduton.;
A World Bank power sector mission visited Ghana over February 3 to February 17, 1997 to
review the progress of the National Electrification, Power VI, and Thermal Power projects
and the ICR of the Power V project. Team members included M. Segal (Task Team Leader),
M. Ashouripour, N. Bouzaher, C. Hdry, D. Kianpour and S. Mikhail. K-B. Agyen
accompanied the mission. The mission thanks the staff of MOME, VRA, ECG and their
consultants for their warm welcome and assistance in the work of the mission.
1.    Electricity Tariffs and Financial Performance of the Power Sector:
1.1    MOME presented a tariff requirements analysis for 1997 indicating that in order to
fully comply with IDA financial covenants, VRA would require a tariff yielding average
revenue from BST sales of approximately 48 cedis and ECG approximately 112 cedis per
kWh, both collected over a tweleve month period effective 1/1/97. These tariffs would not
provide sufficient revenue for ECG to pay its arrears to the CDCH related both to purchases
of electricity from VRA and debt service. The mission noted that Ghana's "added-value"
approach to tariff specification is acceptable to IDA for purposes of the power sector's
financial covenants provided that it yields sufficient tariff revenue to meet the covenants. The
"LRMC covenant" of the NEP was superceded by the financial covenants of the Thermal
Power Project.
1.2    MOME staff explained the process by which adjustment of the tariff could occur in
the very near future, but that circumstances surrounding the parliamentary process made it
impossible to secure a firm timetable for implementation at this very moment. MOME
committed to do the utmost to secure the tariff increase required for ECG and VRA to meet
their financial covenants with IDA for 1997 as quickly as possible, but noted that it lacks
control over the parliamentary process. MOME also explained that measures were being
contemplated for working-out ECG's arrears and to prevent re-occurence of same.
1.3    The mission explained that GOG is non-compliant with financial covenants in IDA
credits largely due to the absence of tariff increases in January 1996 and January 1997. In
light of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the power sector (sections 1.4 to 1.6), the
Bank's rating of the porfolio's performance will be downgraded to <unsatisfactory> unless
an adequate tariff were implemented by the latest May 1, 1997 and by the same date GOG
presented a programme satisfactory to IDA for settling ECG's arrears to VRA. An adequate
tariff is that tariff which IDA expects will yield sufficient revenue during its period of
effectiveness in 1997 for ECG and VRA to meet their financial covenants with IDA for 1997.
The mission notes that the later the tariff increase is implemented, the higher the increase
will need to be. The main consequences of downgrading the portfolio performance to
<unsatisfactory> are that no new projects in this sector may be presented to the Board of IDA
until the rating can change to <satisfactory> and IDA may suspend disbursements under
existing credits.
ECG's Financial Performance
1.4    ECG's 1996 financial results are unsatisfactory, with an expected loss of about Cedi
30 billion and RoR on ANFA of minus 4.8%. This is the result of inadequate tariffs



combined with high growth of distribution investment, connections and load. In 1996 total
expenditures exceeded electricity revenues by more than 21 percent. These results are
unaffected by the billing:collection ratio. Accounts receivable are estimated to be 148 days
by end 1996 (cedi 41.3 billion at end-November 1996), while the covenant is for 90 days.
(ECG and MOME may approach the Bank with a case for revising this covenant, which the
Bank would consider.) The operating ratio was 1.1. Since early 1995 ECG has not paid in full
for its electricity purchases from VRA. By end 1996, ECG owed through the CDCH Cedi 52
billion to VRA and 31 billion in debt service arrears.
VRA's Financial Performance
1.5    Unaudited end-1996 results show a net profit of Cedi 24.5 billion. However, VRA is
expected to earn less than 5% RoR on ANFA (relative to a covenant of 8%), due to greater
than expected Cedi devaluation, which caused VRA's foreign exchange costs and
depreciation expense to increase more than tolerable on a 23 cedi BST. VRA is expected to
be in compliance with all other financial covenants with IDA in 1996.
1.6   Looking forward into this year, VRA requires settlement of ECG's arrears and
adequate tariffs to cover its growing debt-service requirements, costs of imported energy, and
forthcoming fuel bill for the Takoradi thermal plant.
2.    Power Sector Reform:
2.1    The mission noted the satisfactory progress on the design of power sector reform,
including the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution, development of added-
value tariffs, design of distribution system zones and an approach to power sector regulation,
covering tariffs, service and technical standards, and the granting of licences and
concessions. The PSRC Chairman stated that the PSRC will deliver its final report to the
Government by mid-March, whereafter the Government will decide upon implementation,
including the timetable for implementation. The mission encourages GOG to complete the
design work and proceed with implementation over 1997, and within the same time period to
prepare for the participation of the private sector in electricity generation and in the
distribution zones.
2.2    MOME indicated to the mission the areas (ref. Section 2.1 above) in which timely
on-going support from IDA would be appreciated for completing the arrangements and
implementing the reform process. The mission indicated IDA's willingness to continue its
support to this programme, and in this respect emphasized the importance of MOME keeping
IDA adequately informed in a timely manner about design and implementation of the
reforms.
3.    Distribution Sub-Sector:
3.1    National Electrification Project:
3.1.1. Data: ECG commissioned studies to assess the penetration rate and customer
profiles in newly electrified areas. A synthesis of these studies and projections of the number
of consumers to be connected through the NEP will be communicated to IDA.



3.1.2. Investments: After discussing with ECG and MOME the possible implications of
power sector restructuring on NEP investments, the mission recommends that:
a) the procurement of equipment necessary for project implementation should
proceed within the limit of funds available under the credit; however, variation
orders for goods and works and sole-sourcing of consultants will be approved
only on an exceptional, well-justified basis;
b) studies and investments for the ECG information system likely to be affected by
restructuring (i.e. the training program, the telecommunications studies and
investment, the computerization master plan and the extension of the CBIS
system) should be reviewed for their appropriateness in a restructured sector;
c) the installation of prepayment meters in the ECG and NED area should proceed
within the limit of funds available under the credit; each utility should submit to
the Bank an action plan including marketing strategy, specifications,
procurement arrangements and benefit:cost profile.
3.1.3. ECG Component - Progress of Works:      Nearly all the equipment and
material has been delivered. Installation is hampered by a severe shortage of poles in both
rural and urban areas. Unless a solution is found to this problem the project may experience
loss of material and equipment and cost overruns. While the Bank team will assess whether
there is any possibility of accelerating the procurement process by recourse to LCB, the
mission recommends that ECG prepare to acquire the necessary number of poles through
ICB within funds available under the IDA Credit. ECG's poor financial condition makes it
difficult to sustain the expected level of installation work because of the unavailability of
counterpart funds. This constraint would be relaxed by the acquisition of poles through IDA
funding.
3.1.4. Performance Evaluation of the Customer Services Directorate: ECG has
completed a mid-term review of the Customer Service Directorate under contract to the
consortium of EDF/SAUR. The following main observations emerged from discussion of this
report with ECG and their consultant:
a) the development of systems and infrastructure has been largely achieved;
b) the development of local capability to sustain the Directorate beyond the contract
period may be less satisfactory;
c) reliable performance measurements and benefit:cost assessments are difficult to
achieve due to errors in the data and in the parameters used for setting the initial
conditions; as well, there are alternative ways of conceptualizing benefits, and it
was agreed that the consultant would show the results using several approaches.
3.1.5. Recent Status: For June:December 1996 the collection:billing ratio has approached
100%; however, at 18.9% losses remain higher than targeted. The CBIS for five regions
(including Accra East and West) are operational. Three regions (Volta, Eastern, and Central)
remain to be added to the CBIS. ECG will explore the mission's suggestion of integrating
them into the larger CBIS, rather than investing about $306,000 in other hardware and
software.
3.1.6. Near Term Prospects: The 1997 action plan contains targets to improve commercial
performance, including losses of 17% and a collection:billing ratio greater than 100%. There
is special emphasis on capacity-building. A decision is required about whether to extend the
consortium into its fourth year.



3.1.7. Training: In light of recent sectoral developments, the mission emphasized to ECG
the importance of comprehensive training and capacity building programs to develop new
skills relevant to a restructured environment. The mission suggested the need to review and
amend as appropriate ECG's current training program. ECG agreed to inform IDA of the
result of this review as soon as possible.
3.1.8. Management Information Systems: In light of the impending restructuring of the
distribution sub-sector and the Power Sector Reform Committee's interest in adapting and
improving information systems to serve the new structures, the mission undertook an
assessment of the current information systems in ECG and reviewed with MOME, ECG and
TRESP consultants the latter's forthcoming work program in this area. The mission found
that:
a) at present all computer activities are in the Customer Services Department;
b) there are five Divisions handling computer-related activities, these being: Billing
Process and Revenue, Organization and MIS, Metering and Technical Services,
Commercial Data Processing, and Sales and Marketing;
c) a major shortcoming of the present system is that there are two separate systems
providing information simultaneously to the institution: the WANG system,
introduced in 1985, and the IBM from 1995, the latter to provide management
and customer information more accurately and efficiently;
d) the present computer system does not include major components such as MIS,
maintenance and safety, inventory control, and sales and marketing information;
hence some system losses are due to inadequacies of the system; as well the
present hardware would not be adequate for ECG's future business needs;
e) the operating software and relavent program codes are under control of ESBI;
ECG should have access to main program codes in order to adapt them to ECG's
business needs;
f) the information provided by the WANG system cannot be archived, hence the
Sales & Marketing Division which relies on historical data, often cannot produce
accurate analyses; also there are no accurate documents available on mapping of
the regions;
g) having reviewed ECG's computerization Master Plan, the missions suggests that
(i) the proposed system is costly to implement and needs to be revamped; (ii)
training issues are not fully addressed; and (iii) it is necessary to specify the role
of ECG staff in all stages of implementation and operation;
h) the computer programs which facilitate the work of the engineering departnent
are well written and well maintained; however, they reside on one PC with no
back up mechanism to secure the data and programs; in case of data loss, several
man months of work will be lost, and it would be costly and time consuming to
rebuild the lost data accurately and efficiently; back-up measures are
recommended.
3.1.9. VRA Component: Progress of Works: Work is proceeding satisfactorily. The
necessary wooden poles were ordered far in advance and metallic towers have been used to
design the overhead-lines at the MV level. Having received and reviewed the necessary
justification, the mission will clear variation orders for the electrification of Acherensua,
Botokrom and Gambaga after return to Washington.



3.2   Power V ICR:
3.2.1. The mission provided ECG and MOME with copies of the Bank guidelines for ICRs,
commented on ECG's draft of the ECG contribution and requested of ECG and MOME data
on costs and rate of return required for the report. The mission emphasized the importance of
receiving the ECG and MOME contributions within the next month.
4.    Generation Sub-Sector:
4.1    Sixth Power Proiect (Credit 2109-GH):
4.1.1  The credit was to finance the retrofitting of Akosombo hydro-electric plant,
including refurbishment of the turbine runners. Based on the results of retrofitting the first
unit, VRA decided that the turbine runners should be replaced rather than refurbished. The
procedure for implementing the runner replacement is to award contracts for competitive
runner design and model testing, then to select the most cost-effective option, manufacture
and install the new runners. The current project schedule calls for award of contract for
competitive model tests by August 1, 1997 and award of contract for replacement runners by
May 1, 1998. The mission recommends a more compressed schedule of July 1, 1997 and
March 1, 1998 respectively. (The manufacturing and installation process would be completed
by October/December 2003.)
4.1.2. The project includes two other components which are not financed under the Credit
and are not completed:
1) construction of the second bulk power supply point in Accra: VRA has prepared
the preliminary engineering and financing is being sought, estimated at $20
million (of which VRA's share would be about $7 million and ECG's $13
million);
2) interconnection with Burkina Faso: a meeting is scheduled for February 20, 1997
between AfDB, VRA and SONABEL to complete their comments on the draft
feasibility study prepared by TRACTEBEL.
4.1.3. The original credit amount of SDR 15.2 million has an undisbursed balance of SDR
10.9 million. The credit was extended to June 1998 to accommodate financing of the
competitive model testing (likely to cost in the range of two to three million dollars). The
runner replacement and the remaining retrofit work is estimated to cost about 40 million
dollars, financing for which remains to be arranged. Award of contract for this phase of the
work is expected for early 1998, by which time financing should be in place.
4.2   Thermal Power Project (2682-GH):
4.2.1. Construction of the Takoradi power plant is apparantly behind schedule. Unit 1,
expected to be in service by July 15, 1997 may be delayed by one month. However, the site
engineer, General Electric, confirms that Unit I will be in service by the expected in-service
date. Major steps will have to take place, including around-the-clock work on TK- 1 for this
schedule to be met. An eighteen hour work day is scheduled to begin on February 17. Close
monitoring is required to insure that the July 15 in-service date will be met. Unit 2 is
scheduled for in-service date of September 15, 1997.



4.2.2. The gas turbines are at the port of Takoradi and will be sent to the site next week.
One bridge had to be reinforced to accommodate the heavy load.
5.    Demand Management
5.1    MOME presented a report of activities from 1994 to end-January 1997, and
discussed on-going and forthcoming initiatives with MOME staff, as follows:
a) MOME presented to IDA, along with a request for financing: (i) the terms of reference of
the feasibility study for the establishment of electric motor service centers (the objective
is to facilitate private sector involvement in demand management, and (ii) the
amendement to the Dekkon contract.
b) MOME will prepare and send to IDA the terms of reference and request for financing for
the study of the socio-economic strategy to encourage the productive uses of electricity
in domestic, agricultural, industrial and commercial activities.
c) MOME gave the mission a copy of the contract concluded between MOME and NIFES
consultants of the U.K. In order to expedite disbursements, the contract was sent to
Washington via special courrier.
d) MOME will keep IDA regularly informed on the progress of the demand management
component and on the results achieved.
