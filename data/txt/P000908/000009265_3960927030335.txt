ORANDUN AND RoCrUHENDA?ION oF E  PT ESIDENT
OF TNC INTRANTIONAL DEMRLOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO   E ECUTIE DIa0COS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TME REPUBLIC OF GCUNA
FOR AN ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GhUNA
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit of SDR 30.3
million to the Republic of Ghana is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and would
help finance improvements to the electricity distribution system and
strengthening of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG). The project
would be cofinanced by the Governments of Austria and the United Kingdom,
by the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, France and by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation, U.K.
2.       Background.  Ghana's total public electric generation capacity is
1,122 KW of which 952 is from hydroelectric stations on the Volta River,
owned and operated by the Volta River Authority (VRA). VRA sells
electricity to ECG, the Volta Altuminum Co. and the mining companies,
exports to Togo, Benin and C8te d' Ivoire, and also distributes power in
n.rthern Ghana. Under the Northern Grid Extension Project (Credit
1759-GH), of February 1987, VRA's high voltage transmission system is being
extended to cover urban centers in northern Ghana and replace the present
isolated diesel stations. ECG distributes the purchased power within an
interconnected grid in the southern part of Ghana. Vhile VRA is a well-run
public utility, ECG has been poorly managed, overstaffed and is financially
weak. These problems, combined with a lack of foreign exchange, have
resulted in an inefficient and poor quality electricity supply in recent
years. An ongoing Power System Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1628-GH) of
October 1985 is assisting Ghana to introduce sector policy changes, to
rehabilitate ECG's distribution network and improve its
financiallmanagerial performance. The project is proceeding ahead of
schedule and additienal funding is now needed to maintain the momentum of
the reform program.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's continued association with
the sector would complement our efforts under the public enterprise and
economic reform programs. It would secure the full implementation of the
policy changes needed to establish ECG as an autonomous and accountable
power utility. IDA involvement would ensure orderly and timely sector
development, based on a sound long-term strategy, and would assist
Government to obtain appropriate financing for priority sector investments.
4.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project would continue the
ongoing sector policy reforms started under the above projezts, so as to
help establish ECG as a commercially-oriented entity, capable of delivering
a reliable and economic supply of electricity to its customers. The
project would also assist the Government to develop a comprehensive sector
development strategy and long-term electrification program.



-2-
5.       Prolect Descrition.  The project would comprice institutional
development, investment, and sector planning components. Institutional
development would focus on the conmercialization of ECG through: {i)
completion of the management reorganizations (ii) financial restructuring;
(iii) a performance 'contract' with 000 to Improve ECG's efficiency as a
power utility, comprising performance targets for the period through 1992
and incentives to reward Improved productivity; (iv) a manpower reduction
(about 202 of the labor force), staff development and training program; and
(v) a program of technical assistance from a mature power utility. The
investment would consist oft ti) EGG's total capital expenditure through
1993, comprising subtransmission, distribution and telecouwaunications
equipment, tools and materials, vehicles, and staff housing. A sector
development strategy would be formulated through studies of long-term
subtransmission and distribution expansion needs.
6.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$117.7 million
equivalent, excluding interest during construction, with a foreign exchange
component of US$97.0 million (821 of total cost). Project costs and a
financing plan are set out in Schedule A. Project procurement arrangements
and IDA Credit disbursements are set out in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana
are set out in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the major
power sector Lstallations and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 7405-GH dated
July 19, 1989 are attached.
7.       Areed Actions.  Goveroment has demonstrated its determination to
improve sector efficiency in the past two years. ECG has been reorganized
and its management strengthened. Key sector financial objectives have been
agreed with IDA, and ECG and VRA introduced new tariffs in 1988, based on
long-run marginal cost principles, which will improve the sector's
financial position. While ECG's revenue collection performance has
improved, much more needs to be done in the area of billing and collection
to improve ECG's liquidity. Six critical targets to improve ECG's
efficiency (saleslrevenues, collections, system losses, manpower reduction,
service quality and system expansion) have been identified for the period
through 1992, together with staff incentives for improved productivity.
These would be incorporated in a performance contract between ECG and
Government. Through a manpower plan, ECG has identified both a surplus of
about 820 (221 of its labor force) mainly unskilled staff and a shortage of
skills in key areas, where technical assistance is required while local
staff are recruited and trained. A program has been established to remove
the surplus staff by end-1990 and appropriate provision for compensation
made in ECG's 1989 budget. Affected staff would also be assisted in
redeployment. ECG would continue to use the services of the Electricity
Supply Board of Ireland (ESB), under an existing twinning arrangement, for
technical assistance and staff development and training. Terms of
reference for a National Electrification Study have been agreed with IDA,
and suitably experienced consultants identified.
8.       In order to improve ECO's financial viability, its capital has
been restructured. For many years EGC was unable to service its debt to
Government and, more recently, to pay VRA's bills for purchased power. The
problem of debt servicing has been seriously exacerbated since 1983 by the



-3-
major cedi devaluations. Government has converted to equity all overdue
debt under expired subsidiary loan agreements. This has reduced ECG's
debt/equity ratio from about 70/30 to about 50150 and improved ECG's
capacity to service current and proposed loan obligations.  Government has
also established a  clearing house  scheme to settle current public sector
obligations for electricity and water and has resolved the substantial past
mutual indebtedness of the respective agencies and itself.
9.       During negotiations, agreements were reached with regard to --
onlending terms of the IDA credit; minimum earnings (a rate of return on
currently valued fixed assets of 62 in 1989, 7Z in 1990 and 82 from 1991
onwards) and debt service coverage (1.5 times) to ensure ECG's future
financial viability; ECG's performance contract, including arrangements to
monitor and review agreed performance targets; the adoption of economic and
financial criteria for future electrification schemes; and, with specified
ongoing exceptions, ECG not incurring any non-project capital investment in
excess of US$2 million equivalent annually, without IDA consultation. A
program to improve ECG's revenue management would be submitted to IDA by
September 30, 1989.
10.      A firm project financing plan has been agreed and satisfactory
project management arrangements are in place, along with the key
appointments of Director of Finance, Accra Subtransmission Manager and
Revenue Manager. The signing of the Performance Contract and the   -:
Subsidiary Loan Agreement, and the effectiveness of the CDC Loan Agreement
and the U.K. ATP Grant Agreement would be special conditions of
effectiveness.
11.      8emefits. An adequate supply of reliable electricity is essential
to sustain Ghana's economic recovery and to provide better value-for-money
to customers facing higher electricity bills. Funding for the ongoing
sector reforms, coumercialization of ECG and rehabilitation of its system
is now fully exhausted. The proposed project is essential to avoid any
interruption to the present program and to begin to expand ECG's
distribution system to new urban areas in southern Ghana and take advantage
of VRA's present capacity to supply power to the domestic market. The
proposed project complements similar efforts by VRA in northern Ghana to
provide a more reliable and economical electricity supply. The proposed
project is based upon the least-cost investment program (1989-93) required
to achieve the above objectives. The internal economic rate of return,
based upon existing tariffs, is estimated at 202, which is satisfactory.
12.      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed
project. The major risks relate to possible project delays and to the
achievement by ECG of its plans to improve efficiency. However, Government
is fully committed to strengthening the power sector and the presence of a
strong technical assistance should minimize such risks. Furthermore, ECG's
new management team is fully aware of the need to re-establish the
credibility of ECG in the eyes of the public.
