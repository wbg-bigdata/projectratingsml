POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               People's Republic of Bangladesh
Beneficiary:            Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
Amount:                 SDR 52.3 million (US$56.0 million)
Terms:                  Standard
Relending Terms:        The proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Bangladesh
Power Development Board (BPDB) at a rate of 11.5% per annum for
a period of 20 years, including a grace period of five years.
BPDB would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:   The project's main objectives would be to expand and reinforce
the transmission and distribution system of BPDB to meet
forecast demand at least cost; to stablilize system voltage; to
increase system reliability; to reduce power losses in trans-
mission and distribution; and to strengthen BPDB's financial
operations. The project would compromise erection of 582 km
(kilometers) of 132-kY (kilovolt) lines; extension of
low-voltage distribution networks in fourteen towns; installa-
tion of meters and metering equipment; and technical assistance
to BPDB.
Risks:                  The project is straightforward, and project risks are limited.
A possible cause of slippage would be delays in procurement.
Appointment of consuLtants to assist BPDB in preparing designs
and bidding documents and in construction supervision would
minimize this risk. BPDB's financial performance needs to be
improved and the excessive system losses reduced. Without
improvements in these areas the planned expansion of the power
network and the institution building objectives of the project
would be placed at risk. In order to address these issues, the
project would include (i} a program to reduce system losses,
both on an interim and longer term basis, and (ii) the estab-
lishment of specific short-term financial goals for BPDB and
the development of longer term performance goals based on a
long-run marginal cost based tariff study.

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview of Energy Resources
1.01    Bangladesh's principal commercially exploitable energy resources
consist of large deposits of natural gas and a small hydropower potential.
In addition there are some potential peat and coal resources; however, at
present their development would be uneconomic. Traditional fuels, such as
crop residues, animal dung and wood, supply about 60Z of energy consumption.
Natural Gas
1.02    Natural gas is the main commercial energy resource, accounting for
over 50Z of commercial energy supply. One offshore and twelve onshore fields
have been discovered and seven fields were in production in December 1985.
All onshore fields are located on the eastern side of the Brahmaputra/Jamuna
River, which runs across the country from north to south. The production of
natural gas increased rapidly during the period 1975-1984, from about 80
MKCFD to 250 MNCFD (1,800 to 5,700 TOE/day). Twenty-two wells were in opera-
tion at the end of 1985, with a total production capacity of about 600 MMCFD
(13,700 TOE/day). Gas-in-place is estimated to be aboit 11 TCF (250 million
TOE), however, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and United Nations Develop-
ment Program (UNDP) financed Bangladesh Energy Planning Project (BEPP)
estimated that there is a 50X probability that undiscovered gas reserves are
in the range 12-20 TCF (275 to 460 million TOE). Uncertainty regarding the
level of existing reserves makes it impossible for GOB to formulate a
long-term development strategy for the subsector. Therefore, there is a need
to initiate a professionally-designed appraisal program to assess reserves.
As a first step, detailed high- resolution seismic surveys of the major gas
fields are being undertaken as a part of the IDA-financed Petroleum Explora-
tion Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD) to firm up the reservcir structure
maps, provide a basis for locating future wells to be drilled and assist in
identifying gas-water contacts. A critical follow-up would be a program of
appraisal drilling which is now being addressed under the IDA Second Gas
Development Project (Credit 1586-BD).
Oil
1.03    To date no commercial reserves of oil have been discovered.  The
IDA-financed Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD) is
intended to revive the interest and engender the participation of foreign
investors in petroleum exploration in Bangladesh. This includes, besides



-2-
the aforesaid seismic surveys (para 1.02), establishment of a data processing
center, preparing a hydrocarbon habitat study, and strengthening the
capabilities of the national oil and gas corporation, Petrobangla. In addi-
tion GOB is conducting other seismic works covering most of the western zone
in order to identify promising structures.
Hydropower
1.04    Bangladesh's hydropower potential is limited because its large
rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra/Jamuna, flow over a flat deltaic area.
The hydropower potential is estimated to be about 1,500 GWh/year, of which
850 GWh/year has been developed. All of the existing development is on the
Karnafuli river at Kaptai, where the installed capacity is 130 MW. The
construction of a second power house, financed by OECF (Japan), was started
in 1984 and two 50 MW units are scheduled to be commissioned in December
1987.  Provioion has been made for a subsequent extension to house two addi-
tional 50 MW units.  When completed, the Kaptai project will have a total
installed capacity of 330 MW and a generating capability of about 1,050
CGZnlyear. Two other prospective hydro sites have been investigated in the
same area: (a) Sangu, where about 300 GWh/year could be generaced from a
150 KW peaking plant working under a maximum head of 45 meters; and
(b) Matamuhari, where a peaking plant of about 100 MW operating under a head
of 40 meters could generate about 200 GWh/year. The development of these
schemes would require the relocation of about 30,000 people, consequently no
detailed engineering studies of these schemes have been undertaken to date.
Coal and Peat
1.05     Good quality coal with a heat value of about 6,200 kcal/kg exists
in north western Bangladesh, at Jamalganj, with total deposits estimated at
700 million tons. The deposits are at a depth of 650 to 1,050 meters under
soft water-bearing strata and their extraction would require sophisticated
and costly soil-freezing techniques. Production costs have been estimated
to be about US$150/ton (mid-1983 prices), which is considerably higher than
the cost of imported coal. Good deposits of peat are known to exist in the
Faridpur and Khulna districts. The Faridpur reserves are believed to be
sufficient to fuel a 200 MW thermal plant for 40 years at a 50% load factor.
The Bangladesh Energy Planning Project has reported that a 30 MW pilot plant
consuming about 200,000 tonnes of peat a year is under consideration by
Bangladesh Power Development Power Board (BPDB).
Renewable Energy Resources
1.06     Traditional fuels play a crucial role in Bangladesh's energy sector,
supplying about 60% of total energy requirements. Wood is one of its major
renewable energy resources, but its usage is believed to be in excess of its
sustainable yield. It has been estimated that tree biomass, such as stem
wood, branches, and other tree fuels, contribute between 50% and 60% of total
household energy requirements. Animal dung and agricultural wastes supply
the remaining domestic energy requirements. According to the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics the amount of energy supplied by traditional fuels in
the unorganized sector increased by less than 1% a year between 1976 and



-.3-
1982.  During the same period commercial energy supply increased  ,y about
6Z a year.
1.07      Urgent action is required to increase Euelwood production, improve
the recovery of forestry wastes for charcoal production, improve the
efficiency of traditional stoves and investigate the use of non-conventional
forms of renewable energy. GOB policy is to increase the availability of new
and renewable energy resources, with the emphasis on fuelvood (through com-
munity and homesteed afforestation) and the promotion of non-conventional
energy resources. IDA is assisting the implementation of this poLicy through
the Mangrove Afforestation Project (Credit 1042-BD). In addition, the ongo-
ing Bangladesh Energy Planning Project is to formulate a set of recommenda-
tions to help stabilize the dwindling base of traditional energy in the face
of rising demand.
B. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.08      Responsibility for energy policies 2nd programs in Bangladesh is
dispersed over a number of agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources has overall responsibility for commercial energy.  Operational
responsibilities are vested in a range of public sector entities responsible
for comiercial energy supplies. Bangladesh Oil and Cas Corporation
(Petrobangla) and its subsidiary organizations are responsible for oil and
natural gas exploration and production, and distribution of natural gas.
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is responsible for imports of crude
oil, refining and marketing of petroleum products. BPDB is responsible for
generation and transmission of electric power, and its distribution except in
those rural areas served by the Rural Electrification Board (REB). REB was
created in 1977 to take over the distribution of electricity in rural areas
through a system of cooperatives, referred to as Palli Bidyut Samities
(PBSs). By mid-1984, 17 cooperatives, serving about 110,000 connections 1/
had been partially energized and another 16 cooperatives are being developed.
At present there is no institutional structure for the coordination of
activities in the non-commercial energy sector. Various government agencies,
including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Local Covernment,
Rural Development and Cooperatives, are responsible for non-commercial
energy. The issue of coordination is being reviewed under the ongoing
Bangladesh Energy Planning Project (BEPP). The draft final report of the
BEPP was forwarded to IDA in August 1985.
1.09      The Planning Commission, which is responsible for macroeconomic
planning and produces the Five-Year Plans and Annual Development Plans
(ADPs), is also responsible for the preparation of the master plan for
energy. An Energy Study and Planning Cell (ESPC) has been established within
the Planning Commission to formulate this plan through the ADB/UNDP financed
BEPP.
1/ On average each domestic connection serves about 2.5 households, and thus
the 110,000 connections provide supply to about 237,000 consumers.

C. Energy Consumption
1.10      Bangladesh's per capita consumption of commercial energy is about
36 kg of oil equivalent per annum, about 872 lower than the population
weighted average for all low-income countries. Total per capita consumption
of energy is about 90 kg of oil equivalent per annum, about 60X of which is
supplied by traditional energy resources. The level of energy use is very
low, and thus there is high potential for increased energy demand.  Between
1976 and 1983, commercial energy consumption grew at about 5.82 per annum,
while traditional energy showed relative stagnation, increasing at less than
1l  per annum.  In FY84, comercial energy consumption was about 3.4 million
tons oil equivalent, of which imported fuels, petroleum and coal, accounted
for 37Z and SZ respectively, natural gas 522, and hydropower 6Z. Consumption
of natural gas, which accounts for about two-thirds of electricity gener-
ation, increased at 13.5Z per annum between 1975 and 1984.
D. Energy Pricing
1.11    The prices of traditional fuels are determined in the market place,
while the prices of petroleum products, natural gas, coal and electricity are
set by the Covernment. For each class of consumers the prices of commercial
energy products are uniform throughout the country, with the exception of
eLectricity supplied by PISs. Each PBS sets ils own tariff with the approval
of REB. COB's pricing policy for petroleum products is based on the prin-
ciple of periodic adjustments to recover increases in procurement, processing
and distribution costs and allov reasonable returns. An adjustment in July
1984, raised prices to or above their border price levels. The Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources is authorized to increase petroleum product
prices automatically by up to 102 in response to increasing costs. The
current ex-refinery price levels, in comparison with import parity equivalent
prices, are satisfactory. Cas tariffs have been raised several times in
recent years, most recently in July 1985. Natural gas prices for some clas-
ses of consumers, such as electric power and fertilizer users, are well below
long run marginal cost. A tariff study by international consultants was
carried out under Bakhrabod Cas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD) to
assist the Government in establishing reasonable gas prices. Under the
Second Cas Development Project (para 1.02) GOB increased the average price of
natural gas by 202 on July 1, 1985, and agreed to introduce an additional
increase of at least 202 by July 1, 1986. Beginning FY88 and thereafter, COB
has agreed to adjust the structure and level of gas prices on the basis of
long-run marginal cost plus an allowance for depletion. Electricity tariffs
were increased by 28X on July 1, 1982, by 3.2Z on July 1, 1983, by 9.52 on
March 1, 1984, by 3.42 on December 1, 1984 and by 16.4Z on September 1, 1985.
The latest tariff incorporates time-of-day pricing for some consumer classes.
However, there is a need for an updated long run marginal cost tariff study.
GOB agreed, under the IDA-financed Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit
1254-BD) and the Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), to undertake
such a study. In October 1984, when the proposed Project and the Second



-5.-
Rural Electrification Project were being appraised, GO' approached UNDP to
finance this study; the project document has been signed and the Bank Croup
appointed as the executing agency. In mid-September consultants were invited
to submit proposalo, and the study should commence in January 1986, and
implementation of revised tariffs based on the recomuendations made in the
study should occur in phases beginning December 31, 1986 (paras 3.10 and
4.08).
I. Ener.y Planning and Development Strateg
1.12      Energy development in general, and oil and gas exploration in
particul-r, were designated a "core priority" in the Government's Second
Five-Year Plan (SFYP) 1981-1985. Particular emphasis has been placed on
substituting imported fuels with indigenous resources, such as natural gas
and hydro potential. Other major objectives being pursued by the Covernment
in the energy sector include: (a) improving the reliability of electricity
supply and efficiency of the power system operation; (b) achieving a regional
balance in energy supply between the eastern and western zones of Bangladesh;
Cc) implementing a comprehensive rural electrification program; and
ad) improving efficiency of use and increasing the availability of renewable
resources to meet the growing demand for energy in rural areas. 1/ In line
with the priority given to energy development, the SFYP allocated 19X of
total public sector outlays to the energy sector, of which 70 was allocated
to the power subsector and 301 to hydrocarbons.
F. Bank Croup Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.13    The objectives of the Bank Croup's assistance in the subsector have
evolved from a continuing dialogue with GOB on the complex problems confront-
ing the electricity supply industry. They are aimed at supporting efforts
to: (a) meet the forecast demand for electricity at least cost;
(b) substitute electricity generated using indigenous resources for that
generated using imported petroleum products; (c) assist in institution build-
ing and training; (d) strengthen financial management, particularly of BPDB;
and (e) electrify rural areas. In line with these objectives, the Bank group
and GOB have agreed that priority should be given to: (a) development of
gas-fired and hydroelectric power plants; (b) the reduction of system losses;
(c) the development of efficient transmission and distribution systems,
including the rural electrification systems; and (d) the financial objectives
and practices of BPDB. Progress has been made in all of these areas, but
further improvements are necessary. In particular additional efforts are
needed to: (a) address system losses; (b) continue improvement in the main-
tenance, operational procedures and management of BPDB; (c) develop the
transmission system to allow the substitution of energy generated from
gas-fired plants for that generated from thermal stations using petroleum
1/ The Bangladesh Energy Planning Project will address this issue.

products; (d) improve transmission and low-voltage distribution systems to
supply new consumers, and generally improve the quality of supply; and
(e) electrify new rural areas and expand the supply systems in areas which
have already been electrified.
G. Bank Group Involvement and Donor Coordination
1.14      To date IDA has supported energy development with six operations:
three in the power subsector and three in the hydrocarbon area. The total
amount of IDA funds committed through these operations is US$296.5 million,
representing about 20% of total IDA resources committed to Bangladesh during
the last five years. IDA's involvement with Bangladesh's power subsector
began in June 1979, with the approval of a US$28 million credit for the
Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit 934-BD) to upgrade and
improve the distribution networks in Khulna and three neighboring towns. The
completion of this project has been delayed by more than one year, mainly due
to delays in procurement. BPDB has however, taken corrective steps to remedy
the situation and the Project is expected to be completed in FY86. This
credit was followed by the approval of two power credits in June 1982: a
US$40 million credit for the Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD)
to provide electricity to seven rural cooperatives, which was supplemented by
US$8 million under the Supplemental Assistance Credit (Credit 1504-3-BD) in
June 1984, and a US$92 million credit for Ashuganj Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1254-BD), to expand the generating: capacity of the Ashuganj thermal
power station by adding two 150 MW gas-fired steam units. The Rural Elec-
trification Project is expected to be completed on schedule in December 1988.
After some initial delays which have caused the estimated completion date for
the Ashuganj Project to slip by about one year to July 1987, work is
progressing smoothly. IDA is anticipating substantial savings under Credit
1254-BD, and GOB has requested IDA to finance, utilizing these savings, a
third 150 MS unit at Ashuganj to meet forecast load growth. In November
1985, IDA approved a credit of US$79.0 million for the Second Rural Elec-
trification Project as part of GOB's program-to electrify rural areas. In
the hydrocarbon sector, the first IDA financing, in June 1981, was the US$85
million credit for the Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD) to
develop wells at the Bakhrabad gas field and to supply gas to the Greater
Chittagong area. A US$28.5 million credit was approved in Kay 1983, for the
Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1357-BD). This
seeks to rehabilitate the oil refinery and to study modifications needed to
improve the yield pattern. This project also provides support for the
development of an energy conservation program to improve the efficiency of
energy use in the industrial sector and for feasibility studies on gas-based
export-oriented projects. In July 1983, a US$23 million credit was approved
for the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD). This seeks
to stimulate interest among foreign investors in the resumption of oil
exploration through a proper assessment of petroleum prospects by undertaking
seismic surveys and hydrocarbon habitat studies. In April 1985, IDA approved
the Second Gas Development Project as a part of GOB's program for gas
development and gas infrastructure in the north eastern part of the country.



-7-
1.15      In addition to IDA, a large number of external donors have been
involved in assisting investment in the energy sector. They incLude over
20 agencies ! including ADB, KfW, UNDP, OPEC Fund and Islamic Development
Bank.  ADB ias been particularly active in the energy sector through its
involvement with the Bangladesh Energy Study (BES), carried out in 1976, and
a number of lending operations covering all major energy subsectors. ADB is
currently executing BEPP (para 1.02) and a Power Sector Master Plan Study.
These reports are expected to provide the basis for formulating the Govern-
ment's energy policies and investment program for future Five-Year Plans.
The Bank intends to review BPDB's annual investmen. plan in FY86, and its
review will be discussed with other donors and GOB.
II.   THE BORROWER
Organization of BPDB
2.01     BPDB, the beneficiary, is a statutory government entity which was
formed in 1972. It is responsible for planning, construction and operation
of power generation and transmission facilities throughout Bangladesh, and
for distribution except in those rural areas served by REB. BPDB's management
consists of a chairman and not more than five members, all of whom are
oaDpointed by the Government. The members are responsible for planning/
development, generation/transmission, discribution, finance and administra-
tion. The period, terms and conditions of appointment for the chairman and
members are determined by GOB, which can make appointments and dismissals at
any time. In the past this has led to frequent turnover of top management
and, although appointees have been chosen from BPDB's staff, has led to
discontinuity.
2.02     BPDB's organization chart is shown in Annex 1.  This suggests that
BPDB has well defined lines of responsibility; however, in practice, this is
not always the case. Some improvements have been made in recent years (para
2.04). A major impediment to effective management is BPDB's limited
autonomy. Although GOB has recently begun to denationalize important
industries (e.g. jute and textile manufacturing) it retains control over the
development of the energy sector. It has retained responsibility, within the
framework of the country's overall development plans, for policy formulation
concerning the development of the power subsector. However, GOB's influence
is not confined to taking strategic decisions but extends to such day-to-day
matters as the appointment of BPDB officers, setting salary levels and
structures, and approving the !idget.
2.03     In FY84, BPDB had about 22,000 employees, including about 2,860
graduate and nongraduate engineers, and about 4,720 unskilled staff. The
number of consumers served by BPDB in FY84 was 725,235, giving a con-
sumer/employee ratio of about 35:1.  This is a very low ratio and indicates
that BPDB is considerably overstaffed. However, since 1978 BPDB has reduced
recruitment of lower level staff and has introduced training programs to
impart relevant skills to unskilled staff. The consumer!employee ratio has
improved from 20:1 in FY78 to its present level. Continuation of the exist-
ing policy of limiting recruitment of new staff will lead to a substantial



-8-
improvement in this ratio given the forecast large increase in the number of
consumers.
2.04     Various aid agencies have been involved actively in attempting to
improve BPDB's efficiency. The lead has been taken by ADB, which recognized
that required improvements cannot be achieved solely through managerial
changes. Thus ADB has funded: the preparation of two energy studies (para
1.15) which included many recommendations for the power subsector; provision
of consulting services to establish and introduce an accounting system based
on commercial accounting principles (para 4.01); provisio:u of cooperative
arrangements between BPDB and the electric power utilities in Thailand; and
development of a power system master plan (paras 1.15 and 2.09). Management
consultants engaged under ADB's technical assistance program made several
recommendations to overcome the problems of high turn-over of middle and
senior level staff, overstaffing at lower levels, and the high degree of
centralization of authority. Their recommendations included: (i) job class-
ification, preparation of job descriptions and standard staffing patterns for
specific items of work, (ii) adoption of more appropriate perforrance
appraisal procedures and promotion policies, and (iii) increased delegation
of powers to operating personnel. Most of these recommendations have been
implemented and an Organization and Methods Directorate has been established
to carry on the activities of work study and job classification on a continu-
ing basis. ADB provided US$50,000 under its Fifth Power Project for foreign
training to officials of the 0 & N Directorate. ADB has pursued an active
program with regard to BPDB's institutional development. This program has
been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory, and therefore future efforts
will be devoted to supporting the role played by ADB.
2.05     GOB is considering the reorganization of the power subsector.
Management consultants were engaged under bilateral financing by UK to under-
take a detailed study of the power distribution system in the Dhaka Zone.
They recommended the early establishment of a separate autonomous body to
handle power distribution in that zone. GOB has been reviewing the consult-
ants' recommendations. In the long term this might involve BPDB shedding its
distribution functions, so that it would become a generation and transmission
utility. Distribution in rural areas would be the responsibility of REB,
while in major urban areas it would be the responsibility of new corporate
entities, beginning with Dhaka. So far GOB has not taken any significant
steps in this regard, however IDA proposes to continue to monitor develop-
ments through supervision and other missions.
Existing Facilities
2.06     Bangladesh is divided into east and west zones by the Ganges and
Brahmaputra/Jamuna River system. Until the commissioning of the 230-kV
double circuit interconnector (energized at 132-kV) in December 1982 the
power systems in the two zones were completely isolated. In FY85, BPDB's
total firm generating capacity was 1010 MW (Annex 2). 1/ Firm capacity in the
west zone was 338 MW, all using imported oil, and in the east zone was 672
1/ In addition, industrial captive plant capacity is about 200 MW.



-0-
MW, comprising 130 MW hydroelectric plant, 537 MW natural gas fired plants
and 5 MW of diesels. The commissioning of the interconnector in 1982 allowed
total system generating costs to be reduced by substituting natural gas fired
generation in the east for oil fired generation in the west. In FY84, the
average fuel cost per kWh generated in the west zone was nearly Tk 1.5/kWh
but only Tk 0.15/kWh in the east zone. Substantial transfers (519 GWh and 144
MW) took place in FY84. The major generating stations and load centers are
interconnected by a 132-kV transmission grid (2,000 km) consisting of double
and single-circuit lines (Annex 3). There are also 167 km of 66-kV sub-
transmission lines which branch out from the Ishurdi substation. No further
development of this 66-kV system is planned. Many reinforcements and exten-
sions are under construction or planned for the next decade (Annex 4). These
include stringing second circuits on existing double-circuit towers, exten-
sion of the 230-kV grid, together with reinforcements and extensions of the
132-kV grid in both the east and west zones.
2.07     The distribution system consists of about 7,000 km of 33-kV lines
and 21,000 km of 11-kV and 400 volt lines. The 33-kV network functions as a
bulk distribution system to supply large consumers. Because of the lack of
a 132-kV transmission grid in some remote areas, some of the 33-kV lines
are very long, exceeding 100 km. The 400 volt networks are supplied from
centrally located 11/0.4-kV transformers. Consequently, the 400 volt network
is very extensive and is often overloaded. TechnicaL losses are high in the
33/11-kV and 0.4-kV distribution systems (para 2.10).
2.08     Total energy generated by BPDB's power plants in FY85 was 4,665 GWh,
4,207 GWh (90%) in the east zone and 458 GWh (10%) in the west zone (Annex
19). At the end of FY84, the total number of consumers supplied by BPDB was
about 725,000 of which about 467,000 were domestic consumers and about
214,000 were commercial consumers, including street lighting (Annex 6).
Another 237,000 consumers have been connected through REB, of which about
215,000 are domestic consumers. It is estimated that about 9% of the popula-
tion is receiving electricity supply.
Power Planning
2.09     In May 1983, BPDB set up a Master Planning Cell to prepare a Power
System Master Plan for the development of the generation and transmission
system in Bangladesh (para 1.15). BPDB was assisted by a small team of
advisers from Acres International Limited (Canada) financed by ADB/UNDP.
The Master Plan covers the years 1985-2005 and was undertaken entirely in
Bangladesh in order to maximize the training element. The principal objec-
tive of the Plan is the optimal development of the high voltage grid system,
including both required generating plants and high voltage transmission
network. Distribution planning was not included in the Terms of Reference;
however, a simplified approach was used to assess the investment required for
distribution. This aspect of planning has now been addressed (para 2.15).
The draft interim report for the Power System Master Plan has been reviewed
by IDA. The report does not specify a least cost development program for
BPDB. Rather it consists of 12 scenarios, based on different assumptions
regarding the availability of natural gas, different dates when natural gas
may bacome available in the west zone, different rates of system expansion,
and various options concerning the use of coal-fired generation. The interim
report set out a basic high voltage system capable of being adapted to any of



-10-
the 12 scenarios. The intention was that the interim report would deal with
near-term matters of a pressing nature, while longer term decisions could be
deferred until the various uncertainties underlying the scenarios had been
resolved. One of the most significant parts of the training element of the
Master Plan was the provision of two IBM desk-top computers together with
various programs, including programs for generation expansion, system studies
and financial projections. BPDB's Planning Directorate should now be in a
position to generate and handle its own technical and financial data
accurately and quickly. This represents a significant improvement in its
planning capability.
System losses
2.10     In FY80 and FY81, BPDB's losses in the cransmission and distribution
networks were 40% of gross generation. These were attributed to overloading
of the distribution system, low power factars on consumers' loads, and to
various forms of theft. BPDB agreed under Credit 1254-BD to take all steps
necessary to reduce losses, as a percentage of gross generation, to about 28X
la FY83, 25Z in FY84, 23% in FY85 and  ZOZ in FY90.  Losses are still welL
above the agreed target levels. The joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and Lahmeyer International (Federal
Republic of Germany) have recently studied losses in Bangladesh. Losses, on
the basis of gross generation, were estimated to be about 39% in FY85 and are
estimated to be about 36% in FY86. ESKAP estimated transmission and
distribution losses to be 31% of net generation, consisting of about 14Z
technical losses and 17% non-technical losses. The main reasons for techni-
cal losses are still overloaded distribution systems and inadequate power
factor correction. On the completion of ongoing distribution improvement
projects currently under construction at Khulna, Dhaka, Rajshahi and Chit-
tagong (financed by IDA, ADB, France and ADB respectively), BPNB expects to
reduce technical losses substantially. Non-technical losses are due mainly
to inadequate metering and billing systems, and to theft and corruption. The
ESMAP draft report was discussed with GOB in October 1984. It included
programs to deal with the technical and non-technical losses. These programs
have been included in the proposed Project (paras 3.08 and 3.09).
2.11     Although dated action programs have not been formulated (para 3.08
(a)), it is expected that their implementation would, as a minimum, reduce
system losses to the following levels:
Losses
Fiscal Year           (Z gross generation)
86                         36
87                         34
88                         32
89                         30
90                         28
91                         26
92                         24
93                         22



-11-
The measures discussed in para 3.08 will not begin to reduce losses until
1987. To assist BPDB in reducing system losses in the interim, ESMAP sent an
expert in loss reduction to Bangladesh in November 1984. The objective was
to accelerate the reduction of non-technical losses using available
resources. During his stay of one month he checked, together with a team of
meter technicians from BPDB, approximately 35 commercial and industrial
metering installations. The discrepencies corrected during that period are
estimated to reduce system losses by about 4 GWh a year, worth about US$
280,000. Pending the implementation of the long term measures to reduce
system losses under the proposed Project (para 3.08), BPDB is implementing an
action program to reduce non-technical system losses (para 3.09).
BPDB's Developmrent Program
Planned Generation
2.12     Details of the forecast energy and capacity balances are given in
Annex 2. Total installed capacity on BPDB's supply system is expected to
increase from 1010 MW in 1985 to 2,345 NW in 1992. Projects under construc-
tion or firmly planned in the east zone include: extensions at Ashuganj
(3x150 MW gas-fired steam units and lx60 NW gas turbine (GT)), extensions at
Ghorasal (3x210 MW gas-fired steam units), extensions at Chittagong (2x28 MW
GT), extension at Siddirganj (80 NW GT), and the extension of the Karnafuli
hydropower station (4x50 MW). Similarly, projects under construction or
firmly planned in the west zone for commissioning by end 1988 comprise 20 MS
GT extensions at both Saidpur and Barisal. Financing has been secured for
most of these projects and they should be comuissioned approximately as
planned. Annex 2 shows that the completion of this commissioning program as
planned would enable BPDB to meet its load forecast at the quality of service
incorporated in its reserve plant margin criterion. However, looking beyond
1991 it is apparent that the planned generation investment program will not
allow BPDB to satisfy its security of supply criterion. There could be load
shedding beyond 1991 if the commissioning program is not augmented by addi-
tional capacity. BPDB is expected to revise its planned investment program
for the period beginning about 1990.
2.13     BPDB's strategy of adding natural gas-fuelled base load stations in
the east zone and transferring surplus energy to the west zone in order to
limit use of expensive oil-fired generation in that zone to the level needed
for voltage regulation and system security is sound. The investment in
generating capacity necessary to implement that strategy leads to an invest-
ment program with pronounced peaks in FY86 and FY87 (Annex 18), mainly
required for the on-going Ashuganj and Chorasal gas-fired projects (to be
commissioned in those years). Any slippage in that investment program would
have a severe impact on BPDB's expenditure on fuel since oil-fired generation
in the west zone would need to be substituted for the deferred natural-gas
generation in the east zone. The incremental fuel cost involved in using
Khulna in place of Ghorasal is Tk 1.727/kWh. In FY86 Chorasal is projected
to generate 310 GWh. If this was generated using Khulna, the additional fuel
cost would be Tk 535.37 million. rhis is equivalent to 32.2Z of projected
local currency expenditure on generation facilities in FY86, and to a 5Z



-12-
increase on projected expenditure on imports of petroleum products in that
year. 1/ Thus any slippage due to a shortage of local currency would lead to
increased expenditure of scarce foreign exchange. In view of the size of
proposed investments in the power subsector and their importance to the
economy of Bangladesh, the Bank Group plans to initiate a special review of
BPDB's investment program in FY86. The investment program will be discussed
with other donors and GOB (para 1.15). During negotiations, BPDB agreed to
review with IDA, by July 31 of each year during the execution of the proposed
Project, its investment program and associated financing arrangements, and to
make such changes to the program as may be agreed by GOB, IDA and BPDB (para
6.01(a)).
Transmission
2.14     Conversion of the east-west interconnector to 230-kV operation is
planned for 1986-87 upon completion of the terminal 132/230-kV substations.
BPDB is considering reinforcing the interconnection with another tie-line by
about 1993 to further increase power exchange capability and system security.
Many reinforcements and extensions are under construction or planned for the
next decade. These include the extensions of the 230-kV grid down to
Comilla, as well as reinforcements and extensions of the 132-kV grid in both
the east and west zones.
Distribution
2.15     Development of the distribution system has not kept pace with the
rapidly increasing demand, resulting in a situation where not only are losses
excessive but voltage drop often far exceeds the original design levels. This
is particularly true in the 400 volt network, where most consumers receive
supply at less than 85% of the nominal voltage. Most of the conductors on
the main feeders, branches and service drops are undersized; the 11/0.4-kV
transformers are overloaded and many joints and taps have been made with poor
technology, resulting in unreliable connections and local overheating. To
remedy this situation BPDB has recently established four units, one under
each Chief Engineer Distribution, to plan and develop distribution systems.
Under the proposed Project provision has been made for consulting services to
assist BDPB's distribution planning units in reinforcing the distribution
systems, identifying areas of high losses and recommending a rehabilitation
program (para 3.08 (a)).
1/ In FY86 Bangladesh's total imports are projected to be about US$2760
million (petroleum products US$380 million), and total export earnings
about US$950.0 million, all in constant price terms.



-13-
III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    GOB's strategy for accelerating the development of domestic energy
resources is to locate future major generating stations in the east zone. In
association with this generation, it plans to develop efficient and reliable
transmission and distribution systems required to evacuate the power at least
cost. COB's plans call for the commissioning of about 1,050 MW of gas-fired
generation and 100 MW of hydro-generation over the next five years in the
east zone, and the commissioning of only 40 MW of oil-fired generation in
the west zone. The existing transmission and distribution systems cannot
evacuate the additional power. Even with the present loads, avaiLable
operating voltage is low. On one of the lines included in the project,
Bogra-Thakurgaon 132-kV line, system voltage as low as 114-kV has been
observed. Most of the lines are single circuit and any interruption dislo-
cates supply to all the substations connected to that line. Based on system
studies, BPDB has formulated plans for stabilizing the voltage and reinforc-
ing the transmission and distribution systems. System losses are high,
partly as a result of the inadequate transmission system. Currently, system
losses are about 36Z, however BPDB plans to reduce them. For routine line
maintenance, BPDB shuts the supply and carries out maintenance. To enhance
the quality of supply, BPDB is planning to introduce hot line maintenance
using modern techniques (para 3.12). BPDB has prepared a draft project
Proforma for the proposed Project. Approval of the final Proforma by GOB
would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.03(a)).
Project Objectives
3.02    The principal objectives of the proposed Project are to expand and
reinforce BPDB's transmission and distribution systems to meet the load
forecast at least cost, to stabilize system voltage, to increase system
reliability and to reduce transmission losses. The proposed Project also
includes technical assistance and extension of training facilities. It would
also strengthen BPDB's financial management through the provision of techni-
cal assistance to improve financial services and accounting procedures; and
improve its financial viability through a proposed tariff study.
Project Description
3.03    The proposed Project would be comprised of the following components:
(a)  erection of about 582 km of 132-kV lines;
(b)  extension of sixteen 132-kV substations to accommodate new lines, and
the installation of two 132/33-kV transformers, each of 20 MVA, in
two of these substations;
(c)  extension and reinforcement of the low voltage distribution network

lines (Annex 10).
Details of the Project description are summarized in Annex 7, and map 18660
shows the Project details.
Project Cost
3.04    The estimated total cost of the proposed Project, including price and
physical contingencies, duties and taxes, is US$71.6 million. Duties and
taxes are US$4.2 million. Total finances required, including interest during
construction, are estimated at US$82.9 million, including US$47.8 million in
foreign exchange. The estimates are based on mid 1985 prices. Physical
contingencies are 1OZ for equipment, material and services, on the basis of
experience with similar projects. Price contingencies for foreign costs are
assumed at 7% annually for FY86-FY87, 7.5% for FY88, 7.7% for FY89 and 7.6% a
year thereafter. Price contingencies for local costs are 13Z for FY86 and 11%
a year thereafter. Total price contingencies amount to 24.3Z of base cost
including physical contingencies. A summary cost estimate is presented in
Table 3.1 below, and detailed estimates are given in Annex 8.

Project Financing
3.05    IDA would finance US$56.0 million of the total cost of the proposed
Project, representing 94% of the foreign cost and 57Z of the local cost,
excluding taxes, duties and interest during construction (US$19.6 million).
UNDP would finance the remaining 6% of foreign cost. Table 3.2 below sum-
marizes the Project financing plan.

BPDB would finance local cost amounting to US$12.5 million (15Z) of the total
cost of the proposed Project from internally generated resources. GOB's
contribution of US$11.4 million would finance the remaining local cost and
would consist of US$7.0 million (60X) as equity and US$4.4 million (40Z) as
long term loans. BPDB would bear any cost overruns and the foreign exchange
risk. The onlending arrangements are discussed in para 4.15.
Project Engineering and Consulting Services
3.06    The proposed Project mainly consists of 132-kV lines, substations
and low voltage distribution works. DetaiLed engineering designs, specifica-
tions and bidding documents for all these Project components are required.
BPDB has prepared engineering designs, draft specifications and bidding
documents for the 132-kY lines and substations. Since the materials are of
standard design, BPDB would not require any consultancy assistance for the
132-kV lines. It would, however, need the services of consultants of inter-
national experience to review the engineering design, draft specifications
and bidding documents related to the 132-kV substations, since these would
involve sophisticated equipment requiring close coo!:ination with existing
equipment. In August, 1985 BPDB engaged the services of Hotor Columbus
(Switzerland) for this purpose in accordance with TORs acceptable to IDA.
3.07    BPDB has the capability to prepare design and bidding documents for
low voltage distribution works. However, since a substantial amount of field
survey work is involve;j and BPDB has manpower constraints, it intends to
entrust this work to local consultants with previous experience in the
implementation of similar projects. BPDB has followed this approach under
ADB financed projects and their performance has been found to be satisfac-
tory. Consequently, in November 1985, BPDB engaged the services of six local
consultancy firms to undertake work in specifically designated areas. Before



-17-
the documents prepared by the local consultants are finalized, they would be
reviewed by consultants with international experience to ensure that the
documents are suitable for international bidding. The latter consultants
would also supervise the proposed Project during construction (except low
voltage distribution works) and train BPDB staff in hot line maintenance and
erection of distribution lines. The costs of these consulting services, are
included in the cost of the proposed Project. The appointment of the con-
sultants of international experience would be a condition of credit effec-
tiveness (para 6.03 (b))
3.08    The proposed Project includes assistance to BPDB in the form of
consulting services to undertake studies and implement a program to reduce
both technical and non-technical system losses. UNDP has agreed to finance
these studies, with UNDTCD as the cxecuting agency. The project document,
including TOR and a short list of consultants, has been agreed by UNDP, COB
and IDA. During negotiations GOB/BPDB agreed to impLement the following loss
reduction program:
(a) appoint consultants to assist BPDB's distribution planning units in
reinforcing and rehabilitating its distribution systems, to identify
areas of high losses, and to recommend by December 31, 1986, dated
action programs to remedy each of the specific causes of system
losses. BPDB would implement, in a timely manner, these action
programs taking into account IDA's comments (para 6.02a(i));
(b) appoint a consulting firm for a period of two years to provide the
services of a commercial manager, meter engineer and five meter
technicians to help BPDB streamline its billing and metering proce-
dures (para 6.02a(ii));
(c) prepare and submit to IDA for its comments by June 30, 1986 programs
to provide meters at those installations where there are no meters,
to recalibrate all existing meters, and make all meter installations
secure. BPDB would implement these programs in a timely manner (para
6.02a(iii)); and
(d) prepare and submit to IDA for its comments by June 30, 1986, a
program for the introduction of a computerized billing system consis-
tent with normal commercial utility practices. ADB has provided
US$1.70 million in its Sixth Power loan to finance phase I of BPDB's
computerization program. Under this loan BPDB is inviting proposals
for consultancy services to identify its requirements for hardware
and software. BPDB would keep IDA informed of the progress of this
program and, keeping in view IDA's comments, implement the program in
a timely manner (para 6.02a(iv)).
3.09    In the interim, pending the introduction of the loss reduction
measures under the foregoing studies (para 3.08), GOB/BPDB agreed during
negotiations to continue to implement BPDB's ongoing loss reduction program,
which includes the following key measures (para 6.02(b)):
(a) procurement and installation of appropriate meters at all unmetered
installations;



-18-
(b) calibration of all existing meters, with priority for three phase
meters;
(c) 100X meter reading and billing, and checking by supervisory
personnel;
(d) prevention of theft and pilferage through the installation of secure
and tamperproof meter enclosures; and
(e) prompt disconnection and prosecution of consumers for the illegal use
of electricity.
During negotiations it was agreed that BPDB would prepare for IDA's
review an analysis of the level of system losses, showing progress made up to
December 31, 1985 and for each succeeding six-month period thereafter, until
a level acceptable to IDA is achieved.
..iO    UNDP is also providing technical assistance for a study to set
tariffs based on long run marginal costs; investigate the implications of
various subsidies for rural electrification, and develop a methodology for
the revaluation of BPDB's fixed assets (para 4.08). IDA is the executing
agency for this study. Following the approval of BPDB, consultants were
invited to submit proposals in mid-September 1985, and the study should
commence in January 1986.
Project Implementation
3.11    All 132-kV lines would be erected by local contractors.  BPDB has
recently erected, with the assistance of local contractors, 102km of 132-kV
line between Ishurdi and Bogra in about three months. The use of local
contractors is considered acceptable to IDA since the works are scattered
over a wide area and are labor intensive. The 132-kV substations would be
erected by the suppliers of substation equipment on a turn key basis.
Low voltage distribution works would be erected by local contractors. Con-
sultants with international experience, acceptable to IDA, would supervise
the construction and commissioning of the 132-kV lines and substations, while
local consultants, also acceptable to IDA, would supervise the low voltage
distribution works.
3.12    The proposed Project includes US$500,000 to strengthen the Khulna
training institute (Annex 10). This provision includes about US$300,000 to
meet the cost of new tools and equipment required to train BPDB staff in
modern techniques of hot line maintenance and erection. About US$200,000
would be used to meet the foreign cost of overseas training for BPDB staff.
The consultants with international experience engaged under para 3.07 would
assist BPDB in implementing this training program. During negotiations, BPDB
agreed to implement the following training program (para 6.02(c):
(a) submit a consultant's report
covering equipment specifications
and training requirements of
of BPDB staff;                            June 30, 1986



-19-
(b) prepare bidding documents for tools
and equipment for hot line
maintenance;                             September 30, 1986
(c) finalize contracts for
procurement of tools and equipment;      June 30, 1987
(d) select and depute
BPDB teachers for training abroad;       June 30-October, 1987
(e)  train BPDB staff in Bangladesh; and      November 1987-February 1988
(f) consultant's evaluation of the
training program.                        March 1988
3.13    BPDB has decided to create the post of Project Director, suppirted
by necessary staff, in order to expedite the implementation of the project.
The proposed organization has been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory.
The appointment of the Project Director would be a condition of credit effec-
tiveness (para 6.03(c)).
3.14    The implementation schedule for the proposed Project is given in
Annex 9. It would be constructed in about four years from the date of
initiation of works. IDA has approved GOB's request for the advanced
procurement and retroactive financing of up to SDR 5.0 million, to cover
expenditures for the Bogra-Thakurgaon 132-kY line. As explained in para
3.01, the system voltage on that line is low and BPDB intends to give
priority to the erection of the second circuit.
Procurement
3.15    The procurement of the various components of the proposed Project
would be arranged as shown in Table 3.3. Procurement of materials and equip-
ment would be on ICB basis in accordance with Bank Croup guidelines. It is
expected that only foreign suppliers would submit bids for equipment and
materials. Should a local manufacturer submit a bid, 15X price preference on
CIF prices or prevailing duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed. Local
contractors would be selected on LCB procedures. These procedures have been
reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory. Civil works associated with 132-kV
substations would be constructed by the suppliers of the equipment on a turn
key basis; other civil works associated with 132-kV lines and low voltage
distribution works would be constructed by the local contractors. A set of
small quantities of materials, tools, spare parts and equipment, not exceed-
ing US$75,000 each and in the aggregate not exceeding US$375,000, would be
procured on LIB basis, in accordance with Bank Croup guidelines. Another set
of small quantities of materials, tools, spare parts and equipment, not
exceeding US$75,000 each and in the aggregate not exceeding US$375,000, would
be procured under LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.

insurance charges. -Duties and taxes amount to US$4.2 million out of the
total of US$12.6 million.



-21-
3.16    Separate bidding documents would be prepared for the following items:
line materials, consisting of conductors, insulators and
fittings, poles, and cross arms, estimated at US$18.6 million;
vehicles and erection equipment estimated at US$2.5 million;
substation materials, including civil works and erection,
con3isting of transformers, switchgear, protective relaying
and carrier equipment, capacitors and other associated
equipment, estimated at US$23.0 million; meters and metering
equipment, estimated at US$2.4 million; and erection and
commissioning, including civil works, of 132-kV lines and low -
voltage distribution systems, estimated at US$4.4 million.
All IDA financed contracts exceeding US$50,000 would be subject to IDA's
prior review.
Disbursement
3.17    Disbursement under the proposed credit would be in respect of the
costs of material and equipment, civil works, erection and commissioning, and
technical assistance, as shown below:
(a)  100Z of the CIF cost of line and substation materials, vehicles and
erection equipment, meters and metering equipment; in the case of -
goods manufactured locally, 1002 of ex-factory cost, and in the case
of goods procured locally, 702 of the cost;
(b)  100Z of foreign expenditure and 801 of the local expenditure for
civil works and erection and comnissioning charges;
(c)  1002 of the total expenditure for consulting services; and
(d)  100Z of the total expenditure for overseas training of BPDB staff.
These disbursements would be fully documented, with the exception of small
civil works costing less than US$20,000.  In such cases, disbursewent would
be made against Statement of Expenditure (SOE), the documentation of which
would not be submitted to IDA but retained for inspection by the supervision
missions. The standard procedures for auditing SOE's would apply. In order
to facilitate disbursement, a special project account would be established in
the Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank), on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA. The initial deposit in the bank would be SDR 3.0 million. The disbur-
sement schedule is based on-completion of the proposed Project by
December 31, 1989, with a one year warranty after completion. The credit
closing date would .be December 31, 1990. This would imply a construction
period of about four years and a disbursement period of about five years.
An allowance of 15X slippage in the disbursement schedule has been included
to cover the possible risk of delays in implementation (para 3.20). A mean-
ingful comparison cannot be made using the standerd IDA/IBRD profile since
132-kV towers already exist. Procurement is only needed for conductors,
insulators and fittings required-for stringing the circuit on existing
towers. This should take only a relatively short time. BPDB has recently
erected a second circuit  - a 102km section between Ishurdi and Bogra in only



-22-
three months. All 132-kV substations with associated controL room buildings
exist. Only extensions would be required to accommodate the second 132-kV
circuit and new power transformers at Faridpur and Madaripur. At all 14
towns, 33/11 kV substations exist, except at Habigani, and reinforcement of
these substations is covered under the proposed Project. The proposed
Project, however, includes some new low voltage local distribution lines and
substations. Local contractors and the BPDB have sufficient experience in
this type of work to undertake it satisfactorily. BPDB plans to engage a
number of local contractors to work on different sites. This will shorten
the construction period. During negotiations GOB/BPDB, however, gave an
assurance that in the event of delays in the implementation of the proposed
Project, GOB would make suitable arrangements to finance any cost overruns.
Ecological Effects
3.18    GOB has assured IDA that Bangladesh's existing laws provide adequate
compensation for properties acquired or damaged as a result of projects
undertaken for public purposes. During negotiations, GOB further assured IDA
that any rights of way required for the purposes of the proposed Project will
not have any adverse impact upon wild life preserves.
Project Monitoring
3.19    Implementation of the proposed Project would be monitored by BPDB
with the assistance of consultants, and BPDB would submit quarterly progress
reports and other pertinent information to IDA.  When .inally completed, BPDB
should undertake not later than six months after the closing date, or such
Later date as may be agreed for this purpose, to prepare and furnish to IDA a
Project Completion Report of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall
reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of the Project,
its cost and the benefit derived from it, the performance of BPDB and the
accomplishment of the objectives of the Credit.
Risk
3.20    The proposed Project is relatively free of complexities.  Slippage
could occur due to delays in procurement and the appointment of contractors.
This would be minimized by engaging consultants according to an agreed
schedule. Appropriate contingencies have been provided to avoid cost
overruns. BPDB's financial performance needs to be improved and the exces-
sive system losses reduced. Without improvements in these areas, the planned
expansion of the power network and the institution building objectives of
the proposed Project would be placed at risk. In order to address these
issues, the proposed Project includes (i) a program to reduce system losses,
both on an interim and longer term basis, and (ii) the establishment of
specific short-term financial goals for BPDB and the development of longer
term performance goals based on a long-run marginal cost-based tarifi study.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
System of Accounts
4.01     BPDB engaged the service of Sycip, Cores, and Velayo (SGV) of the
Philippines, under financing from ADB, to assist in the introduction of
a new accounting system. The consultants compLeted their basic assignment
in Kay 1981. Manuals, books of accounts and organizational structure
required for the implementation of the proposed commercial accounting
system were developed. BPDB has begun to compile its accounts according
to the new system and made the required institutional changes by creating
25 regional accounting offices and placing all financial and commercial
activities under the Member Finance. However, despite the efforts devoted
to this objective so far, limited progress has been in areas, such as
property accounting and inventory accounts. In addition, the books of
accounts and records, especially in the Regional Accounting Offices are
poorly maintained. An understanding was reached with GOB that, an overall
review and evaluation of the progress made in implementing the new system
of accounts would be carried out to detect any impediments and recommend
improvements. Therefore, during negotiations it was agreed that the
Association and BPDB will jointly review BPDB's existing accounting system
(para 6.02(d)).
Past Financial Performance
4.02    In February 1978, GOB prepared a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) for
BPDB, which included: (i) restructuring BPDB's debt to GOB and reschedul-
ing its foreign debt; (ii) financing the local cost of BPDB's investment
program (50% as loans and 50% as equity); (iii) reducing system losses;
(iv) revising tariffs periodically; and (v) establishing programs for
system rehabilitation and improved management. Some progress has been made
in meeting these objectives. In February 1978, all GOB's preliberation
loans and 501 of post-liberation loans 1/ were converted into equity. The
remaining 501 post-liberation loans together with all foreign loans 2/,
were rescheduled with a repayment period of 25 years, including a 5 year
grace period bearing a 5% interest rate. In July 1983, all BDBP's out-
standing local currency loans from GOB up to June 30, 1981, and all foreign
grants without relending agreements, were converted into equity, effective
from July 1, 1981. Tariffs were increased in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 and
1985. Under the Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), BPDB
prepared a comprehensive loss reduction program; however, although various
measures have been implemented, to date system losses have not been reduced
(para 2.10). Although BPDB has improved the compilation of its annual

-24-
financial statements, the evaluation of its past performance is difficult
due to unreliable data on system losses and electricity sales. In
FY82-FY84, BPDB issued supplementary bills for the previously free consump-
tion by its own staff and for consumers believed to have been under-billed
during the past 10 years. BPDB added the additional energy consumption
included in these bills to recorded sales. Since most of the supplementary
billing was disputed by customers and was largely uncollectable, issuing
these bills simply distorted actual sales data, appeared to reduce system
losses and inflated accounts receivable. During negotiations the GOB
delegation informed IDA that the practice of issuing supplementary bills
has been discontinued unless underbilling, theft, fraud, etc. has been
established beyond doubt and the billed amount is collectable. BPDB did
not fully meet the agreed financial targets for FY83 and FY84; however,
its financial performance has improved, although at a slower rate than was
expected during the preparation of the Ashuganj Thermal Power Project,
(Credit 1254-BD). In FY83, it brcke even financially for the first time,
and average fuel cost per kWh generated decreased due to the commissioning
of the east/west interconnector.
Tariffs and Financial Objectives
4.03      Under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), BPDB is
required to take all actions necessary to ensure that its tariffs are set
at levels that will realize net cash generation equal to at least 20% of
its average annual investment in FY83, 25% in FY84 through FY86, and 40Z in
FY87 and thereafter. Tariffs were increased by about 28Z in July 1982,
3.2Z in July 1983, 9.5% in March 1984, and 3.4% in December 1984, leading
to an increase in the average tariff revenue from Tkl.00/kWh in FY82 to
Tkl.41/kWh in June 1985. Despite these increases BPDB was unable to meet
the cash generation agreement in FY83 and FY84. Ho-wever, it was able to
move from a position of losses in the 1970's to financial breakeven in FY83
(Annex 16). In FY85 BPDB is expected to realize a cash generation of about
only 2% as a result of: (i) its policy change regarding supplementary
billing, and (ii) the introduction of a tariff increase of only 3.4% on
December 1, 1984, when a tariff increase of 11% from July 1, 1984 was
estimated to be required to realize the covenanted net cash generation of
25%. It is expected that BPDB will be able to generate net cash equal to
about 12% of its average annual investment in FY86 as a result of the
tariff increase introduced from September 1, 1985. This tariff increase
was estimated by GOB to be about 162.1/ PDB's inability to meet its agreed
cash generation targets during the three previous yeirs was only partly the
result of inadequate tariff increases. Other reasons included: (i) BPDB's
limited success in reducing system losses; (ii) the unexpected 40% increase
in imported oil prices introduced by GOB on July 1, 1982, which was not
passed on to electricity consumers through the fuel adjustment clause; and
(iii) the higher than expected annual investment program, (Annex 18). On
the other hand, some factors contributed positively to BPDB's financial
performance during those years. These included: (i) the commissioning of
1/ This includes an increase in the bulk supply tariff rate to PBSs
from TK 0.78/kWh to Tk 0.95/kWh



-25-
the east/west interconnector in December 1982, which decreased the average
fuel cost per kWh generated from Tk 0.76 to Tk 0.48; and (ii) COB's arran-
gements to restructure BPDR's capital to maintain a debt/equity ratio of
60/40, which reduced the debt service obligation from FY82.
4.04    IDA recently concluded that the use of cash generation to measure
BPDB's financial performance was inappropriate due to: (i) the difficulty
in reaching agreement on BPDB's investment program starting from FY86, and
(ii) the sharp increase assumed by BPDB in its preliminary forecast for the
annual investment program in FY86-FY88 (about 1001 more than FY85 in each
of these FYs), followed by a smaller program thereafter. These factors
suggest that annual rate of return targets based on BPDB's average net
revalued fixed assets in operation would provide a more appropriate measure
of BPDB's financial performance than cash generation related to an uncer-
tain investment program (para 2.13). BPDB is already revaluing its assets
each year by applying a 10% price escalation factor (para 4.10). A rate of
return target of about 10 on BPDB's average net revalued fixed assets in
operation will enable it to become financially viable and permit it to self
finance an adequate proportion of its future investment program (Annex 14).
This target should be achieved through a reasonably smooth progression
after four interim years. During-negotiations, GOB and BPDB agreed to take
all necessary measures to enable BPDB to achieve a rate of return, on its
average net revalued assets in operation, of 5.0% in FY86, 7.5% in FY87,
8.5% in FY88, 9.0% in FY89 and 10.0% in FY90 and thereafter (para 6.02(e)).
The tariff increase introduced with effect from September 1, 1985 should
enable BPDB to meet the target rate of return for FY86.
Billing and Collection
4.05    At the end of FY84 BPDB had about 725,000 consumers, including
about 467,000 (64%) domestic, 250,000 (35Z) industrial and commercial, and
7,000 (1%) irrigation pumps. The number of consumers increased by 27.6X
(6.3Z p.a.) from FY81 to FY84, while total energy sold increased by 59.8%
(12.4Z p.a.). During this period about 56Z of the total energy sold went
to only 0.2% of BPDB's consumers, comprising high tension (HT) and extra
high tension (EHT) bulk supply industries. One of SGV's tasks was to
assist BPDB in improving its commerciaL activities. To this end, SGV
prepared a commercial practices manual streamlining meter reading, billing
and consumer accounting procedures. In accordance with SGV's recommenda-
tions, commercial functions were separated from operations and maintenance
functions, and a commercial office, headed by a commercial general manager
and assisted by a deputy general manager and director, was established
under the control of the Member Finance. Collection procedures were
simplified to encourage consumers to pay their bills on time and some
measures were taken to reinforce disconnection procedures and reduce
non-technical losses. However, some impediments remain to the adequate
implementation of some of SGV's recommendations. These would be addressed
in the proposed review of BPDB's accounting system (para 4.01).



-26-
4.06    Table 4.1 below summarizes BPDB's billing and collections for the
past three years:
Table 4.1

The table shows that only 87.7% of the total number of consumers were
billed, and 78Z of the total amount biLled was collected, in FY84. The
previous practice of supplementary bilLing made the assessment of actual
collectable revenue difficult and worsened BPDB's accounts receivable
position (para 4.02).
Accounts Receivable
4.07    Under Ashugnaj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD) BPDB is
required to keep its accounts receivable within 20% of its sales forecast
as approved in its annual budget. However, BPDB's actual accounts receiv-
able were about 36% of its forecast sales revenue at the end of Ff84. The
increase in arrears during the last two financial years is attributed
mainly to the introduction of supplementary billing. Accounts receivable
which represented 2.8 months of sales in FY82 increased to 4.4 months in
FY83 and 5.8 months in FY84. On June 30, 1984 BPDB's accounts receivable -
amounting to Taka 1,780 million - were a real constraint on its financial
performance and caused: (i) serious delays in the payment of fuel bills,
and (ii) frequent resort to short-term borrowing at high interest rates
to solve its liquidity problems. Therefore, as a condition of nego-
tiations, GOB/BPDB furnished to IDA a draft proposal for an action program
to settle existing accounts receivable. This proposal, which IDA found
acceptable, shows the arrears attributable to public entities, corporate
entities, private consumers and other consumer categories. The proposal
includes the methods to be employed in settling BPDBts arrears and writing
off uncollectable arrears, together with a timetable for its implementa-
tion. During negotiations BPDB agreed to implement this action program and
to settle, accordingly, all existing accounts receivable from the sale o'
electricity and to ensure that, by June 30, 1988, and thereafter, its
accounts receivable will not exceed the revenues equivalent of the three



-27-
preceding months' sales of electricity. Meanwhile GOB agreed, as a condi-
tion of credit effectiveness, to reduce the arrears due to BPDB from GoB's
departments to a level satisfactory to IDA. In this regard the IDA delega-
tion indicated that the level of arrears from GOB's departments should be
reduced to be no more than the equivalent of 4.5 months of the sales of
electricity to these entities (paras 6.02(f) and 6.03(d)).
Tariff and Subsidy Study
4.08    Under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), and the
First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), it was agreed that
GOB shall: (a) carry out by December 31, 1984, a study of the bulk and
retail tariffs to be applied in the power subsector taking into account the
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of supply; and (b) implement by July 1, 1985,
the tariff structure and such other recommendations of the study as agreed
by GOB and IDA. In October 1984, GOB requested UNDP to finance this study.
During the appraisal of the proposed Project and the Second Rural Elec-
trification Project, it was found that an additional study should be under-
taken to investigate the financial burden placed on the Government by the
rural electrification program, including both current and capital costs of
existing and planned investments. The study should assess the extent of
subsidies provided through such mechanisms as onlending arrangements
between the Government and REB, and subsequently between REB and PBSs, the
Government's program of subsidizing PBSs during the first five years of
their operations, bulk supply tariffs, and PBSs' retail tariffs. In addi-
tion, the subsidy study should provide an evaluation of the tariff levels
which consumers would be able to afford and the possible implications for
the rate of expansion of the rural electrification system. This study was
included in the terms of reference for the tariff study. Following comple-
tion of that study, the onlending arrangements, Government provision of
subsidies to PBSs, bulk supply and retail tariffs, would be reviewed with
the Government in order to develop and implement a program, satisfactory to
IDA, for the expansion and operation of the rural electrification program
which would maximize cost recovery within the limits of affordability and
without jeopardizing the economic and social objectives of the program.
During negotiations it was agreed that GOB shall: (a) within a time-frame,
under arrangements and in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory
to the Association, carry out, or cause to be carried out, a study of: (i)
the subsidies provided to the rural electrification program, and of (ii)
the bulk and retail tariffs to be applied in the power sector, taking into
account the long-run marginal cost of supplying electricity and financial
objectives; (b) promptly furnish to the Association the findings and recom-
mendations of such study; and (c) by December 31, 1986 or such later date
as the Association may agree, implement in phases revised tariffs satisfac-
tory to the Association, based on the recommendations of such study, and
such other measures as GOB and the Association may agree (para 6.01(b)).



-28-
Audit
4.09    Under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD) BPDB agreed
to have its accounts for each financial year audited by independent
auditors, acceptable to IDA, and furnish to IDA, not later than nine months
after the end of each financial year, certified copies of the audited
financial statements and an audit report for the year. In accordance with
this requirement, BPDB's accounts are now audited, in an acceptable manner,
by independent chartered accountants. However, BPDB has not been able to
comply with the agreed time limit. To date IDA has received the audited
financial staLements for the financial years through FY84, together with
related audit reports. During negotiations, BPDB reaffirmed its agreement
that it will furnish its accounts for each financial yerr to IDA, audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, together with the audit report
for the year (para 6.02(g)).
Revaluation of Fixed Assets
4.10      Under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), BPDB
agreed that, commencing FY83, it would revalue annually its fixed assets in
operation in a manner satisfactory to IDA. Consequently, at the end of
FY82, BPDB started ,o revalue its assets by an amount equal to IO of its
revalued gross fixed assets in operation. Although this methodology
deviates from the more usual approach to asset revaluation, it has been
accepted as an interim measure pending the completion of the tariff and
subsidy study (para 4.08), which also includes asset revaluation. During
negotiations BPDB agreed to revalue annually its fized assets in operation
in a manner satisfactory to the Association (para 6.02(h)). Following
completion of the tariff study, BPDB and IDA will agree to a methodology
for the revaluation of assets and a timetable for its implementation.
Debt/Equity
4.11      BPDB finances its investment program from the following sources:
(a)    foreign loans granted to GOB and onlent to BPDB;
(b)    GOB's contribution, 501 as equity and 501 as loans, to finance
a significant part of the local expenditure; and
(c)    BPDB's internally generated funds.
COB agreed under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), to revise
its arrangements for financing BPDB's investment program by increasing its
equity contributions so as to maintain a debt/equity ratio of not more than
60:40. In July 1983, GOB agreed to convert all local currency loans made



-29-
before June 30, 1981 and all foreign grants 1/ without any relending agree-
ments, into equity. At the end of FY84, BPDB's debt/equity ratio was at
the satisfactory level of 48:52. At negotiations, GOB reaffirmed the
agreements reached under the Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit
1254-BD) so as to enable BPDB to maintain * debt/equity ratio of no more
than 60:40 (para 6.01(c)).

The assumptions used in the financial projections are presented in Annex
13. Sales of electricity are projected to increase from 2705 GWh in FY84
to 8371 GWh in FY92, about 15X p.a. Industrial consumption is forecast to
grow at 12.5% p.a., and will represent about 45% of the total consumption
in FY92 compared to about 65% in FY84. Sales to REB are forecast to
increase from 107 GWh in FY84 to 1286 GWh in FY92, an average growth rate
of about 36% p.a. Domestic and commercial consumption are expected to grow
at an average rate of about 15.5% p.a. System losses are assumed to
decrease *rom about 39% of gross generation in FY85 to 24% in FY92.  The
reduction in system losses will increase BPDB's sales revenue as a result
of some non-technical losses being transformed into recorded sales. It
will also reduce BPDB's costs, partly by reducing capacity requirements and
partly by reducing fuel costs. One effect of these changes will be to
increase forecast net profits and another would be to increase BPDB's cash
generation. BPDB's average revenue is projected to increase from Tk
1.41/kWh in FY85 to Tk 2.36/klh in FY90, an average annual increase of 11Z;
this would permit the realization of the required rate of return starting
from FY86. Revenues from sales of electricity are projected to increase
from Taka 4,032 million in FY85 to Taka 21,680 million in FY92 (27% p.a.),
reflecting both the growth of electricity sales and tariff increases. The
fuel cost per kWh generated in FY92 is forecast to equal 52% of the fuel
cost per kWh generated in FY85, both in constant prices, as a result of
basing generation expansion on gas-fired plants. 1/ As a result of system
growth and loss reduction, administrative and operating costs per kWh sold
in FY92 are projected to equal 80Z of those costs in FY84. The interest
expense represented 3.5Z of total revenues in FY84, and is expected to
increase to about 13.8% of total revenues in FY92 due to the introduction
of a higher interest rate (11.52) for new loans. Net earnings - after
interest expense - are projected to increase form Taka 452 million in FY84
(12% of total revenues) to Taka 7,056 million in FY92 (31Z of total
revenues). The principle issues affecting BPDB's future financial perfor-
mance include:
1.     the achievement or otherwise of the targets set in the system
loss reduction program (para 2.11); and
2.     efficient load dispatching to avoid using costly imported oil
(para 2.13).
1/ About 942 of BPDB's total generation in FY92 is projected to be from
gas-fired plants.



-31-
4.13    The sharp increase in net cash generation as a percentage of the
three year average investment beginning in FY89 reflects the large fall in
the annual investment program between FY86 (Tk 11,300 million) and FY91 (Tk
5,700 million) rather than any real improvement in BPDB's financial perfor-
mance.
Financing Plan

During the period FYB6-FY90 BPDB is eipected to generate net cash equal to
23Z of its investment program; however, in FY86 the internal sources would
be equal to only 12Z of the annual investment but will increase to 71X in
FY90. COB's contribution is expected to be about 192 of BPDB's investment
program during the project construction period, with 61Z provided as equity
contribution and 39Z as long term loans. Foreign currency requirements
will represent about 58Z of the investment program (about US$960 million
equivalent). GOB has already succeeded in obtaining commitments for about
70Z of the foreign currency requirements.
Onlending Terms
4.15     During negotiations GOB agreed to relend the proceeds of the
proposed Credit to BPDB under a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered
into between GOB and BPDI under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
The term of onlending should be 20 years (including 5 years of grace) and
at an interest rate of 11.5Z per annum. The foreign exchange risk will be
borne by BPDB (para 6.01(d)). The conclusion of the Subsidiary Loan Agree-
ment between GOB and BPDB would be a condition of credit effectiveness
(para 6.03 (e)). These arrangements are in line with COB's arrangements
for onlending foreign loans to BPDB. GOB is still using the rate of inter-
est of 5Z on its own local lending to BPDB, as established in the 1978
Financial Recovery Plan. That rate is below rates charged to revenue
generating enterprises. During negotiations the GOB delegation informed
IDA Lhat all the local funds provided by GOB to BPDB are being converted to
equity to enable BPDB to sttain the debt/equity ratio previously agreed
with IDA. However, it was understood that in the event GOB does provide
funding to BPDB in the form of loans, these loans would bear an interest
rate of 11.52.
Insurance
4.16    BPDB does not carry insurance for its fixed assets in operation or
other properties. During negotiations BPDB agreed to insure or make arran-
gements for insurance of its proj,erti' o- assets, in such kinds and amounts
as shall be consistent with approprii*te public utility practice and accept-
able to IDA. In this regard BPDB agreed to submit to IDA by December 31,
1986 a draft scheme for establishing a fund from its own resources to cover
the insurance risks. BPDB agreed to implement the scheme promptly, there-
after, taking into account IDA's comments (para 6.02(i)).
Incoma Tax
4.17 Because of its legal status as a Local Authority, BPDB is not liable
to pay income tax.

V. JUSTIFICATION
A. Electricity Demand Forecast
5.01    Total electricity sales increased at the average annual rate of
14.3Z in the period FY75-FY84 and 18.6% in the period FY8O-FY84 (Annex 5).
A significant change has occurred in the percentage shares of sales
accounted for by BPDB's major consumer groups. Annex 6 shows that, compar-
ing i984 with 1977, there was an increase in the relative importance of
sales to domestic and ceremonial/temporary consumers, and to REB. There
was an off-setting decrease in the shares of sales to industrial, street
lighting and commercial, and agricultural consumers. The increased sales
to REB reflect the on-going rural electrification investment program.
5.02    The load forecast for the period FY85-FY92 is given in Table 5.1
and Annex 19.

Losses (Z)      38.7                   24.0
Total energy sales are forecast to increase at 16.61 a year, while energy
generated is forecast to increase by only 13.1% on the assumption that BPDB
will achieve its loss reduction targets (para 2.11).   Although the
forecast rate of growth for total sales is high, it is lower than the rate
achieved in the period FY8O-FY84. One reason for the relatively high
forecast is the projected reduction in non-technical losses, which suggests
that some currently unrecorded consumption will be replaced by recorded
sales. The forecast reflects the projected continuing high rate of connec-
tion of new consumers, which averaged about 55,000 a year in the period



-34-
1979-1984 and is projected to be about 80,000 a year in the Third Five Year
Plan period (FY85-FY90).
5.03    Significant changes are forecast to occur in the relative shares of
sales to the major consumer groups served by both BPDB and REB. For BPDB
the major changes concern a fall from about 58% to 45Z of total sales going
to industrial consumers and an increase from about 82 to 15X for bulk sales
to REB. The proportional' increase in sales to REB underlines the impor-
tance of rhe introduction of suitable load management measures for REB's
irrigation and industrial consumers (Annex 19) to prevent a possible sub-
stantial decline in the system load factor. This issue is addressed by
the proposed Second Rural Electrification Project which was approved by the
Board in November 1985.
B. Least Cost Alternative
5.04    BPDB prepared the proposed Project to extend and reinforce its
transmission and distribution systems in order to meet the forecast demand
for electricity at least cost. The assumptions used, methodology and
results for each component of the proposed Project have been reviewed and
found satisfactory to IDA (Annex 20).
C.  Economic Internal Rate of Return
5.05    Although the proposed Project is expected to play a crucial role in
ensuring the optimal development and operation of BPDB's supply system, its
benefits to consumers cannot be separated from those of other necessary
generation, transmission and distribution programs. In these circumstan-
ces, having established that the project is part of the least cost expan-
sion program, it is appropriate to carry out the cost-benefit analysis on
the entire program to ensure that it is desirable. For this purpose a
'time-slice' of BPDB's and REB's investment programs for generation, trans-
mission and distribution for the period FY85-FY92 has been analyzed. Capi-
tal costs for these programs, together with incremental operating and fuel
costs, are shown in Annex 21. All costs were expressed in their equivalent
border values. A minimum measure of the benefits associated with these
programs is given by the incremental sales revenue. Based on an average
revenue of Tk 1.64/kWh, and using the standard conversion factor of 0.80 to
convert financial revenue into a measure of economic benefit, the minimum
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated to be 9.6% (Annex
21).
5.06    The foregoing revenue based measure of the EIRR is, by its nature,
more a measure of the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic merit
of the investment programs which include the proposed Project. The
estimated minimum economic rate of return of 9.6% is less than the
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 122, and this indicates that
tariffs are currently less than long run marginal costs (para 4.08). In



-35-.
these circumstances the proposed Project will confer benefits in excess of
those measured by incremental revenue.
5.07    A better measure of the EIRR can be obtained by estimating con-
sumers' willingness to pay for the incremental electricity sales.  Willing-
ness to pay by the major consumer groups was estimated in terms of the
costs which they would bear to meet their energy requirements in the
absence of the proposed Project. For household and commercial consumers
this was the cost of lighting using kerosene lamps, while for industrial
and irrigation (agricultural) consumers it was the cost of diesel motors.
The weighted average willingness to pay was estimated to be Tk 1.94/kWh.
On this basis the EIRR was estimated to be 12.7%. However, it should be
stressed that this is still partial measure of EIRR. It does not allow for
incremental consumers' surplus on the generated market produced by the
project (as distinct from the diverted market), it assumes that the wilL-
ingness to pay for non-technical losses is zero, and does not allow for any
external benefits which may be produced by the proposed Project.
D. Justification for Bank Involvement
5.08    In addition to providing additional capacity to meet forecast load
growth at least cost, the proposed Project will, through Bank involvement:
(a) help expand and reinforce the power generating, transmission
and distribution systems and expand the rural electrification
system;
(b) assist the power subsector in moving tariffs to a level which
reflect the economic costs of production and distribution and
which will also achieve a greater degree of self financing;
Cc) promote the use of natural gas as a substitute for imported
oil for power generation;
(d) improve efficiency by reducing system losses;
(e) expand training facilities; and
(f) improve BPDB's accounting systems.

VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
6.01    During negotiations the following agreements were reached with GOB:
(a) GOB shall submit to IDA BPDB's annual investment program and
BPDB shall, by July 31 of each year of the execution of the
Project, review in consultation with IDA its investment program
and proposed financing arrangements and shall make such changes
to the program as may be agreed between GOB, BPDB and IDA (para
2.13).
(b) GOB will: (a) within a time-frame, under arrangements and in
accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA carry
out, or cause to be carried out, a study of : (i) the subsidies
provided to the rural electrification program and of (ii) the
bulk and retail tariffs to be applied in the power sector,
taking into account the long-run marginal cost of supplying
electricity and financial objectives; (b) promptly furnish to
IDA the findings and recommendations of such study; (c) by
December 31, 1986, or such later date as IDA may agree, imple-
ment in phases revised tariffs satisfactory to IDA, based on
the recommendations of such study, and such other measures as
GOB and IDA may agree (para 4.08);
(c) GOB will enable BPDB to maintain a debt/equity ratio of no more
than 60:40 (para 4.11); and
(d) the proceeds of the Credit will be onlont to BPDB under a
subsidiary loan agreement between GOB and BPDB under terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The terms of onlending will be
twenty years (including five years of grace) and at an interest
rate of 11.5% per annum (para 4.15).
6.02    During negotiations the following agreements were reached with
BPDB:
(a) UNDP technical assistance will be used to implement the follow-
ing loss reduction program:
(i) appoint consultants to assist BPDB's distribution planning
units to, reinforce and rehabilitate distribution systems,
identify areas of high losses, and recommend by Decem-
ber 31, 1986, dated action programs to remedy each of the
specific causes of system losses. BPDB, will thereafter,
implement the action programs in a timely manner taking
into account IDA's comments (para 3.08(a));



-37-
(ii) appoint a consulting firm for a period of two years to
provide the services of a commercial manager, meter
engineer and five meter technicians to help BPDB streamline
its billing and metering procedures (para 3.08(b));
(iii) prepare programs to provide meters at those installations
where there are no meters, to recalibrate all existing
meters, and nake all meter installations secure; the
programs would Be submitted to IDA for its comments by June
30, 1986 and thereafter BPDB would implement the programs
taking into account IDA's comments (para 3.08(c)); and
(iv) prepare and submit to rDA for its comments by June 30,
1986, a program for the introduction of-a computerized
billing system consistent with normal commercial utility
practices. BPDB will implement the program in a timely
manner, taking into account IDA's comments (para 3.08(d)).
(b) Pending the implementation of the above programs, BPDB will
continue to implement its ongoing interim program to reduce
non-technical losses. This program includes the following key
measures(para 3.09):
*i) procurement and installation of appropriate meters at all
unmetered installations;
(ii) calibration of all existing meters with priority for 3
phase meters;
(iii) 100 percent meter reading, billing and checking by super-
visory personnel;
(iv) prevention of theft and pilferage by installing secure
tamperproof meter enclosures; and
(v) prompt disconnection and prosecution of consumers for
illegal use of electricity.
BPDB would prepare for IDA's review an analysis of the level of
system losses showing progress made upto December 31, 1985, and for each
succeeding six month period thereafter, until a level acceptable to IDA is
achieved (para 3.09):
(c) BPDB will implement its training program for strengthening the
Khulna Training Institute in accordance with an agreed time
schedule (para 3.12);



-38-
(d) IDA and BPDB will jointLy review BPDB's existing accounting
system (para 4.01);
(e) COB and BPDB will take all necessary measures to enable BPDB
to achieve a rate of return, on its average revalued net assets
in operation, of 5.0% in FY86, 7.5% in FY87, 8.5% in FY88, 9.0%
in FY89 and 10.0% in FY90 and thereafter (para 4.04);
(f) BPDB will implement its action program for the reduction of
accounts receivable and will ensure that, by June 30, 1988 and
thereafter, the accounts receivable will not exceed the equiv-
alent of the three preceding months' sales of eLectricity (para
4.07);
(g) BPDB will furnish to IDA, not later than nine months after the
*end of each financial year, certified copies of its financial
statements for that year and as will be audited by an independ-
ent auditor acceptable to IDA (para 4.09);
Ch) BPDB will revalue annually its fixed assets in operation in
a manner satisfactory to IDA (para 4.10); and
Ci) BPDB will insure or make arrangements for insurance of its
property or assets, in such kinds and amounts as shall be
consistent with appropriate public utility practice and accept-
able to IDA. In this regard BPDB agreed to submit to IDA by
December 31, 1986 a draft scheme for establishing a fund from
its own resources to cover the insurance risks. BPDB agreed to
implement the scheme promptly thereafter, taking into account
IDA's comments (para 4.16).
6.03    The following conditions would be met before the proposed Credit
is declared effective:
(a) GOB will approve the Project proforma for carrying out the
proposed Project (para 3.01);
(b) BPDB will appoint consultant of international repute to, review
design and bidding documents prepared by the local consultants
for local distribution work, supervise the Project during
construction (except local distribution work), and train BPDB
staff in hot line techniques of maintenance and erection of
distribution lines (para 3.07);
(c) BPDB will appoint a Project Director, with qualification and
experience satisfactory to IDA (para 3.13);



-39-
(d) the aggregate accounts receivable due to BPDB in respect of
electricity supplied to GOB would be reduced to a level satis-
factory to IDA (para 4.07); and
(e) a subsidiary loan agreement is executed between GOB and BPDB
(para 4.15).
6.04    The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$56.0 million.

BANGLADESH
BANGLADESH POWER DEVELPHENT BOARD (BPDB)
TMANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The scope of the technical assistance provided under the Project is
summarized below:
Consulting Services
1.      Consulting services of international experience are being provided for
following works:
(a)  review of the bidding documents related to 132-kV substations; and
(b) review of the bidding documents related to low voltage distribution
works, supervision of the Project during construction and training
BPDB staff.
2.      In addition, a provision has also been made for local consulting
engineers to prepare engineering design and bidding documents for local dis-
tribution works.
3.      UNDP is providing technical assistance for the following works:
(a)  assistance to BPDB's planning units to reinforce its local dis-
tribution systems, to identify areas of high system losses and to
recommend a rehabilitation program;
(b) assistance by one commercial manager, one meter engineer and five
meter technicians to help BPDB in streamlining its comnercial
functions as part of its loss reduction program; and
(c) undertaking a study for setting tariffs based on long-run marginal
cost, investigating the implications of various subsidies and
evolving a methodology for revaluing the fixed assets of BPDB.

Computerized System
4.      It is necessary for BPDB to introduce a computerized billing system
consistent with normal utility practices. At present all billing is done
manually which not only delays the delivery of bills to the consumers but also
introduces errors. ADB in their sixth power project loan has provided US$1.7
million as phase I of their computerization program. BPDB is inviting proposals
from consultants. BPDB would furnish a program to IDA for introducing a com-
puterized billing system and taking into consideration IDA's comments would
implement the program in a timely manner.
Training
5.      One of the main reasons for an unreliable power supply in Bangladesh
has been the Lack of regular preventive maintenance by BPDB which in turn is
due to nonavailability of spare parts and insufficient number of trained person-
nel. To solve the trained manpower problem, BPDB has set up foLlowing training
institutions for its employees;
Kaptai Engineering Academy;
Tongi Regional Training Institute;
Chorasal Regional Training Center;
Chittagong Regional Training Center;
Khulna Regional Training Center; and
Rajshahi Regional Training Center.
6.      All the institucions, except Kaptai Engineering Academy, are under the
charge of the Director Training and Career Development; the Engineering Academy
at Kaptai is under the administrative charge of Director, Engineering Academy,
Kaptai. During FY's 82, 83 and 84 about 6,000 employees were trained in these
institutions through seminars, specialized induction and management courses.
The trainees varied from linesmen and helpers to senior staff including Superin-
tending Engineers. About 134 employees were deputed abroad under various spon-
sorship programs for a period of 332 man months. Apart from IDA, BPDB received
assistance from ADB, UNDP, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Italy, Norway
and UK to develop its training program.
7.      Under Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit 936-BD), IDA
is financing to upgrade the training center at Khulna to provide improved train-
ing facilities for power distribution specialists (foremen, linesmen, cable
jointers). Under the project a provision of US$500,000 is being made to provide
necessary tools and to impart necessary training to BPDB staff at this training
center in "hot line method" of maintenance and erection. US$300,000 would be
used to meet the cost of new tools and equipment and US$200,000 would be used to
meet the cost of foreign expenditure of BPDB staff for overseas training.

Annex 10
Page 3 of 3
During negotiation, a timetable for the procurement of tools, equipment and
assignment of BPDB's staff for training abroad has been agreed.
8. Contribution by BPDB
BPDB would appoint counterpart staff with all the consulting engineers
so that it can effectively implement its loss reduction program and improve its
quality of work in the engineering, finance and accounting departments.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Technical Justification
The proposed Project was prepared by BPDB using appropriate load
flow studies to extend and reinforce the transmission and distribution
systems to meet the future demand for electricity at least cost. The
three 132kV lines (Ishurdi to Bogra, Shahjihazar to Chattak, and Bheramara
to Barisal) are designed as doubLe circuit lines and one circuit already
exists. All 132-kV substations already exist and only reinforcement bas
been provided to meet the increased load demand, improve the system
reliability, reduce system losses and stabilize voltage conditions. The
conditions on the Ishurdi-Bogra line are very critical because voltage as
low as 114-kV (as compared to normal voltage of 132-kV:j has been observed.
With the stringing of the second circuit the operating conditions will
improve. The reinforcement of Shahjibazar-Chattak L.ne would enable BPDB
to connect captive industrial load of a fertilizer factory, Fenchuganj
(23MW), cement factory Chattak (6MW) and paper factory Chattak (6MW) to
its grid system. The reinforcement of Bheramara - Barisal line would
enable BPDB to use thermal power stations in the east zone to their maxi-
mum capacity and thus reduce the costly generation, using imported oil, in
the west zcne.
The existing distribution networks, consisting of 33-kV and LV
lines and substations, in the 14 towns included in the proposed Project
require reinforcement to meet forecast load growth. Existing maximum
demands in these towns are shown in Annex 7, together with forecast maxi-
mum demands in 1990. The 33-kV networks are being fed from sixteen 132-kV
substations included in the proposed Project. BPDB both has approached
and is approaching other donors for funding the reinforcement of 33-kV
networks in other towns. ADB (sixth power project) has agreed recently to
finance distribution network rehabilitation and expansion in 18 major
towns. Since the proposed Project involves the rehabilitation and exten-
sion of existing distribution systems, least cost analysis, say in terms
of alternative supply from isolated diesel sets, was not undertaken. The
components of lines and substations required for reinforcement are shown
in Annex 7, and supporting calculations and drawings are on the Project
File. The criteria used by BPDB to select the 14 towns included; the
number of existing and forecast consumers, existing and forecast elcc-
tricity consumption, and the administrative and economic importance of
the town, with preference being given to those with higher load factor
and/or economically important loads (principally industrial loads). Page
2 of Annex 7 shows that the reinforcement of the networks in the 14 towns
would serve about 31,000 additional singie phase and 1450 additional three
phase consumers by 1990.

Annex 20
Page 2 of 2
The aggregate maximum demand of the 14 towns is projected to be
50.3 NW in FY90 (Annex 7) and the incremental demand about 28 NW. Assum-
ing a diversity factor of 0.9 and the overall system load factor of 0.55,
the annual energy required would be about 122 GWh. Using an average
tariff rate of Tk 1.64/kWh and an additional 3.5Z of revenue to allow for
connection charges and meter charges etc., the total revenue (in 1985
prices) would be Tk 207 million or US$ 6.9 million. The estimated cost
(in 1985 prices) of network reinforcement in these towns (including physi-
cal contingencies and consulting fees) is estimated at USS 25.5 million.
Since the annual revenue is a sizeable portion of the investment cost
(about 27%), the reinforcement of the networks in these towns is jus-
tified.

Transmission and Distribution Project
Economic Internal Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral part
of BPDB's expansion plan and, therefore, cost-benefit analysis needs to be
carried out on the whole plan rather than on the project in isolation. BPDB's
investment program for the period 1985-1992 has, therefore, been analysed.
Capital costs, incremental operation and maintenance costs, incremental fuel
cost (all in terms of mid-1985 prices), and benefit streams are all shown in
Table 1. Assumptions underlying these figures are detailed below.
Capital Costs
Anticipated capital expenditure on generation, transmission and dis-
tribution at financial prices was converted to economic prices by (i) expressing
the import content at cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled local labor at 0.75 of
the market wage rate; and (iii) applying the estimated standard conversion
factor, 0.80, to local costs.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
Incremental annuaL operating and maintenance costs were estimated as the
following percentages of capital value: generating plant 2.08S, transmission
2Z, and distribution 4%.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs, estimated on an economic basis, were as follows: natural
gas Tk33/MCF, HSD Tk 32.81/gln, and fuel oil Tk 24.54/gln.  The economic costs
in Table 1 were derived as the product of the economic cost of generation and
the yearly increase in generation (Glh) shown in Table 2. The economic cost of
generation was derived using the fuel consumption forecast given in Table 4 and
the generation forecast given in Annex 19.
Case 1. Benefits
Case 1 benefits are based solely on incremental revenue at existing
tariff levels. Incremental sales attributable to the investment program are
shown in Table 2. These allow for reduced system losses in accordance with the
targets given in para 2.11.  The average revenue of Tk 1.64/kih in FY86 was



-66-
ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 7
taken to represent the weighted average tariff rate defined over ezisting
tariffs. On this basis the rate of return is about 9.6Z.
Case 2. Benefits
Case 2 benefits are equal to consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for
electricity measured by the costs of the alternative methods of meeting their
demands for lighting, irrigation pumping, etc. which are displaced by elec-
tricity (details are given in the project file). The economic internal rate of
return (EIRk) on this basis is about 12.7X. This is a lower-bound estimate of
EIRB. It assumes that consumers' WTP pay for non-technical system losses (which
relate to meter reading and billing errors, theft, etc.) is zero, whereas WTP
for the consumption represented by these losses will be positive. The assign-
ment of a WTP value to non-technical losses would increase the estimated EIRR.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming 1OX and 20% increases in
revenue, 10% increase and decrease in generation, 10X increase in capital cost
and 10% decrease in willingness to pay (WTP). All the results are summarized in
Table 5.

1/   The table shows the percentage change, compared with base case value.,
required to make the EIII equal to any rate shown in the first column.
Thus the EIRR would fall to 51 if the capital costs were increased by
about 116S or benefits were decreased by 32Z.
N.A. Not applicable, the percentage decrease in costs would have to exceed
100X, meaning that 0 & K costs and fuel costs would have to be negative.
