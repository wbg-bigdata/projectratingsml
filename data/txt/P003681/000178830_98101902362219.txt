CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:           Government of Fiji
Amount:             $18 million equivalent
Terms:              15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest
at 9.25% per annum.
Project
Description:      The proposed project provides for reconstruction of roads
and drainage works damaged by cyclone "Wally" which hit
Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island, in April 1980. Works
will include reconstruction and realignment of a 32 km
section of the Suva-Nadi highway; restoration of seawalls,
outfall structures, and drains for about 12,000 ha; and
dredging of rivers to remove flood-deposited sediments and
thereby restore their flood discharge capacity.
The proposed reconstruction of the 32 km long section of
the Suva-Nadi highway would eliminate the problems of an
unstable alignment subject to landslide and thereby reduce
disruptions to traffic and avoid the need for costly
repairs and maintenance. The benefits due to the
restoration and expansion of the drainage works would be in
bringing cyclone-damaged land back into production and
providing conditions for further expansion of cultivation.
There are no institutional risks since PWD and DID have
considerable experience in works similar to those included
in the project. The cost of the highway component may
exceed estimates if unusually severe storms damage work
in progress but this would not jeopardize the successful
completion of the project.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO FIJI FOR A CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Fiji for the equivalent of US$18.0 million to help finance the
Cyclone Reconstruction Project. The loan would have a term of 15 years,
including three years of grace, with interest at 9.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Fiji:  Selected Development
Issues" (No. 3025-FIJ) is dated August 21, 1980. Basic country data are
given in Annex I.
3.        Fiji attained independence from Britain in October 1970.  It is
composed of a group of over 300 islands in the South Pacific with a total
land area of some 18,000 sq km. It has a population of about 600,000 of
which about 90% live on the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.
Indigenous Fijians (about 44% of the population) and citizens of Indian
origin (almost 50%) comprise the main elements of Fiji-s multiracial society.
4.        A noteworthy feature of Fiji-s development has been the substantial
reduction in the rate of population growth, from 3.3% in the early 1960s to
about 1.8% at present. The Government's active and successful family plan-
ning progLam, cilanging social habits and rising incomes have all contributed
to this trend. Equally significant, the Indian population has tended to
grow at a lower rate than the Fijian population, largely due to the declining
birth raee2 and higher emigration amongst Indians compared to Fijians.
5.        Re<^l GDP has increased at the average annual rate of 5% between
1970-79. Until the early 1960s, Fiji was primarily an agricultural economy,
relying heavily on sugar production as the main generator of incomes, employ-
ment and export earnings. However, the last decade witnessed a profound
structural change, with tourism and related activities emerging as the major
source of growth. At the same time, output in agriculture, forestry and
fisheries stagnated and, as a result, the sector's share in GDP fell from
about one third to one fifth. Mainly due to growth of tourism, the services
sector now contributes about three fifths of GDP.
6.        Because of the slowdown in economic growth during 1975-78, the
average annual rate of growth in real GDP over the present plan period,
1976-80, is expected to be about 4.5%, compared to the planned target of 7%.
Poor performance of agricultural production other than sugar, stagnation in



tourism during the early years of the plan period, sluggish private invest-
ment and world-wide recession are among the main factors that account for
this shortfall.  On the other hand, government spending provided a much-
needed stimulus to the economy. In aggregate, government development
expenditures are expected to reach 90% of the planned amounts by the end of
the plan period.
7.         One consequence of slow growth that is viewed with great concern
in the country is unemployment. The rate of unemployment (estimated at 9%)
cannot be measured precisely but, with an estimated 10,000 school leavers
joining the labor force annually and paid employment stagnating over the
last five years, it is likely to have increased in recent years. Available
statistics suggest that unemployment is particularly high among the recent
school leavers aged between 15 and 19 years.  The Government recognizes that
job creation must be accorded high priority in the country's next development
plan if a serious unemployment rate is to be avoided.
8.         The Government is giving increasing attention to policy initiatives
needed to stimulate private investment, particularly in the industrial sec-
tor. However, the small size of the domestic market, large distances from
possible export markets and relatively high wage costs have restricted indus-
trial development so far. Industrial output contributes only 10% to GDP,
and one half of even this low proportion is related to sugar. To encourage
the establishment of suitable industries, higher tax concessions were
provided in the last budget, and other measures are under consideration.
Additionally, the Government has proposed the establishment of an Economic
Development Board, with representation from both private and public sectors,
to advise the Government on economic issues, including private investment
and employment.
9.        Over the present plan period, domestic resources are likely to
finance a much higher proportion (70%) of the development expenditures than
anticipated in the plan (50%). The annual share of the surplus in the cur-
rent budget has, however, declined in real terms due to the combined effects
of a substantial expansion in recurrent expenditures and a less rapid growth
in recurrent revenues. Concerned by this, the Government appointed an inde-
pendent Financial Review Committee. A number of the Committee-s recommenda-
tions for restraining expenditures and raising revenues were reflected in
the 1980 budget.
10.       The country's Eighth Development Plan covering 1981-85 is currently
under preparation and is expected to emphasize more rapid and diversified
agricultural development; reduction in the country's high food import bill
through import substitution; industrial development for local needs as well
as exports; creation of more jobs, particularly for the 15-19 age group;
and a more equitable distribution of personal and regional incomes. Given
the country s agricultural potential, the prospects for a satisfactory rate
of growth are reasonably good. There will be significant opportunities for



- 3 -
reducing the country's relative dependence on sugar. The fishing industry
should, in particular, become increasingly important, and the pine scheme,
under which one half of the targeted area of 60,000 hectares has already
been planted, should also begin to contribute to export receipts.
Revitalization of the agricultural sector is also essential for raising
incomes of the poorest group in the country, the Fijian farmers, who derive
a high proportion of their incomes from subsistence production.
11.       Achieving a satisfactory rate of growth over the next plan period
will require an increased use of external financing as well as much greater
mobilization of domestic resources than in the past. Fiji has not tradi-
tionally relied heavily on external resources. Reflecting this, the coun-
try's debt servicing ratio remains moderate. At the end of 1978, the level
of external debt was about US$144 million, of which about US$80 million was
public. Debt service payments were about 10% of exports of goods and nonfac-
tor services. The debt service ratio should not rise rapidly over the plan
period provided a fuller use is made of possibilities for financing from
multilateral and bilateral sources. Fiji's capacity for project identifica-
tion and preparation is limited and will require strengthening.
12.       Fiji is also in need of further external assistance to deal with
damage inflicted by cyclone "Wally" in April 1980. The cost of reconstruc-
tion is estimated at about F$50-60 million, or about the same level as the
country's annual development budget. Infrastructure was more seriously
affected than agricultural production. Roads, water supplies, telecommuni-
cations, drainage and housing suffered considerable damage. In the
agricultural sector, livestock and production of rice, vegetables and root
crops sustained heavy losses. Tourism is also likely to be adversely
affected due to the publicity associated with the cyclone. Fortunately, the
sugar crop was only marginally affected, and with the expected record sugar
crop and buoyant prices, the growth and balance of payments prospects for
the current year remain favorable. Nonetheless, without generous outside
support, Fiji would have to divert a large proportion of its scarce
financial resources from development to reconstruction.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       The Bank has so far made seven loans to Fiji totaling US$65.7
million, for six projects in agriculture, power, telecommunications and
transportation (one of the seven loans provided supplemental financing for a
highway project). Implementation of these projects has generally been
satisfactory, though the highway project was subject to delays and cost
overruns. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as well as
notes on the execution of ongoing projects. There has been no IFC involve-
ment in Fiji in the past. The possibility of an IFC investment in the
pine industry is being explored.



- 4 -
14.       Increasing agricultural production will continue to be a major
objective of Bank assistance. The agricultural sector represents Fiji's best
potenl-ial for raising rural incomes, substituting for imports, and expanding
export:s. Realization of this potential would call for a larger allocation of
resources to the sector, diversification of crops, development of new lands,
and increased productivity. Programs for agricultural development must also
take into account the differing characteristics of the two rural communities
- the Fijians and the Indians. Fijian agriculture is largely traditional
subsistence farming based on the cultivation of root crops. Indian farming,
on the other hand, is more market-oriented and consists of smallholder
sugarcane with subsistence rice and vegetable production.
15.       Two agricultural projects are under consideration.  The first would
assisi: Fiji's pine plantation scheme. Aside from its employment-creating
potential, the scheme offers considerable scope for diversifying Fiji's
export:s. The second, and much more difficult project in the agricultural
sector would aim at assisting smallholders through the provision of infra-
struct:ure, extension, credit, marketing, processing, and storage facilities
and would encompass both Indian and Fijian farmers.
16.       Future Bank lending will focus on:  export expansion; import
substitution; opportunities for subsistence families to earn cash incomes;
and selective infrastructure development with particular emphasis on projects
that would bring about significant foreign exchange savings or contribute
directly to the development of the rural areas. In view of the limitation of
Fiji's overall absorptive capacity, the Bank would also focus on institution
building, particularly in the agricultural sector.
PART III - THE CYCLONE
17.       Between April 1 and April 5, 1980, torrential rain, triggered by
cyclor.e "Wally", fell on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu. The
maximum observed rainfall during the storm was 1,300 mm (51 inches) and the
peak 24-hour rainfall was 850 mm (33 inches). This cyclone was preceded ten
days earlier by cyclone "Tia" which did relatively little damage but
saturated the mountain catchment areas and thereby intensified flood runoff.
Cyclone "Wally", regarded as the worst tropical storm in Fiji's history,
caused. 20 deaths, rendered 10,000 homeless and led to a heavy loss of crops
and livestock.
18.       Most of the damage was caused by floods and landslides; wind damage
was relatively light. Massive landslides throughout the mountains bordering
the southeast coast destroyed roads and bridges, swept away villages and
dumped vast quantities of sediment in the rivers which reached unprecedented
flood levels. The farm lands and villages in the deltas of the Rewa, Navua
and other rivers were badly hit by flooding and by silt and clay deposits
reaching depths of up to one meter in places. About 4,500 ha of farm land
were damaged by silt flows. The silt contains no organic matter or nutrients



since it is derived from the lateritic soils overlying bedrock in the
catchments of the rivers. Drains and stream channels throughout the
agricultural areas were filled with sediment. The floods destroyed seawalls
and tidal outfalls and this exposed lowlying areas to sea water intrusion.
The enormous ;3ediment runoff choked the lower reaches of the Rewa and Navua
rivers with sandbanks and gravel bars which have impeded navigation and
drastically reduced their flood capacity.
19.       The most severe damage to roads occurred along the highway linking
two major urban centers: Suva, the capital, and Nadi. There were several
major landslides between Suva and Deuba and bridges and carriageways were
washed away in several places. In the first 32 km between Deuba and
Nabutini, the road was so badly damaged it took two months for it to be
reopened. Numerous main roads and country roads in the southeastern part of
Viti Levu were also very badly damaged. Other major damage to infrastructure
included inundation of the pumping station supplying 80% of Suva's water and
destruction of part of the delivery pipeline, and extensive damage to
telephone and power lines.
20.       Government agencies and Fiji's armed services moved rapidly to
provide emergency shelter, food, and water to the homeless, and to restore the
roads, telephone and water supply systems. The New Zealand Air Force provided
two helicopters for rescue and relief efforts, and the Australian Navy
provided medical teams. A number of countries and the United Nations Disaster
Relief Organization (UNDRO) provided immediate donations of cash and supplies,
and larger donations were made later to help Fiji in its recovery from the
cyclone (Annex IV, Table 8). The Governing Council of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) also agreed to provide Fiji with a grant of
US$1,000,000 to help finance the technical assistance needed for
reconstruction of damaged infrastructure.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
21.       The Government of Fiji requested Bank assistance on May 8, 1980 in
financing the reconstruction of roads and drainage works damaged by the
cyclone and provided a proposal for their reconstruction program on June 26,
1980. An appraisal mission, comprising Messrs. W.T. Smith (AEPIR),
A. Tsantis, Y. Kimura (AEADD), and P. Gil (CTR), visited Fiji from July 3 to
14 to discuss the Government's proposal and to determine where Bank partici-
pation would be most effective. The proposed project has been formulated on
the basis of the mission's findings. In view of the urgent nature of this
project, no Staff Appraisal Report has been prepared. Negotiations were held
in Washington on October 6, 1980. The Fiji delegation was led by Mr. Winston
Thompson, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance. Supplementary project
data are provided in Annexes III and IV.



-6-
Project Description
22.        The proposed project provides for reconstruction of roads and
drairLage works damaged by the cyclone. The principal features are:
(a) reconstruction, improvement and, where necessary, realignment
of a 32 km section of the Suva-Nadi highway between Deuba
and Nabutini;
(b) reconstruction and improvement of drainage works for some
12,000 ha of land along the southeast coast of Viti Levu
including 50 km of seawalls, 30 tidal outfall structures,
and 250 km of drains;
(c) dredging of about three million cu m of flood-deposited
sand and gravel to restore the flood discharge capacity of
the Navua, Nasouri, and Rewa rivers, and other smaller
rivers; and
(d) procurement of construction equipment for executing part of the
above works by force account.
Highway Reconstruction
23.        The Suva-Nadi highway, traversing a distance of 175 km, is
divided into three sections from west to east: Nadi-Korotogo (Section I),
Korotogo-Nabutini-Deuba (Section II) and Deuba-Suva (Section III).
Upgrading of 108 km of the highway was carried out with the help of
Bank-financing (Loan 771-FIJ) between 1971 and 1978. Under that project, 66
km of road from Nadi to Korotogo (Section I) and 42 km from Suva to Deuba
(Section III) were realigned, widened, and provided with a bituminous
surface. Thus, at the time of the cyclone, the central 67 km long section of
road between Deuba and Korotogo (Section II) was gravel-surfaced and
constructed to lower geometric standards than Sections I and III. The most
severe damage occurred in the eastern half of Section II between Deuba and
Nabutini where, in a total length of 32 km, there were eight major
landslides in a 10 km stretch of road, two major bridges were destroyed, and
over 5 km of highway was covered by silt flows. Most of the landslides
occurred where the road passes through mountainous terrain with numerous
sharp curves and steep gradients.
24.        Following the cyclone, work was concentrated on the more important
Suva-Deuba section and a 46 km section extending to the east from Korotogo.
Clearing of these sections allowed work to begin on the mountain section
late in April and, after a major earthmoving operation mounted by the Public
Works Department (PWD), the road was opened early in June. However, there
are numerous places along the Deuba-Nabutini section where heavy rains are
likely to cause further landslides. On the uphill side of the road, the
slides have left steep and unstable slopes which would require vast
quantities of earthmoving to render them safe. There are also areas where the



- 7 -
original alignment had to be abandoned and the road benched on the unconsoli-
dated slide material. The PWD has therefore concluded that parts of the
highway through the mountains will have to be realigned since it would be
impossible to achieve any reasonable degree of stability on the present
alignment.
25.       The proposed realignment (see Map 15258) will form part of a
scheme, recently approved by the Cabinet, to upgrade section II (Deuba-
Nabutini-Korotogo) by widening and providing a bituminous surface for the
entire 67 km which is now gravel surfaced. The Deuba-Nabutini section
(32 km) which would be financed by the proposed project would account for
nearly 80% of the cost of Section II because the bulk of the earthwork is in
the new alignment through the mountains. The road would have a width of
7.3 m with 1.5 m shoulders. PWD considered the possibility of reducing
the pavement width in the sections where the road passes through rugged
terrain. However, it was decided to retain the 7.3 m width to avoid the
difficult task of future widening, but to relax standards governing sight
distance, minimum radius and grade, and to reduce shoulder width where
appropriate. The proposed design of the pavement and the geometric standards
are shown in Annex IV, Table 4. To minimize costs, the existing alignment
would be followed for about 12 km of the 32 km covered by the project.
Drainage Works
26.       Cyclone damage included breaches in the seawalls, destruction of
tidal outfalls, and silting up of natural streams and drains. Severe damage
was caused to land, mostly in the Navua area, by silt flows which covered
some 4,500 ha. Of the 7,150 ha of cultivated land in the project area,
about 2,000 ha of pasture were damaged by silt flows and standing crops were
destroyed on 1,600 ha. The proposed drainage works will assist in
reclaiming land damaged by tidal inundation and silt flows and improve
surface drainage in the undamaged areas to allow more intensive and
productive land use on a gross area of about 12,000 ha. Similar works are
being constructed on the north coast of Viti Levu under the Bank-financed
Sugar Development Project (Loan 1226-FIJ).
27.       The works would be carried out in 10 subprojects coming under the
jurisdiction of three Drainage Boards. The Navua Drainage Board covers about
4,900 ha, of which 3,950 ha is in the delta of the Navua River and the
remainder is in four subprojects to the west and east of the river. The
Nausori Drainage Board covers about 5,100 ha, consisting of three contiguous
subprojects in the delta of the Rewa river. The Naitasiri Drainage Board
covers 1,950 ha, mostly comprising land bordering the Rewa river upstream of
its delta. Drainage Boards are empowered under the Drainage Ordinance to
maintain, improve and construct drainage works, enter into contracts, control
livestock, conduct surveys and undertake other matters relating to drainage
works. The Boards have the power to levy drainage rates which, together with
any grants, are paid into a Drainage Fund. For the proposed project, the
Government would construct the works and turn them over to the Drainage
Boards for maintenance.



- 8 -
28.       The existing seawalls, which serve to protect low-lying agricultural
land from inundation at high tides, were breached in twelve locations by
flood flows originating on the landward side. About 50 km of seawalls would
be constructed to close the breaches and extend protection to areas
vulnerable to tidal inundation. The seawalls would be between one and two
meters high with a 4 m wide gravel-surfaced crest; if used as public road,
the width would be 6 to 7 m. In the past, seawalls have been damaged by
crabs burrowing into the fill and this has led to piping and ultimate
failure.  This problem can be avoided by using fill free of any organic
material. Deposits of suitable lateritic fill material are available within
a reasonable haul distance of the seawalls. A shallow cut-off, about one
meter deep, has been found effective in preventing burrowing in the
foundation of the seawalls.
29.       Tidal Outfall Structures.  Most of the existing outfalls were
destroyed or badly damaged during the cyclone and will be replaced by new
works. These structures, located where the main drains enter the sea, would
be equipped with gates that open on the falling tide to release drainage
flows and close on the rising tide to prevent sea water intrusion. A
standard design, which has proved very successful in the Sugar Development
Project, consists of 2.7 m x 1.5 m box culverts with vertically-hinged miter
gates. Several units may be combined depending on the required discharge
capacities. For some cases, where the drainage areas are small, concrete
pipes fitted with flap gates would be used. The effect of these outfall
structures is to hold water levels in the internal drainage systems at about
the low tide level, except for two or three days following heavy rain.
Thus, they promote better surface drainage, help to lower the water table,
and prevent salt water intrusion.
30.       Internal Drains.  Some 100 km of man-made drains and about 50 km
of natural drainage channels were silted up by the storm. The proposed
project would include reconstruction of the man-made drains, construction of
150 km of new drains, and the clearing of natural channels. Priority would
be given to areas waterlogged following failure of the tidal gates and to
the areas damaged by silt flows, where drainage is needed before any
remedial measures can be taken. Where the silt is not too deep (less than
30 cm) it would be plowed in and mixed with the original soil. Elsewhere,
the silt would be fertilized and planted to a green manure crop in order to
introduce some organic matter. However, until drainage is restored, the
land in most areas is too soft to support tractors. Therefore, reconstruc-
tion cf the internal drains is essential to reclaiming the areas damaged by
silt flows.
31.       Dredging.  During the cyclone, massive deposits of silt, sand and
gravel, occurred in lower reaches of the Navua and Rewa rivers and the estua-
ries of other coastal rivers. Numerous sand banks and gravel bars have
appeared where none existed before, which have closed the rivers to shallow
coastal vessels. Also, the raised bet levels will lead to much higher flood
levels. It is estimated that between 3 and 4 million cubic meters of mate-
rial, mostly silt and sand, will have to be removed to reopen the rivers to

navigation and to restore their flood discharge capacity. A Marine
Department dredger is presently working in the Navua river. This dredge has
a capacity of 200 cu m/hr. To expedite the clearing of the river, a second
300 cu m/hr dredge, with work boat, would be procured under the project.
This dredge would be operated by the Drainage and Irrigation Division so
that spoil disp_.sal can be coordinated with land reclamation behind the new
seawalls. Since disposal areas are a long distance from the river channels,
about 2,000 m of delivery pipe with a booster pump would be procured, and an
additional booster pump would be procured to increase the output of the
Marine Department dredge.
Implementing Agencies and Project Execution
32.       Highway reconstruction would be the responsibility of the Public
Works Department (PWD) in the Ministry of Works and Communications, which
would carry out the work by force account, using government-owned equipment,
including equipment procured under the project. PWD has considerable
experience in construction of roads by force account and builds about 160 km
of roads per year in difficult terrain. PWD's ability to handle a major
earthmoving operation was demonstrated by their performance in reopening the
Suva-Nadi road following the cyclone. On completion of the project the
equipment procured for highway reconstruction would be fully employed by PWD
in their normal construction and maintenance activities. At present PWD
maintains nearly 4,000 km of road in Fiji. The Department has three
regional offices, the Central, Northern and Western Divisions. The proposed
road reconstruction would be under the Principal Engineer, Central Division.
Surveys and designs would be carried out by the Design Division at
headquarters, and the Mechanical Equipment Division would be responsible for
taking delivery of project equipment, and for its deployment in the field.
33.       Given PWD-s construction capabilities, the alternative of construc-
ting the road by contract would not lead to significant savings in cost or
time of construction. It would not be practicable to divide the project
into small packages within the capacity of local firms and, therefore, the
alternative to force account would be a single large contract awarded
following international competitive bidding. This would probably be more
costly than force account because contractors, recognizing the difficult
conditions, would tend to provide a wide margin in their bids to cover
such events as landslides and tropical storms. PWD would, of course, have
to deal with such events if they occur, but the cost to the Government
would be the actual expenditures rather than the large contingencies built
into a contractor's unit prices. Construction by contract would also lead to
a late start on the works; designs, procurement and mobilization could
extend through July 1981 whereas, with force account, PWD would start work
in January 1981 using its own equipment.
34.       The drainage works would be the responsibility of the Drainage and
Irrigation Division (DID) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF).
DID has gained considerable experience in similar work in connection with the
Bank-financed Sugar Project (Loan 1226-FIJ). Local contractors have shown
their ability to construct seawalls and drains but they ran into difficulties



- 10 -
with the outfall structures which have therefore been built as a combined
effort of PWD and DID. It is expected that the seawalls and the internal
drains would be built by local contractors. The precast element of the
outfalls would be manufactured by local contractors, and the construction of
the out-falls would be by force account. DID would require several
additional engineers to implement the works and they would be provided under
the UNI)P grant for cyclone rehabilitation (para. 20). Dredging operations
would be handled by the Marine Department and DID (para. 31).
35.        Surveys and designs for the road would be completed in March 1981,
but work would begin January 1981 on improving the sections already designed
which follow the existing alignment. Bid invitations for construction
equipment have been prepared by the Government with the help of Bank procure-
ment specialists. These would be issued in early December 1980 and it is
expected that contracts would be awarded in time to allow most of the
equipment to be on site by the end of July 1981. With the arrival of this
equipment work on the road would be stepped up, a start would be made on the
drainage works, and the dredging work would be expanded. Construction
normally proceeds throughout the year in Fiji, but earth moving work
sometimes has to be curtailed during periods of heavy rain particularly
betweerL November and March. The project works are expected to be completed
by March 1984 which would be just over three years from the start of
construction in January 1981.
Agricultural Development Plan
36.       The proposed drainage works would not only restore drainage infra-
structure but would, over much of the 12,000 ha area, lead to a marked
improve.ment in drainage conditions compared to those prevailing prior to the
cyclone. In the past, poor drainage has been one of the factors causing the
relatively low intensity of land use of about 60% of the cultivable area.
However, if more intensive cultivation is to be achieved, a number of issues
must be addressed, such as land tenure, markets, and agricultural supporting
services.
37.       Land tenure in the 12,000 ha area can be broadly divided into four
categories: Freehold (38%), Crown land (9%), Native Land, Inside Reserve
(27%) and Native Land, Outside Reserve (26%). Except for a large block of
land (about 2,000 ha) owned by the Fiji Pastoral Company, most of the free-
hold land is farmed in 2 to 4 ha units. Holdings of Crown Land are generally
in the 4 to 8 ha range. Native Land, Inside Reserve, which is reserved for
the sole use of indigenous Fijians, is less than 50% cultivated in some large
communally-owned blocks. Very little use is presently made of Native Land
Outside Reserve; such land can be leased to individuals other than Fijians.
38.       Of the 7,150 ha cultivated prior to the cyclone, about 2,850 ha was
devoted to pasture, 2,300 ha rice, 800 ha root crops (tapioca, dalo), 800 ha
coconuts, 300 ha vegetables, and 100 ha maize. It is estimated that because



- 11 -
of the cyclone the cultivated area will be limited in 1981 to less than 5,000
ha. Restoration of the drainage system should allow the cultivated area to
increase to the original area by 1983 and MAF estimates that by 1985 the
cultivated area should reach 8,200 ha. More detailed forecasts of future
growth will be possible as a result of the agricultural plannJ.i-g exercise
described below.
39.       In order to exploit the agricultural potential which would be
created by the drainage works, MAF, with technical assistance provided under
the UNDP Cyclone Rehabilitation Project (para. 20), would carry out in-depth
investigations and analyses and prepare a detailed agricultural development
plan for the area served by the three Drainage Boards. It is intended to
employ a two-stage approach. The first stage would be carried out early in
1981 in the form of a reconnaissance in which a team of experts would
evaluate the basic data being collected by MAF and advise MAF on the nature
of further investigations and the scope, timing, and manmonth input of
various specialists for the second phase. The aim of the second phase would
be to produce an action program for agricultural development in the project
area. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that such an action
program would be submitted to the Bank for review and comment by December 31,
1982 (Section 3.04, draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost Estimates and Financing
40.       The project cost is estimated at US$31 million of which the
foreign exchange component is US$18 million or 58% of the total cost. The
proposed Bank loan of US$18 million would cover the foreign exchange cost
and the remainder would be met by the Government. Cost estimates for
highway reconstruction are based on PWD's cost experience expressed as costs
per kilometer for the three different types of terrain to be encountered,
(i.e. rugged, rolling, and flat), supplemented by detailed studies recently
carried out by PWD for typical sections of the proposed alignment. Costs for
the drainage works are based on DID's experience on the Bank-financed Sugar
Development Project. Unit costs for dredging are the estimated cost of
operating personnel, fuel, and spare parts. All costs for force account
works exclude depreciation of equipment procured for the project. Equipment
costs are based on recent bid prices. Project costs are expressed in January
1981 prices. About 15% of the total cost is represented by taxes and duties,
primarily by taxes levied on fuel consumed by construction equipment.
Physical contingencies of 15% have been added for civil works and 5% for
equipment. Expected price increases are based on the following estimates of
annual price escalation: 1981 - 9.0%, 1982 - 8.0%, and 1983-84 - 7.0%.
Project cost estimates are shown in the Loan and Project Sumtary and a
detailed breakdown is given in Annex IV, Table 2.
Procurement
41.       For reasons given in para. 33, the reconstruction of the highway
between Deuba and Nabutini would be by force account. As regards the



- 12 -
drainage works, contractors would be employed for the seawalls and drains,
but clearing of drains and construction of outfalls would be by force
account. Government-owned dredges, one of them provided under the project,
would be used for dredging operations. The total value of work executed
by force account would be about US$19 million. Civil works contracts for
the drainage component, with a total value of US$3.7 million, would be
divided into packages of about US$300,000 and awarded following competitive
bidding in accordance with local procedures which are acceptable to the
Bank.
42.       Vehicles and equipment (US$6.5 million) would be procured follow-
ing international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty if
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Vehicles and equipment costing less than US$50,000 each and limited to a
total of US$500,000, which are not practicable for international tendering,
would be purchased through normal government procurement procedures (local
competitive bidding or competitive quotations) which ensure adequate com-
petition.
Disbursements
43.       Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made at the rate of 100%
against the foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equipment,
or the ex-factory price net of taxes for items manufactured locally, and at
a rate of 65% of total costs for imported items procured locally. Disburse-
ments for civil works would be at 50% of total expenditures, to be disbursed
against periodic contractors' progress payments or, in the case of force
account works, statements of expenditure based on physical work completed and
unit costs agreed by the Bank and the implementing agencies. It is expected
that disbursement would be completed by June 30, 1984.
Accounts and Audits
44.       Both PWD and DID are subject to normal government control and audit
procedures. Assurances were obtained that:
(a) each agency would maintain separate accounts for the project;
(b) these accounts would be audited by the Government's Auditor
General, or other auditor satisfactory to the Bank; and
(c) each agency would submit audited project accounts, together with
auditor's comments to the Bank within nine months of the close of
the financial year.
Rate of Return, Benefits and Risks
45.       The proposed reconstruction of the 32 km long section of the Suva-
Nadi highway would eliminate the problems of an unstable alignment subject



- 13 -
to landslide and thereby reduce disruptions to traffic and avoid the need
for costly repairs and maintenance. The economic rate of return has been
estimated for the upgrading of the presently unpaved section (Section II)
between Deuba and Korotogo. This shows that with modest assumptions of
traffic growth (6% per annum) from the estimated 1984 traffic of 1,540
vehicles/day, the benefits due to road-user cost savings would produce an
economic rate of return of about 16%. This does not take into account the
significant benefit due to a more stable alignment which would be difficult
to quantify. A sensitivity analysis shows that reducing traffic growth to
3% would reduce the ERR to 12%. The benefits due to the restoration and
expansion of the drainage works would be in bringing cyclone-damaged land
back into production and providing conditions for further expansion of
cultivation. Counting only the restoration of production on land cultivated
prior to the cyclone, the rate of return for the drainage works would be
about 15%. An overall rate of return for the project would be about 15%.
There are no institutional risks since PWD and DID have considerable
experience in works similar to those included in the project. The cost of
the highway component might exceed estimates if unusually severe storms
damage work in progress, but this would not jeopardize the project's
successful completion.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between Fiji and the Bank and the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.
47.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 1140-FIJ         Second Telecommunications Project:  US$5.0
Million Loan of July 16, 1975; Effectiveness Date:
October 23, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Progress with this project is satisfactory. It suffered some delay
in its early stages due to local investments restrictions imposed by the
Government in 1976 but much of the lost time has been recovered. Project
completion is now expected by December 1980, a delay of about 1 1/2 years
from the original schedule. The Government approved an increase in tariffs
during 1978 and this has strengthened P&T's financial position. An
additional tariff increase has also been approved effective January 1980
which should further improve P&T's finances.
Loan No. 1226-FIJ        Sugar Development Project:  US$12.0 Million Loan
of April 23, 1976; Effectiveness Date: July 13,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project consists of an 8,000 acre settlement scheme for more
than 400 families to grow sugarcane on previously uncultivated land, and
drainage improvement on 26,400 acres for about 2,000 other families on
traditional coastal sugarcane land. The settlement component, which accounts
for about 66% of project costs, is virtually complete and sugarcane
production from the settlement area has surpassed the target for the third
straight year. Progress on drainage improvement was delayed due to farmers
reluctanze to pay drainage rates, staffing problems and poor contractor per-
formance. Action has been taken to remedy the situation and performance has
been improved, but a one year delay in project completion is now likely.
Loan No. 1596-FIJ        Monasavu-Wailoa Hydroelectric Project:  US$15.0 Mil-
lion Loan of November 30, 1978; Effectiveness Date:
January 10, 1979; Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
Construction of the project is proceeding well. All major contracts
have been placed. River diversion was delayed by about a month to June 1980
as a result of flooding caused by a recent hurricane. Work on the main
tunnels for the water-conductor system has fallen behind the contract schedule
(which calls for completion by July 1, 1981). However, steps have been taken
to synchronize completion of the tunnels and steel lining to enable operation
'1  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

of the power station by the target date of December 1981. The cost of
the project has been increased by F$8 million or 16% above the original
estimate to about F$57 million.
Loan No. 1859-FIJ        Second Power Project:  US$ 15.5 Million Loan of
July 29, 1980; Effectiveness Date: September 26, 1980
Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
Raising the height of the Monasavu dam by 15 m has already begun in
conjunction with the first power project. The project provides for construc-
tion of two small diversion weirs to divert neighboring streams into the
Monasavu reservoir, extension of the civil works at Wailoa power station and
installation of two additional 20 MW generating sets. Since the Bank loan was
approved, the Government has deferred approval of a tariff increase. The
borrower, Fijian Electricity Authority (FEA) is planning to borrow
additional funds to make up for the expected loss of revenue following the
Government's decision, and is studying the implications with respect to the
rate of return and debt limitation covenants in the loan agreement.
