INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RFCOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit for a second education project to the Kingdom of Morocco for the
equivalent of US$8.5 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Association made a first credit of $11 million to Morocco
for education in 1965 (79-MOR). In November 1970 the Moroccan Government
submitted to IDA a request to finance a second education project which had
been prepared with the assistance of UNESCO.
3.        The mission which appraised the project in November/l}ecember 1970
found that certain project items required furthler preparatory work before
they could be considered for financing. It was therefore decided to defer
these items to a possible third education project.
4.        The credit for the newly defined seconcl project was negotiated
in Washington from June 11 to June 15. The Moroccan delegation was led by
Mr. Abdallah Fassi-Fihri from the Prime Minister's office. Mr. Abdelhafid
Benjamaa represented thie IMinistry of lHigher, Secondary and Technical Educa-
tion and Teacher Training (hereafter the "Ministry of Higher Education").
5.        The proposed credit would be the twelftih operation in Morocco by
the Bank and IDA. A summary statenment of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
May 31, 1971 is attachedl as Annex I. It shows that the Bank Group has
been active mostly in agriculture, in the financing of industry through the
Moroccan Banque Nationale pour le D)eveloppement Economique (BNDE) and, to a
lesser extent, in the financing of tourism (hotels), roads, and education.
6.        Several of the projects financed hiave presented problems.   Comple-
tiotl of an agricultural development project in the Sidi Slimane area, fi-
nanced iinder Loan 3839-MOR was delayed for a year, and thlere remnaiietd unutil-
Ized a balance of about $2.2 tnillion wh:ich was cancelled at the revised
closing date of Octoher 31, 1970.   The main reason for this situation was
that the Governmenct reduced tlie programn of farm Lmprovemenit and financed
part of it witth other funds.

7.        After a slow start most contracts for the Hiighway Project (Loan
167-nKOR and Credit 642-MOR) liave now buen let, or will soon be, and the
initial delay sliould be made good. Constrtiction of the dam included in
the Klharb-Sebou Irrigation Project (643-MOR) is going well, but delays
have occurred in some other parts of the project, particularly in land
consolidation, reorganization anid redistributioni of land thlrough the proj--
ect area, tlhe Government beingl; slow in putting into effect the Agricultur-
al Investment Code.   Recently the GovernmenLt has taken steps which, If
followed up), would overcome th(!sc probtlms.
8.        Execution of the first education project was very slow, so that
only $4.5 million, or 41 percent, of thie total credit hiad been disbursed by
the end of 1970.  Thte Government has llow taken steps to remedy administrative
shortcomings hampering project implementation and the processing of with-
drawal requests. Disbursements under the first project were brought up to
nearly 60 percent as of the end of June, and a new schedule of anticipated
withdrawals provides for 80 percent disbursement of the Credit by the end of
the year, witlh full disbursement by mid-1972. On the basis of these actions,
the Association agreed to postpone the closing date of the first credit for
the time being to December 31, 1971, and to negotiate the second education
credit now proposed.
9.        IFC holds $1 million, or 25 percent of the share capital of
Morocco's development finance company, the Banque Nationale pour le Devel-
oppeTient Economique (BINDE).  In 1966 IFC miiade an investment and a loan to-
taling about $1.4 nmillion in Compagnie Industrielle del Lukus (CIL), a com-
pany mainly engaged in thte processing and canning of vegetables.
10.       the pattern of past Bank Group lending in Morocco reflects the
priorities given in the five-vear plan to agriculture, industry, tourism
and education.   By channelinig an important part of its lendirng to the
BNDE (for industry), the Credit Immobitier et hlotelier (for tourism) and
the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (for agriculture), the Bank Group
supports the growthl of development credit instituticns in these sectors.
P.mtu^e lendling by the Bank Group would include projects similar to previous
ones:  agricultural credit and the CIII; and projects in new fields such as:
water supply, power development, and phosplhoric acid based on phosphates,
Morocco's principal mineral resource. In the longer run the Bank is also
giving attention to the possibilities of assisting Morocco in its regional
development and in its growing unempLoyment problem.
PIART II - TIE ECONOtTY
11.       A Report entitled "Economic Developnment and Prospects in Morocco"
(EMA-27a, dated September 30, 1970) was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors on October 16, 1970.   An economic mission visited Morocco in April/May
1971 and is preparing its report. A country data sheet is attached as
Annex Il.



- 3 -
12.       The Moroccan economy, helped by the excellent hiarvest in 1968 andl
above average harvests in 1969 and 1970, has moved further away from the
previous stagnation.   The buoyant sectors were construction, tourism, manu-
facturing and electricity; and commerce and transport followed suit. The
stagnant sector was mining, which suffered from stiff competition in the
phosphate markets and from poor grades of orc in other mines.    In 1970 GDP
in real terms rose by about 4.5 percent which was somewhat beLow the growth
rates in 1968 and 1969, and about the avelage for the last five years.    Th;1
population growth rate has been averaging 3.2 perceun per aniiumii.
13.       Fixed investment increased during the last five years at anl aver-
age annual rate of nearly 10% in real terms, bringing the level to about
16% of GDP in 1970, puLblic investment riccounting for 60 percent of fixed in-
vestment and private investment for /,0 percent.   Savings did n10, however,
keep up with the expansion of total investments, leaving a resoui X gap of
over: 4 percent of GDP.  Public savilgs f-itanced two-thirds of public invest-
ment in 1970 as compared to 45 percent in 1966. The overall cash deficit of
the central government was reduced slightly andi this, together with a small
rise in net foreign borrowing, enabled the Government to reduce its net bor-
rowing from the domestic market and from the Central Bank.
14.       The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments in-
creased considerably (from $40 million to $150 million) in 1970, clue almost
wholly to a rise in imports. Exports remained stable in value, the rise in
the amount of citrus and phosphate exports being offset by a drop in prices.
The net services account changed little, and the effect of a larger trade
deficit was offset by a larger inflow of public and private capital.
15.       Net foreign reserves increased somewlhat, bringing their level to
about one and a half months of imports. Public long-term external debt in-
creased by 12 percent to $636 million, and the dlebt service represented 8
percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1970. The debt service ratio is
expected to rise, possibly to 12 percent by 1976 and 20 percent in the
early 1980's, due mainly to the slow growth of exports, the need for a
higher rate of investment, and the increased repayment of long term debt.
Continuation of concessionary aid in the next few years is needed if the
debt burden is to be prevented from rising too fast.
16.       A fundamental problem for Morocco is the worsening unemployment,
at present estimated at 13 percent of the labor force.    The Government is
increasingly aware of the serious social and economic implications of unem--
ployment, especially since the migration from the countryside to the cities
is continuing at a rapid pace.   Large irrigation sclhemes are being developed
in an attempt to keep the population in the couLntryside, so far with little
success probably in part because the 1969 Agrarian Reform Law is being ap-
plied only slowly.   However, the present constrtuction boom and the growing
emigration provide some relief.   In the long run thie problem can be solved
only if economic growth quickens and population growth slows down.

17.       Ilie Bank chairs a Consultative Group for MAorocco wlhose members
are: Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, United Kingdom, the
United States, thie International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Devel-
opment Programme.  Thle Consultative Group met for thie first time in April
1967, atnd a fourth meeting of the group is planned for October 1971.
PART III - TIH' EDUCATION sECTroRt
18.       The educational system of Mlorocco is based upon tLle French system
and tends to follow chalnges in it. It providles for five years of primary
education, followed by seven years of secondary education divided into a
first cycle of four years and a second, more diversified, cycle of three
years. Iligher education is largely restricted to teacher training and uni-
versity studies, with little or no traininig for intermediate positions.
Tlhe language of instruction is Arabic in prinary schlools; in all others
Frenclh is used.
19.       Enrollment in primary schools grew rapidly from 1956-1964, but
sinc.e then h:as been relatively static.  In 1969/70 1.14 million children
were enrolled in primary schools; witlh an enrollnment rate of 53.5 percent.
In the first cycle of secondary education, 248,000 pupils were enrolled in
1969/70, thus reaching a relatively high enrollment rate of 17.1 percent.
In the secondl cycle enrolLment is markedly lower: 43,000 pupils or 4.7 per-
cent of that age group. About 8,000 students a year graduate from second-
ary sclhool witl the "baccalaureat" degree.
20.       In higlher education, tlhe enrollment is only 12,000 students, and
the enrollment rate 0.9 percent.   Vocational training is provided by the Min-
istry of Labor and Employment, thirouglh vocational training centers giving
short courses in industrial and commercial occupations.    Enrollment amounts
to approximately 1,000 trainees.
21.       Ihe financing of education is providedc mainly through the central
Government's budget. Total expenditure lhas increased considerably during
last six years, and in 1970 reaclhed $157 million or 4.7 percent of the gross
domestic product. Recurrent expenditure for public education amounts to 23%
of the Government 's recurrent budget.  Ccapital expenditure for education
accounts for a small part of total public investment, fluctuating between a
low of 2.2 percent in 1967 and a high of 6.9 percent in 1968. The proposed
project with a total cost of $13.52 million, would account for 24 percent
of all education investment included in the Five-Year Plan 1968/1972.
22.       EdIucat ion in Morocco still shows many we;iknesses, manifested in a
high number of Irop-outs and class repeaters, insufficient preparation of
pupils for employment or the next educational level, and the lack of proper-
ly trained graduates in most scientific and technical fields.



-5-
23.       SoTne of the weaknesses are general. They lnclucle the problen. t:he
tise of two l.anguages of instructLion, tihe small i proporti on of girls  L tending
sc:hoo] and thie neglect of educ.-Lt-ion in rural a.reas. A second g,roup of pr(-
blems is to be found in the retention of an iducatLon syst cil which stresseés
academic subjects while neglecting practical training, in weak administra-
tion and the lack of a colherent, comprehenisive development plan for educa-
tion.  To overcome these problems it i5 importantL to introduce practi[cal cur--
ricula adapted to needls, to reform administration and( to adopt an effective
eclucation policy. These shortcomings are deeply rooted aind can be remedied
only over a long period. There is, howeveer, a thiird set of problenms whlich
can be tackle(d immediatcly:  the shorta;ge of qullifieCd teacllers, the short-
age of schools an(d equipment, and the need for improvement in technical edu-
ca t ioni.
24.       The proposed project would help relieve the latter problemls and
would, at the same time, initiate measures to deal withi some of the more
deeply rooted shortcomings.  Specifically; the propose(d project wouLd ineet
important nee(Is in secondary teacher training, in upper cycle secondary
science and technical education, and in selected areas of agricultural and
industrial vocational training.  Other mna ters, hiowever, require urgent at-
tention.  Primary schooling has not kept pace with the population increase,
and primary teacher training is lagging.  In secondary schooling, more at-
tention will have to be given to the lower cycles, where industrial arts
and science teaching needs to be strengthened. Agricultural education and
training should be reformecl and in higher education, the training of physi-
cians, industrial technicians ancl engineers expanded. These elements could
constitute a third education project for whiich the Government is planning
to request Bank Group assistance. With this in view, the Government study-
ing thie following matters:
(i) the future of primary education, particularly the orga-
nization, curricula and expansion of primary education
as a basis for the expansion of teacher training;
(ii) the future form of agricultural training; andl
(iii)  hligher education with a view to its modernization and
expansion, particularly in engineering and medicine. Fi-
nancing for such study has already been requested from UNDP.
PART IV - TIIE PROJEICT
25.       A detailed dlescription of the proposed project is given in the re-
port entitled "Appraisal of a Seconcl Education Project in Morocco" (No. PE-29a)
which is being distributed separately. A credit anld project summary is at
Anniex III.

26.       In comparison wihli the first education project, which financed the
construction anid equipment of '21 secondary schools, the proposed second proj-
ect is complex. '[t can be d[vided inlto five major groups:  educational re-
searchi and teacher traioing, upgrading of scientific and technical education
in secondary schools, vocational traininig, agricultural training, and tech-
nical assistance.
27.       Educational researchl and teachier training:  About hialf of the ex-
penditure under thte proposed project would be for training secondary school
teachers. Enrollment in secondary education is expected to show an annual
growth rate of 3.6 percent from now to 1982 which is only slightly higher
than the rate of population growthi. 'To provide for this expansion and for
thle_ replaecmlent by qu:ilif fLed Noroccan teachers the expatriate teachers ( who
presently make up more thani 6() percent of thle teaching force) and tile un-
qualified Moroccan teaclhers, some 12,000 teachers for the first cycle and
4,500 for the second cycle of secondary schools must be trained before 1982.
On a yearly basis, 1,200 first cycle secondary teachers and 300 second cycle
teachers will be required every year from 1976 on. Existing facilities could
provide for about a quarter only of these requirements, but the facilities
included in the proposed project would mteet most of them.
28.       Three types of education research and teacher training institu-
tions are included iu the proposed project:  The National Institute of
Pedagogy, the Higher Teacher Training), College, and six Regional Teacher
Training Colleges. Tlhe National Institute of Pegagogy, to be located in
1labat, would le responsible for (a) researclh into the structure, content,
and techniques of teaching, with particular attention to the causes of pres-
ent student failures, (b) coordinationi of all training of primary and secon-
dary schlool teachers, (c) advanced in-service courses for teachers and super-
visors, and (d) experimentationi with new teaching equipmenit, production of
prototype material andl printting of miwanuals. Thie Hligher Teacher Training Col-
lege, to be located also in !Zabat, woul(d provide one-year post-graduate
courses for second cycle secondary sclhool t eachers.  As from 1975, it would
have an output of 300 senior secontlary teachers per year. Students would be
admitted to the college after obtainlng a university degree. Th'e six Region-
al 'I'eaclher Training Colleges will provide tlhree-year post-secondary courses
for first cycle secondary school teachers (botlh pre-and in-service). Their
location is indicated on the attached map (Annex III). Each college will
have an enrollment of' 720 students; t:otal enrollmnents of 4,320 students
should produce some 1,200 teachers per year.
29. Scientific and technical traininr in secondarv schools:   The secondary
educat Lion systemi, traditionally academic, has been oinresponsive to Morocco's
,rowiin:., need of graduates that are well prepared for technologically
oriented Jobs or for higher scientific or technical studies.  General second-
ary education is weak in science teachiing which is too theoretical with lit-
tle student participation in experim-aental work. In technical secondary edu-
cation, thie existing industriaL and commercial courses which do not lead up
t'o the "bhaccal-aureat" have proven unisuccessful and have given rise to student



- 7 -
unrest.  The degree to be obtained in these technical secondary schools, "di-
plome de technicien marocain", does not help the graduates to get middle-level
jobs in business or government because of insufficient practical preparation,
nor does it give access to higher studies or posi Lions for iack of academic
content:.  The proposed project would deal with thLs problem by financing the
extension and equipment of school buildings to permit modern teaching and
experimental work for science and teclhnical subjects.  The project would af-
fect three types; of schlools: general secondary schiools, industrial secondary
schools and commercial secondary schlools.
30.       In general secondary education, the project would provide a
"science block" consisting of six completely eqluippecd laboratories for
six existing secondary schools where absence of adequate laboratories has
prevented the establishment of science sections. 'Tleir location is marked
on the attached map. Total enrollment of these schools would be Q,100
students, of whom 1,300 students would be able to enroll in the new scien-
tific courses. About 400 science graduates can be expectecl annually. For
indlustrial secondary schools the project would provi.de additional workshop
an' laboratorv equipment in ten schools. 'The utasuccessful "diplome de tech-
nicien marocain' would be replaced by a "Daccalaureat en ciathematiques et
techniques." GCraduates of these new courses, which are to begin in t)ztcber
1971, will not only be qualified for contirued training at a university,
but will also have received a tihoroughl practical training.  Tne ten schools
included in the proposed project will have a combined output of 450 grad'-
uates per year, of whom 250 can be expected to gain the "baccalaureat.)'  In
commercial secondary schools, a similar change from an unsuccessful tech-
nician's diploma to a "baccalaureat economique" will be made possible under
the proposed project.  Thirteen existing commercial schools will be providedl
with additional moderni office equipment, and part of the existing equipment
wi 11 be replacecd in ordler to upgrade the courses to the htigher level.
The tlirteen project schiools are expected to have a combined output of approx-
itnately 1,200 students a year, of whom some 700 will probably obtain the
baccalaureat.
31. Vocational training is carried out in centers under thie Ministry of Labor
and Employment.  It needs continuous adjustment and expansion in selected
trades to ensure an adequate supply of skilled labor for the industrial sector.
The Ministry plans to expand its output front 1,920 to 2,470 during the five
year plan period 1968-1972,  Thcse plans include the two vocational training
centers Included in the project.  One, in Casablanca, would be for the build-
ing trades, and is the only one of its kind so far planned. It shoul d he
well placed to meet tlhe demand for plumbers, masons and carpenters in the
rapidly developing coastal strip from Kenitra to Safi.   The output of 105
trainees per year, many of whom would be recruitt(e from unemployed building
workers h-aving no knowledge of modern construction teclhniques, should be ra-
pidly absorbed into thie incdustry. 'I'The second would be a vocational trafining
center for the engineering trades and would be locateil at Kenitra, a rapidly
growing industrial center.  Thln output of 93 trainees per yeatr slhould also
I-e rapidly absorbed inlto industry.

32.       Agricultural training:   Morocco necds improvements in all segments
of agricultural trailing.   Unsaltisfactory staffing, curricula, and methodol-
ogy hamper the agricultural secondary schtools whiclh train field assistants.
At post-secon(dary levels, tlhe existing facilities are often not fully used,
and not enouglh priority is glven to the training of agricultural teachers
and extension workers.   In the absence of ani overall reform plan for agri-
cultural teaching and traininig, two isolated but well-prepared project items
have beeln included in the proposed project: a D)epartment of Veterinary H4edi-
cine and the Royal School of Forestry.
33.       A new Department of Veterinary Medicine would be built and equipped
as an extension of the existing Hiassan II Institute of Agronomy at Rabat.
Thle new department, witlh an initial output of 25 veterinarians per year,
would meet part of the need for 230-300 veterinarians to be trained between
1970 and 1980.  Most of them would be employed in the 120 veterinary dis-
tricts, in each of hiich the Government plans to station three veterinarians.
Thie Royal School of Forestry at Sale, whiclh presently trains 25 field assist-
ants per year would be expanded to include a new two-year course for the
traininig of 40 field agents per year. They would be recruited after three
years of general secondary education.
34.       Technical assistance:   Work on the first education project was
not well don<.  Government staff entrusted with the supervision of project
implementation have been too few and lhave lacked experience. As a result,
schlool construction and equipment procurement were poorly supervised and
took too long. Inefficient and cumbersome procedures for civil works con-
tracting, inadequate record keeping, and poor communications among the De-
partments concerned worsened the problem.   The government has meanwhile
taken steps to remedy these weaknesses but requires assistance in training
MIloroccan staff in project managemnent.  ro this end, the proposed project
inicludes the services of an architect experienced in school design and a
specialist in education equipmunt procurement.    In addition, an architect
experienced in the maintenance of sclhool buildings will establislh and or-
ganise a maintenance section in the Ministry of Hi1.gher Education.
35.       Project Administration:   For the first project, a Project Unit was
set up in the Ministry of Higher Education, whiclh only recently lias been
brought to full strengtlh.  With the technical assistance outlined above, this
Project Unit slhould be capable of completing the first project, and discllarg-
ing its functions under the second.   WittI regard to the latter, the Project
Unit will be responsible for those items whichi are under the jurisdiction of
the Hlinis ry of Highier Education and accoutIt for 86 percent of total project
cost. The renmaining project items, i.e. the vocational training centers,
the Department of Veterinary Medicine, and the Royal School of Forestry are
under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Labor and Employment, and of
Agriculture and Agrariani Reform, respectively. Officials to assume perma-
nent responsibility for the execution of these remaining project items will
be appointed in the two ministries concerned, and overall project coordina-
tion will be handled by a permanently appointed official in the Prime Min-
ister's office.



- 9 -
36.       Procurement:  Contracts for the supply of fuirii ture and equLipinenlt
and for construction wl.[i be awarded foLlovwing internaitional competitive
bidding. It is likely that most construction contracts will he won by local
contractors, and that most of thie furniture a.'cl equipment will be imported.
Tihe present practice of the Government to dividedl the construction of a
single project item into a number of contracts awarded to specialized con-
tractors, which was followed1 in tde execution of the first project, is un-
satisfactory and leads to inadequate supervision by the ministries concerned.
For the second project, comprehensive bids wjill be prepared for each insstitu-
tioni, i-ncluding all specialized works, andl tle awards will be inade to general
contractors who will be free to subcontract as necessary. Wherever possible,
bids will be combined in economic packagYes. Local manufacturers of furniture
and equipment would be allowed a 15 percent preference in bid comparison or
the import duty, whichever is lower.
37.       Disbursements:   'I'lTe foreign exchange cost is estinmated at a minli-
mum of $7.4 million.  The proposed credlit of $8.5 milLion represents about
63 percent of the total project cost of $13.5 milLion. The small amount of'
local expenditure financi.ng whicht might be involved, estimrated at $1.1 mil--
lion, is justlified in view of the country's stubstantial needls for external
assistance despite the Governmert's su-ccessfti U  efforts to mobilize miiore do-
mestic resources.  The Association will disburse the full c.i.f. cost of
imported furniture and equipment or the full ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment and 45 percent of the expenditure for
all other items.
