RWAINDA
Second Water Supply Project
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:      Republic of Rwanda
Beneficiary:   Ministry of Public Works and Energy
Amount:        SDR 11.9 million (U.S. $15.0 million equivalent)
Terms:         Standard IDA terms
Project
Objectives:    The main objectives of the project would be (a) to improve
the quality and quantity of water provided to the rural
population, thereby improving public health and the living
conditions of women and children who often must walk long
distances to carry water; (b) to strengthen institutional
arrangements and introduce cost recovery measures for the
rural water supply sector; and (c) to increase the
responsibility of local communities in the maintenance and
management of water supply facilities.
Project
Description:   (a) Rehabilitation and extension of rural aqueducts in the
Lava region; (b) establishment and implementation of a
national program for rehabilitation, operation and
maintenance of rural water supply systems throughout the
country; and (c) strengthening of the General Directorate of
Water (GDW) as well as the communes and the users
associations through the provision of expertise, vehicles,
equipment and training.
Benefits:      The major benefit of the proposed project would be the
availability of safe potable water for about 500,000 persons
living in scattered rural settlements, and an improvement of
their health. The project would also foster the development
of communal responsibility for infrastructure serving the
population directly and result in considerable improvements
in the planning, implementation, and supervision of rural
water programs at the country level.
Risks:         The major risks concern the maintenance of the systems.
Experience in Africa has shown that the most promising
results are derived from delegating responsibility to the
village level and fostering the sense of communal ownership,
while providing adequate back-up services and tehnical
assistance. Questions still remain whether the
beneficiaries can be sufficiently motivated over a long tive
to make the necessary monetary outlays, and to join into
ccmmunal efforts to maintain and repair the system. The
planned demonstration campaigns as well as the efforts to
sensitize local leaders and administrators should help
minimize this risk.

I * THE SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Rwanda is a small landlocked country which depends on
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania for its access to the sea. With an area of
26,338 square kilometers and a population of 6.0 million people, Rwanda is
the most densely populated country in Africa:228 per Km2 but 400 per 1km2 of
usable land. Only 5% of the population lives in urban areas. Smallholder,
rainfed agriculture is the predominent feature of the rural sector. There
are about one million smallholdings. Population pressure has resulted in
diminishing farm size with more than half of the farm families occupying
less t1an I ha and another 30X between 1 and 2 ha. The population is
increasing at a rate of 3.7% per annum, Life expectancy at birth is
estimated at 47 and infant mortality at 137/1000o
1.02      GNP per capita estimated at US$290 in 1985 is among the
lowest in the world. Average annual rural family income is about US$550
(US$100 per capita). Limited natural resources, population pressure,
scarcity of qualified and experienced manpower, and isolation from main
trade routes are the main contributors to the country's poverty.
1.03      The topography is hilly to mountainous with elevation
increasing from east to west. The country is characterized by a wide
diversity in agro-ecological situations and corresponding farming systems.
The western part (Lake Kivu), the central high plateau and the northern
volcanic highland areas have the highest agricultural potential. The
semi-arid eastern savannah, traditionally a grazing area sparsely
populated, is now almost fully settled as a result of the recent control of
the tsetse fly and mounting population pressure elsewhere in the country.
1.04      Up to the present, food production seems to have kept
face with population growth roughly maintaining national food
self-sufficiency. However, national statistics indicate that the growth of
agricultural output may be slowing down after a period of relatively strong
growth, 5.8% per annum in the period 1974-81. During the period 1981-84,
the average annual growth rate is estimated at about 3.5%, less than the
population growth rate of 3.7% per annum. Maintaining a general food
balance in the future under increasing land constraints will require a
major effort to intensify production at the farm level.
1.05      The local administration consists of ten provinces
(prefectures) and 143 communes. Each commune is divided into several
sectors or "hills" which correspond to the physical hills. There are about
1814 hills in the country.



-2-
Water Resources
1.06      Rwanda is a hilly country with good rainfall and two
rainy seasons. Rainfall increases with elevation from east to west, from
730 mm to 1,600 mm per year. Because of its geology and climate, there are
many springs and sv-face waters in the country, except in the eastern part
of the country, where the only resource is ground water, and in the Lava
Region, where rainfall Is good but volcanic ground is porous and cannot
retain water. Therefore, in the highest part of this region, the
population has to walk 10 to 15 kms to find water. Generally, due to a
lack of sanitary protection the quality of water provlded by the natural
sources is either doubtful (unprotected springs) or really poor (streams,
marshlands). This lcuds to water-borne diseases which represent more than
70% of all endemic diseases (see Annex 1). It is estimated that 80% of
infant mortality is due to the lack of safe water.
Sector Organization
1.07      Initiated under the International Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Decade, a National Water Supply and Sanitation committee (CNEA)
was created in early 1981. It was headed by the Secretary General of the
Ministry of Natural Resourcas, Mines and Quarries now within the Ministry
of Public Works and Energy, and includes representatives of all the
Ministries involved directly or indirectly in the sector. The Committee
had only a consultative role. It was to advise the Government on all
matters relating to water and sanitation, especially the organization of
the sector and the coordination of different activities. Its main
achievement had been to inform Government officials of sector needs and
constraints, and to study alternatives for reorganization of the rural
water supply subsector.   The Ministry of Natural Resources was abolished
in January 1984 and its responsibilities for water supply were transferred
to the Ministry of Public Works and Energy. A new committee was
established on October 12, 1984, called the Interministerial Coordination
Committee (CIC) for urbanization, housing, water and energy. It is headed
by the Minister of Public Works and Energy and includes respresentatives of
the ministries of Transport, Agriculture, Health, Education and Finauce.
This CIC has to determine sector policies and to oversee their
implementation. It has reviewed the Institutional study for rural water
supply financed by Credit 1345-RW and approved its recommendations.
1.08      According to the statute (Decret-Loi 18) approved in 1976, the
parastatal Electrogaz has exclusive responsibility for water and
electricity distribution throughout the country. However, its activity has
been more limited, both in practice and according to legislation approved
more recently. In practice, Electrogaz serves only Kigali and eleven other
urban centers. Its activities are supervised by the Ministry of Public
Works and Energy (MPWE). Water supply in strictly rural areas has since
January 1984 been under the responsibility of the General Directorate of
Water (GDW) of the same Ministry, even though the original statutes of
Electrogaz have not been changed. In between are 22 "sous-prefectures
with both rural and urban features, the responsibility for which is
currently under discussion.



-3-
1.09      Until the creation of GDW, the lack of rural water supply
institutions and the absence of financial resources prevented the upgrading
of rural water supply facilities and resulted in poor operation and
maintenance. A total of 292 rural water supply systems have been
constructed (see Annex 2). Many of those constructed by the "Association
Internationale de Developpement Rural" (AIDR) were also entrusted to AIDR
for operation and maintenance, However, funds allocated yearly to AIDR for
operation and maintenance were not increased adequately over the years to
compensate for inflation and facilities are In poor condition.   AIDR went
bankrupt in October 1985.
1.10      The role of GDW is to take over the sector and to implement the
new Institutional and cost recovery policy recommended by the institutional
study (see para. 1.07) and approved by the Government. Because of Its lack
of experience, GDW needs technical assistance and training. GTZ is already
committed to provide two experts for two years. PAO would provide a legal
expert to prepare a revision of the water legislation and the proposed
project would provide two other technical assistants (see para. 4.14).
Levels of Service
1.11      About 46% of the urban population is served through private
connections (25%) or standpipes (2'%). In rural areas, 16% of the
populatiou had access to the 2549 standpipes existing at the end of 1984
and 47.42 is served mainly through springs, which are partially protected,
and also through wells. People not served (36.6%) rely on unprotected
spriugs and polluted streams and ponds which are at relatively great
distances.
1.12      A WHO sprvey showed that 252 of the urban populatiou was served
by septic tanks and 35% by pit latrines. Another survey carried out in
May-July 1984 showed that 84% of the rural population had access to pit
latrines. This percentage is very high and compares to 30% in Burundi.
Sector Objectives
1.13      The Government's objectives for rural water supply in the long
term are to manage water resources in order to meet the needs of all the
population, agriculture, livestock and industry. For the period ef the
fourth development plan (1987-1991), the objectives are to put in place the
institutioaal and legal framework for a rationalized water management. The
necessary decisions were taken by the Government Council on November 15,
1985 (see Annex 3). It was decided, in accordance with the recommendations
of the institutions'a study, to give the communes full responsibility for
water management, with the participation of users associations. The
beneficiary families should cover the full cost of operation, maintenance
and renewal of the facilities. Financing for investments would be obtained
from the National Fund for Rural Water Supply (NFRWS), to be created as a
special account of the existing Communal Development Fuud.
1.14      The Fourth Development Plan (see Annex 4) includes water supply
projects for an amount of PRw 11,467 million (US$ 136.5 million) of which
PRw 433 million (US$ 5.15 million) is for studies. All of these projects
are sound and justified but the program is too ambitious for the



Implementation capacity of the country. Moreover, financing for FRw 1,290
million (US$ 15.36 million) has still to be found. During project
Implementation, an updated three year investment program would be submitted
by October 31, each vear to IDA for its review and comments, and the
Government would ensure that investments in the water supply sector are
technically, financially and economically justified. IDA would also be
given the opportunity to review and comment GDW's annual budgets for the
following fiscal years (see para. 4.12).
Sector Development
1.15      In spite of the limited absorptive capacity and the institutional
weakness of the sector, several water supply projects are under
construction or under preparation. Water systems in Kigali and Butare have
recently been developed under a project financed by the African Development
Bank (AfDB). IDA is financing a project for five secondary centers and
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) for four others.
Moreover, AfDB is financing a study called "Kigali 2,000" for a project
aimed at meeting the needs of Kigali for the year 2000.
1.16      In rural areas, water supply is being actively developed, mainly
by NGOs. COFORWA (Compagnons Fontainiers du Rwanda) has built 93 rural
water supply systems and developed an interesting cooperation policy for
construction, operation and maintenance. They do not start the works until
a users'association, represented by a water committee, is created. The
association contributes to the construction and participates in operation
and maintenance. The association also participates in decisions about the
financial contribution due yearly by every family. The committee is
responsible for the collection of this revenue and for its use. Another
NGO, SNV (Netherlands Volunteer Service) is also deeply involved in rural
water supply. They have built 37 systems and have developed a method to
sensitize ne population to the value and use of safe water. Most of the
new systems are now managed by users' committees with financial
contributions from the beneficiaries. Twenty-six systems are currently
being operated by the communes.
Sector Constraints
1.17      The main constraints in the water supply sector are the lack of
financing for operation and maintenance and the shortage of qualified staff
in the ministry responsible for the sector. This results in inadequate
planning and project selection, poor supervision and lack of decision
making capacity on organizational and cost recovery aspects.
1.18      In the urban water supply sub-sector, the main issue is the low
rate of house connections, due to the high cost of the connection and, up
to now, the lack of payment facilities. Under the First Water Supply
project (Cr. 1345-RW) the Bank has financed 1000 house connections in five
secondary centers and arranged with Electrogaz that they be paid for by the
customer over a period of several years. Another issue is the amount of
arrears accumulated by the Government and the Municipalities. The Credit
Agreement of the first project (Cr. 1345-RW) required that the total amount
of receivables due from governmental customers not exceed three month's
billings. Due to this covenant, negotiations were held between the
Government and Electrogaz, and this issue is being resolved.



-5.
1.19      In the rural water supply sub-sector, the bankruptcy of AIDR (see
paragraph 1.09) left a vacuum which is difficult to fill. The GDW is still
a young and weak institution suffering accutely from a shortage of skilled
staff and a lack of resources. (see para. 4.07).
Previous Bank Involvement
1.20      The Bank is involved in a first water supply project (Credit
1345-RW of SDR 12.0 million, signed on 7*7.83) to rehabilitate, reinforce
and extend the production and distribution facilities for potable water in
the five secondary centers of Cyangugu, Kibungo, Kibuye, Ruhengeri and
Rwamagana. Implementation of this project is almost completed, ahead of
schedule. The project also included the construction of a training center
in Kigali, for electricity and water, and the establishment of a training
program. In addition, the project included detailed engineering studies
for rehabilitation and extension of rural aqueducts in the Lava Region and
an institutional study of the rural water supply sub-sector in Rwanda.
These studies, now completed, have been reviewed by the Government and the
Bank. They are the basis of the proposed project.

II. POPULATION, WATER SUPPLY SERVICE AND DENUID IN THE PROJECT AREA
ProJect Area
2.01      The scope of the project extends to all rural areas throughout
the country; i.e. in the 143 communes. The main component of the project,
the rehabilitation and expansion of water supply in the Lava Region, is
located in eleven communeq of two "prgfectures": Gisenyi (Rubavu, Kanama,
Rwerere, Mutura-and Karago)and Ruhengeri (Nkuli, Mhkingo, Kinigi, Kigombe,
Nkumba and Kidaho) (see Tap no. 20081). The second component of the
project, a national program for the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural
water supply systems throughout the country will be based on the priority
needs of rehabilitating existing rural water supply systems (see para.
3.13).
Population
2.02      In 1984, the rural population of Rwanda was 5.531
million. Annex 5 gives the figures for each prefecture with population
density and growth. The average annual growth rate is 3.10% per annum in
the country, varying from 1.45% in Gikongoro to 4.50X in Kigali
prefecture.  The growth rate is 2.45% per annum in Ruhengeri prefecture and
3.35X in Gisenyi prefecture. In the Lava Region, the population
of the eleven communes involved in the project is estimated at 485,300
inhabitants in 1985 and 688,500 in 1995. Annex 7 shows the population in
1985 and 1995 for every commune.
Level of Service
2.03      The percentage of the rural population presently served is 63.4X,
of which 47.4% is served by protected springs and 16% by water supply
systems (see Annex 6). On average, 36 families are served by a protected
spring and 62 by a standpipe (see Annex 6, page 2). The rest of the rural
population is served mainly by unprotected springs or has no satisfactory
access to safe water.
2.04      In the Lava Region, 60.0% of the population was estimated to have
been served in 1985 in the ten communes involved in the project. This
percentage should reach 96.7% in 1995, after completion of the project (see
Annex 7). If we consider the more limited area covered by the project, the
percentage of the population served would be increased from 39.2% in 1985
to 96.3% in 1995.
Existing Water Supply
2.05      The rural population of Rwanda is presently served by 12,956
protected springs and 292 water supply systems, of which 243 are gravity
systems (97 built by AIDR, 93 by COFORWA and 37 by SNV), 6 gravity systems
with treatment (AIDR), 42 systems with pumping (of which 37 were built by
AIDR), and 1 system with pumping and treatment(AIDR). These 292 systems
provide water through 2,549 standpipes (see Annex 2).
Water Consumption and Demand
2.06      A survey carried out in 1984 by the consultants (BCEOM) showed
that the average consumption varied from 8 lcd (liters per capita per day)
in the rainy season to 12 lcd in the dry season. When distance is



-7-
significant (5 to 10 kms.), consumption falls to about 5 lcd, particularly
during the rainy season. These figures are far below international
standards and should be compared to 20 lcd in other similar countries.
Since the project would provide a standpipe within a distance of about
1,000 m for everybody, it is believed that the demand will reach 12 lcd
in 1992 when the project is completed and 15 lcd by the year 1995 in the
project area. In a household having 5.6 people on average, the demand per
family would be 67.2 and 84 liters per day, respectively.  All the public
institutions such as public buildings, hospitals, schools, etc., would be
served by direct connections. Private connections would also be installed
under the project. The project would satisfy the water demand up to the
year 2,000 for most of the systems. For the remaining systems, additional
works, implemented in a second stage from 1995 to 1998, would be needed.
Rationale for Bank Participation
2.07      The Bank's objective In the water supply sector is to support the
Government's efforts to implement a new sectoral policy aimed at giving the
communes full responsibility for water supply in rural areas and
establishing a new system of water charges to be collected at the communal
level from all beneficiary families to cover operation, maintenance and
renewal costs. This policy has been designed by the institutional study
financed by the Bank under the first water supply project, and drafted by
the Government following many discussions with Bank missions, meetings and
a round table on water supply organized by UNDP in January 1986. Due to
extensive consultation with other donors, particularly CCCE, this policy i.
supported by every donor involved: CCCE, AfDB, BADEA, Austria and
Switzerland. The proposed project provides a good opportunity of
implementing this new policy throughout the country and the leadership
role of IDA ensures that adequate attention will be paid to institutional
and cost recovery aspects for the sector as a whole.

III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      The proposed project is the result of a continuing dialogue
between the Bank and the Government on the development of the rural water
supply sub-sector, and on ways to finance the operation and maintenance of
the existing systems. An institutional study, finance' under the First
Water Supply Project (Cr. 1345-RW) was completed in December 1985 and was
the basis of a round table conference, sponsored by UNDP in Kigali from
January 20 to 22, 1986, which provided au opportunity to promote
coordination in the sector and to attract cofinancing.Feasibility and final
design studies for the Lava Region were also financed by Credit 1345-RW:
the final report and draft bidding documents were delivered in February
1986. All bid documents will be finalized by June 30, 1987.
3.02      Moreover, an inventory of rehabilitation requirements for the
country as a whole will shortly get urderway, with financing from the Study
Fund of the Ministry of Planning. By no later than the date of project
effectiveness the study is expected to have identified overall requirements
as well as the most urgent needs, which would form a first phase of a
country wide rehabilitation program. The framework for implementation of
this program has been agreed (see para. 3.13). The communes, assisted by
NG0s, would submit a request, including the proposed cost recovery system,
for appraisal by GDW. Financing would then be obtained from the National
Fund for Rural Water Supply (NFRWS), (see para. 5.03).
Project Objectives
3.03      The project objectives are:
(a)   to strengthen the capacity of GDW and of the communes to
perform their functions through detailed functional
analyses, manpower development, provision of equipment and
the creation of a National Fund for Rural Water Supply
(NFRWS) to improve the efficiency of resource flows into
the sector;
(b) to improve the quality and quantity of water provided to the
rural population throughout the country through the
establishment of a national water system rehabilitation and
maintenance program under the direction of GDW;



-9-
(c) to assist with the financing and implementation of the
rehabilitation and expansion of five water supply systems in
the Lava Region (NorthWest Rwanda.)

The Lava Region component is shown on Map IBRD no. 20081.
Project Cost
3.05      The total cost of the project is estimated at FRW 6,065 million
(US$ 72.2 million), of which US$ 45.4 million, or approximately 63%,
represents the foreign exchange component. Base cost estimates are
expressed in prices as of January 1987. Cost of works were estimated on
the basis of consultants' detailed design. Since goods and equipment for
project purposes would be imported free of customs duties and internal
taxes, base costs are net of tax liabilities. Taxes on locally procured
goods (mainly cement and fuel) estimated at 6% of local costs have been
Included in the estimate. They amount to FRW 134.9 million (US$ 1.60
million). The cost estimates are detailed in annexe 8, and summarized
below:

3.06      Physical contingencies of 15% have been added to the cost of pipe
laying, pipe supply, equipment and civil works of the Lava Region
component.   Price contingencies have been added to base costs plus
physical contingencies. Price contingencies for the foreign costs are
based on recent estimates of international inflation as follows: 3.0% in
1987, 1% in 1988-90 and, 3.5% from 1991 onwards. Local cost price
contingencies have been included at an annual rate of 3% for 1987, 6% for
1988, 5% for 1989 and 3% thereafter. The base cost estimates for technical
assistance and training services total about US$ 4.2 million.
Project Financing Plan
3.07      The proposed project would be mainly financed through the
following credits and grants (see annex 22):
(i) Austria: US$ 7.0 million for the Sebeya and Yungwe-Bikore
systems;
(ii) BADEA: US$ 7.25 million for the foreign costs of the lower
hutobo system;
(iii) CCCE: US$ 16.0 million for the pumping stations and
treatment plants of all the Lava Region's systems, for the
Mutera system and for construction supervision, and for the
rehabilitation program;
(iv) IDA: US$ 15.0 million for the upper Mutobo system, the
Misingo-Mutura system, the project unit, technical
assistance to GDW, training and the rehabilitation program;
(v)  UNDP:  a grant of US$ 0.7 million for training;
(vi) Switzerland: about US$8.3 million for the rehabilitation
program;
(vii)  AfDF:  US$12.5 million for the Crates system.
3.08      The communes to be served by the project would contribute the
equivalent of 5% of the works in the form of labor, mainly for earthworks,
pipe laying, construction of small reservoirs and standpipes, with the help
of NGOs. This would represent about US$ 1.55 million (FRW 130.2 million).
The remainder of the financing would be assured by a Government
contribution of US$ 3.9 million (FRW 327.6 million). The tentative
financing plan is indicated below:

3.09      The Government would make the proceeds of the credits and grants
and its own contribution available to the executing agency (GDW). After
project completion, the ownership of the facilities would be transferred to
the Communes or Associations of communes.
Implementation
3.10      GDW would be the implementing agency for the project.  The
General Director of Water would be assisted by a project coordination unit
financed under the project, located in Ruhengeri or Gisenyl, close to the
Lava Region. It would consinc of three experts: a project coordinator, a
sanitary engineer and an accountant, and ten employees of GDW: one
sanitary engineer, two technicians, one accountant, two secretaries, two
drivers, one office clerk and one house-keeper.
3.11      A donors consultative committee would supervise the project.
Chaired by the General Director of Water, it would comprise a
representative of every cofinancier and the project coordinator. This
committee should meet twice a year in Rwanda.
3.12      Construction works would be executed in different lots
corresponding to pumping stations, treatment plants, supply of pipes and
the laying of pipes. Each cofinancier would finance a different lot, in
accordance with its own procurement regulations. Bids would be called for
the supply of pipes and equipment, the laying of pipes and civil works.
The secondary distribution systems, laying of distribution pipes,
construction of small reservoirs and standpipes, would be carried out by
NGOs. In particular, COFORWA, SNV and Care International, have agreed to
participate. The Communes affected by the project would contribute to the
construction through UMUGANDA (non-remunerated community work), mainly for
earth works and the supply of raw materials (sand, gravel) and the
construction of small reservoirs and standpipes. In addition to the
saving, this will sensitize the population to the value and use of safe
water. They will be more eager and trained to keep the systems in good
shape when they are complete, having contributed to their construction.
The implementation schedule is shown in Annex 9.
3.13      For the rehabilitation program component, a study is being
carried out, financed by the study fund (Cr. 1217-RW). This study will
produce a priority list of rural water systems to be rehabilitated with a
cost estimate for each system. The priorities will be based on (i) the non
availability of other sources of water; (ii) the investment cost per
capita, which should be less than US$50.0; and (iii) the capacity and
willingness of the population to cover the cost of operation, maintenance
and renewal of the facilities, The communes, helped by NGOs, will submit
projects to GDW for technical and institutional approval. The number of
water supply systems to be covered by the study is 144. It is estimated
that the absorptive capacity of GDW for review and approval would be 20 to
25 water supply systems per year, for an average cost of US$100,000
equivalent. Therefore, a first tranche of about US$2.0 million would be
implemented the first year of the program. Other tranches of similar
importance would be prepared for the subsequent years. For the 6 year
disbursement period of the project, the rehabilitation component would
amount US$12.0 million equivalent. Financing will be obtained through
NFRWS (see para 5.03) and construction will be carried out by NGOs,
supplemented by assistance from the population to be served (see para.
3.12).

Procurement
3.14      Equipment, pipes and civil works would be grouped in seven
bidding packages for:
a. Financing by CCCE in accordance with V own regulations:
(1) Mutera system; (ii) all the treatment plants and puuiping
stations of the Lava Region;
b. 'inancing by the Austrian Government, in accordance with its
own regulations: Sebeya and Yungwe-Bikore systems;
c. Financing by IDA and procured under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines:
(i) Mizingo-Mutura system; (ii) Upper Mutobo system;
d. Financing by BADEA in accordance with its own regulations:
Lower Mutobo system.
e. Financing by AfDF in accordance with its own regulations:
Cr4tes system.
3.15      These seven bidding packages would include civil works and pipe
laying for the production facilities and transmission mains, but excluding
distribution mains, small reservoirs and standpipes, which would be
executed by NGOs in conjunction with the local population (see para.
3.13). It is expected that all equipment would come from abroad, although
two plants are manufacturing plastic pipes in Rwanda, but at a higher price
than imported pipes. However, a preference, equal to the applicable custom
duties and other import taxes with a maximum of 15%, would be applied to
the bids of qualified local manufacturers, if any. For civil works, a
preference of 7.5% would be applied to bids from local civil works
contractors. Every contract over US$100,000, for equipment, and
US$300,000, for civil works, would be subject to prior IDA review.
3.16      A number of small contracts totalling US$4.3 million equivalent
(1.6 million IDA financing) not likely to attract foreign suppliers would
be awarded after competitive bidding advertised locally but open also to
foreign bidders. This would cover mainly the equipment for the
rehabilitation program, procured separately for each commune, over a period
of 6 years: plastic pipes, fittings, valves, taps and standpipes. This
would also include office equipment, furniture and furnishings for the
project unit and the technical assistance team. Local procedures were
reviewed and found to be satisfactory. The Bank's guidelines will be used
for the selection of consultants for technical assistance and project
management (US$3.4 million equivalent).

on the standard disbursement profile for IBRD and IDA water supply and
sewerage projects in East Africa. The proposed closing date would be
December 31, 1994.
3.20      To ensure prompt availability of funds for the project, a
separate Special Account (revolving fund) would be established in the
"Banque National du Rwanda" (BNR), with an initial deposit by IDA of US$1.O
million. The Special Account opening balance was calculated as the
equivalent of four months of IDA disbursements from the proceeds of the
proposed Credit.

IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
4.01      The beneficiaries of the proposed credit would be the communes in
whose areas the proposed water supply project would he executed. The
General Directorate of Water (GDW) would be the executing agency for the
construction of the works and upon their completion would hand them over to
the communes. The technical assistance component would primarily benefit
GDW but would extend to the communes to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of the systems as well as billing, collection and accounting.
THE COMMUNES
Organization
4.02      There are ten "pr6fectures", headed by a "prefet", nominated by
the President. The 143 communes are headed by a "Bourgmestre", also
nominated by the President. He is assisted by a communal council composed
of the sector counsellors elected by the population for every sector.
There are usually between 10 and 15 sectors in a commune. The bourgmestre
and the sector counsellors receive a salary from the commune; 25,000 FRW
and 4,500 FRW per month respectively. There is also a communal committee,
consultative council, composed of the members of the communal council, of
the technical commission and of the "cellules" responsible. The "cellule'
is the lowest organization level. It is a group of 50 to 100 families who
elect a committee of four representatives headed by a chief who has a seat
on the communal committee. He receives an indemnity of FRw 4000/year, paid
by the party MRND. It is a very participative organization. Nonetheless,
the sector counsellors are elected from a short list of 3 to 5 candidates,
screened and approved by the Prefet and by the Party.
4.03      The communes are vested with legal autonomy, taxation authority
and administrative and financial responsibilities for a wide range of
services: establishment of public order and justice; construction of
health centers and their maintenance; management of communal forests; post
primary artisanal formation as well as adult training; construction of
communal roads and their upkeep, etc. In 1985, 26 communes operated water
supply piped systems, in addition to protected springs. Depending on the
ability of the Bourgmestre to mobilize external resources (bilateral
donors, NGOs, Central Government) the communes also undertake small
development projects such as water supply systems, workshops for artisans,
storage facilities, etc.
4.04      The communes in Rwanda also have some sociological and cultural
characteristics on which development administration has been partly based.
Through the communal subdivision of sectors and cells, the communal
administration can easily communicate with the rural population and know
about their motivations and contraints. The long-existing tradition of
solidarity among the peasants makes it easier for the Bourgmestre to
organize Umuganda (non-renuinerated community work), when the benefits are
apparent to the population. Every Saturday morning, the male population



- 18 -
contributes to the construction or repair of schools, dispensaries, roads
and, on occasion, water facilities. This possibility would be used in the
project for the construction of small reservoirs and the rehabilitatiou or
construction of distribution facilities, (laying of plastic pipes and
installation of standpipes).
4.05      There exists in rural areas a deep-rooted tradition of
animation" and trainuig originally initiated by the missionaries.  In
addition to church groups and NGOe, three types of national training
institutions operate at the communal level: (i) Communal Development and
Permanent Training Center (CCDFP); (it) Integrated Rural and Artisanal
Training Center (CERAI); and (iii) Youth Centers, supported and managed by
the Ministry of Youth and Cooperation Movement.
4.06      Most of the communes appoint a water supply attendant responsible
for the control and maintenauce of the springs and water supply systems
existing on their territory. UNICEF is implementing a training program
designed mainly to improve the attendant's skills. The courses last 3
weeks for 20 trainees.  The salary of a water supply attendant is ahout FRw
2500/month.
4.07      The potential, as well as the effectiveness of the local
authorities to mobilize local resources varies significantly from one
commune to another, depending on a number of factors, including the
dynamism of the Bourgmestre, the production activities of the commune and
income level of the population, population density, degree of
monetization of the local economy and existence of development projects.
These factors are not adequately taken into consideration by the
Government which assigns similar financial responsibilities to each
commune. It is frequently the case that field level technical staff are
irregularly paid, or simply dropped due to a lack of sufficient funds,
although communal finance is an area where the autonomy of the Bourgmestre
is almost unlimited. Indeed, "voluntary' but, in effect, compulsory
individual contributions are often requested for specified ends such as
construction of schools, communal offices, health centers and, possibly,
water schemes. This results in a relatively high local tax burden, with a
wide disparity in the level of taxation among communes. For example, in
the Lava Region, Kigombe has an annual budget of FRw 10 million and Mutura
FRw 5.5 million. The average contributions per family are FRw 1940 and
910, respectively. Most of the budget is used for salaries: Bourgmestre
(FRw 25,000/month), 10 to 15 policemen (7 to 8000/month) and about 12 other
communal employees. In order to improve the situation, the Government is
currently working on legislation to strengthen the communes' financial and
manpower resources.
4.08      In view of most communes' precarious financial situation, it is
becoming increasingly important for the communal administration to transfer
some of its respousibilities to local NG0s, professional organizatious,
users' associations, cooperatives and the private sector. In this respect,
the NGOs have had a tremendous impact on communal development. In spite of
some deficiencies (lack of thorough planning, weak technical capacity,
absence of coordinatiop, etc.), they have developed as institutions well
suited to operating at the communal level, with the participation of the



- 19 -
population. Local participation is a crucial element in most projects such
as the establishment of rural water supply systems. It is not uncommon to
find that water supply systems have broken down because the population was
not lnitally Involved in site selection, setting of water tariffs,
organization of tariff collection and maintenance. A number of lessons
have been drawn from this experience and some NGOs are now deeply involved
in the development of rural water supply. The proposed project would be
implemented, at the communal level, with the help of NGOs (Coforwa, SNV and
CARE International). Only the main works of the Lava Region would be
constructed by international contractors.
GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF WATER
4.09      Within the Ministry of Public Works and Energy, GDW was
established by Presidential Decree no. 173.06 of February 23, 1984. It is
responsible for the organization of activities involving the water sector,
implementation of the Government's policies in the sector, planning and
financing of water supply and sanitation projects, and training and
supervision of existing water supply systems.
Organization
4.10      GDW is headed by a Director General who is appointed by the
President upon nomination by the Minister of Public Works and Energy. Its
present Director General has held this position since GDW's creation in
1984. Its organization is divided into two departments:
(a) Water Supply and Sanitation, which comprises 4 divisions:
(i) inspection; (ii) maintenance; (iii) water supply; and
(iv) sanitation. The first two divisions are responsible
for rural areas and the others for urban areas.
(b) Planning, which comprises a study division and a "Lakes and
Rivers" division.
Shortage of adequately qualified and experienced staff, combined with
limited financial resources, will undoubtedly prevail over the years to
come and will only gradually disappear as staff become more experienced.
The proposed project addresses these questions through its technical
assistance and training components (see para. 4.16).
4.11      The Government has decided to reorganize GDW. GDW's proposed
organization chart, which was discussed at appraisal, is included in Annex
11. This organizational structure should make GDW more responsive to its
tasks, particularly in rural water supply. A new department would be
established for rural water supply, which would consist of the two old
divisions "inspection" which would become "new works" and "maintenance"
which would become "water supply management" with two subdivisions:
sensitization-training and control of operation. The old "water supply and
sanitation" department would keep two divisions: urban water supply and
sanitation. The new organization should be totally implemented by December
31, 1992.



- 20 -
Finance
4.12      The table below sets forth the amounts that GDW received since
1984 from the Government to cover its cost of operations and investments:
Year           FRw            US$
1984      32,863,457        345,000
1985      74,111,629        800,000
1986     111,164,800      1,314,000
1987     107,918,000      1,285,000
The detail of these budget allocations is given in annex 12. These limited
financial resources preclude the recruiting of sufficient competent staff
needed to implement the Government's policy for the rural water supply
sector. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained from the
Government that budget allocations to GDW would be increased to meet the
needs of the sector and particularly to allow for the necessary recruitment
of staff (see pars. 4.13). IDA would be given the opportunity to review
GDW's annual budget each year for the following fiscal years. GDW's
accounts will be audited every year by an external auditor and submitted to
the association within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Staffing
4.13      GDW's staff amounted in September 1986 to 43, of wbich 23 were
permanent staff paid according to the salary structure of Ministries, and
20 were contract staff. A detailed assessment of GDW staffing needs was
carried out during project preparation and confirmed during appraisal. As
the proposed project would increase GDW's staffing needs and also require
that presently vacant positions be filled, some 19 new staff would have to
'be recruited: 2 managers, 11 engineers, and 6 technicians (see Annex
15). In addition, 10 engineers and 10 technicians are required to represent
GDW in the prefectures. Due to the shortage of qualified manpower, these
targets can only be reached gradually and should be done during the Fourth
Development Plan (1987-1991). During negotiations, assurances have been
obtained from the Government that at least five engineers and technicians
be recruited every year from 1987 to 1992. To meet the needs of the sector
in the long term, new courses should he established for hydraulics, water
supply and sanitation in the university education and vocational training
systems.
Technical Assistance
4.14      The capacity of GDW's organization will be enhanced through the
improvement of management and training methods. To this end, technical
assistance is needed to train local higher level staff in their operational
duties. This expatriate technical assistance would consist of:
1.   An advisor (sanitary engineer) to the Planning department.
2.   An advisor (sanitary engineer) to the Water Supply and
Sanitation Department.
These two positions would be financed by GTZ for 24 months
with the possibility of extensions up to seven years.



- 21 -
3. A water legal expert, financed by FAO for 12 months.
4. An assistant to the Rural Water Supply department.
5. An assistant to the Water Supply Management division.
Positions 4 and 5 would be financed by IDA for 3 years under
the proposed project. Terms of reference for these
assignments (positions 4 and 5), which are detailed in Annex
13, were discussed with GDW at appraisal and would be financed
by the PPF until Credit effectiveness.
6. A training expert financed by UNDP for two years with a
possible extension.
All technical assistants will have their national counterpart who would be
able to take over after having adequate training.
4.15      In addition, a project coordination unit would be established for
the Lava Region component, with the assistance of three experts (see para.
3.10). Terms of reference for these assignments, which are included in
Annex 14, were discussed with GDW at appraisal. As early appointment of
the experts is crucial to project implementation, this appointment is a
condition of effectiveness.
Training
4.16      Training would take place at all levels of GDW, the communes and
the intercomunal authorities.  The training program would aim at
strengthening institutions and personnel by:
-  upgrading the skills of GDW higher-level and line staff with a
view to standardizing their professional qualifications, which
are now heterogenous and not necessarily well-matched;
-  raising the awareness of the public regarding the advantages
of higher-quality potable water, the desirability of their
participation in the works and the requirement to pay a fair
price for the water;
-  improving the skills of the maintenance staff, to ensure the
care of rural water supply systems at the users' association
and commune levels;
- raising the awareness of and providing training for communal
administrators (bourgmestres and chairmen of users'
associations) in the optimal use of the water supply sytems;
and
- training communal accountants to improve accounting and
financial reporting systems and collection procedures.
4.17      A training program is being prepared by a firm which specializes
in rural water supply (SAUR), financed by the PPF. UNDP financing would
cover the actual expenses of this training program, in Rwanda and abroad,
for the personnel of GDW and for communal employees: mayors, accountants
and water supply attendants. Moreover, on-the-job training would be



- 22 -
provided by the technical assistance to GDW and the project unit.
Undoubtedly, continued future efforts in training and human resource
development will have to be made, as the proposed project represents the
first step in assisting the country to strengthen GDW as an institution
capable of carrying out its assignment. Annex 15 provides more detailed
information on the envisaged training program, according to the assessment
of training needs carried out during project preparation, and confirmed
during appraisal.
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Implementation
4.18      The secondary distribution systems would be constructed by the
communes and the users' associations with the help of NGOs (see par.
3.13). GDW would contract with NGOs for the review of the exieting design
with the communes, the consultant acting as coordinator. COFORWA would be
responsible for 5 communes, SNV and Care International for 6. They also
would start sensitization efforts immediately since this participatory
process is an extremely long one which involves education (benefits of safe
water), public opinion determination, and collective decision-making. The
NGOs would also have to help the population create users' associations
covering the distribution systems. Until Credit effectiveness, all these
actions would be financed by the PPF.
4.19      As soon as the pipes and equipment are supplied by the
contractors retained for the main works, the NGOs will start the works on
the distribution systems, with the help of the population: laying of
pipes, construction of small reservoirs and standpipes. In any case, NGO's
work would be supervised by GDW.
'Operation and Maintenance
4.20      Operation and maintenance of the installed secondary water
systems would be assumed by the Communes, who would be assisted by users'
associations. Families using a standpipe, or a group of standpipes, would
make up a users' association responsible for operation and maintenance of
the secondary network and the standpipes. Every user's association will
elect one representative to a commune-wide user's association, which will
interest itself in all systems in the commune. This commune-wide
association will elect a Water Board, which will have direct and full
responsibility for operation and maintenance of facilities within the
commune boundaries. The Water Board will collect water charges from the
users' associations, will pay the inter-communal bills and its own staff
and expenditures. The annual meeting of the commune-wide users'
association will also elect representatives to the Communal Water
Committee. This Communal water committee will he composed of
representatives of users' associations and of commune officials. Through
this committee, the Commune will retain responsibility for all the water
systems in its territory, and thus can take over the maintenance of the
secondary systems and water points in the event of any problems with the
functioning of the users' associations and recover the cost of such
services from the user.
4.21      For the larger installations (transmission mains, treatment
plants and pumping stations) serving more than one commune, the communes



- 23 -
Authority with full administrative and financial responsibility for their
operation and maintenance. Two such Intercommunal Associations would be
required to serve the Lava Region. It is anticipated that the local staff
of the project unit would be appointed by the two Water Authorities at the
end of the construction period as qualified executives for the management
of the water supply schemes. The water authorities would contract with
professional operators for water production systems which comprise pumping
stations and/or treatment plants. These operators would be local private
enterprises which already have experience in water supply. For the Mutobo,
pumping and treatment plant, the State-owned company, Electrogaz, would be
the operator because the station has already been built under the First
Water Supply Project (Cr. 1345-RW) for the city of Ruhengeri, and is
operated by Electrogaz. This is an exception. A detailed description of
these institutional arrangements is given in Annex 16.
4.22      Participation of the Communes concerned and their users'
associations from the beginning is considered crucial for the success of
the project. Therefore, appropriate fora for each of the two Lava Region
systems need to be established, assembling all the Communes and NGOs
involved, under the coordination of GDW and the Project Unit to discuss all
issues, and to have all active participants fully Informed of the decisions
and progress of project design and implementation; and to review the
institutional aspects, in particular the formation of users' associations
and the formation of the two Inter-Communal Associations. The latter shall
be formally created by the end of 1988 and the management staff of the
Water Authorities appointed by the end of 1989.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      The financial aspects of government policy for rural water supply
systems are importarL.  The aim of securing the participation of the users
in running the systems, and in paying for the costs of operation,
maintenance and renewal will be put to the test in the program for the
rehabilitation and extension of rural water schemes. The range of types of
schemes covers the more simple gravity ones, costing about 500 FRW per
family per annum, to 1000 FRW for one involving pumping and to 1500 FRW for
those requiring pumping and treatment. The government, through GDW will be
in charge of executing and securing the finances for new rural systems, but
once they are handed over to those at the local level a new responsibility
is developed. It is anticipated that the facilities will be handed over to
the Communes and, if any, to the Intercommunal Water Authorities who will
thereafter be responsible for their operation, maintenance and renewal.
The Government will retain responsibility for servicing the loans and
credits received for construction of these projects and there will be no
local involvement in this regard. Accordingly these loans and credits will
not appear in the financial accounts of the Water Authorities or the
Communes.
5.02      For the Lava Region component, tariff policy will be of paramount
importance in ensuring that finances are available for the operation and
maintenance of high standards of the two schemes. Because of the nature of
the terrain and soils, the projects are expensive ones, and consequently
the tariffs will be on the high side. All the more reason then to have an
awareness program to explain the need for adequate tariffs.
National Fund for Rural Water Supply
5.03      The financing arrangements for NFRWS will be established as a
special account of the existing Communal Development Fund (CDF) created by
Decree-Law no. 17/77 of July 13, 1977. This Fund, within the Ministry of
Interior, receives contributions from the communes, the Government and
external donors. It grants loans and grants to the communes for communal
or intercommunal investments. The fuuds of NFRWS would be used for rural
water supply through loans and grants to the communes, approved by the CDF
loan committee on the basis of an appraisal report prepared by GDW. The
funds of NFRWS will be used for studies, equipment and works, but only for
rural water supply. An external audit would be carried out every year and
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Documents related to its operations and a decree for the establishment of
NFRWS would be reviewed by the Bank prior to credit effectiveness. Key
features have been discussed during appraisal and are acceptable. In
particular, technical assistance and training would be provided to CDF and
NFRWS to improve their capacity and efficiency. The Government would make
an annual contribution to NFRWS,about tlS$ equivalent 0.2 million or 10% of
the annual expenditures through a line item in the Development Budget. The
initial contribution from all cofinanciers would amount to USS1.0 million
and the account would be replenished every quarter up to this amount. The
establishment of NFRWS within the Communal Development Fund and the initial
Government contribution of US$0.2 million equivalent will be a condition of
effectiveness of the credit.

5.05      The two Water Authorities will be responsible for delivering
water to the tean communes. Each Authority will charge their own members
with a common water price. Consumption by each commune will be metered and
it will be held responsible for payment of the water. Each commune will
have its own expenses in distributing water within its own territory and
these will be taken into account in the charges which it will make for
water. It will have appropriate measures for collecting and recording
revenues and doing so on the basis of the most suitable and efficient
method - whether by jerryean or by bi-annual, quarterly or monthly charges.
Demand Projections
5.06      Projections of water consumption have been made for four separate
categories:  standpiDe users. private conneetions, public ea6nletione.. AnA



- 26 -
cattle. Standpipe users are assumed to have a demand for 12 litres per day
in 1992 (when the projects are expected to become fully operational),
rising steadily to 15 litres by 1995. This demand is assumed to remain at
this level until the year 2000, the last year for which demand and
financial projections are made in this appraisal report. Apart from this
risirg consumption per capita, consumption is also expected to rise with
populatlon increases in the area served by the projects. These have been
estimated separately for each of the communes, with a range of increase
from 2.5X to 4.0% per annum. Overall population projections for East and
West are given in Annex 17, together with consumption estimates for the
four categories.
5.07      Private connections are assumed to have a growth rate per annum,
as from 1992, of about 3%, while public connections are expected to grow in
the range of 7-8.52. The latter category includes schools, hospitals,
government offices, etc. The number of cattle In the Lava Region is
expected to continue to decline at a yearly rate of 5%. Annex 18 also
shows the proportionate consumption by the four categories in percentage
terms for every year of the forecast, It will be seen that standpipe users
are assumed to be responsible for almost 60% of all consumption, with
public connection ranging between twenty and thirty percent. The numbers
of families in the relevant area are also shown, assuming an average of 5.6
persons per family.
Cost Estimates
5.08      Operating and maintenance, as well as renewal costs are presented
In Annex 19. They are shown separately under the headings production and
transmission. 'Production' (which includes treatment and pumping) and
'transmission' (which means the passage of the water through the main ducts
and all that it entails) are the responsibility of the Intercommunal Water
Authorities. 'Distribution' and its related renewal, shown in Annex 20,
covers the subsidiary networks and reservoirs, together with the stand-
pipes themselves, and are under the care of the communes and of the users'
associations. Renewal costs are also broken down by the two headings and
assume a life of 15 years for all equipment (on a straight-line basis) and
a life of 50 years for everything else such as civil engineering works,
pipes and pipe laying, and housing. Renewal charges on a 50 year basis are
calculated such that in each succeeding year the charge is 3% higher than
in the preceding year, a figure close to the rate of population growth.
5.09      Operating and maintenance costs for transmission and distribution
are assumed to be fixed, while those for production are assumed to be 35%
variable in the East and 21% in the West in accordance with the total
volume of water consumed. Annex 19 and 20 present the cost estimates and
also the costs per cubic meter for production and transmission together
(which would indicate the price to be charged to the communes involved) as
well as for distribution separately. All items are fully costed and there
is no assumption of voluntary work in the projections.
Tariffs
5.10      On the assumption that total costs should be apportioned to users
on the basis of volume of water consumed. Figures for standpipe users



- 27 -
would represent an annual charge per family of about FRw 1660 and 1455 for
the East and the West respectively. If we take into account a collection
rate of 85%, these annual charges would rise to FRw 1,900 annually in the
East, and FRW 1,700 in the West, for 1992 (the equivalent, respectively, of
about US$23 and US$20). All the cost figures for 1992 have been increased
by a total of 31.1% from a 1986 base to allow for inflation. As from 1992,
one set of projections (Annex 19) assumes a rate of inflation of 5% per
annum up to the year 2000.
5.11      Cattle are shown in the projections as drinking around 5-10% of
total water consumption Its proportionate share would be paid by its
owners for this water. Public connections are expected to pay their
consumption at cost while the private connections are expected to pay on
average, 135% of their proportionate share of the costs, with an increase
of 5% per year up to year 2000.
Renewal Costs
5.12      Renewal costs have been shown separately per commune in Annex 21.
The presumption is that renewals funds will be deposited in a special
account, at the NFRWS or the "Banques Populaires" to meet future needs -
both for the communes as well as for intercommunal water authorities. The
importance of ensuring that these, potentially large, sums be available and
spent only for the purposes intended should be stressed. In the case of
renewal for production equipment, provision is deemed to be included in the
arrangements with a professional group or private company which will be
engaged under contract to manage production and transmission.
5.13      The appropriations for renewal, made in the projections, are
based on the replacement costs estimated on the basis of an annual increase
of 5%.
5.14      Provision should be made for inspection by the Government
of the financial accounts of both the Intercommunal Water Authorities and
of the water accounts of the Communes. Appropriate assurances have been
obtained on this matter during negotiations, as well as on the important
matter of the satisfactory designation of the renewal funds.
5.15      Although the accounts of GDW are subject to control like all the
departments and agencies of the government of Rwanda, there is a need for
an external audit of GDW. This is supported by the future magnitude of
GDW's operations as well as the envisaged utilization of the Special
Account and of the Project Advance Account (see para. 3.20). The first
audit should be carried out for GDW's fiscal year in which the Credit
becomes effective and assurances have been obtained at negotiations that a
short list of qualified auditors, acceptable to the Association would be
sent to the Association by June 30, 1988.

VI. ECONOMIC AND SdCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
6.01      The major benefit of the proposed project will be the
availability of a safe potable water supply to that part of the rural
population living in scattered settlements which so far has not received an
adequate share towards the improvement of their living conditions.
Arrangements that would ensure the proper operation and maintenance of
these systems in the long run should demonstrate to the population that the
necessary outlays to be collected in the form of water charges will be more
than offset by their improved physical well-being due to a safe water
supply.
6.02      Quantification of health benefits due to safe water supply Is not
possible as a variety of factors influence improvements in health, such as
health educatiou, availability of food, level of economic activity and
application of hygiene. Nevertheless, the water-borne diseases which are
prevalent in Rwanda (see annex 1) would be checked and the number of sick
days are expected to be progressively reduced.
6.03      Family members travel long distances for water every day.
Children do this task for distances up to 2 Ki, women for distances between
2 and 5 km, and men for distances beyond 5 km. In the Lava Region,
particularly in the dry seasou, they often must walk up to 15 km (round
trip of up to 30 km) to find safe water. This represents 5 to 6 hours
carrying 45 kg. of water. The possibility of drawing, in the future, not
only safe water from public standpipes but having these standpipes closer
to the living areas should provide time savings which, in a number of
cases, may be important. Since the female population also works the
fields, these savings could directly result in greater agricultural
output. With a water supply available at a reasonable distance (up to I
ki), they would have to pay at most FRw 5 per day. A family which had to
walk 4 hours would be estimated to save FRw 45 per day, or 16,000 per year,
taking into account an average daily salary of FRw 100.
6.04      A further benefit of no less importance will result in fostering
the development of communal responsibility for facilities serving the
population directly. The principle of communal participation in
constructing the works, and responsibility for their proper operation and
maintenance should reinforce the communal structure and provide the basis
for other improvements of human resources development, which ultimately
should lead to increased economic activity, including increased
agricultural production.
6.05      With regard to the institutional aspects, the proposed project
would not only create major benefits for the communes but would also result
In considerable improvements in planning, executing and supervising the
efficient functioniag of rural water systems at the country level. This
institutional strengthening should provide the basis for extending and
replicating, in the future, the construction, operation and maintenance of
rural water systems.
Affordability
6.06      Socio economic surveys were carried out during project
preparation to establish the rural population affordability limits and to



- 29 -
determine its willingness to pay for tie services to be provided under the
project, For most of the water systems to be rehabilitated, the cost per
family per year for operation, maintenance and renewal would be between FRw
500 and 1,000. This is acceptable for an average annual income of FRw
50,000 (1% to 2% of income). Nevertheless, in the Lava Region, due to high
pumping heads, the cost per family would be about FRw 1455 per year for an
average income of FRw 53,670 in the western part of the project and FRw
1660 per year for an average income of FRw 45,500 in the eastern one.
These costs do not include provision for bad debt, which would represent
about 15% of total billing. Therefore, the water charges represent
respectively 2.7% and 3.6% of the average annual income. It is generally
agreed that below 5% such a contribution is acceptable. In this regard,
some water systems are already in operation with significant financial
contributions from the beneficiary families: Ruhango (1200 FRw/year),
Cyumba (2000), Kivuye (1800) and Icyanya (960). Nonetheless, some
families' incomes are far below the average and the communes will have to
include in their budget a provision to subsidize these exemptions, as they
presently do for school contribution exemptions or include a level of
cross-subsidy in the tariffs.
6.07      Participation in the construction would pose no difficulty as the
population traditionally contributes half a day of work per week for the
improvement of communal facilities. This community labor (umuganda) would
be made more efficient by the participation of NaOs which have built up a
good experience in working with the communes.
6.08      Project affordability has also to be examined on two other
levels: (i) the implication for the country's budget of the investment
cost and(ii) the impact on communal budgets of the recurrent expenditures.
6.09      The Government of Rwanda will be responsible for the debt service
of all loans and credits received for the project. In addition, the
remainder of the financing would be assured by a Government contribution of
US$3.9 million (FRw 327.6 million). The conditions of the various loans
and grants and the annual cost for the Government are shown in Annex 22.
The total cost per year will be US$0.879 million from 1993 to 1997, 3.067
million from 1998 to 2007, 2.103 million from 2007 to 2017 and 0.825
million thereafter until 2037. Therefore, the debt burden would represent
4.5 percent of the current budget between the years 1988 and 2000, based on
the annual growth in current expenditures (in nominal terms) of about 6.4
and 3.5 percent during the periods 1987-90 and 1990-2000, respectively.
This represents about 1% of the annual export earnings.
6.10      The impact of the project on communal budgets would be minimal
because the recurrent expenditures would be paid for by the beneficiaries.
In the event of the Water Board failing to fulfill its stated functions,
the commune would only have to cover: (i) the salary of the communal water
attendant, already in place for most of the communes; and (ii) part time
salary of the communal accountant.



- 30 -
Ptroject Justification
6,11      The analysis of the project's benefits is closely linked to its
Justification. The proposed project would potentially contribute towards
the widely recognized country objective of human resources development and
increased agricultural production. Fostering the principle of delegating
responsibility for operation and maintenance of the water systems at the
local level is a further step toward decentralization and should minimize
the incremental burden on the national budget. Strengthening of the agency
responsible for planning, constructing and overseeing the proper
functioning of rural water supply (GDW) is particularly important as it is
possible only through this agency to improve the rural water supply
sub-sector.
Least Cost Solution
6.12      The most economic alternatives for meeting the water demand were
selected. Wherever possible and feasible, rehabilitation of existing
systems has been proposed. The rehabilitation cost of the Lava Region
System is relatively high (US$100 per capita) because of the local geology
and geography. There is only one possible alternative which would be to
use rainwater and catchments such as cisterns. However, the cost of this
alternative would also be high per family: US8300 for a tank, plus, In
most cases, a new roof. Moreover, this solution could not meet the demanA
during dry seasons, which last 3 months or more, and the water tanks would
be easily contaminated, negating the health effects of the proposed
systems.
Environmental Impact
6.13      The possibility of a negative impact on the 'Parc National des
Volcans' which is a national reserve for preserving mountain gorillas was
assessed during appraisal. The conclusions were as follows:
-  the design of the water systems was good in terms of siting
and water provision for the local population, and would in
fact have the effect of drawing people away from rather than
toward the Park (at present some people are entering Park
lands to obtain water and this would generally no longer be
necessary);
- given present demographics, the organized provision of water
would have no additional negative impact in the foreseeable
future on the already troubling land/man ratio in the area.
In fact for medium/long-term planning purposes, fixed water
provision will help at least to stabilize the populations
Therefore, the environmental Impact of the proposed project on the Park
would on balance be positive.
Women's Role
6.14      The role of Rwandese women in the water provision process is
presently very important. They often carry water for the family and they
are the main users. Therefore, in the proposed project, thls role will he
fully recognized, in the project design and implementation,  It would he
important for the project that a significant number of women he elected as
responsible officials of users' associations and as members of communal



- 31 -
water committees. It seems clear that the families would be less reluctant
to pay for water if women are responsible for collecting water charges.
Impact on Poverty Group
6.15      The poverty threshold is estimated in 1986 at 40X of the per
capita GNP, or US116 dollars. Assuming a family of 5.6 persons, the
poverty threshold is US$650 per family per year, or FRw 54,600. This is
about the average family income for the country (FRw 54,902). Since this
average includes urban centers, we can assume that 80X of the rural
population is below the poverty threshold. Therefore, the poverty group in
the Lava Region is estimated at about 260,000 at the time of project
completion. They will obtain their water from standpipes and connections.
As most of those connections will serve public facilities as schools,
dispensaries, hospitals, most of the water drawn there would also be
attributable to that part of the population served by standpipes, and the
poverty component of the project is 80% according to the volume of water
consumed.
Project Risks
6.16      The major risks in implementing the proposed project are not so
much associated with the construction and installation of the water supply
systems but with sustaiued maintenance of these systems. Experience all
over Africa has shown that the most promising results with regard to this
aspect are derived from the combined effects of delegating responsibility
to the village level and fostering the sense of communal ownership.
6.17      Although this approach appears obvious, the actual results will
only be known after some time has elapsed following completion of the
system. Questions still remain whether the benefitting population can he
sufficiently motivated over a long time to sacrifice the necessary monetary
outlays, to join in communal efforts where the systems need maintenance and
major repairs and to adopt the measures necessary to really benefit from
the overall improvements in health and living conditions.
6.18      The proposed project was designed to keep these questions in mind
and to promote to the maximum extent possible participation by the rural
population in constructing these systems.   Planned health demonstration
campaigns as well as sensitizing the local population to the idea of
improving health conditions shouid, also work towards achieving the goal of
improving living conditions and thereby increasing productivity.
6.19      However, it would not be prudent to assume that the villagers and
the communes could solve all the maintenance problems on their own. The
necessary outside support would be provided by GDW. This raises the
question whether GDW could provide this, even after completion of project
implementation. The technical assistance provided, and the comprehensive
training program, would reduce this risk to acceptable levels.
6.20      Delays in project implementation should be small as bidding
documents for the main contracts would be ready at the time of Board
presentation and bids would be submitted before Credit effectiveness.



- 32 -
Project risks therefore are acceptable when the benefits that would be
derived from project implementation are considered.
Monltoring
6.21      Critical  indicators, which will be compiled in quarterly and
annual reports, would monitor the progress of the proposed project. Within
six months of project completion, GDW would prepare and submit to the
Association a project completion report on the basis of an outline mutually
agreed upon.

VI1* AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreements have been reached with the
Government on the following points:
(a) The Government will implement GDW's new organization and
complete this implementation by December 31, 1992, (pare.
4.11);
(b) An annual contribution to NFRWS, of about US$ equivalent 0.2
million, would be made every year by the Government (para.
5.03);
(c) The Association would be given the opportunity to review
GDW's annual budget each year for the following fiscal years
(para. 4.12); and GDW would recruit at least five engineers
and technicians every year from 1987 to 1992 (para. 4.13)
with corresponding provision included in the budget.
(d)  GDW's and NFRWS' accounts would be audited by external
auditors acceptable to the Association from effectiveness
onwards. The audit report including the auditor's
certificate would be forwarded to the Associatlon within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. A short list of
auditors would be sent to the Association by June 30, 1988
(para. 5.16);
(e) During project Implementation, an up-dated three year
Investment program would be submitted by October 31, each
year, to IDA for its review and comments (para. 1.14), and,
based on such review, the Government would finalize such
an investment program;
(f)  The two Inter-Comunal Associations of the Lava Region would
be formally established by the end of 1988 and the
management staff of the two Water Authorities appointed by
the end of 1989 (para. 4.22). IDA would be given the
opportunity to review and comment legal documents for this
establishment;



- 34 -
(g)  GDW would prepare quartefrly and annual progress reports and
a project completion report (para. 6.21); and
(h) The Government would see to it that:
(i)  water charges be sufficient to cover operation,
maintenance and renewal costs;
(ii) water charges be reviewed annually by the end of
October of each year to determine their adequacy;
(iii) these charges be deposited in a separate account
and payments from this account be made only for
expenses related to water supply (para. 5.12) ; and
(iv) the water accounts of the Communes Water Boards and of
the Intercommunal Water Authorities be audited annually
by the inspectors of the Government (para. 5.15).

GOVERNMENT RURAL WATER SUPPLY POLICY
Extract from the Proceedings of the Government Council
The Government Council met on November 15 to study the dossier on
the Institutional Study on Rural Water Supply Management.
f
After reading the explanatory memorandum, the Minister of Public
Works and Energy requested that the Government state its position on the seven
points listed on page 3 of the explanatory memorandum (attached as Annex Ia).
He pointed out that the purpose of the study was to sensitize people with
regard to the maintenance of the water supply facilities made available to
them. All the major water projects planned would depend on this
sensitization. The Minister of Public Works and Energy also informed the
Council that the Ministerial CIC* had met and had raised certain questions, as
recorded in the minutes of the meeting (Annex Ib). The members of the CIC had
approved the content of the study in general, however, and had agreed to the
seven points listed below:
(1) Affirm the capacity of communes to act as contracting authorities and
also their capacity to delegate their responsibilities to user
associations and to qualified professionals;
(2) Authorize the change in the organizational structure of ELECTROGAZ to
enable it to undertake certain action (water treatment and pumping
stations) in the rural areas;
(3) Adopt the principle of a rate system based on a cross subsidy at commune
level of all the water supply facilities involved;
(4) Determine whether the rate applicable to users of standpipes *.....
could, where water supply facilities are concerned, be extended to users
of protected springs within a single commune  .....* or whether a special
rate reflecting the real operating costs of a protected spring should be
envisaged for the latter;
(5) Decide to establish a Fonds National de l'Hydraulique Rurale - FNHR
(National Rural Water Fund), which would pool and redistribute any
surplus funds collected at commune level and which might even be used to
channel foreign capital for the expansion or renewal of the facilities;
(6) Determine the conditions required for eligibility to a private connection
from the rural water supply system;
(7) Establish the conditions for forming reserve supplies of equipment needed
in order to provide communes with a relatively quick source of supply
close to their facilities to guarantee the continuity of the water supply
service they are expected to provide;



Annex 3
Page 2 of 2
After discussing the various issues under study, as presented by the
Minister of Public Works and Energy, the President of the Republic, in
bringing the meeting to a close, announced that the CIC proposals contained in
the Institutional Study on Rural Water Supply Management had been adopted. Re
asked that this study be amended in light of the observations made by members
of the Government and that it then be forwarded to the departments involved to
inform them of their responsibilities and to enable them to make the necessary
arrangements to perform the tasks involved.
The President of the Republic reminded the Minister of Public Works
and Energy that the members of the Government had pressed for manpower
training and had approved the establishment of the Fonds National de
Il'ydraulique Rurale, while recommending that it not be autonomous.  It would
operate as a credit window within the Fonds de D4veloppement Conmunal to
support communes in their rural water supply development efforts. The
President of the Republic finished by urging the use of local products in the
water development works.
We therefore understand that, following this meeting of the
Government Council, all the major principles contained in the Institutional
Study on Rural Water Supply Management have been adopted and that decisions on
their implementation will be made as and when needed, including, among other
things, the adoption of legislation prepared as a result of this study, which
is to be submitted to the Ministerial CIC for examination as soon as possible.

and management of rural water schemes are to rest with the communes,
according to Government policy. While the GDW will have responsibility for
planning, financing and constructing new water and sewerage systems, and
for the overall supervision (and control) of the sector the communes will
have an independence in managing their rural water supply systems but will
be required to charge tariffs so as to cover the costs of operation,
maintenance and renewal. The new emphasis in the commune is expected to
have beneficial effects both as regards operational efficiency and consumer
participation.
The Commune
2.        It is envisaged that the management of rural water supply and
sewerage systems, which lie entirely within the confines of a single
commune, will be organized throughout the country in the following manner:
(a) The consumers of one or several water-Points (or standpipes)
will constitute a user association. They will elect someone
to be responsible for the care and maintenance of the water
points and related facilities, for the collection of water
charges and for passing these on to the commune. Every user
association will elect one representative to a commune-wide
user association, which will interest itself In all systems
in the commune - whether these be one or more systems.
(b) This commune-wide user association will hold an annual
general meeting - and such other meetings as appropriate -
to review the affairs of the system(s) within the commune.
The annual meeting will elect members of the Water Board,
which will have full responsibility for all the water
systems on the Communets territory, and elect members to
represent it on a Commune Water Committee. This committee
will also have a minority of members elected to it by the
Commune Council.
(c) The fixed and other assets of water systems lying entirely
within the commune shall belong to the commune, and be
managed by the Commune Water Board with such technical
accounting and other assistance as the commune itself may
provide. This Water Board shall prepare annual budgets, set
tariffs for all customers (which need not necessarily he
uniform) within the commune, supervise their collection, pay

all operating and maintenance costs properly chargeable to
the Water Board and provide for the renewal of fixed assets
belonging to the Commune by setting aside the necessary sums
in an appropriate fund. In the event of the Water Board
failing to fulfil its stated functions, the initiative to do
so shall be taken by the Commune Water Committee.
Intercommunal Water Authority
3.        Where rural water or sewerage systems serve more than one
commune, the following amendments shall be made to the arrangments outlined
in the preceeding section on The Commune. In order to cater for the common
interests and joint responsibilities of the communes involved, they shall,
in accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Organization of
Communes of November 23, 1963, create together an Intercommunal Water
Authority. The creation of such an Authority will represent a new
institutional initiative for Rwanda. The Authority will be composed of two
representatives elected by each of the Commune Water Boards involved. All
fixed and other assets which serve the needs of more than one commune shall
belong to the Intercomunal Water Authority.  The remaining assets shall
continue to belong to the individual communes. In addition to its policy
making role, the Authority shall be responsible for the over-all management
of the intercommunal system(s), and shall appoint the senior personnel for
this purpose to whom the required authority shall be delegated. The
Authority shall charge a uniform tariff for the water consumed by each of
its communes. This tariff shall cover operating and maintenance costs
incurred by the Authority and provide for the renewal of its fixed assets -
such provision being deposited in an appropriate fund. In the event of the
Authority failing to discharge its 'statutory" obligations, reserve powers
shall be exercised by the Prefecture. Quite independently of this set of
circumstances arising, it is anticipated that the DGE will establish an
office of its own in every prefecture.
Lava Region
4.        The proposed country-wide institutional arrangements for Commune
Water Boards and for Intercommunal Water Authorities shall be applied In
the Lava Region in the following manner, Two Intercommunal Water
Authorities shall be established. The Water Authority for the East shall
be formed by the following eight communes: Kidaho, Nkumba, Kigombe,
Kinigi, Mukingo, Nkuli, Karago and Mutura. All of these communes are in
the prefecture of Ruhengeri, except Karago and Mutura. The Water Authority
for the West will be formed by four communes: Rubavu, Rwerere, Kanama and
Mutura - all of which are in the prefecture of Gisenyi.
5.        Because of the lack of prior experience, and the relative
complexity of the management of the East and the West Intercommunal Water
Authorities, it is anticipated that private professional firms will be
appointed by these two Authorities to operate and maintain the pumping
stations and treatment plants together with major water mains. In this
way, professional expertise, whether technical, financial or
administrative, will be available to ensure efficient and timely management
and, at the same time, provide for the training of personnel.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
Population
1.        The population was based on 1985 estimates.  Projections have
been estimated separately for each of the Communes, with a range of
increase from 2.5% to 4.0% per annum.
Revenues
2.        The Lava Region has been divided into two distinct areas; West
and East with separate income statements. However the same assumptions
have been retained for both areas. Two categories of tariffs exist in the
West as well as in the East.
(a) Private connections: these are expected to pay 1.35X of
their proportionate share of cost for the West and for the
East in 1992 increased by 5% each year;
(b) Standpipe users, public connections and cattle are expected
to pay their water consumption at cost. The annual charge
per family would be approximately FRw 1660 in the East and
FRW 1455 in the West in 1992 with an annual increase of 5%
for subsequent years. These costs do not include provision
for bad debt which represent 15% of total billing.
Operation and Maintenance
3.        All estimated operating and maintenance cost have been increased
by a total of 31.1% from 1986 to 1992 to allow for inflation. As from
1992, projected costs assume a rate of 5% per annum up to the year 2000.
Renewal Costs
4.       Renewal provision has been calculated at 6.66% per annum, straight
line, on equipment and 2.0X per annum for civil works and pipes. Renewal
provisions on 2.0% per annum basis are calculated such that in each
succieding year the charge is 3% higher than in the precedinig year, a
figure close to the rate of population growth.
5.        The appropriations of renewals, made in the projections, are
based on replacement costs estimated on the basis of an annual increase of
5%.

Receivables
6.        It is assumed 85% collection and a provision is required for
doubtful accounts. It is assumed that no working capital is needed at the
start of operations. An advance of three months consumption will be
collected when production begins. A sample of Mutura commune is given
below for calculation of revenue:
- Annual consumption in m3:
- Standpipes (442.32s365) -         161446.8m3
- Public Connections (215x365) -    78475.00m3
Cattle (107.98x365) -              39412.70m3
sub-total           279334.Sm3
Private Connections (60.63x365) -    22129.95m3
Total Consumption Mutura      301464.45m3
- Cost per m3
- Total cost 18.508.880/301464.45m3 - 61.39 FRw
- Revenue
- Standpipes, Public connections and cattle at cost
(61.39 x 279334.5)                         -  17,149,000 FRw
- Private connections 22129.95x(61.39x1.35)        1,834,000 FRw
- Othet fees : estimated at 1000 FRw per
connection (143 x 1000)                    -     143,000 FRw
Total Revenue-Mutura Commune      19,126,000
