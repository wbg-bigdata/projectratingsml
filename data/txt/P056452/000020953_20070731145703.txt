F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(i) expand rural access to electricity in 671 communes located in 32 provinces of
Vietnam through grid extension, where economically justified, to improve welfare,
enhance income earning capacity and help alleviate poverty;

  (ii) define and establish institutional mechanisms and strategy for rural electrification in
Vietnam that would facilitate: (a) a sustained program of continued rural electrification
with increased local management of operation and management, conversion of commune
electricity groups to joint stock cooperatives or companies; (b) the long-term viability of
the power sector through appropriate bulk supply tariffs and distribution margins; and (c)
continued implementation of power sector reforms in accordance with the 1997 Policy
Letter and Strategy; and




                                               ii

  (iii) promote the application of renewable energy sources in areas inaccessible to the
national grid and to supplement grid power supply.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, Vietnam's power sector was facing the challenge of meeting the needs of a
country in transition to an industrialized economy and modern society. Between 1995 and
2000, electricity demand had grown at an average rate of 13-15% p.a. Government social
and economic growth targets for future years required increasing electricity supply at a rate
1.7 times faster than GDP. Rural electrification (RE) was a critical component of the
Government's program to eliminate poverty, redress imbalances in development, and
improve overall welfare levels by providing reliable lighting sources, better living conditions,
health care and other services. In 1998, about 30 million people still had no access to
electricity, and only 72% of the 8,860 rural communes and less than half the rural households
had been electrified.

Planned development of essential energy infrastructure represented an investment of around
5% of GDP, needing careful use of the limited financial resources available to the country.
The Government planned to address these challenges by: (i) raising and restructuring
electricity tariffs to increase internally generated funds; (ii) promoting energy conservation
and efficiency; (iii) increasing private investment in power generation and developing natural
gas; (iv) equitization of distribution; and (v) meeting the funding gap using donor financed
programs, particularly for its rural electrification program.

Progress of the Government's RE Program was being hampered by poor institutional
arrangements and lack of sufficient capital. Almost 90% of rural electricity distribution was
carried out by Commune Electricity Groups that had no legal status, minimal technical
competence and little financing. Regulation of the power sector suffered from two specific
drawbacks: (i) there was no effective legal and regulatory framework for the power sector;
and (ii) the function of government oversight and regulation was not separate from
Electricity of Vietnam's (EVN's) operation of the power system. As a result, Vietnamese
government agencies and power enterprises had been unable to decentralize decision making
and to exercise administrative/management oversight of local energy activities without
interfering. One of the basic requirements for a more successful RE program, effective local
implementing agencies with a high degree of operating autonomy, technical competence and
good leadership, were missing.

The Bank supported the Project for two reasons. First, its support would help to cover the
financing gap for rural electrification by providing IDA funds of US$150 million. To
optimize the use of available IDA funds and ensure adequate technical design and local
capacity building, the Project aimed to provide: (i) technical assistance to develop an
economic evaluation methodology for RE investments, standardization of technical design of
rural networks and cost sharing arrangements; (ii) consultant/advisor assistance in financial
and commercial management; and (iii) training to upgrade PCs utility management skills (of
the 8,000 staff in the provincial PCs, fewer than 20% had been trained in modern utility
management practices).




                                                  1

Second, the Project aimed to pilot improved institutional arrangements. In particular, the
Bank supported the Project as a demonstration of decentralizing the RE program to local
implementation agencies, building local direct participation and cost sharing, and building
local capacity for operation and management of the rural network, as the key principles for a
successful and sustainable rural electrification.

To build the institutional groundwork and facilitate future RE projects, the Project also
provided technical assistance for: (i) assessment of different management arrangements for
rural networks; (ii) implement a pilot program to transform a commune electricity group into
a joint stock distribution company or co-operative; and (iii) a study to assess Vietnam's
current electricity tariffs and recommend tariff setting principles for distribution network
(distribution margins) and bulk supply tariffs for PCs and rural communes (commune
electricity groups) to ensure financial viability in the PCs and EVN.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project's original development objectives were to: (i) expand rural access to electricity
to 671 communes in 32 provinces of Vietnam through grid extension, where economically
justified, to improve welfare, enhance income earning capacity and help alleviate poverty;
(ii) assess and develop appropriate institutional mechanisms for rural electrification in
Vietnam that would facilitate: (a) a sustainable program of continued rural electrification;
and (b) the long-term viability of the power sector; (iii) continued implementation of power
sector reforms in accordance with the 1997 Policy Letter and Strategy; and (iv) promote local
renewable energy in areas inaccessible to the national grid and also to supplement grid power
supply.

The key performance indicators were:          (i) increase in the number of electrified rural
households and communes; (ii) progress in the implementation of power sector reform; (iii)
maintenance of financial soundness of EVN and PCs; and (iv) progress in the introduction of
policies and programs for renewable energy development.

The project included financial performance indicators for EVN and PCs, plus a tariff increase
to a specified value. As this value was calculated based on assumptions that failed to prove
correct, the tariff indicator was later eliminated and replaced by standard financial
performance indicators used in other Bank projects.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
and Reasons/Justification

There was no revision of the PDO or of the key indicators.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

People living in the rural, remote communes electrified were identified as the main
beneficiaries of the project. Rural areas benefited from development and poverty reduction.

Electricity of Vietnam (EVN), its power companies (PCs) and local distribution units were
also beneficiaries of the project, in institutional development, appropriate technical design
and local operation of rural networks, which significantly reduced PCs' costs in managing
rural networks.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

The project was designed with four components - one for each of the three Power
Companies (PCs) with rural areas - and the fourth to ensure sustainability by providing
technical assistance for capacity building, management arrangements and technical
design:

Component No. 1:       Electrification of communes in PC1 area to expand access to
                       electricity to about 147,150 households (HH) in the northern areas
                       of Vietnam in 347 communes in 13 provinces;

Component No. 2:       Electrification of communes in PC2 area to expand access to
                       electricity to 201,851 HH in 120 communes in the 10 provinces in
                       the southern areas of Vietnam;

Component No. 3:       Electrification of communes in PC3 area to expand access to
                       electricity to 204 communes in 9 provinces in the central region of
                       Vietnam and connect 81,184 HH.

Component No. 4:       Technical assistance and capacity building for EVN and the PCs
                       for institutional development.

1.6     Revised Components

There were no changes in the number or substance of components.

1.7     Other Significant Changes

Change in Scope:

Goods procurement arrangements by PCs that maximized competition and lowered prices,
and favorable movements in the exchange rate, led to unused funds becoming available to
electrify more households than originally planned. Upon the request of EVN and the PCs
and to further support the Government RE program, the number of project communes and
provinces participating in the project within the three Power Companies' areas were
increased eventually reaching 976 communes in 35 provinces.




                                               3

Change in Schedule:

The schedule was extended to include two additional phases and accommodate the increase
in project communes to be electrified:

    -  Original closing date:        30 June 2004
    -  First phase extension to:     30 June 2005
    -  Second phase extension to:    31 December 2006

Change in Costs:

The increase in number of communes and HH connected led to costs being different from
those estimated in appraisal, as shown in Table 1:

The original credit amount was SDR 111.7 million, equivalent to US$150 million. As the
US$ weakened during the implementation period, the credit amount in terms of US$ rose to
about US$ 168 million at closing.

Cancellation:

To allow the implementing agencies to use the project savings, in 2005 the credit closing date
was extended, for a second time, to 31 December 2006. As time left for the implementing
agencies to prepare the new project subcomponents was limited, the GoV requested to cancel
SDR 6 million (about US$ 9 million) from the credit, which was done on June 30, 2006. The




                                                4

total amount of the Credit after cancellation was SDR 105.7 million (or equivalent to about
US$ 159.55 million at the date the project closed).

The actual amount disbursed from the credit was SDR 99,996,918, equivalent to about
US$ 150,915,157 (at the exchange rate of 20 June 2007, when all disbursements were
completed). This means that about SDR5.7 million (or US$ 8.6 million) was left unused. The
reason was the time left for the preparation and implementation of the third phase was only
about one year; to avoid the risks of some subprojects being incomplete on the closing date,
31 December 2006, the implementing agencies cut those expected to encounter difficulties in
construction.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The PDOs were in line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy at the time, which called
for "Deeper Focus on Poverty and Social Issues" and "Redirection of Lending towards Rural
Development". The PDO supported the government strategy to rebuild the rural economy,
by: (i) raising productivity through infrastructure, in particular increasing rural
electrification; and (ii) accelerating rural development and increasing environmental
protection. Project components for PCs were designed to specifically target poor communes
in rural and distant areas.

The Project considered the recommendations of the Bank review of RE (Rural
Electrification: A Hard Look at Costs and Benefits; OED Précis, May 1995). Communes
were selected after verifying that grid extension was the least cost option and economically
viable.

To achieve the local participation and ownership required for successful implementation and
to maximize the number of communes connected, the Project was designed based on two key
principles: (i) decentralization to local authorities; and (ii) cost-sharing by all parties.

Given the large number of sub-projects, the concept for decentralized implementation, and to
secure quality EVN standardized, with assistance from the Bank: (i) Technical Specifications
for Rural Electrification, which were aimed at ensuring network efficiency; (ii) a template for
the economic and financial evaluation of sub-components; and (iii) a format for the
feasibility study report.

Broad consultation with stakeholders at the local level ensured interest and including written
commitments from consumers on willingness to connect and pay connection costs and from
provincial authorities to fund the compensation costs. Thus cost sharing was agreed as
follows:

    · EVN through its PCs was in charge of implementing the medium voltage (MV) and
        low voltage (LV) network up to the customer's meter;




                                                5

    · Project provinces were in charge of resettlement and payment of compensation and
        land acquisition costs. This was the first time that provinces paid compensation to the
        PAH for rural electrification. In previous projects compensation costs had been
        treated as customer contributions;
    · Rural consumers financed the household connections.

During preparation, the Bank assessed the capacity of local contractors to ensure
procurement packages were optimally sized. Fewer larger packages would limit the number
of contractors that could respond to tender documents, thus reducing competition and leading
to higher prices. Too many small packages would be more difficult to track and make
contract management by local implementing agencies more difficult. To address delays in
the procurement process experienced in other projects, bid evaluation procedures were
streamlined and EVN submitted to the Government a request to implement special
procedures for the Project. This was the first power sector project in Vietnam for which
approval and clearance for procurement was decentralized from EVN headquarters to the
PCs.

Measures were taken to reduce delays found in previous projects in the preparation and
implementation of RAPs due to insufficient counterpart funds, by: (i) the Bank providing
early assistance and monitoring in preparation of RAPs; (ii) feasibility studies of initial
components were approved by the relevant government agencies before negotiation of the
Credit; and (iii) a written firm commitment from Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) on
funding cost of compensation was obtained during preparation.

2.2     Implementation

The Project was successful in implementation, exceeding the number of communes
electrified and rural HH connected. Key factors for success included: commitment and
involvement of local authorities from start of preparation; coordination mechanisms and
close supervision including the Bank providing timely advice to local implementation
agencies; standardization of good technical specifications for rural networks; and adequate
packaging of procurement works and materials.

Managing coordination mechanisms and ensuring close supervision were consistently
reinforced during implementation. Underneath the main inter-ministerial steering committee
for the Project, local steering committees in each PC coordinated and monitored the
implementation progress for their component. Steering committees in each project province
coordinated resettlement and compensation.

Provinces were mostly successful and implementation progressed smoothly, though some
initially found problems. In particular, settlement of compensation to PAHs lagged in some
provinces, but this was resolved through Bank advice and supervision that improved the
efficient functioning of District Compensation Boards.

Implementation during the final period was affected by the rapid increase in the prices of
steel, aluminum and copper, creating unexpected price increases in equipment and materials



                                               6

between bid submission and contract award. Contracts offered in the bidding documents did
not include price adjustment clauses; consequently contractors refused to sign contracts at the
original prices, resulting in rebidding in several cases.

Sub-projects using cost savings suffered delays in implementation and disbursement. The
increase in counterpart funds required re-assessment of costs and Government re-approval of
the project, and obtaining this clearance proved to be slow. Furthermore, approval of
disbursement by the financial controllers stopped until the Government approved the new
total cost estimate, which was received by EVN only in April 2006.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project was prepared under the logical framework approach, setting indicators to be
monitored. In general, the monitoring and evaluation was well-designed and implemented,
and met project needs. EVN set up adequate systems, collecting and compiling monitoring
data every 6 months. Key indicators were regularly monitored and progress evaluated
compared with targets. Similarly, implementation of the environmental plan was regularly
monitored, and supervision missions included social and environmental experts.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

As identified at appraisal, there was a large number of PAHs but for most of them the
impacts were small and aggregate impacts in each of the three PCs' components low. Lines
were routed to minimize impact. Permanent land acquisition occurred only for distribution
line posts (3m2 for each MV and 1.5 m2 for each LV post) and sub-stations (20m2 for each
substation). Some houses were affected, but in the main did not require relocation of the
households outside their existing residential plots. In addition to permanent land acquisition,
a narrow right-of-way (ROW) of two to three meters for MV lines and one meter for LV
lines was temporarily occupied for post erection and line stringing, and in some cases for
temporary roads. A wider ROW was also designated, of eight meters for MV and three
meters for LV lines, in which all buildings and trees higher than four meters had to be
removed, but in which other activities could continue. For permanent land acquisition and
both ROWs, compensation was paid.

Project impacts at appraisal and at completion are summarized in the tables below:

In the event, the number of households was much greater than estimated at appraisal,
although the level of permanently acquired land was less. This was a result of: (i) the
increase in communes covered by the Project; (ii) the impact surveys during preparation
stage only identified the size of impact not individual property owners; and (iii) only the
land for which project owners have compensated PAH are recorded at completion, while
appraisal included all affected land including areas that had no owner.

Assessment of RAPs at Implementation

RAPs were generally implemented as planned. The following issues a rose:
   · In some cases, there was an initial lag in payment of compensation in some cases.
   · The compensation for individual HHs was in most cases small, particularly those
        affected by the low voltage system. As a consequence, the administrative process and
        transaction cost to manage the compensation was often higher than actual damage
        costs; and
   · The survey and other data collected in project preparation for the RAP became
        obsolete, due to the long period between initial surveys and completion of the project
        compared with the much more rapid changes in land use in Vietnam today. Often,
        assessment of compensation had to be based on a new survey to identify actual
        impacts, which sometimes resulted in differences compared with findings from
        surveys during preparation.

Procurement

The project involved a significant number of contracts. All major equipment and materials
were procured through international competitive bidding (ICB), while civil works were
procured through national competitive bidding (NCB).

Care was taken in: (i) defining adequate procurement packages to maximize competition but
limit the burden on implementation agencies; (ii) standardizing the NCB procurement
process; (iii) developing procurement capacity in the PMUs; and (iv) close monitoring by
EVN and PCs of the procurement activities of PMUs. The competitive procurement
procedures were effectively managed and led to prices lower than estimated at appraisal. A
review undertaken as part of the preparation of a paper to reduce the fiduciary risk for World
Bank financed projects in Vietnam noted that the project had complied well with Bank
procurement policies and guidelines.

Disbursement

Disbursement appears to have been the main weakness during project implementation. A
significant lag was observed between the work being done and the payment to contractors for
completed works. Causes of delays identified are the following:



                                               8

    (i) Low capacity of contractors. Procedures before submission of invoices for final
        payment required contractors to complete documents including as-built drawings, and
        return unused equipment and material to the PMU. Contractors delayed submission
        of final documents on the grounds that they were too complicated and difficult to
        complete. The 10% of the contract price that was reserved for final payment as a
        quality guarantee did not seem to have been enough to encourage contractors to
        prepare and complete the required documentation quickly.

    (ii) PMUs' delay in payment following sub-project final acceptance. The review process
        for disbursement by the financial controllers designated by the Government delayed
        the payment to contractors. Lack of clear procedures for the review and clearance of
        invoices made the justification process by the PMU tiresome, and discouraged PMUs
        from making the final completion payment. This is problem common to many
        projects in Vietnam and is being addressed at the portfolio/ country operations level.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Upon completion, the electrification schemes have been transferred to the Provincial Power
Services of EVN for operation and maintenance. Given the technical, commercial and
financial capacity of EVN, it is expected that the systems will be maintained and operated in
a safe and efficient way for their design lifetime.

The Project was the first of a series planned by the Bank to support RE in Vietnam. Starting
at the provincial level and with rural communes under PCs, the Project designed and tested
decentralization and cost sharing, and provided the groundwork for the next RE projects
through standardization of technical design and assessment of approaches for the
management of rural distribution.

The Second Rural Energy project (Cr. 4000 VN, IDA financing of $220 million) focuses on
rehabilitation of rural networks (MV and LV) and improving institutional and management
arrangements for rural networks. A third project, Rural Distribution, is under preparation to
remove bottlenecks in transmission and distribution due to increased demand in rural areas.
A project (Third Rural Energy Project) is planned after the end of the Second Rural Energy
project (envisaged for 2011) to support the electrification of the 5% or so communes that are
expected still to be without access at that time.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rate of Relevance: High

The PDO remains highly relevant at completion. The challenges of ensuring adequate supply
to rural areas, and improving the quality of service in areas not covered by the Project remain
and will become increasingly important as economic growth continues to accelerate in the




                                                9

less urbanized areas.        As sector reform proceeds, robust institutional and financing
mechanisms to ensure delivery of improved services will be of increasing importance.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

(i) Expand rural access to electricity in 671 communes located in 32 provinces. Exceeding
     its original indicators, the final outcome has been the electrification of 976 communes,
     45% more than targeted at appraisal (including 278 of the poorest communes identified in
     the Government's special commune program) and the connection of more than 550,000
     households in the most disadvantaged areas, 41% more than targeted at appraisal, as
     shown in Table 2.

     The project has contributed to the government's National Rural Electrification Program.
     Through the overall RE Government program access to rural households increased from
     50.7 % in 1996 to about 92.3% by 2006, representing access to 12 million of the 13
     million rural households. Progress of Vietnam rural electrification program is shown in
     the Figure 1 below. As described further in Annex 5, new electricity access achieved
     through the project has had a substantial positive impact on living standards.

(ii) Progress in the implementation of power sector reform: The major milestones of power
     sector reform include the issuing of Decree 22 in 1999 allocating responsibility for the
     Rural Electrification, and Decree 45 in 2001 setting out the Government's strategy. The


                                                   10

    Electricity Law of 2004 set the framework for the power sector (including rural
    electrification) for the next 20 years, while the road map for reform, approved in 2006,
    sets milestones and timings for the transition to a sector based on market principles. The
    project has underpinned reform.

(iii) Maintenance of financial soundness of EVN and the PCs: EVN's financial performance
    has continued to be satisfactory. In 2004, EVN and the Bank agreed that they would in
    future measure performance based on 3 main               financial indicators: Debt Service
    Coverage Ratio, which was to be maintained at 1.5 times or more; Self Financing Ratio
    which was to be kept at 25% or better; and Debt to Equity Ratio, to be kept at no more
    than 70:30. In subsequent fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, EVN and the PCs have
    maintained or exceeded these requirements.

(iv)Promote the application of local renewable energy in areas inaccessible to the national
    grid and also to supplement grid power supply. Under the project Ministry of Industry
    prepared and adopted the Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) which outlined a
    program to increase the use of renewable energy for both on grid supply and for
    electrification of remote areas. The first steps toward implementing REAP have
    subsequently piloted under the project through setting up a pilot scheme in one province
    (Son La) and preparing standardized power purchase agreements for renewable energy
    generators. The activity is being continued under System Efficiency Improvement,
    Equitization and Renewable Project (SEIER, Cr. 3680-VN) and grid connected
    renewable power will be scaled up under the proposed Renewable Energy Development
    Project.


3.3     Efficiency

At Appraisal:

The total project cost at appraisal was $201.3 million, of which $3 million was allocated to
TA activities. The remaining $198.3 million was allocated to the connection of communes to
the national power grid (see Table 3).

                                Table 3: Cost Estimates at Appraisal

    Component No 3                  204       81,184         52.37       256,716        645
    Total                           671      395,001         198.34      295,589        502


Table 3 shows different estimated unit costs per commune and per HH for each PC,
reflecting the differences in topographical conditions, system configuration and population
density. The low unit cost per HH in component No2 (PC2) is the result of: (i) the power
system in southern Vietnam allowing use of single phase transformers; (ii) higher population



                                                11

density in most communes; and (iii) MV lines already constructed in some project communes
before the Project. In all components, costs were estimated to be significantly lower than off
grid solar electrification.

At Completion

At completion, the key indicators and costs are as shown in Table 4.

The economic returns are satisfactory at 21.0% (compared with 29% at appraisal), and the
financial returns are ­3.0% (compared with ­3.3% at appraisal). The details of the analysis
of economic and financial returns are presented in Annex 4, and summarized in Table 5.

The project showed high economic benefits, but low financial benefits due to: (i) low
electricity consumption of rural consumers; (ii) high costs of connections especially in
mountainous areas; and (iii) a tariff set by the government for rural areas below actual cost of
service in those areas.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Overall Outcome Rating of the project: Satisfactory

The rating is based on the project: (i) overachieving its main physical indicator by extending
grid connections to a much larger number of communes and rural households; (ii)
satisfactory economic returns ; and (iii) substantial achievement in improving institutional
arrangements, capacity building and local management of rural networks, that have reduced
distribution losses and costs in rural networks, strengthening their sustainability. In all, the
combination of successful cost sharing, decentralization, technical and management capacity
building and manuals, plus good packaging of procurement is a good formula to scale up RE
further.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


                                                  12

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In order to determine the impacts of rural electrification, two surveys were conducted, the
main results of which are summarized as follows (see Annex 5 for details):

   (i) Impact on poverty reduction

        · Incomes of HH with access to electricity are higher, and increasing with time;
        · In the most disadvantaged communes, income of local people is increasing due to
            the combined access to infrastructure such as roads, electricity, schools, and
            clinics.   Though it is difficult to estimate exact contribution gained from
            electricity access, most of the people attributed about 30% of their gains to it; and
        · The number of HH using electricity for their business has increased since 2002.

   (ii) Gender aspects

        Traditionally, all housework in rural areas ­ including collection and carrying of
        drinking water, preparation of meals and rice husking ­ is done by women, and
        particularly girls. The survey shows that the physical and time burden of these tasks
        has significantly reduced in households that have access to electricity.

   (iii)Social development impacts

        As identified in the survey described in further detail in Annex 5, the quality of life
        has improved significantly.      Public primary health care has improved, there is
        increasing awareness of personal hygiene, housework for women and children has
        reduced, security has improved thanks to nighttime lighting, and there is increasing
        time for leisure, such as watching TV, and reading.

        The survey also demonstrates the beneficial impact of electricity on education, in
        improvement in learning quality due to better conditions for studies and teacher
        lesson preparation. Rural people now have better access to information sources,
        thereby improving their knowledge and understanding, and promoting education.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Rural Electrification Departments established in EVN and the PCs, as well as the Rural
Electrification Units set up in each Provincial Power Service, have contributed to the overall
success of the rural electrification program in Vietnam, improving coordination between the
central government and communes in remote rural areas.

The technical specifications developed by the project have standardized the design and
characteristics of rural networks, promoted better network quality, reduced technical losses,
and avoided the application of urban standards which are too expensive for low density areas.

At project completion, the Service Agent Model, where the Power Service signs service


                                               13

contracts with local staff, for procedures such as meter reading, bill collection, monitoring of
rights-of-way and minor repair of in-house wiring, was applied in most project communes.
This model has substantially reduced operating costs by about 50%.

Several thousand individuals - at least one from each commune - have been trained and many
subsequently engaged by the PCs as service agents.

To assist the operational staff, copies of the Technical Manual and an Operation Manual
developed in the Project were distributed to the project communes.

The services agent model set up under the project has proven effective. Individuals of each
commune are trained and hired by the Power Services, and are responsible for the local
services in each commune. This approach combines several benefits: (i) reduction in
operating costs, (ii) additional employment opportunities for local residents; (iii) better
routine rights-of-way check; (iv) faster communication in case of emergency; (v) greater
ownership by the commune and high level of payment; and (vi) an increase in the safety
awareness of the community.

Other models were studied in detail by the project - such as cooperative, joint stock company
and asset leasing, to be developed further in the next RE project.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The Project commissioned the Institute of Sociology (IoS) of the Vietnamese Academy of
Social Sciences to conduct a longitudinal survey of the project beneficiaries, covering a wide
range of social and economic differences in rural areas, and the main ethnic minority groups.
A first survey was conducted in 2002, a second in 2005, and the third and final survey was
being prepared in 2007 but had not been finalized at the time of this ICR. Thirty HH in each
of 42 communes were sampled, including 22 communes covered by the Project. Controls
were established using communes already electrified in 2002 (at the start of the survey) and
communes that were not likely to be electrified by the time of the second survey in 2005. In
2005 the study sampled 1,260 households, including 1,186 households that had also been
sampled in 2002.

The survey shows the multiple benefits of the Project and rural electrification. Access to
electricity has created conditions for economic development (particularly in the south), job
opportunities for local people and increased household income. Access has also improved
social and cultural life, reduced the burden of household chores for women and children,
improved public primary health care and improved child education. Further details can be
found in the Institute of Sociology Report "Rural Electrification Impact Study and Analyses",
Second Stage 2005. A summary of the major findings is given in Annex 5.

In addition and to assess the impact of the Project on the poorest communes in the northern
areas of Vietnam, a short survey was carried out, involving in-depth interviews in six
communes in three districts in three provinces. This participatory survey also confirms the
important benefits of the project.      In all the communes surveyed, poverty rates have


                                               14

significantly declined, as shown in Table 6.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

The gains to the individuals and communes electrified make it unlikely that they will give
them up lightly. The operation of the communes under the responsibility of the PCs and their
Provincial Power Services is well assured through the technical and management manuals
developed plus the technical training provided ensure adequate local capacity for the rural
networks. The "Agent System" that was developed and implemented by PCs for the Project
considerably reduces the operational costs for the rural networks. This has created the
conditions for the sustainability of the rural networks. Furthermore, the second RE project
that was initiated before the finalization of this Project was designed to continue improving
institutional arrangements and sustainability of RE.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory.           The Project responded to the CAS
objectives and Government needs to finance RE. A PHRD grant was obtained for the
Borrower to ensure adequate project preparation.

Teams were fielded together with EVN to project provinces to carefully explain project
design, fully explain their role and ensure their interest and cooperation. Adding provincial
representatives, the Task Team carried out a similar exercise at the district level and, with
district representatives, at selected project communes. The process was then repeated by the
local authorities to reach all project communes. This ensured their commitment and adequate
understanding for a smooth implementation.

The Bank facilitated the preparation process. In particular, the Bank assisted implementing
agencies to prepare standard templates, and to define clear responsibility for every agencies

involved through the intensive consultation process, giving necessary advice to the
implementing agencies in time.

(b)     Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

With the TTL and most of the key task team members based in the field, it was possible to
supervise the project closely, identify early any potential problem, and meet and provide
timely advice to the implementing agencies.

Comprehensive teams were fielded with members maintained throughout supervision. The
Bank carried out regular supervision missions, scheduling meetings in project provinces and
communes, particularly in a province or commune where any problem on implementation or
progress had been identified. The Bank Team was active in discussing and promoting ways
to address project delays. The continued direct face-to-face contact and discussions build the
confidence of the implementing agencies, and allowed to inform provinces experiencing
difficulties in implementation on practices and approaches in the more successful provinces.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Quality at entry and quality of supervision were satisfactory, and therefore Bank overall
performance is also satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

 The Government's performance in lending and implementation is assessed as satisfactory.
 At the time of preparation, there was close cooperation between the Government and the
 Bank. The Government decision to decentralize the Project to the local implementation
 agencies facilitated the process of preparation and implementation.

 All the key conditions of the loan were fulfilled. Supervision found performance indicators
 in line or exceeding the targets, and the project was rated consistently satisfactory. The only
 problem found that rated the project unsatisfactory on financial performance was caused by
 the indicator setting a specific tariff value. As implementing such tariff would have been
 greater than reasonable given actual costs at the time, IDA agreed to waive compliance
 subject to Government implementing the tariff increase required for financial performance.
 After this agreement, financial performance consistently was satisfactory.




                                               16

A Government Steering Committee in each province supervised and guided project
implementation. The local governments, from the province to the district and communes
levels, were actively involved by taking the responsibility of compensation and site clearance.
Project provinces used their budgets also to assist poor household payment for the connection
from low voltage lines to their houses.

The process of approval and clearance of procurement was rather slow, particularly the
review and clearance by the financial controllers for payments, due to lack of clear
procedures.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Implementing Agencies' performance is assessed as highly satisfactory.

Strong commitment and action within the implementing agencies enabled the project to
manage a large numbers of sub projects and about 600 contracts, scattered in a wide rural and
mountainous areas with difficult topographical conditions and access. The good control of
competitive procurement, even in the period of strong price fluctuation, contributed to
significant cost reductions that allowed electrifying additional communes, a major success of
the Project.

Though there were delays in implementation of some NCB packages, this was mostly due to
contractors' low capacities, the equitization (or privatization) of local contractors, and a surge
in prices during implementation of some contracts.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Given Government rated as satisfactory and Implementing Agencies as highly satisfactory,
the overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

The main lessons learned from the project that may be applicable to future similar project
are:

i) A clear roadmap to achieve the final objective of the Borrower and of the Bank support
    should be developed and be the basis to design the specific interventions and facilitate
    their development. In this case, four major RE projects were planned from the start to
    assist the Government of Vietnam to implement its Rural Electrification Program,
    addressing first the most urgent issues at the time, but not the most difficult areas, and
    carefully preparing the institutional arrangement basis for the next and more difficult
    interventions.



                                               17

ii) Decentralize to the acceptable level.      The decision to decentralize RE to the final
    implementing agencies proved to be efficient and effective to successfully implement the
    project and exceed the number of communes and households electrified.
iii) Cost sharing. Rural electrification projects have a low financial rate of return and should
    be designed to give the room and stimulate the mobilization of funding from other
    sources. Development of RE is strengthened through the principle of cost sharing by the
    parties involved. However, cost sharing arrangements need to be carefully designed to
     ensure the ownership and dedication of the related parties, but not surpass their payment
     capacity.   In this Project, provincial authorities provided support to the poorest
     households.
iv) Consultation and obtaining strong local commitments are essential in projects involving a
    large numbers of parties. For this Project, written commitments were obtained from rural
    residents, communes, districts and provinces. The layout of the lines was certified by
    those affected.
v) Flexibility. The project had a large numbers of sub-components, to be implemented in
    difficult areas during a long period of time. Flexibility is essential, both in term of
    physical scope and approval, to allow for fast adjustment to unexpected conditions (and
    in this case cost savings) that may arise in implementation and increase the benefit of the
    project.
vi) Projects with local implementing agencies and/or covering several local areas need a TTL
    and team based in the field to actively and effectively coordinate and inter-act with the
    client and implementing agencies, and to closely monitor progress addressing fast
    problems and delays.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/ Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

EVN and the PCs agreed with the content of this ICR. Their inputs and comments are
provided in Annex 7. The main issues raised are on implementing Bank procedures less
cumbersome for RE projects given their special characteristics, such as reducing requirement
of documents for the RAP, EIA, EMDP and external monitoring for LV given the almost
negligible advert impacts, and develop a procurement procedure for periods when prices are
sharply fluctuating.

Component 4: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building

Target set:    The T/A component had two parts: (i) to improve the capacity of EVN staff for
the business management, using the credit allocation of $ 3 million; and (ii) to improve the
capacity of staff of EVN and related agencies for the implementation of the REP, using the
PHRD Grant of $810,000.

Output:        The T/A component was implemented by EVN and the outputs of this
component are as follow:

Part 1: EVN used the T/A financed through the IDA credit to conduct the following studies:

       1) Enhancing Stability of Vietnam Power System: to review and simulate the power
           system of Vietnam and propose the measure to improve its stability.

       2) Study on Bulk Power, Distribution Margin, Retail Tariff, and Development of and
           Independent Creditor Model: to review and develop principles for EVN transfer
           prices applicable for wholesale supply sales to PCs, the principles for calculation of
           distribution network margin and retail tariffs, including assessment of cross subsidies
           and re-balancing to improve the structure and efficiency of tariffs. The TA also
           developed an Independent Creditor Model for the financial assessment of EVN and
           of PCs. The Independent Creditor Model is now being used by EVN and PCs.

       3) Master Plan of Human Resources Development and Training: to review the human
           resource of EVN and PCs and workout a master plan for long term capacity building
           and training for the EVN/PCs staff. The actual training program was implemented in
           SEEIR project.

        4) Pilot on Equitization: This study was initiated the concept of the equitization of the
             power distribution utility in Vietnam.

Part 2: To assist in the implementation of the Rural Energy Project, a PHRD Grant for
US$810,000 was obtained. In general the T/A was successfully implemented by EVN.

The main objectives of the PHRD Grant were (a) Improving resettlement action plan
implementation and supervision; (b) Improving management of environmental impact mitigation
measures during Project implementation; and (c) Strengthening the capacity of local commune
agencies in the operation and management of power grids. The following activities were carried
out:

    a) Improving resettlement action plan implementation and supervision for the
        implementing agencies and local authorities

        · Training workshops were carried out for provincial government and PC officials in
             applicable World Bank environmental and resettlement policies and procedures, as
             well as for the supervision and monitoring of resettlement action plan
             implementation.     In total, 495 persons directly involved in resettlement and
             compensation were trained.
        · Consultant services for external monitoring of RAP implementation assisted the
             implementing agencies to monitor the process of project implementation
        · Assistance was provided to provincial project management officials in planning
             and scheduling for resettlement plans and implementation, including policy setting,
             baseline surveys and public consultation.

    b) Improving management of environmental impact mitigation measures during
        Project implementation

Training courses were organized for a total of 120 persons for: (i) the Project management
officials on planning, design and monitoring of environmental impact mitigation measures;
(ii) official from Environmental Departments on the environmental guidelines applicable to
the project; and (iii) for the technicians on relevant technical and safety control specifications
and environmental guidelines.

    c) Strengthening the capacity of local commune agencies in the operation and
        management of power grids:

        · The Manual of Rural Network Technical Specifications, Manual on Maintenance
             and Operation Procedures, and Manual on Business Procedures for Rural
             Networks were developed, and copies of 10,000 set of these manual were
             distributed to each project commune and power services; and
        · 34 training courses and for more than 900 local people on operation, maintenance,

The technical Assistance component also helped the GoV to improve the management model of
rural low voltage systems. Four management models were studied, namely Cooperative, Joint
Stock Company, Service Agent and Asset Leasing. From these, Service Agent proved to be
useful for the communes belonging to PCs. To date, the Service Agent model is being used not
only in the project communes but also in most of the rural communes where PCs supply power
directly to households. It was estimated that using the Service Agent Model, PCs reduce about
50% of operating costs. The other models are now applied in the communes outside of PC
management.

Economic and Financial analysis at Appraisal

1.    The economic and financial returns were assessed for each PC and for the project as a
whole.1 The main assumptions for the analysis were:

  · Economic benefits: Willingness-to-pay (WTP) for electricity was estimated at 13.2 US
      cents/kWh for low income households, 18 US cents/kWh for higher income
      households, and 37 US cents/kWh for commercial, industrial and irrigation use;
  · Financial Benefits: Incremental sale revenue to PCs;
  · Financial cost: Components invested by PCs, including fees and taxes, but excluding
      the compensation cost financed from local budgets and the cost of the connection from
      low voltage lines to houses financed by the individual households2;
  · Electricity consumption: For low income HH, consumption was assumed at
      25kWh/HH/month in the first year, increasing to 40 kWh/HH/month in the 10th year.
      For higher income households, consumption was assumed at 35kWh/HH/month in the
      first year, increasing to 56.4 kWh/HH/month by the 10th year;
  · Economic cost: Total investment during the period 2000-2002, excluding fees and
      taxes, but including all the cost of compensation and connection to houses;
  · Net present value of economic flows over the project economic life of 20 years was
      discounted at the hurdle rate (opportunity cost of capital) of 10%; financial benefits
      were discounted at 7%.3;
  · All costs and benefits were expressed at 1998 price levels, without adjustment for
      shadow wage or shadow exchange rates;
  · Connection rate: Average connection rate at project completion assumed 60% of all
      HHs in a commune would connect in the first year of electrification (based on signed
      agreements with potential HHs and local authorities);
  · O&M costs were estimated at 2% of the investment cost; and
  · Input energy bought for the project was valued at the long-run marginal cost (LRMC)
      at the connection with the transmission system (US cents 5.5/kWh).




1 PAD, Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary.
2 The calculation was not the project financial return (as that is normally defined in Appraisals), but the
  returns to the PCs (though independent of the financial structure). However, the economic returns were
  assessed for the project as a whole.
3 The appraisal economic analysis provided no justification for using a different discount rate for the financial
  returns. Presumably this was done to reflect the fact that the PC's actual cost of capital is much lower than
  the 10% used by the GoV as the discount rate. However, no calculations of this actual weighted cost of
  capital was presented, much less was calculated the financial return to the actual equity investment of
  EVN& the PCs. The interpretation of the financial NPVs as presented in the appraisal report is therefore
  somewhat unclear.

2.      The summary of results at appraisal is shown in Table 3.1. The overall project
economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 29.1%.

3.      The main project risks identified in the appraisal economic analysis were:

    · Capital costs higher than estimated;
    · kWh demand lower than expected; and
    · Willingness-to-pay lower than estimated.

4.      These risks were assessed in a sensitivity analysis that determined switching values
(i.e. the value at which the assumption in question would cause the ERR to drop to the 10%
hurdle rate). As shown in Table 3.2, the economic viability was found to be robust.

Observed Performance and Revised Assumptions

5.      Compared to the assumptions made at appraisal, project implementation resulted with
the following outcomes:

    · Construction costs were substantially below those estimated at appraisal (Table 3.3).
        This allowed electrifying additional communes and rural households with the
        available funds.

                          PC2            281                   297             106%

The main reason for the lower than expected construction costs are the 20% price and
physical contingency included in appraisal. Prices during the construction years were mainly
stable (due to lower than expected inflation), particularly in 2002-2004, and the physical
contingencies proved unnecessary given the precise technical specifications.

Particularly for non-domestic consumption, the WTP is seen to be lower than estimated at
appraisal. WTP for residential consumers was re-estimated in a 2005 report to EVN,4 and that
for productive use in a 2003 report to the World Bank.5 As there is no data available on
actual income level of the connected HH, the assumption used was low income, i.e. the lower
estimate of WTP.

    · Loss rates: The observed T&D losses are close to those assumed at appraisal. For
        example in PC2, the average loss rate estimated at appraisal was 6.6%; and in 2006 the
        observed aggregate loss rate in PC1 was 7.1%, in PC2 6.7% and 6.1 % in PC3.

    · Connection rates: At appraisal it was assumed that all households would connect on
        the electrification year, but implementation showed slower pace in household
        connections. As shown in Figure 3.1 for communes energized in PC2 in 2002, it took
        several years for most of the households to connect. In the first year (2002), only 57%
        of those estimated did connect. By the end of the fifth year, 94% of households (as
        estimated in the appraisal economic analysis) had connected.                   This implies that
        schemes electrified in, for example, 2004 may see additional household connections in
        2007 and 2008 that are not reflected in the 2006 connections. The average observed

    purchased for VND 4.5million.

  connection rates for the first five years following electrification were applied to the
  schemes in the later years. Thereafter, it was assumed that consumption per connected
  household would grow by 1.5% per annum, and additional connections at a rate of 1%
  per annum.

· Bulk supply tariff: The financial analysis used the actual bulk supply tariff to the PCs,
  as recorded in the ECA & Vernstrom report (386, 493, and 536 VND/kWh for PC1,
  PC2 and PC3 in 2003, respectively). The price differential reflect EVN scheme to
  balance revenues and compensate different regional costs of PCs (different mix of
  urban and rural areas and consumer categories) under the current uniform national
  retail tariffs that apply to all users in Vietnam.
· LRMC:       The economic analysis used the average long run marginal LRMC as
  estimated by the ECA & Vernstrom report, at 816 VND/kWh (5.5UScents/kWh).
  This is the same value as estimated at appraisal.
· Operation and maintenance costs: At appraisal, these costs were assumed at 2% of
  capital investment cost. Actual O&M costs are difficult to establish, because the PCs
  do not keep O&M cost records disaggregated by individual communes. The PCs state
  that the O&M costs are about 30 VND/kWh sold (therefore about 1.2% of capital cost).
  This assumption was used in the baseline estimate of returns at completion. In any
  event, the returns are insensitive to this assumption. For example, the ERR for PC2
  reduces from 38% to 37.2% when the O&M cost is doubled to 60 VND/kWh.
· Consumption per connection. The consumption per connection in PC2 is significantly
  higher than assumed at appraisal, but similar to appraisal assumptions for PC1 and
  PC3 (Table 3.5).

    The distribution of monthly per household consumption (as commune averages) is shown
    in Figure 3.2. There are few households in PC1 and PC3 with consumption greater than

    · The consumption data for PC2 suggests that there may be a significant productive use
       of electricity that appears as lighting tariff, as the commercial tariff is significantly
       higher than the residential tariff. Domestic use in rural areas for lighting, TV and
       radio is rarely greater than 30 kWh/HH/month. A consumption greater than 50
       kWh/HH/month is invariably associated with pumps and motors, which would
       correspond to productive use.

    · Productive use:              The assumptions made at appraisal for non-domestic use were
       unreasonably high, and their source is unclear. In the case of PC3, the achieved
       percentage of productive use in total consumption is only 5.3%, compared to 42%
       estimated at appraisal (Table 3.7). This is the single most important difference in
       assumptions between appraisal and completion, and is the main reason why the
       returns at completion are lower than at appraisal.

    · The economic returns for PC1 and PC3 were significantly overestimated at appraisal,
       because WTP for productive use was assumed at 37 US cents/kWh (double that of
       domestic consumption).

6.     Under the revised assumptions and based on actual observed at the end of 2006, the
estimates of ERR and FIRR at completion are shown in Table 3.8.

7.       The estimates of the economic returns may have been under-estimated for the
following reasons:

    · PCs do not record the income level of the households connected. As it was not
         possible to differentiate between high and low-income households, the lower WTP
         values expected for low-income was used for all households. Particularly in the
         booming areas of PC2, this assumption likely understates economic benefits.
         Particularly in PC2, a proportion of what is shown as "lighting" consumption is likely
         to be for productive use, for which a higher WTP would apply.
    · The economic returns do not include environmental benefits.6 The health benefits of
         using electricity rather than kerosene are well established, but have not been quantified
         for lack of credible quantitative estimates.

Conclusions

8.       The following factors would cause returns at completion to be higher than at appraisal:

    · Construction costs were significantly lower than estimated (with costs per electrified
         HH lower by around 65%); and
    · In the case of PC2, electricity consumption per connected household is significantly
         higher than estimated.

9.       These are offset by the factors that would lower the returns at completion

    · Downward revisions of the estimated WTP; and
    · In PC1 and PC3, significantly lower rates of productive use.

10.      Thus, for PC1 and PC3 the ERR are lower than at appraisal, while for PC2 the ERR is
higher than at appraisal (though still exceeding the 10% hurdle rate). The overall project ERR
is a satisfactory 21% %, somewhat lower than at appraisal (29.1%).

11.      The aggregate financial returns (-3.0%) are marginally higher than those estimated at
appraisal (-3.3%).




6   In any event, some or all of the local environmental benefits have already been internalized in the WTP
    estimates.

                         Annex 5. Results of the Beneficiary Survey

The project commissioned the Institute of Sociology (IoS) of the Vietnamese Academy of
Social Sciences to conduct a longitudinal survey of the project beneficiaries. A first survey
was conducted in 2002, a second in 2005, and the third and final survey is being undertaken in
2007.    30 HH in each of 42 communes were sampled in 2005, to include as controls
communes already electrified in 2002 (at the start of the survey) and communes that were not
likely to be electrified by the time of the second survey in 2005. In 2005 the study sampled
1260 households, including 1,186 that had been sampled in 2002.

Such a longitudinal survey is very rare in international experience, and upon full completion
will provide a unique appraisal of the benefits of rural electrification. The 2002 and 2005
survey reports have already been completed. A detailed economic analysis of the data is also
in preparation, and will be available in late 2007.

The main findings of the 2005 survey report can be summarized as follows:

Improvement in Quality of Life

Among factors that make life today better than five or fifteen years ago, "better electricity
supply" has been most appreciated by the households. Electricity is considered to be an
important factor to improve life of people in general and of the elders and disabled in
particular. In general, income of electrified households using network electricity is higher
than that of non-electrified households. Access to the electricity helps rural HH to open up
many new trades and create jobs.

Electricity access helps to improve public health. It enables people to lead a more hygienic
life and enriches their knowledge about health care. It also enhances the feeling of public
safety.   The quality of health care has improved:         health workers confirmed that with
electricity available, the number of consultations has increased because evening visits are
possible.

The impact of electrification on education is demonstrated in three ways: better learning
quality of pupils thanks to better conditions for lesson preparation; pupils becoming familiar
with teaching facilities and understanding lessons better; teachers preparing lectures better;
and people getting better access to information sources, thereby improving their knowledge
and understanding and promoting education tasks better.

94.5% of those surveyed in 2005 (as opposed to 41% in 2005, before electricity) believe their
future lives will be better, and when asked about the specific reasons for this improvement,
better electricity service was the most frequently cited.:

                   Better health                                       18.7
                   Better roads                                        11.9

                   Better access to education and training             5.5

                   Better water supply                                 4.9



39.0% of respondents asserted that present living standard of their families were higher than
when was no electricity, with some areas reporting a much higher proportion such as Hoa
Binh (51.6%) and Soc Trang (47.9%). The proportion of those who thought that it was lower
is very small, only 2.3%. Among those who held positive views about the benefits of
electrification, 15.2% replied "I continue to do work at home in the evening"; 11.9% said that
"Now I earn and save more money than before" and 13.5% said that "the household can now
earn more thanks to electrification".

Impacts on Production and Business

Electricity availability has really created some new production, business and services such as
agricultural and forestry products, agricultural production services, services for everyday life
and entertainment, and created jobs for people. As an example, 12.5% of representatives of
electrified households said that they have new jobs as the result of electricity available. The
proportion of households in project communes confirming this fact is higher than those in
other communes.

The households with high living standard bear the highest index of admitting income
increasing as benefits that electrification brings to their lives (58.2%). The percentage of
people living in areas with network electricity admitted higher living standard is 40.0%, while
in areas without network electricity is 31.1%. Similarly, the percentage of people living in
areas with projects is 42.2% compared to 30.7% in areas without projects.

Impact on Household Income

In general, households that have access to electricity have higher income than those that do
not; and households that have more reliable access by virtue of electricity from the national
grid, have higher average income than those with other sources of electricity, such as micro-
hydro, solar (see Table 5.2).

The average income of total surveyed households in 2005 has increased by 8.3 million VND
since 2002. Dac Lac province has the highest increase in the household income (VND
13,7million), and Hoa Binh province has the smallest increase (VND 5,0million). These
improvements in household income are of course not solely due to electrification, but the data
clearly suggest that electrification is a major reason.


Impact on Living Conditions


Health and health care have significantly improved since electrification. Medical clinics now
operate under better conditions for both diagnosis and treatment, especially for emergencies,
as operation of medical equipment becomes easier.

Respondents had very positive assessments about the benefits of electricity on health and
public safety: 32.9% strongly agreed that "feel very secure at home in the evening" (2002
figure was 24.6%), 29.3% were aware that "lighting with kerosene can cause health
problems" and 32.6% that "lighting with diesel fuel can cause health problems"                      The
proportion of electrified households that have flush toilets with septic tanks is 4 times higher
than that of non-electrified households.

Impacts on Education

For pupils: Their study qualities improve because they do better preparation and homework
at home (as there is electric lighting). As they can watch TV and have access to computers,
they get more knowledge out of school.

In 2005, 75.4% of households had children attending grade school. Households with the
highest proportion of children attending school are those with high living standard: while 82%
of households in the highest income group had children who attended school, only 69% of
poor households did so (proportions very similar to those found in 2002), on 69% of poor
households.

Most respondents agreed that their children devote more time to study since electrification
(79.5% compared with 75.5% in 2002). Data in 2005 show that average daily studying time
of children in electrified homes is about 50 minutes greater than before electrification, and a
majority of households strongly asserted that: "electrification of households is very important




                                                   34

for educating children" (55.1% in 2005 and 55.8% in 2002), and 33.4% strongly agreed that
"because there is good lighting, children will devote more time to study in the evening."

For teachers: Teachers can better prepare their lectures, and can perform experiments or use
more effective visual aids (when teaching electric current in physics, teaching songs from
records etc.). Lectures become easier to understand and more effective.

Impacts on Spiritual Culture and Entertainment

Time spent on leisure activities increased with the increase in living standards and the
decrease in time devoted to housework.          In general, time devoted to leisure activities
(including watching TV, reading books, going out etc.) doubled between 2002 and 2005.
Electrification has particularly helped ethnic minority groups improve their living standard
and enrich their cultural life.

In 2005, the average time spent on reading books in electrified households is 20 minutes/day,
twice as much in non-electrified households (9.2 minutes). The proportion of not electrified
households who do not read books is 57%, but only 37% in electrified households. Another
statistic shows that 25% of electrified households read at least 30 minutes per day, compared
to only 11.2% of not electrified households.

While the general socio-economic situation in rural, mountainous and remote areas is still
difficult and backward, TV provides a very important source of news, knowledge and
entertainment. Data collected from surveys indicate that there is a significant difference in
time spent on watching TV among households with grid electricity, without grid electricity
and without electricity, as shown in Table 5.3. Needless to say, there are different views
about the impact of viewing TV as much as 6 hours/day (20.9% of grid electrified homes, as
against 8.6% of not electrified homes).

                                      Table 5.3: TV Viewing

                                 No electricity  Microgrids, pico   Grid electricity
          Watch no TV                35.2%           21.9%             10.5%
          Watch 6 hours per day      8.6%                              20.9%


Cultural activities related closely with electricity have been appreciated by local residents:
40.9% strongly agreed that "watching TV would provide my family with great entertainment"
(31.4% in 2002); 48.4% "Watching TV is a great source of news and information." (29.0% in
2002); 52.1% "Reading is easier with electric lamps compared to kerosene lamps" (55.0% in
2002) and 32.1%: " in my house, it is easy to read in the evening" (21.4% in 2002). It is
remarkable that 10.1% said "We often receive guests in the evening after it is dark outside".
This indicator shows the development of social exchange in electrified communities.

1.      Overall Assessment

The project has achieved all the objectives and contributed to the success of the Vietnam
Rural Electrification Program for the period 2000-2010 and the poverty reduction program of
the country. The success of the project proved the appropriateness of the policy "Central and
Local governments, State and People doing together", which has been applied for many years
by the Government of Vietnam for rural electrification. This policy involves the obligation
for financial contribution and also the consensus of all the stakeholders from the central to the
local governments to the people who benefit from the project.

The implementation of the RE project has become an example for the other rural
electrification projects in Vietnam to follow. The project contributed to improvements in
Government policies and mechanisms for rural electrification. The project also contributed to
the standardization of the process and procedures for the preparation, implementation and
management of the rural electrification projects, established new technical standards for the
rural electric networks for application in Vietnam.

2.      Benefits of the Project

    · High effectiveness in implementation and use of the funds of the project, allowed the
        project communes to increase from 671 to 976.
    · The project had positive impacts in project communes, initiating changes in various
        aspects of their living conditions such as economy, cultural, public health and
        education. These impacts will bring greater benefits in the longer term since all the
        project communes are poor and disadvantaged, located on areas with difficult
        geographical conditions. In many project communes, the government continues to
        develop other basic infrastructures such as school, clinic, post/communication as well
        as the micro credits for the development of the economy.
    · The economic indicators, such as NPV and EIRR, calculated at the completion of the
        project cannot counted all socio-economic benefits since many of them will take place
        later and some could not be evaluated in terms of money. Access to electricity in the
        project communes is still too recent, since at the most access to electricity is only in
        the last four years, or for the last communes electrified only 6 months.

3.      Lessons Learned

In the Preparation Period

· It is very important to define the project objectives, scopes, and roles of each party
    involved through a wide consultation with all related government organizations, from the
    central to the local levels, the implementing agencies and the local communities.



                                                37

· It is necessary to forecast in advance the issues that might appear during project
    implementation by taking into account all the related regulations of the government and
    the Bank.
· Carefully review the organization and capacity of the implementing agencies and, based
    on this assessment, propose the appropriate measures and project management
    organization to be included in the project documents.
· The management model for the operation period should be clearly defined before the end
    of the construction period in order to guarantee the sustainability of the project. Many
    other projects in Vietnam failed due to the fact that the management model was not
    considered during the project preparation.
· For large and complex projects, technical assistance in the preparation period is very
    important and useful
· The Project Team has a very important role.             In this project, the Bank Team was
    composed of qualified specialists in every field, with knowledge of the socio-economic
    conditions in Vietnam, and experience in conducting dialog with the Vietnamese
    counterparts. The Task Team Leader had the broad vision, capacity to analyze and ability
    to advise and persuade the counterpart.

In the Project Implementation Period

· It is important to maintain contact and coordinate between the Bank Team and the
    implementing agencies, with different communication means (phone, fax, mail and E-
    mail).
· Maintain periodic supervision, evaluation and reporting from both sides, the Bank and
    Government, to forecast the issues/problems that may appear, particularly in procurement
    and disbursement, in order to propose the countermeasures in time. The supervision of
    the field works is also very important.
· Training and capacity building for the implementing agencies are also important factors.
    The Bank team supervised, provided advice but did not intervene in the details of the daily
    management activities of the implementing agencies.
· Close coordination with the government agencies is necessary to solve in time issues
    which are over the capacity of the implementing agencies.

4.      Some Comments to the Bank

· The process for amendment or extension of the DCA should be simpler and faster.
· For rural electrification projects, which usually have almost negligible advert impacts,
    reduce requirement of documents for the RAP, EIA, EMDP and external monitoring.
· Develop a mechanism to fasten the procurement process in periods when prices are
    sharply fluctuating.
· The rural energy project should be designed in the open bases, allowing the implementing
    agencies to flexibly adjust the project subprojects so that the entire credit amount could be
    fully used, provided that all the subprojects are in line with the project objective and meet
    the selection criteria.
