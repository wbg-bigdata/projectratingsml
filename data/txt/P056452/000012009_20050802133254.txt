Vietnam - Rurail Eniergy I - Pllcase 3
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dak Nong is a newly establislhed province wvhich was separated from Dak Lak Province.
37 hamlets in 11 communes of 5 districts of Dak Nong province still do not have electricity,
which is causing many problems for local people.
This sub-project of Rural Energy I (Phase 3), by EVN, using WB loans, is to supply
power for domestic activities of local people, and at the same time, to promote production,
non-crop trades, light industry and handicraft.
The project's proposed investment aims to (a) rehabilitate, improve and expand the rural
power network to satisfy energy demand for the socio-economic development in the next 15-
20 years, to the year 2020; (b) improve reliability and efficiency of the service, reduce power
losses within the networks, lower tlhe power tariff, improve effectiveness of the business and
power management capacity of local utilities in the; (c) convert the existing ad-hoc local
management systems to local distribution utilities in legal forms, which supposed to be
economically independent, technically reliable, management accountable and profitable,
affordable to absorb capital and repay investment.
The Dak Nong RE I phase 3 subproject (powver supply system for hamlets of Dak Nong
Province) includes two main components: (i) expansion and rehabiliation of the medium and
low voltage systems (ii) converting the existing communal management systems to local
distribution utilities, and training and capacity building for the province. The project includes
11 communes of 5 districts of Dak Nong province.
Implementation of the two subproject components wvill require some land acquisition.
However, rehabilitation/expansion of the medium and low voltage systems would not cause
large scale of land acquisition and resettlement. This RP is prepared to deal with
compensation for all losses related to and rehabilitation of the people affected in 05 districts
of Dak Nong province in the phase I (a), for tlhe appraisal.
1. Legal fiamework and waiver piovisions
The RP for Dak Nong sub-project is based on the Policy Framework for
Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation prepared for the RE I Phase 3 Project.
According to the policy framework, eligibility for compensation and rehabilitation entitlement
includes: (a) all persons with legal title on tlheir assets; (b) all persons originally without legal
title on their assets, but with certificates of legal righlts which are based on State regulations,
or on possession of documents such as receipt of land tax, residence register, or related
permits issued by local aothorities, and (c) persons without legal title on their assets or
without any kind of papers whliclh certify their right to the land that they are using.
Persons in (a) and (b) are entitled to compensation for loss of land and other assets,
and other forms of assistance. Persons in (c) are assisted with resettlement instead of
compensation for recovered land, and other forms of assistance, if necessary, in order to
achieve goals set in this RP for those who are included in the RP inventory prior to the RP
cut-off date. Persons who acquire land in the area afler the cut-off date are not to be entitled
to compensation or any forms of assistance for resettlement. Similar regulations apply to
persons whose income is affected by the project.
2. Project impacts
The project will impact on:

Vielnarn - Rural Eniergy I - Pliase 3
-  Permanent land acquisition for tower foundations, substations and some access roads
for the project construction.
-  Permanent impacts on trees, crops and other assets in the proposed substations, tower
foundation areas and in ROWs.
-  Assets on the service roads.
-  All trees and crops or other assets surrounding the towver foundation and substation
areas.
-  Temporarily acquired land required during construction of the project
The survey results are shown as follows:
-  There will be a total of 1,852 affected households (8,577 persons), of wvhich:
+      1,389 households affected permanently due to permanent loss of parcels of
land and trees/crops;
+      1,852 households affected temporarily due to temporary loss of parcels of land
with trees/crops attached;
+     There are no impacts on houses.
+     There no DPs losing more than 10% of their total agricultural land holdings
+     There are no impacts on natural preserving zones, vestiges, and pagodas or
sensitive areas.
Through consultation, DPs opted for cash compensation for their impacted assets at
replacement costs or market rates.
3. Entitlemeint policy
The cut-off date is 30 December, 2004. Compensation costs will be based on
replacement/market costs - compensation at replacement cost for land, houses, other
structures and perennial trees; compensation at market price for annual crops.
All DPs, Nvho xvill be resettled. wvill be entitled to (i) transport alloNvance; (ii)
relocating subsidy; and (iii) training or other restoration measures. Those DPs who lose more
than 10% of land holding, will be entitled to (iv) rehabilitation assistance and/or training. In
Dak Nong sub-project, there no any DPs losing more than 10% of land, as well no DPs who
have to be resettled or have to move their business to a nexv site.
So far, in the Feasibility Study, results of surveys and inventory of losses do not show
any severe impacts on DPs, communities nor on public properties, thus there is no need for
economic restoration measures. However, in project's implementation stage, if any severe
adverse impacts on DPs and communilties is envisaged due to design changes/adjustments,
then respective responsibilities should be taken by the concerned parties to ensure that the
DPs able to restore their previous productive capacity and income level.
4. Public participation and( consultation
The consultation Nvith DPs in getting their feedback will limit contradiction and avoid
delays in project implementation. The RP is developed in close consultation wvith local
authorities and DPs in order to maximize their participation in resettlement planning and
implementing and the socio-economic benefits of DPs to the project. Local authorities and
DPs wvere consulted on line alignments, resettlement policy, RP implementation, grievance
mechanism, and monitoring and evaluation on the restorationl of DPs' livelihoods after the
project implementation.

5. Complaint and grievances
During the project implementation, DP's complaints and grievances wvill be dealt with
according to the regulations of Vietnamese lawvs. DPs raising complaints will be treated fairly
and guided by related agencies on the order, procedures and complaints of RP, in addition no
fee will be paid for their complaints.
The implementation of RP shall be constantly supervised and monitored by PMB,
PPMU and local People's Committees. Moreover, an independent consulting agency wvill be
entrusted with independent monitoring task. The independent consulting agency selected by
PCU or PMB and PPMU wvill make a contract just after RP approval and wvill begin
monitoring activities from the beginning of thle implemenitation phase.
The result of selection of independenit monitoring agenicy will be submitted to thle WB
for its concurrence.
6. Institutional arr angements
The Central Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of EVN is responsible for overall
coordination, operations on investment guidelines and liaison between the Govemment, PCs,
PPCs and WB. Power Companies (PCs) assigned by ENV and assisted by their respective
PMB will be responsible for implementation of MV/LV components, including RP
implementation component.
7. Schedule
The proposed RP implementationi schedule is as follows:
-  RP review and approval: from May 2005;
-  Establishment of resettlement committees at local levels and hire an independent
monitoring agency: June 2006;
-  DMS: September - October 2005:
-  Compensation payment and land clearance for the project construction: December

Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1.   Policy Framework
The RE I Project has prepared an overall Resettlement Policy Framework. This policy
framework follows the World Bank policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) and
legislation on lands acquisition of GOV. The principal objective of the Policy FrameNvork for
Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation is to ensure tlhat all project displaced persons
(DP's) will be compensated for their losses at replacement cost and provided wvith rehabilitation
measures to assist tlhemii to improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living stanidards and
income earning capacity.
The Policy Framewvork lays dowvn the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of
DP's, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and
rehabilitation, peoples participation features and grievances procedures that wvill guide the
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the DP's. The present RP is based on this
policy frameNvork.
1.2.   Objectives and suggestion
The overall objective of RP is to define resettlement and compensation programs for the
project in such away as to limit as much as possible the number of project displaced persons
(DPs) and their affected propelties. This RP provides the provisions that all the households
and institutions affected by the project (DPs) shall be compensated and assisted in such a wa)y
as to warrant the improvement or at least the maintenance of their pre-project living standard
conditions.
The compensation and resettlement program in RP wvill mitigate the adverse impacts
and ensure DPs to be restored xvithl tlieir living stanidards.
The RP preparation has been carried out with consultation and participation of DPs.
This RP wvill be valid after GOV's and WB's approval.
In order to ensure that this RP's objectives are met, compensation prices will be
established at rates warranting compensation at market rates/ or replacement costs. The
Project Developer, Compensation Commilittees and Provincial People's Committees,
independent monitoring agency are responsible to check and adjust (if necessary) for
compensation unit costs at the time of RP implementation for ensuring that, the compensation
unit costs are at the replacement values.

Chapter 2: MEASURES TO MINIMIZE LAND ACQUISITION AND
LOSSES
2.1.  Impact mitigation measures in design stage:
2. 1. 1. Substalion location:
The substations are designed to be located on either un-constructed, unused or bare
land and of low economic value or on public land wvhichl under management of Commune's
authorities. For the investigation and design of substations, the efforts were made to
completely avoid passing markets, densely populated areas, villages, and pagodas, historic
and cultural assets.
The substations are designed to be located nearby the existing roads, and therefore,
access roads, if envisaged, are short.
At least two-three alternatives of substation location have been studied and the
optimum alternatives from the viewpoints of minimum  adverse environmental impacts were
selected.
2. 1.2. Route selection.
The investigation and design of route have tried to completely avoid passing the
market, densely populated areas, villages, pagoda, protection forests, natural preserved areas,
historic and cultural assets etc.... The T/L \vill not run near or parallel with communication
system, gasoline and weapon storages.
To avoid or mitigate impacts, the direction of the routes has been selected so thus they
only either run within the ROW along existing roads, or pass agricultural land or homestead
garden land. There are applied the tuming angles of the routes, in some cases the turning
direction angles are up to 30(- 60(. In the case necessary, the angles may be about 900. With
this solution, the routes will pass through the road in several times to avoid impacts to the
houses/ structures.
The selected T/L will be not exceeding I km far from the axis of existing national
roads. Therefore, limiting to build new roads for construction but using the axis of existing
national roads.
For each sub-project, at least 02 - 03 alternatives of route locations are studied and the
optimum alternative is selected.
.2.1.3. 7he technical solutions :
Application of average tower distance is 70- 85 m for MV and 45 m for LV system.
Tower sites will preferably be located on empty land.
Application of different dimensions for tower foundation to be suitable xvith the
selected position. Area of foundation size wvill vary from 1.2 - 4 m2 for towver foundation and
3.9-5.2 m 2 for foundation of substation .
To mitigate impacts, temporary service roads would be built mainly in the area of
ROW (along the route).
The predominantly applied technical option of the out-door, hanging on pole-mounted
substation type, besides of others, also contribute to reducing extent of project land
acquisitioni.

2.1.4 Consultation and Paruicipationi
In the period of project preparation, the consultation  with local authorities and
participation of local people for selecting sites of substations, alignment of routes were
carried out by PC3. The valuable feedback of local authorities and DPs were taken into
account for design.
2.2.  Impact mitigation measures in constr uction stage:
There 56 substations will be newly built and the total length of MV transmission lines
of 110.87 km and the total length of LV transmission lines of 85.68 km will be going along
the areas of 11 communes of 5 districts of Dak Nong province.
Suitable measures and optimumii arrangements for the project construction have been
considered, such as construction wvould be started after the harvest of crops and terminated
before the next sowings. In order to meet this target, some working shifts in days will be
scheduled for shortening the temporarily affected time.
The construction camps for wvorkers in the construction period wvill be located on the
unused or public lands nearby or within headquarters of communes. The camps will not to be
built in populated areas.
2.3.  Result of mitigation iieastuiies
During the subproject preparation, at least 02 - 03 alternatives have been studied for
routes and substation locations in order to select a miniimunm impacted option.
Total area of affected land is 746,779 m2. However, only 17,736 m2 will be acquired
permanently, equal to 0.42 % of the total area affected, and 729.043m2 will be affected
temporarily, equal to 99.58% of the total area affected. No household will lose more than 10%
of their productive land holding. No household wvill be affected in terms of houses, structures
or business.
*                 No impacts on natural preserving zones, vestiges, and pagodas.
With the extent of impacts, mostly marginal, all the DPs opt for cash compensation for'
their impacted land and assets at replacemenit costs. Development of resettlement sites is not
required.

Chapter 3: Project Impacts
3.1. The displaced Persons (DPs)
Project impacted individual, household or institution (hereinafter called "DPs") which
are affected by the project temporarily or permanently are owners of land and properties, land
and house renters in ROW of T/L, in proposed areas for towver foundation, substations and
temporary service roads.
By census and inventory, the results are as below:
The project wvill impact on 1,852 households (8,577 persons). Of these:
o  1389 households affected permanently due to permanent loss of parcels of Ian;
o 1852 households affected temporarily due to temporary loss of parcels of land;
o There are no households wvhose houses are afrected.
11 communes will permanently lose a part of their land for construction of substations
or tower foundations.
- There are no households having to rebuild their houses or relocate.
- There are no households losing more than 10% of their agricultural land holdings.
- There are no households having business or commercial services to be affected.
- There are no impacts on natural preserving zones, vestiges, and pagodas or sensitive
areas.

rice output was 47,958 tons. The production of bean, soybean, groundnut, cotton, sugar cane
provides considerable raw materials for the local processing industry. Coffee is the province's
crucial industrial crop for export wlich greatly contributes to the local GDP growth. In
addition, there are also other long-time industrial trees such as pepper, cocoa, rubber, which
have considerable export value.
The animal husbandry of Dak Nong tends to be developed with many households
investing in building utilities, applying newv technology, such as raising super-lean pigs, wvhich
has brought about high economic efficiency. In addition, attention is also given to veterinary.
Presently the local fresh-water aquaculture, though newly developed in a VAC (garden - pool
- stable) model, is very promising.
Forestiy: In recent years, the gross value of forestry tended to go down. The figure of
the year 2003 was VND 35,644 million, an average decrease of 17.35% per year. There has
been progress in the forest preservation. The deforested area is much less than the previous
years. The exploitation of timber and other forest products also tend to go down. The forest
watch has been strengthened to prevent violation of forest laws arid forest fire. However, the
deforestation and illegal timber exploitation still occurs in some areas.
4.5.  Service and commerce
There are 5009 service and commercial bases in the province, which is equivalent to
59 enterprises. In 2003 the total value of sales of goods in the whole province was VND 565
billion, an average increase of 10% compared with the period 2001-2003. At present, the
export turnover is USD 29.5 and the average import value is USD 1.5 million, yearly. In
addition, transport and post services are developing both in scale and in quality. Finance ancd
banking sectors are being improved.
4.6.  Industry and liandicraft
In 2003 there are 1343 units of industry and handicraft in the province. The gross
value of industry and handicraft in 2003 was 114.6 billion VND, an increase of 14%
compared with the year 2002. The output of some products have increased considerably, for
example, construction sand 29.3%, construction stone 45%, animal feed 25%, micro-
biological fertilizer 30%. The province has started the construction of the H'Linh hydro-
electric scheme, 16 MW, the Buon Kop Hydro-electric scheme, two cassava processing
factories, and others.
Early in the vear 2004, many investors from neighbouring provinces came to look for
opportunities to invest in industrial projects, particularly ones in small and medium size
hydro-electricity schemes, construction material production, and processing of agricultural
products. There are some on-going projects such as Tuong An animal feed factory, Hao
Quang cassava processing factory, the 722 Company factory which is to process cashew for
export, etc. Most enterprises and industrial production bases are expanding production to
partly satisfies local demand, increase industrial production value, as well as create more jobs
for local people.
Current situation of the inclustrial zones: There are currently a number of factories in
operation, and some others have reached agreement on land lease. The problem with the
industrial zones now is lack of capital to complete the infrastructure. The Nhan Co industrial
zone, 250 hectares in area, is being planned in detail and the construction of its infrastructure
is being worked out. The cassava processing factory in this zone is now in operation.

Chapter 8: ECONOMIC RESTORATION
Compensation alone to DPs for lost properties in many cases is far from enough to
help them rehabilitate their previous standards of living. Income restoration measures have
been designed to assist severely affected farmers, shopkeepers and other vulnerable DPs to
restore their pre-project earning capacity and productive levels, or improve living standards,
particularly for the poor and vulnerable. Assistances for economic restoration may include
followings:
8.1.  Agricultural Extensioni (AE)
Severely affected farmers, Nvho loses more tlhan 10% of their total productive land
holdings, will be entitled to agricultural extension assistance to increase productivity on their
remaining land or develop/improve their animal husbandry. Such assistance would include
cultivation and/or animal raising techniques for new high-yielding varieties, hybrids... This
measure could help restore future income losses so that the DP will be in a position to
produce the same level of income from the next season's harvest. The implementing agencies
- PMB, PPMU and RCs with assistance of communes authorities, Farmers' and/or Women's
Unions will consult with the DPs and coordinate with the Agricultural Extension Centers of
DARD to prepare proposal for the training program and facilitate the provision of agricultural
extension services to all severely affected farmers. An estimated VND from 1,500,000 -
3,000,000 will be provided per household for agricultural extension purposes.
The program includes following activities:
-Activity 1: Assessment ofneedls fbr agricultural extension
After the DMS will be completed, the PMB, PPMU and RCs will establish a list of
DPs eligible for agricultural extension assistance program. The Commune's authorities will
assist these units holding meetings to consult with severely affected farmers on topics and
times for agricultural extension trainings, and quantify the demand for the service. It is
preferable to be taken betNveen February and March, 2005 .
Activity 2. IPrepealration 7oJpropo.sa1/for AI
Based on results of training need assessment, the PMB and PPMU, in consultation
vith local AEC, Avill prepare proposal for the AE training program and submit it to PC3 and
PPC for approval and financing. The proposal slhould include:
1. Objectives of the program
2. Beneficiaries of the program
3. Consultation of DPs and establishl lists of participants for each topics
4. Consultation ivith local authority and AECs on the program
5. Proposal for program
6. Implementation arrangement
7. Schedule
8. Cost and budget
9. Monitoring and evaluation
This activity should be done between February - March, 2005.
Activity 3. Implementation ofAE program

Vielltam - Rural Inergy I - Pllltase 3
After the proposal for the AE program being approved, the PMB and PPMU will
transfer the training budget to assigned AECs for training of registered farmers. The AE
activity can be taken in one or several timiies durinig tlhe RP imlplementation, based on needs of
the DPs. The PMB, PPMU, commune's authorities and local mass organizations will monitor
the program implementation.
8.2.  Training Assistance:
For each DP, Nvho has their income source severely affected, including those who
have to change their occupation as a result of resettlement, vill be given training/retraining
assistance in form of job training or cash combined wvitlh respective technical assistance (e.g.,
agricultural extension). The Project Nvill also provide a training subsistenice allowance for
each entitled trainee during 3 months of trainiing course. Tlhe total value of the rehabilitation
assistance will D3,((00(0, per household.
To implement this program, similar actions and procedures as for AE vill be applied
8.3.  Access to Credit
Lack of access to credit often leads to lack of equipment and inputs and lack of
capacity to optinmize the use of agricultural land or to difficulties in creating new enterprises.
In order for the poor and other vulnerable groups including severely affected farmers to gain
fully from these new opportunities, further credit avenues will be explored prior to the
finalizing the RPs for severely affected and vulnerable DPs.
Actioni l: Altaining the Pl'C 's alplroval ancd the 1BSI s agreement on1 prolvision of itindfbi the
credit proposed program.
At approval of the RP and EMDP, the PC3 with its PMB and PPMU wvill discuss with
the PPC and the Bank for Social Policies on the proposed credit program to reach their
support and BSP's commitments to provide the credit service. They also discuss with the
BSP to define organizational model for implemiientationi and the mechanism for channeling
flow of fund.
Action 2. IDissemination of info nation oii crecit proposecid pogram
The PMB, PPMU wvith teclhnical assistance of the BSP staff will prepare information
documents on the credit proposed program for public dissemination, describing objectives of
the program, eligibility, procedures, regulations, interest rates, terms of credits and repayment
conditions.
The commune authorities with local mass organizations, including Women's,
Farmers' Union, will organize meetilngs to inform about the program to DPs and distribution
of available leaflets...
Action 3: IdentiJication of participants oftlhe crecit program
After completion of DMS, the RCs xvill identify and prepare the list of the eligible
EM DPs for the program
The communes will investigate demanid of the eligible DPs for credits and, with
assistance of the BSP staff, wvill assess ability to repay of DPs
Action 4. Preparation of creditlproposal

Action 3:  Realization by awarded contractors of employment provision to prioritized
severely affected persons during civil works.
PMB, PPMU, IMA and communes organization will monitor jobs creation for the concerned
DPs.
8.5.  Preservation of Communities anid Agricultural Activities
During the participatory detailed design every effort will be made to avoid severance
of communities and technical infrastructure, such as irrigation and drainage system, roads.
Technical consultant has primary responsibility for adopting, during design process, technical
alternative mitigating adverse impacts on communities and local productive infrastructure.
During construction period, the contractors are required to make all efforts to reduce impacts
on environment, communities and public properties.
So far results of surveys and inventory of losses do not show any severe impacts on
DPs, communities and public properties, thus there no need for economic restoration
measures to be done. However, in project's implementation stage, if any severe adverse
impacts on DPs and communities will be envisaged, the respective responsibilities should be
observed by concerned parties to ensure that the DPs able to restore their previous productive
capacity and income level.

Chapter 9: COSTAND BUDGETS
9.1.   Budgets
Budget for the implementation of the RP will be taken from the partnership capital.
EVN will provide budget for the MV and LV components, and the PPC will be responsible
for the provision of the resettlement compensation budget.
9.2.   Compensation cost estimate
Compensation cost estimate for temporary and permanently impacted house,
structure, agricultural land, forestry land, cultivated land, trees and crops have been
based on:
- Circular No. 145/1998/TT-BTC   of the Ministry of Finance guideline for
implementation of the Decree 22/CP
- Decision No.87/CP dated on 17 August, 1994, setting frame for compensation prices
of land in case the Govemment acquire land for national security and public interests.
- Decision No 302/TTg was issued on 13/5/1996 by Prime Minister for adjustment of
the K factor of the Decree 87/CP, giving wider ranges for regulated land prices
- Decision No 2395/QD-UB, dated on November 10th, 1997 on compensation rates for
houses and structures, issued by Dak Nong PPC;
- Decision No 39/2004 QD-UB, dated on May, 2004, issued by Dak Nong PPC on
compensation rates for crops and trees, property, structures, applied in Dak Nong
province.
- Decision No. 44/2004/QD-UB issued by Dak Nong PPC on prices of newly-built
houses and regulations on application of prices of newly-built houses in Dak Nong
Province.
- Preliminary assessment of replacement costs and market price for land, structures,
trees conducted by PC3 in the period of carrying out inventory of losses survey
(December, 2004)
Results of preliminary replacement cost assessment made by consultants shows that
the compensation rates for all types of losses, issued by Dak Nong PPC have been
outdated and lower than current market prices/replacement cost. Thus, at time of the RP
implementation, it requires appropriate updating of compensation rates for lost land and
assets impacted by Dak Nong subproject, based on a replacement cost survey, to ensure
that DPs are compensated and assisted fairly.
9.3.  Cost Estimlate
i) Cost for RP consists of:
i) Preparation work:
+ All work at the office such as design study, preparation of survey form.
+ Survey wvork: census and inventory socio-economic survey.
Survey work is carried out in two stages : Preliminary stage (for RP preparation) and
Detailed Measurement Survey (at the earlv time of project and RP implementation)
ii) Compensation and rehabilitation cost
Based on the impacted categories and extent of impacts which described in the above
chapters, compensation and rehabilitation costs are included:

- Management cost (not yet in breakdowvn form).
iv). Monitoring cost
When carrying out the project, PMB of PC3 will signed a cortract vith independent
monitoring institution(s). Because cost of monitoring work has not yet the detailed norms of
Government, it is estimated at about 3.5% of total cost of compensation and RP preparation.
The interested independent monitoring institutions wvill prepare the technical and financial
proposals for bidding and actual cost will be decided through procurement for independent
monitoring.
v) Contingency cost
It is learned from the implemented projects that the rate for contingency is estimated
about 20% of total cost of compensation and RP preparation.

- To ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation.
There are twvo phases of the public information campaign and DP consultation:
Phase I: Durin1g RP plann1ing and preparalion activities (already car r-ied out)
This plhase consisted of line route selection, census and inventory of affected people,
affected assets, and identification of strategies for compensating, rehabilitating and
relocating. During the census and inventory of DPs, their lost land, assets, survey teams had
conducted consultation with local authorities of all project affected communes and districts
and took focus group discussions wvith DPs in the number of impacted communes to attain
their comments on the route alignments, potential of adverse impact, their comment on unit
cost of land, local agricultural productivity, land transfer rate etc. Commune local authorities
had also been consulted on availability of public land that can be used for compensation
option "land for land"
Draft RP will be sent to PPC, relevant agencies and other authorities for review and
comments. PC3 and PMU will request PPC and other local authorities to carefully review for
the requirements on waivers, eligibility to compensation, proposed entitlement policy, RP
cost, taskforces, mechanism for complaint and applied unit costs in draft RP. PPC will
review and their comments will be sent to PC3.
The draft RP will also be disclosed at the office of PPC, at VDIC of the World Bank
office in Viet Nam.
All feedback from local authorities and relevant agencies are integrated in RP.

Phase 11 During RP itnplemenlation
During this phase, meetings will be organized in each commune. The implementation
of resettlement and rehabilitation activities includes: implementing resettlement policies;
entitlement calculation and payment of compensation to DPs; finalize DPs' options on
compensation mode, trainings etc.
10.2.  Information campaign, DPs, EM & agency consultationi duiing resettlemenlt
planning and RP prepar ation
During phase 1, (RAP preparation), the following activities were carried out
sequentially:
Plhase I-Activity 1: Injormation & discussion with local authorities on the line routes.
After studying maps and visiting the site, PC3 had envisaged a preliminary route on
1/50,000 scale map. This map was sent to all locations passed by the line and relevant local
authorities. The local authorities have agreed on the project line routes. These activities took
place in December/2004.
I'h2ase I - Activity 2: Inventory of losses and statistics
Based on the agreed line routes, survey teams had realized the routes at sites and
coordinated with the commune officials to make a list of DPs affected on land and assets. The
socio-economic survey forms were delivered to 20 % of affected households. These activities
took place in December of 2003.
P'hiase I - Activity 3 : Meetings with DP's representatives
When the survey finished, PC3 in coordination with the commune officials held
meetings with DPs having land and other assets impacted and with village representatives.
The consultation wvas made in December, 2004, in all the project communes. In these
meetings, PC3 informed the participants about the project, purposes; presented the project
activities, components and possible impacts on land and crops and other properties; explained
the objective of RP, policies for compensation and informed people not to build new
structures or plant trees in the affected areas. DPs were also asked for their priority for
compensation modes. The result was that the most of them would prefer cash for land and for
other assets as the scale of loss was marginal. All of the DPs, consulted expressed full support
to project investmnenit and willingness to offer their land for project development. They
wished to be early informed about the project implementation schedule.
Phase I - Activity 4: Sending drlaft RI' and entitlement policy to PPC and districts for
r eview and disclosure
Draft RP will be sent by PC3 to the PPC for reviewv and comments. PC3 and PMU will
request PPC and other local authorities to carefully reviewv for the requirements on waivers,
eligibilit) to compensation, proposed entitlement policy, RP cost, taskforces, mechanism for
complaint and applied unit costs in draft RP. PPC will review and their comments wvill be
sent to PC3 and EVN.
The draft RP will also be disclosed at the office of PPC, at VDIC of the World Bank
office in Viet Nam.
