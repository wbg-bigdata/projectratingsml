4. SCREENING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1. CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS
The Environmental Impact Assessment focuses on the major environmental issues of
*              the Project's Most Favoured Alternative. The potential impacts of the Project's pre-
construction, construction, and operation phases were assessed as being in one of five
categories:
i. NO IMPACT. The potential impact of the Project activity is assessed as NO
IMPACT if the project activity is physically removed in space or time from the
environmental component.
ii. MAJOR IMPACT. An impact is said to be MAJOR if the project activity has
potential to affect an environmental component. Major impacts coulcl be "Major
Negative" or "Major Positive." The following criteria were used to determine
I                    whether a given impact is MAJOR:
a) Spatial scale of the impact (site, local, regional, or national/ international);
|                      b) Time horizon of the impact (short, medium, or long term);
c) Magnitude of the change in the environmental component brought about by
the Project activities (small, moderate, large);
d) Importance to local human populations;
e) Compliance with national, provincial, or district environmental protection
laws, standards, and regulations
f) Compliance with Vietnam's international commitments. These include the
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especiallyi as
Waterfowl Habitat (RAMSAR), the Convention Concerning the Protection
of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention),
and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES); and
g) Compliance with World Bank guidelines, policies, and regulations.
iii. MINOR IMPACT. If an impact occurs but does not meet the criteria for a Major
Impact it is assigned the category MINOR. Minor impacts could be "Minor
negative" or "Minor Positive."
MITIGABLE IMPACT. The potential impact of a project activity on an environmental
I              component is said to be MITIGABLE if there is potential for a major negative impact and
the proposed mitigation measure will prevent the impact or reduce the impact to
*              acceptable levels.

4.2. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT
The Project is aimed to supply electricity to 11 communes (45 hamlets) in Dak
Nong province. By implementation of the Project new opportunities for job will be
created, the life quality of local people will be improved, the distance between rich and
poor will be shortened; good condition for economic development will be created.
Beside the significant beneficial impacts, the project may cause different adverse
impacts on the environment and local socio-economy. By using Environmental Screening
Data Checklist and Environmental baseline Checklist as guided in Framework for
Applying Environment Safeguards to Rural Energy II Project, The potential impacts of
the Project are described in Table 4.1.

the ROW                                              to be cut. The trees are still remained.
- Construction of the line inevitably implies some
ground work, clearing of vegetation and
interference along the line. However, since most of
the line will be positioned very close to a major
road, the interference is not assumed to be
substantial or of long term nature.
- The lines are not going through any forested areas
or areas with highly ecological value
- Most of the clearing required for the power line
will be of eucalyptus, coffee, pepper, cashew,
which is an economic rather than an environmental
issue.
- Acquired lands are mainly unused land along the
existing roads with very low ecological values.
- Project's communes are located in well developed
areas, especially in term of transportation roads.
There is no new access road is required for
construction of the Project.

5. PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
During project preparation stage (2004), the following activities were carried out:
Activity 1: Information & Discussion with Local Authorities on the Line Route
Activity 2: Impact Survey and Statistics
Activity 3: Meetings with PAHs
When the survey was completed, District Compensation Committee (in
coordination with the commune officials) held meetings with PAHs having land in
I               the line ROW and with village representatives. During the meetings, the Consultant
presented numerous materials, including: Project Summary, draft RAP and draft EIA,
maps of the project site, figures, tables, photos, pictures, and other support materials.
i               Meeting officials informed participants of the Project purpose; presented the Project
impacts on land and crops in detail; introduced the principles and policies of
compensation and advised people not to build new structures in the line ROW. PAHs
I               were consulted on the entitlement policy, property affected, and the compensation
amount to each household. Questions posed by the PAHs were addressed and
recommendations/concerns of PAHs and PC3 were recorded.
Activity 4: Receiving Further Feedback from PAHs
Activity 5: Public disclosure and Clearance on EIA
The Project will receive an investment license only after appropriate modification of
location, design, capacity and/or technology of the project to meet the requirement of
environmental protection and resettlement. To address disclosure requirements of
I               OP 4.01, PC3 will:
* Provide Vietnamese-language copies of the EIA report, RAP, and Project
Summary to each commune-level and district level People's Committee in the
Project area.
* Advertise in major local newspapers several times over a two-month period.
I                    The advertisement will state the EIA, RAP, and Project Summary is available
for public review for a two month period during normal working hours at the
following locations: 1) the provincial-level People's Committees; and 2) The
commune level Peoples' Committees.
* English and Vietnamese-language copies of the EIA report will also be sent to
the Vietnam Information Development Centre at 63 Ly Thai To in Hanoi, for
access by NGOs and public.
English language copies of the EIA report will be sent to World Bank for publication
on World Bank Info Shop.

- Select a right place for concrete mixing.
- Residue from earthwork should be removed from the site to proper places (soil
residue can use for garden filling; concrete residues are removed by contractor to the
peritted places).

dry seasons, after the harvest time and during the shortest duration of time.
- Land surface recovery after the pole erection.
- Clearing of site for power line should be done manually by cutting, and not with the
use of fire or chemicals. This is order to preserve the herbs and grasses and their root
system which reduce the erosion risk.
- Optionally stumps from trees and shrubs could be left in the clearance, although this
increases the work required in annual clearing.
9     Air pollution                     Minor Negative   - Minimize the construction time in each site. Spray water regularly on dirt piles and
any other areas that could create dust
