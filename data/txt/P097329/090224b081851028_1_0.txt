                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR updates the project status with a Level 2 Restructuring- Extension of Project Closing Date.

                         The closing date for Sri Lanka, Public Sector Capacity Building Project, Credit No. 4412-LK, P097329 has been extended from December 31, 2012 until December 31, 2013.

                         The original project development objective (PDO) was to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of two key public service agencies in Sri Lanka: the Department of
                         Census and Statistics (DCS) and the Auditor General’s Department (AGD). The revised PDO enhances the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of the recipient’s Auditor General
                         Department (AGD). The proposed extension was necessary to ensure the sustainability of the Human Resource Development initiatives carried out under the project by establishing

                         This is the second extension to the project. The Government of Sri Lanka had earlier requested a one-year extension to December 31, 2012 for: (i) completing the training program of
                         the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) postponed due to Island wide Census of Population and Housing; and (ii) utilizing the resources allocated under the human resource

                         development and communication and external relationship sub-component under the Auditor General’s Department (AGD). Given the strong performance of the AGD component in
                         overall implementation and in achieving the PDOs, the Bank extended the AGD component till December 2012 and cancelled the DCS component. In August 2012, the PDO and the
                         results framework were revised in order to reflect appropriately the performance of AGD component in the achievement of the PDOs. Implementation progress and PDO level results
                         in relation to the revised PDO have been Satisfactory since the date of the restructuring.

                         The AGD has prepared its Corporate Plan 2012-2016 recently. The SWOT analysis of the corporate plan of AGD clearly indicates that one of the major weaknesses of the
                         Department is lack of training in multidisciplinary streams. During the project, over 50 percent staff received training in English language, leadership, investigative audit, performance
                         audit and financial audit. However, the success of foreign training and study tours was mixed because many times the officials could not attend/participate in training abroad due to
                         heavy work load. The need for residential Training Center in the country is a core issue that needs to be addressed for strengthening the AGD to meet the needs of a sophisticated
                         and dynamic public financial management system. A residential Training Center of AGD at Ratnapura will enable the Government to increase the coverage and ease of imparting
                         real time advanced training to its staff with the help of both national and international experts.

                         Keeping in view the excellent track record of engagement and commitment of the Auditor General and his team over the years on the project, the justification for supporting a regional
                         training center at Ratnapura is strong. The Auditor General has been awarded land by the Government and all necessary approvals have been obtained and shared with the Bank
                         team. The extension will enable AGD to sustain training to audit staff in regional offices after the conclusion of the project. The detailed plans show that all activities can be
                         completed by December 31, 2013.
