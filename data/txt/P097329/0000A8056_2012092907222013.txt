                         The proposedchanges were necessary in order to reflect the cancellation of the undisbursed amounts of the DCS component in the PDO and in theResults and Monitoring
                         Framework.

                         Change in Project’s Development Objective-

                         Initial PDO: to enhance the effectiveness,efficiency and productivity of the Recipient’s DCS and AGD.

                         Proposed PDO: to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency andproductivity of the Recipient’s AGD.

                         As a result of the Board approval, the PDO has changed and the rating has been upgraded from"MU" to "S"


                         Time bound action plans have been discussed and agreed for between the Auditor General and Bank team for theremaining period of the project, which include:(i) the steps involved
                         in finalizing the corporate plan (2013-2016) of the AGD; (ii)approving and translating to Sinhala and Tamil, the Financial (FA), Performance (PA) and Investigative (IA) audit
                         manuals;(iii)establishing dedicated PA, IA, IT and training units and establishing 12 month work plans for the dedicated units;(iv) re-engagingthe audit methodology consultants to
                         ensure FA, IA and PA roll out is taking place as planned as one the of main objectives ofproject extension was to provide the AGD with this opportunity of obtaining expert advice and
                         guidance beyond one audit cycle;(v)further exposure and training opportunities to AGD staff; and (vi) developing a communication strategy and action plan for the AGD;(vii) full
                         utilization of the project funds by project closing date.

                         Implementation progress as of December 31, 2011 was rated asModerately Unsatisfactory (MU) overall, entirely because of delays in the construction of the office building for the
                         Department ofCensus and Statistics. The overall implementation progress rating was upgraded to Satisfactory in January 2012 following arestructuring to cancel the DCS component
                         of the project and to extend the closing date of the AGD component of the project fromDecember 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Implementation progress under the AGD
                         component of the project has from the beginning beenSatisfactory or Highly Satisfactory, and the project objectives continue to be achievable.
