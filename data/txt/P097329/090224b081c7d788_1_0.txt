                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR updates the project status with regard to the Auditor General component and on the basis of recent implementation support mission completed in early May.

                         The closing date for Sri Lanka, Public Sector Capacity Building Project, Credit No. 4412-LK, P097329 was extended from December 31, 2012 until December 31, 2013.

                         The original project development objective (PDO) was to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of two key public service agencies in Sri Lanka: the Department of
                         Census and Statistics (DCS) and the Auditor General’s Department (AGD). The revised PDO enhances the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of the recipient’s Auditor General
                         Department (AGD). The one year extension was necessary to ensure the sustainability of the Human Resource Development initiatives carried out under the project by establishing

                         a Departmental Training Center for AGD in Ratnapura. There was adequate funding available in the Designated Account for carrying out the related activities. This was the second
                         extension to the project.

                         The project is on track to fully disburse by the extended closing date of December 31, 2013.

                         Audit Methodology. By the date of the May 2013 implementation support mission, additional training in financial, performance and investigative audit procedures had been provided
                         entirely by the AGD’s new audit training department, without consultant support. The mission was informed that financial audit training, for example, had been provided to 19 classes
                         totaling 590 officers, and that the new procedures had been applied in the financial audits of all 229 public enterprises. In 2014, the financial audit procedures will similarly be rolled
                         out to the audits of externally-aided projects, which will significantly shift the focus of those audits from compliance based tests of transactions to risk based audits of financial
                         statements. A total of 28 performance audits and 20 investigative audits had been completed or were being conducted by the new performance audit and investigative audit units that
                         were established during the project. Investigative audits are not necessarily intended to be reported to Parliament, but performance audits are. The mission noted that none of the 28
                         performance audits had yet been reported to Parliament. AGD agreed to commence monthly reporting to Parliament of completed performance audits beginning May 31, 2014.

                         Human Resources. To the date of the August 2012 implementation support mission, a permanent Training Division had been established in AGD, over 70 officers were pursuing post
                         graduate degrees in local universities, and extensive amounts of foreign and local training had already been provided, including training in International Financial Reporting
                         Standards. By the date of the May 2013 implementation support mission, 10 officers attended a customized training on public works audit delivered by SAI China, an advanced
                         English program delivered by British Council has been taken by over 300 officers, and over 200 officers had taken one-week courses at SLIDA on leadership skills, procurement and
                         project management, quality management and team building. In addition, a staff performance evaluation scheme linked to incentives has been developed and sent to the Salaries
                         and Cadre Commission for their approval.

                         Communication and external relations. Agreed actions from the August 2012 mission included staging an international experience sharing event in Colombo in December 2012,
                         including the heads of SAIs of SAARC, ASEAN and other Asian countries (approximately 24 countries in total). The May 2013 mission noted that the December 2012 international
                         experience sharing event had not taken place. However, the mission was advised as to even more ambitious plans to invite the heads of all ASOSAI countries (over 40 countries) to
                         a seminar in Colombo during July 24-28, 2013.

                         Physical infrastructure. By the date of the last mission, the new AGD building had been constructed. The May 2013 mission noted that the landscaping for the new building had not
                         been completed. In addition, the timeline for construction of the regional training center in Ratnapura is tight. Since there will be no further extension of the project, the mission
                         requested AGD to closely monitor the progress of the Ratnapura building and prepare a work plan for every stage of the project backed by goods and procurement plans. AGD
                         agreed to closely monitor all aspects of the construction including cost estimates, and to request such reallocation between cost categories as may be necessary and appropriate.

                         In overall terms, the AGD component continues to perform strongly and is well implemented.
