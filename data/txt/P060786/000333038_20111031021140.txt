1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union Armenia’s economic transformation has been
profound. The economy is now a market-oriented one, highly open to trade and capital,
technological innovation, and is based on services, light industry, and, to a declining
extent, agriculture. However, when Armenia regained its independence in 1991 it
immediately confronted a distorted and imploding economy, an overly centralized and
ponderous public administration, and a level of physical and institutional infrastructure
inadequate to compete internationally. In addition, an energy crisis, a war with
neighboring Azerbaijan, and economic blockade contributed to hyper inflation and a 50%
reduction in economic output, leaving nearly 60% of the population living below the
poverty line. After the 1994 ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan the government
retargeted its efforts toward addressing urgent economic and social problems, initiating
and implementing a remarkable macroeconomic stabilization and economic liberalization
program that resulted in stable economic growth continuing for the next decade. Indeed,
by the time of appraisal the economy was growing in the double digits (nearly 10% in
2001, 12.9% in 2002, and 13.9% in 2003). Private investment (supported in part by
inflows from Armenian communities around the world) had increased, manufacturing
exports were surging from a low base, and the private sector accounted for more than
70% of GDP.

This progress had been aided by a series of reforms within the government itself. Most
notably, the structure of the central administration was reorganized and rationalized
through the consolidation of ministries from 21 to 18 with attendant reallocation of
responsibilities, separation of policy formulation and monitoring from execution and
service delivery, and passage of organic Civil Service and related civil service
remuneration legislation. The Government recognized that these actions, however
important, needed to be supported by “second generation? reforms. Complex and time
consuming institutional capacity building efforts were required to improve the
accountability, effectiveness, and transparency of public sector management. Without
them the antiquated processes, still weak capabilities, and misuse of resources by the
public sector would hinder sustained economic growth.

While ministries had been reorganized, they too often lacked the capacity to formulate
effective policies or implement them properly. Cross-ministerial coordination systems
were not functioning well. Despite the laws, a government-wide Human Resource
Management (HRM) system had not been established and personnel functions were weak.
The level and structure of civil service wages were inadequate to sustain a professional
cadre of staff. Government procurement procedures were inefficient and lacked
transparency. Oversight of government financial activities through both internal and
external audit functions was weak and confusingly dispersed among various agencies.
Finally, the Government had enacted legislation increasing the functions and
responsibilities of local authorities (RA Law on Local Self-Government 2002, RA Law



                                           1
on Municipal Service 2004, RA Law on Local Self-Government in Yerevan 2008, etc.),
even though many communities lacked even rudimentary execution capacity. While
Armenia was receiving a broad array of technical and financial assistance from donors,
including in the area of public sector strengthening, there were significant gaps in cross
cutting government management systems and no well coordinated approach to state
reform.

The World Bank was among the first donors supporting Armenia’s economic and social
transformation in the early years of independence. The Bank’s strategy initially focused
on providing assistance towards overall economic reforms and institution building,
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure, and social protection mechanisms. Over time it
deepened its focus on capacity building, informed by a series of analytical work. Policy
reform indicated by the reports were increasingly included in Development Policy
Operations, and the Bank sought to directly support capacity building through investment
projects, such as the 2000 Judicial Reform credit.

The April 2001 CAS targeted the improvement in governance and public services as a
key goal, directly undergirding the government’s poverty reduction strategy. The Public
Sector Modernization Project (PSMP II) under review in this ICR was an investment
credit aimed at supporting the CAS by increasing efficiency and transparency in public
sector management. The credit targeted several cross-governmental management
information systems, training to enhance the quality and effectiveness of policy
management, personnel management, and local government service delivery.
Complementing this horizontal approach, the project also aimed to support several core
agencies responsible for the cross-cutting systems as well as some sector specific
interventions. It was complemented by a series of policy based adjustment operations
and extensive economic and sector-related work, as well as related activities financed by
other donors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project Development Objective indicated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD-
Report No. 27563-AM) is to enhance efficiency in public sector management through: (a)
piloting innovations in selected institutions; and (b) improving transparency in
government decision-making and policy implementation.

The PDO wording in the Development Credit Agreement is nearly the same.

Six project monitoring indicators are laid out on page 5 of the PAD. They include:

       1. The proportion of civil service appointments made through merit-based open
          competitions increases by 50% annually;
       2. Where E-procurement is applied, time taken for an average procurement
          exercise is reduced by 25% by the end of the project;



                                            2
       3. The number of sole source contracts in public procurement is reduced by 25%
          by the end of the project;
       4. Audit standards on 10 subject areas, one of which should be ethical standards,
          are developed and approved by the Chairman of the Chamber of Control
          (COC) and effectively applied, as verified by independent local audit experts;
       5. Level of satisfaction of the business community with the appropriateness and
          timeliness of certification and standardization services is increased by 50%
          over project duration as measured by surveys;
       6. Improved citizens’ perception on local government management capacity, as
          well as on the quantity and quality of public services locally delivered, in the
          pilot Communities and Inter-Community Unions (ICUs) as compared to the
          pre-project situation.

Unfortunately the Results Framework for the project was poorly designed with
inconsistencies between the PDO outcomes and performance indicators, mathematically
incorrect or inappropriately defined numeric targets, broadly defined indicators, lack of
baseline data and targets, etc. For example, of the indicators above, only numbers 3 and 4
appear in the Results Framework and Monitoring Table in Annex 3 of the PAD.
Numbers 5 and 6 did not appear in the Results Framework and were not tracked in ISRs.
Other indicators appeared to have arbitrary and end of project targets without reflecting
baseline information or considered appreciation of the challenges.

As a consequence during project implementation the task team sought to retrofit the
shortfalls in the results framework as well as use proxy indicators although the survey
results reported in Annex 2 of this report are used with caution. Overall the monitoring
and evaluation framework designed for the project during preparation does not meet the
current standards of the Bank. Consequently for purposes of the project (and this ICR in
Annex 2) the relevant PDO outcome indicators and IRIs are assumed to be those included
in Annex 3 of the PAD as supplemented by additional or clarified indicators tracked in
ISRs.

For the purposes of clarity, performance against the indicators listed on page 5 of the
PAD are included in Section F of the data sheet of this ICR and include: (i) for the
mathematically hyper ambitious target for the civil service of a 50% annual improvement,
the perception on fairness and efficiency of application of merit-based principles during
competitive appointments and annual evaluations of civil servants reached, after
introduction of the system, 70.6% from the 2005 initial level of 59.1%; (ii) the time taken
for the average procurement exercise was reduced from 51 to 45 days (11.8%) even
before the pending launch of e-procurement, versus a target of 25%; (iii) similarly the
number of sole source contracts was reduced from 1442 to 380 (73.6%) between 2005
and 2010 before the launch of e-procurement versus a target of 25%; (iv) audit standards
for ten subject areas, one of which to be ethical standards are developed, approved by the
Chairman of CoC and effectively applied; (v) the level of satisfaction of the Business
Community with the appropriateness and timeliness of certification and standardization
services was increased by 9.1% over project duration reaching 60% versus a targeted


                                            3
50% improvement; and (vi) public satisfaction with local government services registered
a 17% improvement over the baseline, reaching 54.2%, versus an unquantified target.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

There were no formal revisions of the PDO during the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The PAD does not explicitly list project beneficiaries as such. Based on the
characteristics of the project, it could be assumed that the beneficiaries were, most
directly, government officials and staff at the central and local levels benefiting from
training, improved business processes and ICT equipment, and a more professional
human resources environment. The following agencies were identified in the PAD as
proposed recipients of credit resources—Civil Service Council, Academy of Public
Administration, State Procurement Agency, Chamber of Control, Ministry of Finance and
Economy, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, the Office of the Government,
Tax and Customs Services, and Ministry of Territorial Administration—although this
does not cover the up to “sixty? potential benefitting state agencies plus sub-national
governments also mentioned without name in the PAD. Beyond these agencies the roll
out of Electronic Document Management System and performance management system
expanded the impact of the project to cover the entire central and regional public
administration, plus some selected municipalities. Citizens and private sector firms, of
course, would be the ultimate beneficiaries in terms of improved services, better value for
taxpayer resources, more transparency in government operations, and an improved
poverty alleviation effort.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

This project includes five substantive components designed to support innovations in
horizontal management processes and capacity building in specific agencies (although
there is some overlap between horizontal and vertical elements in components iii and iv).
The components were: (i) Strengthening Civil Service Management; (ii) Introducing E-
procurement; (iii) Strengthening the Chamber of Control; (iv) Improving Policy
Formulation and Implementation through Capacity Building; and (v) Developing
Capacity in Local Governments. All components were to be supported by a range of
activities including technical assistance, training, and computer hardware and software
complementary to the TA and training. The project also included a sixth component to
handle (vi) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Surveys, and
Communication on the project itself.




                                            4
Strengthening Civil Service Management (US$2.62 Million--IDA contribution
US$2.52 Million)

This component focused on the development of systems and capacities to ensure a
consistent application of merit-based recruitment and promotion processes across all
institutions under the Civil Service Law. Key activities under subcomponents are listed
below.

Subcomponent 1A was to support the drafting of a Civil Service Development Strategy
and the completion of remaining elements of the Regulatory Framework for Civil Service
Management.

Subcomponent 1B aimed to strengthen the new Civil Service Council (which oversees
the recruitment process for senior positions in the state administration, coordinates the
implementation of the Civil Service Law and manages the overall civil service system)
through activities, which would improve the testing and attestation instruments; equip the
Council’s offices; assist the Council to develop and implement a Civil Service Training
Strategy; and help develop a Communications and Public Relations Strategy and
establish a Public Information Center.

Subcomponent 1C would support the introduction of cross-ministerial systems for
Human Resource Management and Assessment/Attestation. The introduction of
government-wide IT systems for HRM would enable the CSC to monitor the consistent
application of merit based procedures and develop a pro-active career management policy
that would reward professional excellence through accelerated career growth.

Subcomponent 1D would assist the Government to improve the quality of the training
programs of the Academy of Public Administration (AAPA) as the main provider of
Civil Service training by strengthening the Academy’s ability to develop and implement
training programs, upgrading the Academy’s training facilities in Yerevan, and equipping
the to-be-created regional branches in two other municipalities.

Introducing E-procurement (US$0.92 Million--IDA contribution US$0.62 Million)

This component sought to address some of the systemic weaknesses in the procurement
system, which were identified in the May 2003 CPAR and in particular the prevalence of
non-competitive practices and over-reliance on single source methods. It aimed to
establish the information technology infrastructure for E-procurement and the basis for
the development of a full-fledged E-procurement system.

Subcomponent 2A would assist the Government in creating the material base for E-
procurement in the Central Authorized Body, the State Procurement Agency as well as 60
state agencies, 44 local Treasury units and the information centers in 10 Marz
administrations and the Yerevan region.




                                            5
Subcomponent 2B would finance the acquisition, adaptation, installation, configuration,
and testing of E-procurement application software, including: (i) an automated internal
procurement administration system covering planning, budgeting and recording of
contract awards; (ii) a contract management system for the generation and management
of contractual documentation and the procurement process; (iii) system-controlled
requisitions, purchase orders, and receipt and payment documents, including e-catalogues
for framework contracts; and (iv) a public awareness/outreach program to maximize the
awareness and utilization of the E-procurement System.

Strengthening the Chamber of Control (US$0.74 Million--IDA contribution US$0.29
Million)

Component 3 would provide limited and focused support to the Chamber of Control
(COC), the nation’s supreme audit authority, including the development of audit
standards and manuals needed to enhance its ability to provide professional performance
audit reports to the National Assembly (beyond the more narrowly defined traditional
financial audits), training on the new standards, some essential equipment, and an
updated web site.


Subcomponent 3A would assist the CoC prepare at least 10 performance audit standards
including one on ethics, an Audit Manual for the CoC’s financial compliance units, an
evaluation of budgetary programs, training and an internal code of ethics for CoC staff.

Subcomponent 3B would finance workstations, ICT equipment and start up, and some
furniture to the agency.

Subcomponent 3C would expend a small amount for local technical assistance on the
further development of the CoC’s website for posting CoC reports and information on its
activities.

Improving Policy Formulation and Implementation through Capacity Building
(US$3.55 Million--IDA contribution US$3.42 Million)

To address weaknesses in the policy formulation and implementation process in the
central administration, this component (Component 4) would support the development
of electronic document management systems and systems for tracking policy
implementation, as well as pilot management innovations to enhance transparency and
accountability and address priority capacity building needs in selected agencies. (It
should be noted that this component appears ambiguously named in the sense that its
activities, performance indicators, and funding are focused largely on capacity building
with improved policy formulation and implementation, in most cases, assumed to result
from these project inputs. As elaborated in Annex 2 some improvements in policy
formulation and implementation can be discerned in some sub-components.)




                                           6
Subcomponent 4A would support the introduction of an integrated document
management system to enhance the effectiveness of policy development and
implementation across the state administration.

Subcomponent 4B would enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Economy
in the areas of revenue policy, internal audit, and the Budget and Financial Management
Training Center. Specific activities would include: (i) the provision of training to
strengthen policy development in the area of revenue policy, including coordination
systems with the Tax and Customs Services; (ii) strengthening the Ministry’s internal
audit mechanisms through training and upgrading equipment; (iii) providing equipment
to effectively link the Supervision Service [internal audit unit] of the MOF, the
Supervision Service of the President’s Administration, and the Supervision Service of the
Office of the Government; and (iv) enhancing the capacity of the Budget and Financial
Management Training Center to effectively train staff members of budget departments
across the public sector.

Subcomponent 4C would support the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade
(MEDT) to enhance its capacities in regulatory policy-making especially in the areas of
standardization, certification and metrology and strengthen the Ministry’s capacity to
communicate and coordinate with external interlocutors, domestic and international,
public and non-governmental.

Subcomponent 4D would focus on strengthening the external communications and
outreach capacity of the Office of the Government, the office reporting to the Prime
Minister and assisting in the management of the government’s decision-making process.

Subcomponent 4E would strengthen MEDT’s standardization, metrological and
certification functions in support of Armenia’s WTO accession by focusing on improving
the regulatory framework and related technical standards, improving access to
international technical standards and standards procedures, and addressing the essential
hardware needs through the provision of equipment for testing laboratories.


Developing Capacity in Local Governments (US$2.85 Million- IDA contribution
US$2.76 Million)

To improve local self-government capacity to deliver public services as called for under
the 2002 Law on Local Self-Government, this component would seek to address four
related issues: (i) mitigating the consequences of administrative fragmentation; (ii)
enhancing revenue mobilization; (iii) implementing a HRM system for the municipal
civil service; and (iv) strengthening municipal data management.

Subcomponent 5A would support the development of the legal and policy framework for
Inter-Community Unions [grouping administrations and services to enhance efficiencies]
to mitigate the impact of administrative fragmentation.




                                           7
Subcomponent 5B would finance international and local technical assistance and training
to advise the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure coordination on
building local capacity to meet new responsibilities for property and land tax collection.

Subcomponent 5C would help design and implement a human resource management
system for the municipal civil service.

Subcomponent 5D targeted the development and deployment of an integrated, computer-
based Management Information System, and by the strengthening of the national center
for technical support and systems development in Charenstsevan.

Project Management, Surveys and Communication (US$0.59 Million- IDA
contribution US$0.54 Million)

Noting that the other components involved a set of complementary but distinct public
sector management reform initiatives, this final component sought to provide a unified
project governance and management and monitoring of outcomes.

Subcomponent 6A would provide funding for the project manager and essential support
staff and functions.

Subcomponent 6B aimed to fund periodic surveys of households, firms, NGOs and
public officials to collect data on key performance indicators and obtain feedback from
stakeholders on the reform process, as well as finance a communication campaign to
explain project objectives to selected stakeholders to help build and maintain support and
ownership for the reforms.

1.6 Revised Components

No change

1.7 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

Other significant changes impacting the project were related with three extensions of
closing dates with the first for a period of 15 months to June 30, 2010, the second for 4
months to October 31, 2010 and the last one for 4 months to the de facto closing date of
February 28, 2011. The main reason for the extension of the closing date was allowing
sufficient time for completion of procurement of ICT systems, inter alia, roll-out of
EDMS and customization of e-Tendering system.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory. This judgment balances the alignment
with the Government’s public administration reform program and coordination of the
program with adjustment lending and ESW work on the positive side against the very
broad scope plus gaps in prior preparation for the implementation of the various ICT
investments on the negative side.

Strengths of the program at entry

Leading up to the project and supporting its design was extensive economic and sector
work, including a Civil Service Assessment (1998), an Institutional and Governance
Review (2000), a Public Expenditure Review (2003), a country Procurement Assessment
Report (2003), and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2003). Significant
analytical work continued through the program, and helped refine the approach of the
project. The project benefitted from years of close country policy dialogue as well as
strong coordination between the Country and Sector Units.

The project was complemented by several other investment operations, including health,
education, social services, legal and judicial services, as well as various adjustment
operations. These investment operations provided the technical assistance that was
relevant to the development and implementation of the broader policy changes and
allowed the Public Sector Modernization Reform project to focus on its core mission.

Weaknesses

First, while there was no formal revision of PDOs or the basic structure of the project, by
2007, it became apparent that the implementation of the various information technology
subcomponents of the operation (which represented a large share of project financing)
was challenged by a variety of technological and institutional factors. A major issue was
that the basic connectivity infrastructure assumed in the PAD was not in place and its
design and installation would have to precede full deployment of the electronic document
management system, government-wide HRM management system, and E-procurement
systems if fragmented and isolated systems were to be avoided. Interoperability of some
of the investments was questioned and some efforts did not fully take into account a wide
variety of uncoordinated IT initiatives in Armenia under way funded by the government,
donors, and even other projects of the World Bank. Moreover, counterparts to some
extent may not have fully understood the scope of the project, and plans for business
process reengineering had not been fully embedded in the design of the ICT components.
Consequently, overall project implementation was slowed and ISR ratings downgraded.
The supervision team proactively brought in outside ICT expertise to review the project
and its relations to the other initiatives, and engaged in intense dialogue with counterparts.



                                              9
A remedial program of actions was agreed upon, adjustments made in funding allocations
and procurement activities, and disbursements ramped up significantly within a year.

Second, the objective of including a large array of components was to respond to client
demands and needs, fill gaps left by other donors, and enhance a holistic approach to
state modernization, in the view of the PAD. Yet experience with projects of this nature
suggests that such a broad scope often exceeds the management capacity of government.
Combining government-wide horizontal reforms with vertical capacity building efforts in
a few ministries, addressing organizations at the central and regional levels of
government, and supporting an agency (the Chamber of Control) independent of the
executive branch stretched the management capability of the project teams. The project
had five substantive components and 20 sub-components, which in turn were often
broken down further (e.g. Component 1 had 13 separate sub-sub components). The size
of anticipated funding of sub-components ranged from $20 thousand to $2.39 million
(120 times larger). Project management needed to spend considerable time in monitoring
and policing the myriad activities, educating project beneficiaries as to project goals, and
in general seeking to ensure some unified approach to the project. Despite budget top ups
by the Country Unit to add resources above the Supervision budget norm, the Bank team
itself was challenged from the beginning by the coordination responsibilities of the
operation.

Third, it is also somewhat of a stretch to see the project bringing a holistic approach
given the individual narrowness and overall number of issues requiring counterpart
attention (scientific laboratory upgrades, internal audit training, HRM software system
development, land tax data base transfers to municipalities, furniture for the Chamber of
Control, etc.) While such complex operations may well on rare occasions have their
place depending on the commitment, capacity, and adaptability of counterparts and Bank
teams, it puts a large burden on supervision teams and carries a high risk of failure from
one-off unsustainable investments.

Finally, the determination of performance indicators was poor. This was especially
bothersome during implementation as the vague nature of the Project Development
Objective statement (“improved efficiency in public sector management?, followed by
clauses on two operational aspects of how it would be achieved through piloting
unnamed “innovations? and transparency) gave little concrete direction. Six “main
project monitoring indicators? were listed on page 5 of the PAD, but none are PDO
outcomes, only four appear in some fashion in Annex 3 (Results Framework and
Monitoring) as intermediate results indicators (IRIs), and these nominally measure only
three of five components. Two “main project monitoring indicators? do not appear in the
Results Framework in Annex 3 and were not tracked in ISRs. The three PDO indicators
relating to the civil service, financial management, and central and local administrations
identified in Annex 3 are very general and non quantifiable (“transparent?, “more
efficient, effective, and transparent?, and “more functional and effective?) so any
determination of their achievement would be subjective. In Annex 3 there were 22
intermediate results indicators presented, although some major sub-components lacked
any IRIs and in other cases indicators were unrelated to project activities (e.g. E-



                                            10
procurement). In any case the government and Bank teams struggled to square IRIs with
project activities (which presumably were closer to government priorities). Ultimately
the original IRIs were supplemented by additional indicators better reflecting project
activities.

2.2 Implementation

As some of the design shortcomings became apparent the project supervision team
attempted to address them during implementation. The government, with Bank support,
moved within a year to replace an ineffective project director. A locally based Bank staff
was contracted to strengthen daily supervision. Ratings of the project were generally
realistic, most notably the downgrades reported in 2007-8. All performance indicators
mentioned in Annex 3 of the PAD were tracked, and subsequently expanded by
additional indicators. Assessments provided to management in ISRs appeared to be
thoughtful, appropriately targeted, and supported by comprehensive Aide Memoires. By
2007 the team candidly reported on the ICT challenges and took steps through expanded
technical assistance and dialogue with counterparts to successfully address those
problems.

The quality of implementation of the project was assessed by a special QAG review
commissioned by the Public Sector Management Office (PRMPS) in 2007. The panel
was impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the supervision team, but
found that the project was “overambitious, too wide in scope with insufficient counterpart
understanding, and overly equipment driven?. It noted that this lack of understanding
and failure to define business process reforms “suggest hasty preparation and a failure to
communicate project objectives and how to get there.? Although not explicitly stated,
this may suggest that the QAG team viewed the Quality at Entry as no more than
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Output and outcomes monitoring and evaluation were considered important aspects of
project design, including a separate sub-component of the project. Counterparts
ultimately monitored the entire set of performance indicators listed in the PAD text and
annex. After the mid-term review additional intermediate results indicators were agreed
upon, monitored, and reported in ISRs. Having some indicators with more apparent
relevance than others (which were not cancelled), however, can lead to confusion for
teams or outside observers as to which were the real metrics for measuring performance.

The credit also contemplated a series of monitoring and evaluation efforts establishing
baseline values and tracking progress over time. However the contracted outside firm did
conduct a comprehensive review of project performance based on surveys, focus groups,
and data for 2005-2009/2010. It sought to establish retrospectively reliable baseline
information going back to January 2007 for Components 1, 2 and 4 (arguably the period
when project implementation began in earnest) based on records as well as input from
survey and focus group respondents. Surveys for Component 5 sought to reflect



                                           11
information going back to 2005. While comprehensive, interesting, and indicative,
confidence in the baseline values would be greater had the studies and surveys been done
closer to project launch. In the event the 2009/2010 monitoring and evaluation effort
appears to have been comprehensive and useful, providing input to project reporting and
this ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
         
The financial management arrangements in the PIU (Foreign-Financed Project
Management Center), which included accounting, budgeting and planning, financial
reporting, funds flow, internal control, and external auditing were developed early on and
maintained an acceptable quality throughout the life of the project. Internal controls were
judged to be strong and capable of providing reliable and timely information on the
projects. Financial monitoring reports were always submitted by due dates and assessed
as acceptable to the Bank. Audited financial statements of the project were always
received by due dates with unqualified (clean) opinions issued.

According to the Bank’s procurement team member, as well as periodic reports, the
government implementation unit did an excellent job in preparing the terms of reference
and bidding documents and procurement of the contracts generally proceeded without
problems. Monitoring of project procurement and contract execution was careful, timely
and detailed. Five post review missions were conducted with approximately 70% of
contracts subject to post review. There was only one area of a major bidding problem
when the first bid for development of the E-tendering contract solicited proposals far in
excess of available resources. The proposed work program was therefore revised and re-
bid successfully (an interruption in implementation leading to the last credit extension).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The project supported major improvements in core government management information
systems (HRM, EDMS, and E-procurement) that enable more efficient policy
formulation and implementation. It also contributed to modernization efforts in selected
ministries and agencies, units, and a broad swath of local governments. An indication of
the government's assessment of the project’s success and need to continue ongoing
modernization efforts was the request for a follow up Public Sector Modernization II
project which was approved on March 16, 2010. This operation builds on a narrowed set
of initiatives of the first operation. The government’s project implementation unit has
remained intact which should both facilitate smooth implementation of the new operation
and provide institutional memory for any follow up actions required for investments
under PSMP I.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

This project’s objectives are fully relevant to country priorities and consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy and subsequent Country Partnership Strategy as highlighted
in the two documents dating back to 2001. The Bank’s current Country Partnership
Strategy for Armenia, approved on May 12, 2009 and covering FY09-12 aims at the two
main pillars of mitigating vulnerability (related to the impact of the global economic
crisis which hit Armenia hard due to its increased integration into the international
economy) and strengthening the country’s medium term competitiveness. Improving
public sector efficiency is highlighted as a core structural reform under the
competitiveness pillar.

The CPS notes that progress during the previous CAS period was real, especially in
capacity building in selected public agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, HRM
improvements, and strengthening local governments, but that more was needed in other
agencies and in combating corruption and improving transparency. Consequently, the
CPS highlights five areas of public sector strengthening: (i) tax and customs
administration; (ii) a more integrated approach to public expenditure management; (iii)
civil service reform deepening; (iv) expanding the scope of judicial reform; and (v) a
comprehensive and coherent effort to strengthen conflict of interest controls at all levels
of the government.

The follow up Public Sector Modernization operation reflects the government’s
commitment to continuing the reform effort and confidence in the Bank as a partner in
this effort. This new operation aims at enhanced performance of public sector
management for better service delivery by: (i) strengthening institutional capacity in
policy formulation; (ii) maximizing the efficiency of human resources; and (iii)
developing information systems for internal work flow and external communication.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Despite the generalness of the Project Development Objective and design challenges for
the indicators of performance, the project appears to have materially achieved its PDO.
As detailed below, there have been clear improvements in public sector management
efficiency stemming from: (i) the roll out (and not just piloting as called for in the PDO)
of innovations such as the electronic document and human resource management systems
in the bulk of Armenian government agencies (which has been facilitating other process
and structural reforms, such as work planning and performance appraisal for the civil
service, tracking communications online between government and citizens, introducing e-
licensing, decentralizing recruitment of junior civil servants, launching functional
reviews, and business process reengineering in a number of ministries) plus initiation of a
modern E-procurement system; and (ii) improved transparency (both as an input to
efficiency and end in itself) in operations through initiatives affecting government media
and web site communication with citizens, enhanced public access to data not only on



                                            13
their specific requests but also government policies and budget execution, and
strengthening formal oversight through as internal and external audit organizations.

With regard to the PDO outcome indicators listed in Annex 3 of the PAD, the weight of
evidence suggests that: (i) merit and transparency are being applied and monitored by the
Civil Service Council; (ii) financial management has been improved through
strengthened external audit capacity (though full exploitation of this capacity may be
spotty) and increased transparency of budget execution. Introduction of electronic public
procurement by end 2011 will further enhance relevant project outcomes; and (iii)
substantive improvements in local government operations and business processes in the
central public administration. The electronic document management system enables real
time effective workflow and communication within central and regional public
administration. The work planning and performance management system, fully supported
by Electronic Document Management System, enables developing and implementing
policy in-line with Government strategies, measuring and motivating performance at
organizational and individual levels. That said, difficulties in both the articulation of the
PDO indicators and data collection implications need to be recognized in assessing the
evidence that was collected:

PDO Outcome Indicator 1: The management of the Civil Service of Armenia is
transparent and based on merit principles that are consistently applied throughout
the system. Annex 3 of the PAD called for surveys of citizens and public officials, plus
supervision reports to provide the evidence. The operative goal for the end of the project
was stated in Annex 3 as “Merit principles in recruitment and promotion are applied.?

Evidence: Data was gathered in 2010 through surveys of applicants to civil service jobs.
The information was broken down by year and method of hiring (competition or
attestation alone), and collected from 537 people who may or may not have been hired
ultimately. The summary table indicates that an increasing majority of applicants believe
that recruitment is merit based. Separate survey data collected on efficiency of periodic
qualification tests captured an increasing perception of efficiency, to which the project
contributed through building capacity for the elaboration of more sector and job relevant
questionnaires. The tests were the only source to inform merit-based career decisions
before the implementation of performance appraisal system also supported by the project.
The practice of periodical testing is expected to be discontinued in a couple of years after
full roll-out of the performance planning and management system. (No information was
gathered on the fairness of promotions in part due to the difficulty of devising a neutral
and valid measurement method and this goal was not tracked in ISRs. Also the ISR
dropped the goal of “increasing the proportion of civil service appointments made
through merit-based open competitions by 50 percent annually? stated on page 5 of the
PAD as such a goal was mathematically illogical.)

PDO Outcome Indicator 2: The financial management control framework and
procurement procedures become more efficient, effective and transparent. Annex 3
of the PAD called for surveys of businesses and officials (without target values) plus it
listed project inputs relating to E-procurement, internal audit offices, CoC audit standards
and manual as targets. ISRs at first made operational the PDO indicator by calling for
increasing business firm satisfaction with public procurement. Later ISR identified a
satisfaction rate of 80%. ISRs also called for approval of ten audit standards by the CoC
plus staff trained on the new standards. Following the revision of indicators the
requirement of staff training was dropped (reportedly because staff had already been
trained).

Evidence: As outlined below and in Annex 2, which covers implementation of the
various components the specific inputs on E-procurement, internal audit, CoC audit
standards and manuals, the input target values were largely met. Business satisfaction
with public procurement was assessed through surveys of firms (sample of 341 firms)
covering period 2005-2009/2010. The firm names were obtained from the State
Procurement Service, data from official procurement bulletins, and other available
sources. The following table and graph summarize the survey results, and indicate a
satisfaction rate of about 80% and an increase over three years in the perceived fairness
of public procurement. No similar perception based measures were obtained for wider
financial control functions due to difficulty to identify proper respondents and smaller

 PDO Outcome Indicator 3: The organization of Central and local administrations is
 more functional and effective. This statement is from the beginning of Annex 3:
 Results Framework and Monitoring. However later in the same annex the PDO indicator
 is presented as Local self-government in Armenia is empowered with sufficient
 organizational structure, technical capacity and fiscal autonomy to exercise their
 responsibilities as established by Law. The ISRs track the first statement, but the
 specific operational targets changed from earlier ISRs’ “Citizens and government can
 more effectively monitor policy decisions and policy implementation as measured by
 surveys; government institutions use results to improve availability of information
 throughout the project? to in later ISRs “83% of business community is satisfied with the
 appropriateness of services, a 15% increase in general satisfaction with local government
 services of respondents over baseline?.



                                              16
Evidence: It is difficult to provide clear evidence in line with this PDO Outcome
Indicator. First of all it is not clear what the word “organization? refers to in the PDO
Outcome Indicator sentence—an organization chart, the mobilization of government
resources, or the government as an organization itself. Secondly there are two PDO
outcome indicators listed in Annex 3. Thirdly neither indicator is quantifiable as written.
Fourthly the operational targets listed in ISRs evolved over time and narrowed onto local
government (borrowing the concept of increased satisfaction with local government
services from the last “main project monitoring indicators? listed on page 5 of the PAD
text and adding a 15% numeric target). Finally, no surveys were conducted to explicitly
ask businesses and citizens their views of improvements in services —rather there was a
survey of officials and citizens in the four pilot Inter Community Union municipalities on
the nature of government services. This provides baseline information going forward.
There was no baseline information to judge project impact in these communities. In any
case the project was focusing on internal public administration capacity building and it is
unclear how soon citizens would have perceived improvements in service delivery at the
local level. In sum, given the conceptual and data collection flaws for this PDO indicator
reliance must be placed more on the intermediate results indicators linked to components
to identify improvements in overall government administrative effectiveness.         Those
efficiency improvements under the substantive components (which are further detailed in
Annex 2 of this report) include the following:

Human Resource Management: With the support of the project Armenia has
developed the policy and material basis for a modern HRM system. An electronic based
human resources management information system has been created and installed in all 45
agencies subject to the Civil Service Law. It contains and interactively manages a
comprehensive system of electronic personnel files, annual performance evaluations, and
linked staff training plans. Recruitment of staff is more competitive and transparent as all
vacancies are listed on the Civil Service web site. Selection has been improved through
agency relevant testing using centrally approved methods (unlike previous practice where
agency scope for discretion in selection criteria was broader). The program of periodic
attestation is being integrated into the HRMIS. Training for public employees (both on
site and long distance) has been significantly upgraded. The capacity of the Civil Service
Council to oversee the civil service system has been strengthened, as well as the capacity
of the Academy of Public Administration.

Introducing E-procurement. The component aimed to create the material base within
government for an E-procurement system as well as the procuring and installation of such
a system. The component’s aims were partially achieved, and represented a major effort
within the project, including the last extension of project closing date in order to
complete a critical E-procurement sub-component process. By the end of the project the
core elements of an E-procurement system had been designed, tested, and transferred to
government. The E-tendering system is currently under phased implementation—it was
loaded onto servers by end May 2011, will be publicly launched in October 2011, and its
use will be mandatory for all government agencies as of January, 2012. The E-tendering
system represents the heart of an E-procurement system, involving in electronic gathering



                                            17
and posting of government tenders for goods and services, transmission of information to
registering suppliers, and submission of bids (specifications and costs) all accessible on a
government web-site.

Strengthening the Chamber of Control. The stated objectives of this financially small
component were partially achieved. The project provided support to the CoC for the
development and internal review of modern performance audit standards covering ten
areas, as well as a code of ethics for CoC staff. All have been approved by the Board of
the Chamber including its Chairman and are in effect. An audit manual for financial
compliance was similarly developed, approved and applied. The audit standards and
methodologies formally guiding CoC activities are in line with international practices.
The anticipated equipment and furniture purchases were made and the web site of CoC
was upgraded and is now available to the public at www.coc.am. The quality of CoC
operations, however, does not yet fully reflect the capacity building inputs.

Improved Policy Formulation and Implementation through Capacity Building.
This component (largely funding ICT investments) was generally designed to improve
the information base for policy formulation and timelier and more effective policy
implementation, (As indicated previously this title is ambiguous if not misleading as
improved information inputs or electronic capacity are not sufficient for improved policy
formulation, adoption, or implementation. So too for the entire project--the technical
assistance and funding provided can enhance public sector efficiency (in terms of speed,
coverage, cost, etc.) without necessarily improving the effectiveness or equity of
government. Although project component design explicitly would not guarantee
immediate results to improve policy formulation and implementation, some improvement
was achieved in some areas due to the teams’ efforts to bring planned piecemeal efforts
together to ensure synergies and alignment with general component targets. The
successful creation, under this component, of an Electronic Data Management System
(EDMS) digitizing government operations and moving toward a paperless administration
is a key project outcome. The related software that was developed—termed Mulberry—
is used by 8000 staff daily in 32 government bodies. EDMS is: (i) impacting the speed of
government activity, accuracy of information, and internal consistency; (ii) permitting
widespread business process reengineering and functional reforms in agencies; (iii)
freeing government officials to focus more on better informed policy deliberations and
less on routine transaction processing and monitoring; and (iv) transforming
citizen/government interaction (electronic application for government services, tracking
of government responses to those requests, public oversight of budget expenditures, etc.).
EDMS has become the backbone of Armenia’s E-government effort, underlying the
reforms in human resource management and capacity building supporting other
components of the project, as well as other public administration modernization efforts
fully funded by the government and/or other donors. It can be expected that improved
document management and streamlined business processes will also contribute to the
Chamber of Control’s efforts to audit both financial compliance and performance.
EDMS is rightly considered a flagship of the project and pillar for current and future
public administration reforms.




                                            18
Complementary reforms within the component also aimed to strengthen the basis for
policy formulation and implementation through improvements in public communications.
With project support the government has created a better functioning press operation at
the center of government charged with overseeing a modern and more sophisticated effort
at communications with citizens. The press center (with its expanded communications
capacity, regular briefings, various information outlets available to the press, etc.) in the
view of counterparts is increasing the flow and quality of information from government,
enhancing the transparency of its operations, improving the quality of public debate on
national issues, and promoting increased citizen awareness of, and feedback on,
government operations (which in turn can improve policy formulation and
implementation). Along with the processes supported by EDMS, it is judged (at least by
government officials and local Bank staff) as continuing a trend toward more
participatory government and rebalancing a legacy of one way communication flow and
top down authoritarian public administration inherited from the Soviets.

Two related sub-components with the Ministry of Economic Development (subsequently
renamed the Ministry of Economy) sought to improve policy making, communications
with external partners, as well as the technical capacity in national standardization and
certification to better meet the country’s obligations to the World Trade Organization
(WTO). Rapidly addressing so called “technical barriers to trade? relating to health and
safety procedures and testing, etc. was considered a top priority for the country and its
strategy to better integrate into the global economy. Technical assistance supported
initial significant steps toward the harmonization of technical regulations and testing
methods with international and European standards as well as policy making itself in the
area of standardization. Finally, support to the Ministry of Finance was most helpful in
strengthening the Ministry’s Training Center and its capacity to train staff government-
wide on modern public finance subjects and procedures. Training was provided in
specific areas such as internal audit and the project helped establish pilot internal audit
units in line agencies. The project built both technical capacity and the material base for
the training institution to deliver training on various specific subjects of PFM.

Overall, despite the fact that "umbrella" title for the project component was wide and
ambitious, due to extra efforts at implementation stage (beyond the original planned
activities) the team ensured:
      Improved government capacity for communicating policies with the public
       through modern press center,
      More transparent budget execution,
      More effective workflow through reengineered business processes and timely
       communication of government decision via e-government system covering central
       government and territorial administration, and
      Institutionalizing and automating work planning in-line with government
       strategies through the work planning and performance management system.

The latter is the most critical and valuable change, since it ensures not only planning
individual performance targets aligned to organizational and higher government targets,


                                             19
but also involves civil servants in consultative process of policy formulation to achieve
this. Further, the performance management system motivates achievement of the
relevant targets against which individual and organizational performance is assessed.

Developing Local Government Capacity. A major initiative in Armenia has been to
devolve responsibilities and taxing authority to local governments which are closer to
citizens and presumably better able in the long run to manage local service delivery.
Near the end of project preparation and in response to the client’s request, this component
was included to help support the decentralization program. Progress under several areas
has been notable. For example, data on property and land taxes have been transferred to
nearly all local communities, pilot programs have been initiated to improve human
resource management at the local administrative level (to in part better manage the
increased responsibilities for tax collection), and an integrated, computer based
management information system has been designed and installed in over 200
municipalities, including the largest 60. Consequently the long term process of
institutional capacity building in municipalities is well launched with the support of the
project. One sub-component has not advanced as parliament has not approved legislation
mandating involuntary Inter-Community Units (designed to compel consolidation of
services in neighboring small municipalities) so work on the necessary regulatory
framework could not commence. Nevertheless there appears to be a voluntary process of
consolidation underway, which is benefiting from the other investments within this
component.



3.3 Efficiency

As an institutional capacity building project, quantitative projections of rates of return are
not applicable and were not developed during project preparation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The substantial advances highlighted above have laid the basis for more efficient public
sector management. This has been achieved through: (i) an improved material base
(hardware, software, and communications infrastructure) for core management
information systems underlying better policy formulation; (ii) more transparent and two
way communications with citizens and other stakeholders; and (iii) targeted
improvements in the operations of several key agencies or functions impacting
government performance. Whatever the specific challenges of poorly designed
performance indicators the project can fairly be judged to have met its goals warranting a
rating of Satisfactory. Indeed in some instances, such as HRM and EDMS, it exceeded
expectations. Several of the modernization efforts will be deepened under the follow on
PSMP II operation.




                                             20
The rating takes into account some shortfalls. These include the inability of the project to
complete the regulatory framework for the Inter-Community Union legislation as it has
not yet passed the National Assembly and an apparent decision not to vigorously pursue
training and other investments to enhance coordination between the internal revenue and
Custom Departments. These, based on their nature (small relative funding size as well as
modest policy importance) do not warrant downgrading the project outcome to
Marginally Satisfactory (although on the other hand they do suggest that a Highly
Satisfactory rating would be too generous). Similarly the progress toward creating the
material basis for an E-procurement system has met the expectations of the PAD, even
though the roll out of the core E-tendering system is only occurring now (a pace which is
normal for global practice). Had the project been formally restructured and performance
indicators and some components refined accordingly the project may have earned a
Highly Satisfactory rating. Nevertheless, judged against other public sector projects this
operation is very solid and undoubtedly one of the most successful in the portfolio.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There is no direct poverty, gender or social impact on the population. Indirectly,
however, the project can be judged as contributing to more efficient management of
public resources, improved policy formulation and implementation, more transparent
government operations, and improved two way communications between government
and the private sector—all of which should benefit citizens.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening is the core focus of the project. As indicated above and in
Annex 2 below, it has supported significant improvements in government ICT systems,
training, and specific agency activities all fostering more efficient and transparent public
sector management. Most notably the civil service system has been strengthened by the
HRMIS facilitating a more merit based system as a whole starting from competitively
filling vacancies, through personnel evaluation, linked staff training, better oversight of
agency personnel actions, etc. EDMS is the backbone of Armenia’s advance toward E-
government, with all the benefits implied in terms of speed, accuracy, efficiency, and
more effective public administration. The investments in communications (press centers
and public relations units, improved web sites for the flow of information and citizen
requests for services, and public monitoring of government operations) will strengthen
institutions’ ability to refine and implement policies.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

In line with Sub-component 6B a comprehensive “Monitoring and Evaluation of the
Public Sector Modernization Project? was contracted and covered the period 2005-
2009/2010 and a final report delivered in April 2010. The report focused on intermediate
results indicators then being tracked in ISRs. The data was gathered, analyzed, and
presented on 27 topics using surveys, focus group discussions, review of government


                                            21
documents, interviews, etc. The data helped inform preparation of this ICR as well as
implementation of the project in its final months. Efforts were made by the report team
(a private company) to capture data from earlier years (through time specific questions
and data assessment) for few additional indicators for local government added after MTR
of the project. Its usefulness would have been greater had earlier similar studies been
conducted as indicated in the PAD.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The sustainability of project achievements and thus the Development Outcome seems
likely. The investments in ICT and resulting improvements in HRM, the core features of
e-government including EDMS and E-tendering, as well as improvements in training and
specific capacities in several areas seem to be largely uncontroversial, representing non-
partisan building blocks for any public administration. Save a severe national crisis it is
unlikely that any government would give up the cost efficiency and effectiveness of most
of the measures supported by the project. Of course any future government could
theoretically cut citizen access to government information, curtail the Chamber of
Control’s efforts to increase performance auditing, or limit the transparency and merit
principles in public hiring or procurement, but that is a risk that seems low given the
trajectory of Armenia’s progress over the last two decades and deep commitment to the
global economy and association with the European Union. A more practical
complication might stem from an unwillingness or incapacity to maintain/upgrade the
modern systems, perhaps due to budget constraints. But with time government and
public comfort with, and indeed reliance on, the new systems would likely mitigate
against any sustained rollback or degradation of those systems.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Rating the Bank’s performance at entry is a challenge and ultimately a close judgment
call. The Bank drew on a long list of relevant ESW, extensive preparation and dialogue,
a strong team of public sector specialists, and close collaboration with counterparts and
other donors to design the project. The primary focus on ICT investments laying the
basis for fundamental improvements in government capacities was the underlying thrust
of the project at conception and in implementation as indicated by the amount of
resources dedicated to these components. The successful results of the project in the core
areas of EDMS, HRM, and fully anticipated in E-procurement validate the underlying
quality of the project at preparation.




                                            22
However, because the scope was too wide, some targets too ambitious, the articulation
and consistency of results indicators inadequate, and some preparatory activities required
supplementation during implementation a moderately unsatisfactory rating seems
appropriate. The inclusion of activities somewhat tangential to state modernization
burdened supervision. This may have reflected a close collaboration with government
and willingness to accommodate a partner with a proven track record of performance.
Additionally a limited number of operations available under tight IDA funding
constraints may have inclined Bank management to accept additions to the project in
order to provide flexibility to tackle discreet, financially small, targets of opportunity.
Whatever the reason the broad scope deepened the challenges of execution and
supervision.

While it would be a stretch to claim that the project reined in a disparate state
modernization effort by giving it a holistic vision, the project over time did become a
backbone of the state modernization effort which, according to counterparts, improved
the internal coherence of public administration reform and provided a basis for better
prioritization of some donor activities. Nevertheless there may have been a tendency to
oversell the possible benefits of the operation in order to secure a place in the lending
queue.

Another issue is the combination of a quite general PDO with a longish list of indicators
of varying quality essentially trying to make the objective more concrete. This appears to
have been a problem for many public sector operations prepared at the time where the
development of performance indicators seemed to follow rather than lead project
conception, and where “doing something? to improve governance exceeded the Bank’s
experience in measuring such improvement. Unsurprisingly the performance indicators
had to be supplemented during supervision1.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank mounted a solid mixture of headquarters and field based staff for supervision.
The project was supported from the early stages by a full-time field based Public Sector
Specialist and a strong headquarters based team including specialists in information
technology, public administration, civil service reform, and other specialists as required.
The team established fluid and frequent contact with counterparts throughout supervision.
It sought and obtained alternative sources of funding for the project’s special supervision
requirements and found the needed expert assistance in several areas. The Country
Director during the bulk of implementation, drawing on extensive experience with public
sector modernization projects within the Bank, provided timely and deft policy support,



1
  The coding of sector themes also seems somewhat arbitrary and in places at some variance with the
actual composition of funding or expressed project goals.



                                                   23
as well as additional budget resources reflecting her appreciation of supervision
requirements.

The team was proactive in identifying and attempting to find solutions to the challenges
which arose during implementation, most notably in ICT. Problems of duplicating
investments with little attention to questions of inter operability as well as unanticipated
problems surrounding communications infrastructure for the HRMIS and EDMS systems
(and which slowed the pace of procurement and disbursements) were identified within
two years of effectiveness (and one year after real project launch due to lagging
performance by the then counterpart project director). The supervision team brought in
high quality ICT expertise to join the team and assess ICT technical and policy
requirements. The resulting recommendations were followed and the government and
Bank made a concerted effort to better integrate the disparate ICT programs under the
Public Sector Modernization office in collaboration with technical units within
government. As a consequence the current architecture for E-government covering E-
procurement, HRMIS, and EDMS among others is in place with good connectivity to all
levels of government and geographic regions.

The willingness of the Bank to stay the course in the project, despite the downgrades in
ISR ratings and slow disbursements, was not based on inertia or lack of management
attention, but rather an informed view of the challenges and risks and confidence in the
teams (by Country and Sector management) to resolve the issues. As indicated above,
the 2007 QAG review of the project praised the dedication and professionalism of the
supervision team.

Supervision was Satisfactory despite a decision not to formally restructure the operation
and adjust the PDOs and/or performance indicators to evolving circumstances. There is a
fairly extensive paper trail of contacts with ECA Operational Services and Quality unit as
well as Country and Sector Management, but the consistent response was to update the
performance indicators and note for the record those no longer considered valid (e.g.
developing the regulatory framework for Inter-Community Units). The needed
adjustments were judged insufficient to warrant, under then practices, a full restructuring.
Moreover, country counterparts apparently opposed a restructuring as potentially opening
a variety of issues with the multitudinous beneficiary agencies with their own wish lists
of additional activities plus an unwelcome diversion of energy and focus. The
government insisted that restructuring the Local Government component by dropping the
focus on the Inter-community legislation (stalled in the parliament) would have sent an
unwanted political signal. Thus in total there were numerous reasons for not
restructuring the project although with hindsight and under current guidelines such a
restructuring should have been pursued. That said, a redesign of performance indicators
and tweaking of some sub-components would not likely have impacted much of the
project’s success in meeting or exceeding most targets and improving public sector
management efficiency.




                                            24
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank provided strong support in terms of preparation and supervision. The vision of
improved efficiency in public sector management was achieved in substance and
exceeded in many areas. The overly broad scope of the project, shortfalls in preparation,
and decision not to restructure the project do not undermine recognition of the project’s
Satisfactory outcome and the Bank’s critical contribution to that result. The Bank has
been a good and steady partner to Armenia in this area, as highlighted by the
government’s decision to obtain a follow up technical assistance operation (even in a
time of extremely strong balance of payments pressures which might have led to
decisions to seek faster disbursing resources). The project demonstrated the strengths of
the Bank—technical and country expertise, commitment to project goals and the partner,
and willingness to go extra lengths to ensure a successful project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Government Performance

The government performed as expected—with diligence, commitment, and adaptability.
After a slow start it moved to install strong project leadership which has remained in
place. Internal communication and coordination appears to have been fully adequate.
Procurement and financial management of the project were also satisfactory. The
counterparts interacted well with the Bank team and evolved into a partnership which
helped identify and correct emerging problems, refine project activities as required, and
facilitate overall public administration policy management within government. The
government made timely decisions to utilize the positive results of investments in
HRMIS and EDMS to expand beyond pilot phases and install them much more widely
within the broader public administration. Commitment to the reforms continued and
even intensified with changes in senior government leadership. The decision to drop the
development of a public landline connection to the regions and instead to rent the
capacity on an existing private sector WAN freed the project resources for other purposes.
It also demonstrated a pragmatic approach to technical issues as well as openness to
public/private collaboration. The government’s efforts to facilitate local government
capacity building through voluntary inter-community associations showed a commitment
to the goal of improved service delivery even if blocked on one means for promoting it.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Despite the broad array of beneficiary agencies and activities, implementation of the
project components and sub-components was rather uniformly satisfactory. The
Chamber of Control met all performance targets. The Civil Service Council and Armenia


                                           25
Academy for Public Administration met, and in the former’s case, exceeded project
targets. The Ministry of Economic Development successfully executed or oversaw
several sub-components. The unit charged with the project’s procurement and financial
management performed well. The Ministry of Finance’s Training Center was
significantly improved and internal auditing is spreading within the public administration.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The borrower implemented a multi-faceted and technically challenging institutional
strengthening program. Targets were largely met or exceeded and the substantive impact
in terms of modern information systems, improved human resource management, more
accurate and transparent data, as well as substantive improvements in several discrete
areas of government operations are real and sustainable. A broad inside the black box
capacity building operation has indeed improved the basis for Armenia’s policy
formulation and implementation capacity. Better HRM and document processes,
improved information inputs, and more transparency in and of themselves do not
guarantee better governance outcomes. But they do improve the tools for achieving them.

6. Lessons Learned

More narrowly focused operations limit the complexity of implementation for the
borrower and supervision breadth for the Bank. In this operation the broad extent of
the operation stretched the capacity of government to fully coordinate and execute. It
required a substantially increased supervision effort (and funding) by the Bank. While
largely successful in this case because of the commitment and capacities on both sides,
the question remains whether opportunities for deeper reforms clustered around fewer
components were missed. Plugging financing gaps or responding to client requests are
frequent factors in Bank operations, but sometimes at the cost of coherence and dispersed
efforts.

Greater candor in identifying the heavy ICT focus of the operation might have
alerted management and government to the need for enhanced project preparation.
Basic investments in ICT for HRMIS, EDMS, E-procurement are prosaic, technically
complex if not mysterious, and somewhat boring for most people (to be frank). They are
also unavoidable for institutional capacity building for any organization and government.
When done well and leveraged to promote changes in business practices, interactions
with customers (citizens), accountability, etc. the investments can serve as the basis for
revolutionary improvements in government operations and service delivery. However
there appeared to be a bias against reporting in detail the extent of planned ICT
investments in this operation. This in turn can obscure for management and government
any gaps in the quality of project preparation, the ICT strength of task teams, potential
interactions with other investments and projects, and serious issues of technology options,
cost trends, or risks. Undue focus on the expected benefits or output indicators or high
flown goals of integrated state modernization can mislead stakeholders away from a



                                            26
focus on critical decisions and investments in ICT. The decisions are ultimately made,
but often with delays and the need to educate officials on the true nature of the project.
In this project ICT preparation was less than adequate with real impacts on the speed,
scope, and cost of project implementation. While project objectives were met, they may
have been exceeded had additional time and money not been required during
implementation to retrofit parts of the ICT program. Ideally this work would have been
fully completed in preparation had management been fully cognizant of the predominant
ICT character of the project. A dearth of task team experts knowledgeable on ICT
technical, policy, and market evolution issues and their integration may be a Bank-wide
problem.

Vague and generally worded Project Development Objectives can hide underlying
conceptual problems, lack of clarity, and lead to monitoring and evaluation
difficulties during and after implementation. Improving the efficiency, effectiveness,
and transparency of government are worthy aspirations but cannot serve as the basis for
judging value for money or provide much of an operational guidepost for counterparts,
teams, or the Board. When accompanied by sloppily conceived and/or poorly written
outcome and intermediate results indicators the burden on client and Bank supervision
team is exponentially increased. This is especially ironic in operations which genuinely
seek to improve administrative processes, transparency, and better accountability to
citizens.

Restructuring should be the default position for mid-term reviews of complex
institutional capacity building operations. It appears in this case, as in many similar
projects, that mid-course corrections are inevitable. Hence there should be a presumption
on the part of teams and management that restructuring is required. This might help
overcome counterpart resistance by lowering any perceived negative public fallout of
restructuring, focus the attention of teams earlier on to the specific priorities for
adjustment, permit more flexibility in project design if restructuring is viewed as a more
acceptable and normal development, help client countries adapt projects to their evolving
needs rather than the reverse, and provide more transparency in operations to the Board.
Mid-term reviews themselves should be treated by sector and country management as
important events (rather than somewhat expanded supervision missions) requiring more
active participation of managers or outside donor funded evaluators if feasible. In the
case of this operation the mid-term review did lead to important course corrections, but
this reflected the strength and commitment of the task teams rather than an
institutionalized presumption of the need for change.

Achievements under this component met, or exceeded expectations. An electronic based
HRM system has been created, leading to a comprehensive system of electronic
personnel files, annual performance evaluation, and linked staff training planning.
Recruitment of staff is more competitive and transparent based on improved and more
agency relevant testing and attestation programs and training (both on site and long
distance) has been significantly upgraded. Where the project anticipated only piloting, in
several cases the advances have been rolled out to all agencies in the civil service system
which are largely civilian and excepting health workers and teachers. (As the various
sub-components below complemented each other, it can be in some instances somewhat
arbitrary to attribute specific contributions.)

1A: Draft Civil Service Development Strategy and complete Regulatory Framework:
Satisfactory

The stated objectives of this subcomponent were achieved. The 2010-2015 civil service
Development Strategy was submitted to senior government authorities for review, and
approved by Public Sector Reform Commission on August 4, 2010. It outlined a series
of measures, based in part on a careful review of global best practices, to enhance
transparency of the system, refine recruitment of qualified professionals, apply more
effective performance management, motivation and training programs, and establish a
flexible system for staffing also balanced from the gender and social justice perspective.
The strategy is the basis for reforms being funded in part by resources from the follow up
Public Sector Modernization II project. Moreover, the regulatory framework for the Civil
Service Law approved in 2001 was advanced with support from project funds and
materialized in form of the draft “umbrella? Law on Public Service, currently before the
National Assembly.

1B: Strengthen the Civil Service Council: Satisfactory

The subcomponent successfully strengthened the Civil Service Council which oversees
the HRM system. Specific project support to the Council included technical assistance
for the design of the integrated HRM software, input on revisions to training and


                                             31
attestation systems, competitive recruitment guidelines, and personnel evaluation and
rating methodologies. The project also funded ICT equipment including computer
hardware for the Council, communication links to the 45 ministries and other agencies in
the Civil Service System, as well as furniture to upgrade the working conditions within
Council premises.      Another critical aspect of HRM reform supported by the
subcomponent was funding for a communications program to explain the ongoing
reforms to public employees within government and other external stakeholders with the
aim reducing misinformation and the inevitable resistance to change. Information centers
were established or upgraded in most CSS agencies, supporting, among other things,
efforts to explain the nature of the civil service reforms to staff, promote more citizen
awareness of their rights, and provide information on the new EDMS system which had a
significant impact on public access to data and interaction with government agencies.
The sub-component also helped increase CSC oversight of the public information centers
to increase the uniformity (and accuracy) of information provided through agencies and
enhance the government’s broader transparency goals. The government believes the
improved ratings for public sector performance measured by citizen surveys reflects in
part efforts to improve communications and public understanding of government
operations.

1C: Human Resource Management and Assessment/Attestation systems established:
Highly Satisfactory

With regard to the design and establishment of modern HRM and attestation systems,
achievements under the subcomponent were highly satisfactory. Under the terms of
Government Decree Number 180 (April 30, 2009) work plans and performance
appraisals for all civil servants are automated through the EDMS and applied to each civil
servant. Guidelines were issued on the operation of the program detailing in part the
roles of immediate supervisors and civil servant in discussing performance effectiveness
and decisions on possible remedial actions including training, e-education, professional
literature to review, etc.

Supervisors are enjoined to meet individually with staff to review performance and
design a business related training program. These merit based human resource
management principles and systems have been rolled out to parallel public services. All
will be regulated under umbrella legislation on public service currently before the
legislature. Indeed the civil service administration is considered to be more advanced
than the policy planning system and procedures within the government as a whole. (An
IDF grant is currently supporting efforts to design an enhanced system of Government
results monitoring linked to agency business processes, work plans, and staff
performance assessments developed under the project.)

Assessment centers (with space and equipment) have been established or upgraded in 45
agency centers to conduct pre selection assessments as well as periodic tests of existing
staff capabilities. Officials note that the project helped develop transparent and
consistent methodologies to help guide individual agencies in designing and applying
their agency specific tests, facilitating Council oversight of merit hiring practices

1D: Improve Academy of Public Administration (AAPA) training program: Satisfactory
This sub-component successfully strengthened the Academy of Public Administration.
Credit resources funded a wide variety of technical assistance and goods. Support was
provided for curricula refinements, development of long-distance learning and its
modules, modernizing course presentations and methods, test booklets, training manuals
for teachers, classroom equipment including computers and furniture, and an upgraded
physical and electronic library. Officials underline the importance of intensive HRM
training provided to 200 plus personnel staff in line agencies (including the respective
chiefs of staff) as critical to improving the units’ ability to implement the new HRM
policies

                                               regional offices, and potentially major local
                                               governments as of January, 2012. It
                                               represents a critical step toward full E-

The component aimed to create the material base within government for an E-
procurement system as well as the procuring and installation of such a system. The
component’s aims were largely achieved, and represented a major effort within the
project, including the last extension of project closing date in order to complete an E-
procurement sub-component process. By the end of the project the core elements of an
E-procurement system had been designed, tested, and transferred to government. The E-
tendering system is currently under phased implementation and its use will be mandatory
within the government by January, 2012.2 The E-tendering system represents the heart of
an E-procurement system, involving in electronic gathering and posting of government
tenders for goods and services, transmission of information to registering suppliers, and
submission of bids (specifications and costs) all accessible on a government web-site.
The PAD and ISRs included other intermediate performance indicators relating to
improvements in public procurement (reduction in the average time for a procurement
exercise, reduction in the number of sole source contracts, and an increase in the number
of bidders). The last two targets were exceeded and the first partially achieved.
Achievement of the targets, however, was unrelated to project expenditures as the sub-
components were focused exclusively on E-procurement. Project management (both in
government and the Bank) exclusively targeted E-procurement activities so the
improvements in these procurement metrics are serendipitous to the project (although to
be fair the steady improvements in the indicators may have precluded any pro-activity by
government and Bank teams).

  The last ISR of February 28, 2011 indicates that there were no issues related to the counterpart funding
even during the economic recession (section titled Ratings), but because of the economic crisis the Ministry
of Finance was unable to provide the previously agreed co-financing (section titled E-procurement). While
these two statements may appear to be contradictory, they are not for the following reason. The ISR
reference is related to some extra co-financing that the government was willing to provide on top of the
already agreed-upon funding for the project. Extra funding was thought necessary at one stage during
implementation when the project allocation seemed insufficient for planned work. This situation stemmed
from the preparation, by a local firm, of TORs for a full e-procurement system, rather than the narrower e-
tendering component anticipated in the Government’s strategy. Not surprisingly the resulting proposals
exceeded anticipated costs. With the assistance of the Bank team and experienced international consultants
the TORs were reformulated and the subsequent rebidding led to lower prices, eliminating the need for the
additional co-financing from the Government. Thus, in terms of formally agreed upon counterpart funding,
there were no issues and the above-statement refers to this fact.

purchased and/or established. Central government, all regional governments, and most
local governments have been connected to the government’s ICT system (which also
carries HRM and EDMS data) which will serve as the material base for E-procurement.
ICT hardware has been secured for all procurement offices in those agencies and the
software for E-tendering designed, tested, and installed. Both government and the Bank
team expended considerable time, energy, and resources to achieve this progress, which
had to overcome issues of inadequate connectivity, duplicative initiatives, and lack of full
knowledge of technical issues which were not fully identified during project preparation.
Despite these challenges (which required the use of an external specialist hired by the
Bank supervision team to conduct a mid-term assessment and propose and action plan)
the material basis largely has been established for the entire E-procurement system.

2B: E-procurement software: Marginally Satisfactory

Progress under this subcomponent is marginally satisfactory, not because of lack of effort
and commitment but largely an over ambitious target. The core of an E-procurement
system is in place and E-tendering is coming online, although the goal of a fully
functional E-procurement system was not met by project closure. Such a system includes
functions beyond E-tendering, including regulated communications between the buyer
and suppliers, notification of bid decisions, publishing of bid award, contracting,
oversight of contract execution, etc. However, with E-tendering the country has a
process of transparent public auctioning for government procurement, representing the
core of E-procurement benefits. According to government officials the E-tendering
system was loaded onto servers by end May 2011, will be publicly launched in October
2011, and its use will be mandatory for all central government purchasing units, ten
regional offices, and potentially major local governments as of January, 2012. It is a
judgment call whether the project can claim a success in E-tendering since it was not
functioning at project closure—however the fact that in the intervening months important
steps have been taken to activate the system gives assurance (against the background of a
well-performing and serious public administration) that E-tendering should fairly be
judged a success. (The Bank could well have set a later project closing date to better
capture the E-tendering advances which were indeed anticipated when the final date was
chosen, but for other reasons chose not to do so). The fact that Armenia is carefully
rolling out this system in line with normal international practice, and initiatives are
continuing under the follow up PSMP II operation to complete the remaining, if less
critical, elements of the E-procurement system, give further weight to a basically positive
rating for this sub-component.

The stated objectives of this financially small component were largely achieved. The
project provided support to the CoC for the development and internal review of modern
performance audit standards covering 10 areas, as well as a code of ethics for CoC staff.
All have been approved by the Board of the CoC including its Chairman and are in effect.
An audit manual for financial compliance was similarly developed, approved and applied.
The audit standards and methodologies being applied by the CoC are in line with
international practices. The CoC is a member of international audit bodies, including
INTOSAI and EUROSAI, and Armenia participates in IIA. The anticipated equipment
and furniture purchases were made and the web site of CoC was upgraded and is now
available to the public at www.coc.am.

Performance in this component is judged satisfactory. The rating reflects a weighting of
achievements according to resources spent (and allocated in the PAD) and in some cases
inevitably subjective assessments due to the broad character of the component and some
less than clear objectives, indicators, and activities proposed in the PAD. The formal title
of the sub-component, for example, is “Improving Policy Formulation and
Implementation?, which might suggest substantive and measureable improvements in
specific government policies. In fact the component largely aimed at improving ICT,
training, and informational inputs which could lay the basis for improved policy and
implementation outputs and outcomes.

The successful creation of an Electronic Data Management System (sub-component 4A),
by digitizing government operations and moving toward a paperless administration, has
had (and is still having) a significant impact on government operations by improving its
speed, accuracy of information, and internal consistency, permitting widespread business
process reengineering and functional reforms in agencies, freeing government to focus
more on better informed policy deliberations and less on routine transaction processing
and monitoring, and fundamentally transforming citizen/government interaction
(electronic application for government services, tracking of government responses to
those requests, public oversight of budget expenditures, etc.). The EDMS has become
the backbone of Armenia’s e-government effort, underlying the reforms in human
resource management, E-procurement, and local government capacity building
supporting other components of the project, as well as other public administration
modernization efforts fully funded by the government and/or other donors. EDMS is
considered a flagship of the project and pillar for current and future public administration
reforms.

Complementary reforms within the component also aimed to strengthen the basis for
policy formulation and implementation through improvements in public communications
(sub-component 4D). With project support the government has created a well
functioning press operation at the center of government charged with overseeing a
modern and more sophisticated effort at communications with citizens. An interactive
web site (www.e-gov.am/interactive-budget) provides up to date information to the
public on government spending in the various agencies. The press center (with its
expanded communications capacity, regular briefings, information outlets, etc.) is in the
government’s view increasing the flow and quality of information from government,
enhancing the transparency of its operations, improving the quality of public debate on
national issues, and promoting increased citizen awareness of, and feedback on,
government operations. This is turn is judged (at least by government officials and local
Bank staff) as continuing a trend toward more transparent government and rebalancing a
legacy of one way communication flow and top down authoritarian public administration
inherited from the Soviets.

Two related sub-components (sub-components 4C and 4E) sought to improve policy
making and communications with external partners, as well as the technical capacity in
national standardization and certification to better meet the country’s obligations to the


                                            39
World Trade Organization (WTO). Rapidly addressing so called “technical barriers to
trade? relating to health and safety procedures and testing, etc. were considered a top
priority for the country and its strategy to better integrate into the global economy.
Admittedly somewhat far afield from a standard Bank public sector modernization effort
in building core financial and HRM systems and center of government capacities, the two
sub-components aimed at a substantive improvement in scientific capability to better
ensure food safety, adequate product standards especially for exports, the validity of
government certifications of technical standards, mobile laboratories to permit field
testing, as well as communicating such activities. According to government officials, the
investments in equipment, technical assistance to improve internal methods and capacity
in the laboratories, observational visits to advanced labs in other countries, etc. have led
to improved quality standards within the Ministry of Economic Development testing
program, which inevitably has led to better policy formulation. The improved technical
capability and standards of the laboratories has been confirmed by Bank funded
consultant specialists. Regarding the MEDT’s ability to communicate and coordinate
with external interlocutors a comprehensive web site has been developed and is
operational at http://www.sarm.am/en/about_sarm/history.

Performance in the sub-component directly related to the Ministry of Finance and
Economy (4B) is more problematic. There were significant achievements in the sub-sub
component related to the Ministry’s Training Center (building technical and material
capacity, development of training curriculum and programs) as well as in training
provided in specific areas such as internal audit and establishment of pilot internal audit
units in line agencies. Improved coordination between the autonomous internal revenue
and Customs organizations nominally under the Ministry is proving to require a longer
term effort which is being supported by Bank expertise outside the project.

4A: Introduce Document Management System: Highly Satisfactory

The stated objectives of this subcomponent were fully achieved. A sophisticated
Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) is now functioning throughout the
government, including in at 15 ministries and 10 regional administrations, and is being
installed in regulatory commissions. EDMS has significantly cut the time for internal
government communication (particularly with the regions) and is contributing to
improved efficiency and transparency. The impact of EDMS in terms of speeding
processes highlighted bottlenecks in other business procedures, prompting a series of
agency functional reviews to streamline processes further. The government has produced
a video demonstration of EDMS successes for use with citizens, donors, and others. It
notes the impact on government efficiency, citizen tracking of requests, reduction of
paperwork and corruption opportunities, increased use of electronic signatures, and
reduction of transmission from “hours and days to seconds? especially for regional
governments.

4B: Strengthen MOF Operations in Selected Areas: Marginally Satisfactory

Performance in this sub-component has been mixed leading to the marginally satisfactory
rating as essentially two of three sub-sub-components were implemented. The Ministry
of Finance’s internal audit capacity has been strengthened through a series of seminars
and observational travel to observe internal audit operations in the UK. Pilot internal
audit units established in three agencies of different characteristics (Ministry of
Education and Science, Avan community of the city of Yeravan, and Melikyan Music
College-rather than the anticipated two as called for in the PAD). In the event, the effort
at strengthening the Ministry’s internal audit mechanisms appears to have succeeded, as
least as far as the anticipated training, foreign observational visits, and creation of
internal audit units in three agencies is concerned. Bank staff confirm that the three
supervision services within the Ministry have been consolidated into one, as indicated in
the PAD. The entire process will take time to complete as internal audit, with its
emphasis on analyzing and refining control systems, risks assessments, and support to
agency heads to improve performance is a qualitatively different approach to the police
mind set and internal investigation activities associated with the legacy Soviet internal
control system. Armenia has been an active participant in regional networks (including
the Public Expenditure Management Peer Assisted Learning—PEMPAL—effort
supported by the Bank) seeking to foster a modern internal audit function.

The sub-sub-component aiming to strengthen the Ministry’s Budget and Financial
Management Training Center to provide training to financial units across government
agencies has been a success. Investments in ICT equipment, furniture, pedagogic
material, and technical assistance on training methodology and exposure to training
programs in other countries’ Finance Ministries has been considered a major success by
MOF officials.

Project officials have indicated that the government has merged the State Tax Service and
Customs Committee into the State Revenue Committee leading to the sharing of many
systems and integration of departments, improving collaboration between the two units.
However the extent of project support for training to strengthen revenue policy
development and coordination between internal revenue and Customs is unclear.

4C: Improved Policy Making in Certification and Standardization by MEDT: Satisfactory

The efforts under this sub-component should be considered in parallel with the related
investments under sub-component 4E. An improved quality of scientific and technical
data, better analysis capacity, increased confidence by government officials in the quality
of these assessments led not only to more informed decision making but also improved
compliance given greater domestic and foreign stakeholder recognition of the scientific
base of the various policy announcements or adjustments. Officials note, for example,
that the Ministry’s efforts to improve food testing, alcohol standards, and assessments of
the character of tobacco products sold in the country have benefited from the project
funded investments, leading to better policies in terms of more timely reaction to
potential threats, better ability to policy established standards, and met export quality

interlocutors a web site has been developed and is functioning at
http://www.sarm.am/en/about_sarm/history.

4D: Improved Communications Outreach: Satisfactory

Performance under this subcomponent is satisfactory. With regard to this Press Center,
the project objectives have been fully met. The Government Press Center, which existed
before the project, has been significantly upgraded in terms of equipment (computers,
communication links internally within the government and to media outlets, physical
capacity to conduct briefings and information sessions, ability to broadcast cabinet
meetings as warranted, etc.). The government’s website has been upgraded. The Center
is the central locale for press briefings, the main source of written and electronic
government information, and the heart of the public communications network also
supported by the project in line agencies. Government officials have reported that the
existence of the Press Center and increased citizen/press expectations regarding
transparency in public activities has impacted policy decision making positively in terms
of underscoring the need for clearer explanations of initiatives, marshalling of evidence,
anticipation of press questions and alternative viewpoints, etc. The Center facilitates the
role of the media as well as citizens in providing feedback (and oversight) to government.

4E: Improved Certification and Standardization Functions in MEDT: Satisfactory

The project’s funding of upgraded laboratories, equipment, operating procedures,
technical assistance in a wide variety of substantive areas, benchmarking against similar
offices in more developed countries provided under 4E has led to improved basis for
certification and standardization by MEDT and its policy making in the view of Ministry
officials. A Bank funded specialist visited Armenia and reported in 2007 that, among
other things, technical proposals and equipment offered from successful bidders were
sound and acceptable, new and remodeled laboratories visited were acceptable for their
intended uses (clean, well lighted, and maintained), staff appears to have basic technical
competence, answers from senior officials were satisfactory in general, etc. The report
noted areas for further work by counterparts. No additional independent reporting was
available beyond this date.

A major initiative in Armenia has been to devolve responsibilities and taxing authority to
local governments which are closer to citizens and better able in the long run to manage
local service delivery. At the time of appraisal, and in response to the client’s request,
this component was included to help support the decentralization program. Progress
under several areas has been notable. For example, data on property and land taxes have
been transferred to nearly all local communities, pilot programs have been initiated to
improve human resource management at the local administrative level (to in part better
manage the increased responsibilities for tax collection), and an integrated, computer
based management information system has been designed and installed in over 200
municipalities, including the largest 60. In short, the long term process of institutional
capacity building in municipalities is well launched, with support of the project. One


                                            43
sub-component has not advanced as parliament has not approved legislation mandating
involuntary Inter-Community Units (designed to compel consolidated services in
neighboring small municipalities) so work on the necessary regulatory framework could
not commence. Nevertheless there appears to be a voluntary process of consolidation
underway, which is benefiting from the other investments within this component.

5A: Legal Framework for Inter-Community Unions: Unsatisfactory

The objectives of this subcomponent were not achieved as the National Assembly has not
approved draft legislation permitting the involuntary grouping of municipalities into
Inter-Community Units (ICUs). Therefore there was no scope for assisting in the drafting
of subordinate legal and regulatory frameworks. No funds from the project have been
expended on this subcomponent, and its inclusion in the project prior to approval of
legislation obviously was premature. The subcomponent and related intermediate results
indicator were not formally canceled due to the government’s hope that it would secure
legislative approval. In the event the government is awaiting completion of an evaluation
of international experiences by the Ministry of Territorial Administration (MoTA) to
adjust the legislation as appropriate for another attempt at legislative action. It is
important to note that the non-performance under this sub-component is due to
circumstances largely outside the control of the government and was noted in ISRs.

5B: Building local capacity for property and land tax collection: Satisfactory

By the end of the project 100% of property and land tax data (cadastre) had been
transferred to local authorities and local governments had been supplied with a budget
module to their management information system (see below) to incorporate this data.

5C: Strengthening HR management at the local level: Satisfactory

A major step toward improving HR management at the local level was the deployment of
an HRM sub-system within the new Municipal Management Information System to the
bulk of Armenia’s local governments. The sub-system provides processing of various
kinds of data on municipalities’ personnel structure, individual employees information,
their trainings, certifications, awards, disciplinary action, annual and sick leaves, business
trips, hours worked, etc. The project funded a consultancy to assist local authorities in
the implementation of the municipal services law and related training of officials.

5D: Management information system at the local level: Satisfactory

The objectives of this component were fully met with the deployment of a municipal
management information system (MMIS) to 225 municipalities, including the largest 60.
It is managed at the national level, with technical support, help desk, and training to local
staff. The web based system complements an Information System for Civil Registry
Offices. Training has been provided to over 1300 municipal staff on the operation of the
systems. The MMIS itself covers the majority of the functions of municipal governments,
improving efficiency, as well as transparency and effectiveness. The functions integrated



                                             44
within MMIS include managements of municipal budgets, assets, human resources,
licensing, local taxes, document flow, registries of businesses and citizens, catalogue of
service procedures, calendars of senior government officials, events calendar,
demographic statistics, citizen opinion polling, citizen application and complaint hotlines,
general municipal contact and rules information, and internet forums.



Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Not Applicable. As a technical assistance operation no quantitative economic and
financial analyses were prepared at appraisal. Rather it was asserted that improvements
in ICT systems, E-procurement, and electronic data management would lead to savings
offsetting at least in part the costs of the project. The anticipated improvement in civil
service performance could be offset by higher salaries. In the event it would appear
reasonable to assert that these assumptions were broadly correct and that the efficiency
and effectiveness of public management has improved with positive implications as a
whole for government private sector performance.

Component 1. Strengthening Civil Service Management

The activities under Component 1 supported the development of a merit-based civil
service system. The main emphasis was on the development of systems and capacities to
ensure a consistent application of merit-based recruitment and promotion procedures
across all institutions under the civil service law.

Under Component 1A support was to be provided for drafting of a Civil Service
Development Strategy and the completion of remaining elements of the Regulatory
Framework for civil service management.
The Civil Service Development Strategy drafted under this subcomponent was endorsed
and approved by the Public Sector Reform Commission. The Strategy sets out a number
of actions that will make the system more transparent and enable using an effective
performance management, justification and training system.

Subcomponent 1B aimed to strengthen the Civil Service Council’s ability to improve its
testing and attestation procedures for furthering the introduction of a merit-based
recruitment and promotion system, equipping the Council’s offices as well as establishing
a Public Information Center.

The following activities were implemented under this Subcomponent:

   1. Competition and attestation tests and exam paper questions were developed for
      the Civil Service Council and all relevant civil service bodies enabling a more
      effective specialist selection and evaluation. This is found by reviewing the
      ratings of effectiveness of competition and attestation test exams in civil service
      presented below:

The ratings for the effectiveness of attestation tests in the Figure 2 show a 13.6 %
increase in the number of people having expressed a positive opinion during the last two
years.

   2. Computer hardware, printing house equipment and accessories, software, air
      conditioners, water pipes, electrical and technical appliances and furniture were
      purchased for and installed at the Civil Service Council to ensure a proper work
      environment.

Component 1C was to support the introduction of cross-ministerial human resource
management and assessment/attestation systems. The following activities were
implemented under this subcomponent:

   1. A human resources management information system (HRMIS) was developed
      enabling the CSC to monitor the regular use of merit-based procedures and
      contributed to rewarding professional performance through promotion. HRMIS
      has been installed in all relevant civil service bodies, and training has been
      provided to system users. Information on civil service competitions, attestations,
      trainings and their results is entered into the system and administrative relations
      with the CSC are regulated through it.

   2. IT equipment (servers, computers, scanners, uninterrupted power supply devices,
      printers, network switches and cables) were purchased for RA government bodies
      for operating the HRMIS.

Component 1D was to assist the Public Administration Academy as the key institution
providing civil service training in improving the quality of training programs, as the main
provider of civil service; training at the central, as well as regional levels was a pressing
need of the civil service. The ability of the Academy to develop and implement training
programs had to be strengthened, and the Academy’s training facilities upgraded.

The following activities were implemented under this subcomponent:

   1. Training programs and 24 training modules were developed for the RA Public
      Administration Academy and training of trainers was conducted aimed at
      developing wider professional development opportunities for civil servants.

   2. Computer and miscellaneous electrical equipment, furniture, building materials
      and around 700 books were purchased for the Academy.

   3. A manual guideline on the Public Service was developed for the Public
       Administration Academy enabling both the students of the Academy and all
       employees and the population to become familiar with the key provisions of the
       law in a more accessible manner and check their knowledge in the area of public
       administration.



                                             49
   4. A questionnaire was prepared for the Public Administration Academy enabling to
       check student knowledge during admission to the Academy, moving to the next
       year and final exams.

Component 2. Introducing E-procurement

Component 2 was to help to establish IT infrastructure for e-procurement and establish
the basis for the development of a full-fledged e-procurement system.

Under this component it was planned to reduce the use of non-competitive procedures,
ensure satisfaction of the business community with the public procurement process and
increased fairness of the process, and make updated information available to all
participants of public procurement on offered and awarded contracts.

 Off-the-shelf software was developed/ introduced for an electronic public procurement
system (e-tendering), the use of which would enable improving the management of a
significant share of annual public expenditure and make the procurement process more
transparent. As part of the assignment training was provided to final users and technical,
operational and user’s manuals were prepared.

Component 3. Strengthening the Chamber of Control

Component 3 provided focused support to the Chamber of Control (CoC) as part of
which external audit manuals and standards were developed in line with INTOSAI
standards and EUROSAI guidelines to enhance its ability to provide professional audit
reports to the National Assembly and related training was provided.

Under this Component computer hardware and office equipment were purchased for the
Chamber of Control, the website was upgraded; the annual report of the National
Assembly was printed, published (in Armenian and English), disseminated, etc.

Component 4. Improving Policy Formulation and Implementation through
Capacity Building

Support provided under Component 4 was to assist the Government in addressing
weaknesses in policy formulation and implementation process in the central state
administration, in particular through the development of electronic document
management systems and systems for tracking policy implementation.

In addition, assistance was to be provided for other model activities in certain state
administration institutions aimed at increasing accountability and transparency and
meeting priority capacity building needs in selected institutions.

Subcomponent 4A was to support the improvement of policy process management in
core state administration, in particular the document flow.




                                           50
The following activities were implemented under this subcomponent:

   1. The policy implementation and monitoring process was diagnosed aiming to
      develop and strengthen policy formulation, implementation and monitoring
      capacities of the RA Government in three pilot bodies (the Office of the
      Government, the Ministries of Finance and Economy).

   2. Based on initial analysis of policy implementation the subcomponent was to
      support development of a wider governance system and increased implementation
      efficiency. As a result, the Mulberry electronic document management system
      was developed and piloted in the Government Office, ministries of Finance and
      Economy. After being tested and getting successful results from them pilot, the
      system was rolled out to other government bodies reaching the current number of
      30. This system enables tracking decision making processes, implemented
      policies in these bodies, timely and efficient implementation of Prime Minister’s
      and Cabinet decrees by these bodies and making administrative documents and
      information available to the public.

   3. To ensure the efficient operation of the Mulberry electronic document
      management system a large number of IT equipment were purchased and installed
      and training was provided to the users of the system.

   4. A security audit of the Government electronic management system was conducted
      to verify the conformity of the Mulberry electronic document management system
      to international security standards.

   5. An electronic system for accepting license applications to the RA government
      was introduced to enable natural and legal persons to send electronic applications
      for being issued any license existing in RA.

The activities under Subcomponent 4B were to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of

Management Training Center through training and upgrading equipment.

The following activities were implemented as part of this sub-component:

   1. Equipment for heating, anti-fire, ventilation and cooling systems were supplied to
      the Training Center state non-commercial organization, IT equipment and office
      furniture were purchased and simultaneous translation system was installed and
      tested. Strengthening of the Training Center’s capacities was aimed at providing
      efficient training to all budget department staff in the public sector.

   2. Training courses on program budgeting, budget formulation, accounting standards
      and internal audit were organized.




                                          51
Subcomponent 4C was to support the Ministry of Economy in enhancing its policy
making capacity in the areas of standardization, certification and metrology and
strengthen the capacity to communicate with external interlocutors, domestic and
international, public and non-governmental.

The following activities were implemented under this Component:

   1. In the area of RA standardization and conformity assessment, technical legislation
      was diagnosed. Accordingly, a strategy was developed for harmonization of
      Armenia’s standardization system with international and European systems,
      where national standardization priorities were reviewed and substantiated.

   2. Under the support planned for the Training Center of the National Institute of
      Standards, training was provided on standardization and certification of
      conformity of quality management systems for fuels and lubricants, perfumes and
      cosmetic products, household electrical appliances, means of telecommunications,
      building items and structures and food stuffs.

   3. Guidelines-manuals on standards and certification were developed and published.

   4. Laboratory equipment was purchased for the National Institutes of Standards and
      Metrology reducing work-time and human interference. These devices are used to
      test physical and chemical indicators of foodstuffs for detecting the content and
      quantity of toxic metals.

       The purchased mobile laboratory enables checking the quality of petroleum
       products and detecting impermissible deviations.

The surveys conducted showed that 63.1% of businesses were well aware of the required
laboratory tests for certification of goods produced/imported/exported by them and
62.3% were satisfied with the time the certification process took for goods.

Progress was also made in the area of standardization; in particular 56.3% of businesses
having applied for registration of a standard in 2009-2010 and 57.4 % of respondents
indicated that were satisfied with the length of time of the standardization process.

   1. The Website of the Ministry of Economy was designed and presented providing
      access to the Ministry related information, increasing the level of public
      awareness and ensuring the linkage between the society and other bodies.

   2. Consultancy was provided to the Ministry of Economy for introduction and
      implementation of the performance appraisal system where the international
      experience was reviewed and recommendations were made on the introduction of
      the system.




                                          52
Subcomponent 4D focused on strengthening the capacity of the Office of the
Government in external communications and outreach.

The following activities were implemented under this subcomponent:

   1. Armenia’s Government Press Center was renovated and equipped with modern
      equipment resulting in a more effective cooperation between the Government and
      reporters. Office furniture, satellite connection, acoustic and simultaneous
      translation equipment, speakers, microphones, cameras, digital cameras and IT
      and other video editing equipment were purchased.
   2. Electronic signature devices and network equipment were purchased for the
      Government information maintenance center.
   3. The Government website was redesigned posting information on state budget
      aimed at making the budget expenditure as transparent and as monitorable as
      possible for the public.


Component 5. Developing Capacity in Local Governments

The project activities under Component 5 aimed at improving local self-government
capacity to deliver public services.

Component 5A was to support the development of the legal and policy framework for
intercommunity unions (ICUs) aimed at eliminating the negative impact of administrative
fragmentation. The Government sees the voluntary formation of ICUs as the best way to
address administrative fragmentation in view of the Communities’ weak capacity and
resource base.

Given that the Parliament delayed the passage of legislation on formation of
Intercommunity Unions, it was agreed to substitute the consulting services category
under this subcomponent for goods and buy equipment for the already existing ICUs.

Under this subcomponent IT equipment (servers, computers, printers and network
equipment) were supplied for ICUs.

Subcomponent 5B was to finance local and international assistance and trainers to
advise the Ministry of Territorial Administration on strengthening local tax
administration capacity. Local capacity building for efficient revenue collection is a
priority in improving local governments. The law also empowered the local governments
to collect additional revenue including the right to collect the property tax and the land
tax. The property and land tax collection is quite problematic, in particular in rural areas.

Under this subcomponent the necessary legal changes were made, additional regulations
passed and an action plan was introduced for transferring the property tax and land tax
database; the database was fully transferred to communities.



                                             53
Subcomponent 5C was to help design and implement a human resources management
system for the municipal service.

The following activities were implemented under this subcomponent.

   1. Armenia’s legislation on Municipal Service was improved through amendments
      and supplements to the RA Law on Municipal Service and secondary legislation
      implied by the latter. As a result, the municipal service system was brought into
      conformity with the situation driven by legal processes underway in the Republic
      of Armenia.

   2. The secondary legislation on civil status registry of the Republic of Armenia was
      drafted; namely birth, marriage, adoption, determining paternity, divorce, death as
      well as new draft legal acts on changing, amending and correcting civil status
      records.

Subcomponent 5D focused on strengthening municipal data management to improve
local governance. It was to be carried out through the development and deployment of an
integrated computer-based management information system and by the strengthening of
the national center for technical support and systems development in Charentsavan.

The following activities were implemented under this subcomponent:

   1. Government information system was developed and informed the activities
      carried out in local governments. They have become transparent and efficient.
      Introduction of the system enabled recording and managing registries of land,
      buildings, means of transport, natural and legal entities.

       The surveys conducted revealed that community offices had sufficient ability to
       manage the population registry (80.6%) and carry out administrative work in the
       community (100%).

   2. IT equipment (servers, computers, printers, scanners, network equipment),
      licenses, antivirus software were purchased for local government civil status
      registry offices intended for ensuring the efficient operation of the local
      government management information system.

   3. Computer equipment (servers, computers, printers and network equipment),
      software and office furniture were purchased for and installed in the National
      Center in Charentsavan.

   Due to the activities implemented under Component 5 information on the services
   provided by the community became more accessible and the population’s satisfaction
   with delivered services increased as illustrated in the tables below:

                  Component 6. Project Management, Surveys and Communication

                  Component 6 was to support project management, surveys and outreach activities since
                  monitoring all achieved results and impact was an essential element to project
                  management.

                  Funds provided under subcomponent 6A were aimed at funding the Project Manager and
                  support staff and covering the FFPMC expenses, which took care of the financial
                  management and procurement functions for the project.

                  Surveys of the population, the business community and relevant government bodies were
                  carried out under Subcomponent 6B aimed at collecting data on the key project
                  indicators and receiving feedback from beneficiaries on implemented reforms.

                  Public awareness campaign of the project was conducted to raise the awareness on the
                  project among the public and beneficiaries.
