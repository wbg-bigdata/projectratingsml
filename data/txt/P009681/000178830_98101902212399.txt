INTERNATIONAL DEVELO P1ENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE   PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
BIHAR AGRICUITURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an ainoutt equivalent to US$32 million for the Bihar
Agricultural Credit Project. The credit would support a three-year lending
program in the State, for investment in minor irrigation tubewells and pump-
sets. About 50,000 farmers would benefit from investment loans under the
project; the selling of excess irrigation water produced from these invest-
ments would help approximately 50,000 additional small farmers.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          An economic report, riEconomic Situation and Prospects of India'"
(156-IN dated MEay 8, 1973) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 2h, 1973 (R73-113). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.          Tne performance of the Indian economy since the inception of
economic development planning in 1950/51 can best be described as mixed.
Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on others:
the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial and agri-
cultural irrigation investment schemes have been highly successPal, but others
have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full
capacity; in some parts of the country there have been periods of rapid growth
and change, but in others there has been stagnation and possibly even dec ine.
4.          The average rate of gowth of national income has on]y been about
3 percent per annum and with population growing at an average rate of about
2.2 percent per annum, gains in per capita income have averaged somewlhat less
than 1 percent per annum.  Although the distribution of income in India is
relatively even by comparison with many other countries, such a low rate of
economic growth has meant there has been little, if any, increase in the
living standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural popyulation.  The
Government has become increasingly concerned about the plight of the lower
income strata which, conservatively measured, consist of some 200 million
people with income less than US$60 rcr head per y-ear, ane J  _ ,__
proposals for the Fifth Five-Year Pnan <1927275-1,?7/79) is   arhiinb to
intensifIy its efforts to alleviate their poverty.



5.          The structure of the economy has also been slow to change.
Agriculture remains the dorminant sector, accounting for soTLe 40 percent
of national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49 percent
twenty years earlier. Despite the emphasis accorded to the industrial
sector, particularly in the period commencing in the mid-1950s, the share
of output contributed by the sector  has increased only marginally over
the period, and since the late 1960s has remained approximately constant
at a level of 23 percent.  The principal change has been the increased
contribution of the tertiary sector from some 27 percent In 1951 to 31 percent
in 1971.
6.          Undoubtedly, India's nost irp-essiLve .achievement has been the
doubling of the average growth rate of prod1uctivit` in food=ra- n production.
But it is proving difficult to maintain the momentum of this performance, as
evidenced by the drought-induced decline in production in 1972. Much remains
to be done to consolidate the production growth in the wheat belt and to extend
it both to other areas and to other foodgrain crops, most particularly rice.
Other crops have, in most cases, shown a slow but fairly constant rate of in-
crease in production.  Irrigation has played a major part in agricultural
growth in recent years and, by reducing dependence on the monsoon, has reducel-
variabillty in Derformance.  At present only about half the potentially irri-
gable area has been developed. Fuller utilization of the existing irrigation
system and the extension of the irrigated area are, therefore, matters of the
highest priority in order to meet India's rising food needs and to protect the
economy against the vagaries of the weather. Al.so of importance is the need to
ra: .se outtptl from non-irrigated land whicrh acco-unts. .'or about 50 percent of the
cultivable area, through higher yielding technology and investment in dry land
farming from which substantial benefits reirain to be realised.  The widespread
drought in 1972/73 and 1he neavry cost Lll i4ui.ian al. if:!an(:lia  terms nas again
served to emphasise the precariousness of hndia'- .Lsodgrainsupply situation.
7.          Perfornance of the industrial sector has been variable and, given
the emphasis placed in the past on industrialization, disappointing.  Industrial
growth averaged about 7 percent a year in the 1 950s, rose to 9 percent in the
first half of the 1960s, and then declined to around 3 percent through the
early 1970s.  The stagnation of recent years is especially worrying. To a largn
extent it was precipitated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the
accompanying general recession.  But it has also been the result of mrany other
factors: the relatively limited opportunities for further import substitution
7hich had from the outset been at the centre of the industrialization strateQy;
the recurring bottlenecks in the production of a numnber of key intermediate
goods such as steel and cement; shortages of imported raw materials; and cumber-
some administrative procedures.  The improvement in output whlich occurred in
1972, combined with recent measures to simplifyT administrative controls, shoul'd
lead to better realization, of India's industrial capacity and a higher rate of
reinvestment.



- 3 -
8.          Domestic savings have fluctuated in the region of 8-10 percent
of net domestic product for the past decade. This has been far short of
India's resource needs and, even with substantial flows of external assist-
ance, has not permitted the investment rate to rise above 13 percent except
in a few years. More recently, as a result of the recession and a decline
in foreign assistance, the investment rate has been only about 9-11 percent.
In particular there has been a deterioration in the savings performance of
the public sector, largely due to a sharp fall in the Central Government's
current account savings despite a near doubling of tax revenues in the 1960s.
A disturbing feature of the budgetary situation has been the expansion of
the States' expenditures far in excess of the growth of their owr. revenues.
The Central Government has had to meet the resulting deficits through budget
transfers.  This, combined with several other factors (the military events
and refugee relief of 1971 and 1972, and a sharp drop in net foreign aid in
1972), has forced a massive rise in total deficit financing. The inflationary
consequences of this and those arising from the food and otSher comrmodity
shortages have been serious, with wholesale prices currently rising at an
annual rate of nearly 20 percent.  The budget for 1 73/74 inltroduced measures
to help curb inflation, while the Reserve Banrk of India has also been inter-
vening to control the expansion of money supply.
9.          Ever since the balance of payments crisis of 1956/7 7 a shortage
of foreign exchange has constituted one of the most crit:ical constraints to
the development of the economy.  This has manifested itself in various ways.
The authorities have acted with caution in their foreign exchange management
and have been left with little flexibility or margin to accommodate special
and emergency needs.  Exchange control and also, in large part, the import
and industrial licensing procedures have been the result of the acute foreig
exchange situation.  Even though the external sector is small in relation to
the national economy, the continuing shortage of foreign exchange together aritii
these controls have retarded and distorted investment and the rate of utiliza-
tion of existing capacity. This is most clearly seen in the stagnation of
non-food imports: for instance, despite expansion of the economy at some 3
percent per annum, even at current prices the present level of non-food imports
is approximately the same as that of the early 1960s, and there has been a
continuing shortage of imported raw materials, spares, and components. While
exports have expanded reasonably steadily, they have never achieved a sastained
growth sufficient to have an appreciable effect on the foreign exchange problem.
Traditional items such as jute, tea, cashew, and textiles, which are all bDeset
with supply difficulties at home and high competitive or shrinking markets abroa,K
still constitute the most important component of exports.   And despite a rapid
expansion in the 1960s, non-traditional items such as engineering goods and
chemicals still form only a small share of total exports. It i    :i;n -his area '
non-traditional items that there is a need for more aggressi-ve e-:Port poiacia
of which the Central Government has been increasingly aware.



10.         Extenlal assistance has played an important role in supplenenting
India's domestic resources for development, especially from the late 1950s
to the end of the 1960s. But, with rising debt service payments and more
recently a decline in gross aid, the inportance of net aid has diminished,
both as a supplement to domestic investment and as a means of financing
imports. Nevertheless, because of a generally low growth rate of exports
and because of a dearth of overall resources relative to even basic develop-
ment needs, aid remains important.
11.         As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external
public debt stood at US$8.5 billion on March 31, 1972.   Annual debt serv-;ce
payments are currently running at a level of around US$725 million. This
compares with a level of about US$200 million in the mid-1960s. In order to
mitigate the negative effects on growtlh of such a high burden of ex-ternal
debt and to forestall any danger of a foreign exchange crisis, the India
ConsortiuT from 1968/69 onwards has extended debt relief to India.    In addi-
tion, starting in the .idd-1 060s there has been somre sof tening in the financial.
terms of official assistance offered by several major creditors, and also an
increase in the proportion of pryogram vs. project aid.  These changes are
welcome in helping India to meet her more urgent import requirements, but
they are still modest in relation to the country's basic needs.
12.         The Govereunment is at present preparingr th-te detailed sectoral
pro-rams to be implementecd in the Fifth Plan.  It is also re-examining t.ne
overall internal and external resources position as well as devisi_ncg the
appropriate policies to achieve the Plan objectives.   A first draft of the
complete Plan is expected to be completed later this year, with the finral
dociunent. being publisheed in M1arch 197'.

15.         The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects the
importance of agriculture and the investment priorities of the Government.
Agric-altural projects will continue to form an important part of the Bank
Group's program of assistance to India. Projects designed to foster agricul-
tural production through the provision of essential inputs, such as credit
for on-farm investment, command area development of existing irrigation
projects, domestic fertilizer production, form an important aspect of the
program for this fiscal year. Lending for investment in processing facilities
for special crops and for livestock development would contribute to diversi-
fication of agricultural production.  Special emphasis is being given to
projects benefiting small farmers, particularly in the east where there has
been a relatively small share of IDA lending; examples are the special pro-
visions for small farmers in IDA-supported agricultural credit schemes, a
rural development project in West Bengal, and a project being developed in
support of the Government's drought prone areas program.
16.         The industrial sector and investments in infrastructure development
have received substantial amounts of Bank Group capital, essentially to cover
the substantial foreign exchange expenditures associated with investments in
these fields. Apart from IDA credits for a number of fertilizer projects,
lending to industry in recent years has been principally tlLrough the medium
of development finance corporations. In addition, industrial production has
had the benefit of a series of industrial imports credits. Assistance to
infrastructure development has been concentrated in the power, teleecommunica-
tions and railways sectors. Credits in support of the Government's power
transmission and telecommunications program were extended last year, a rural
electrification project and a 12th railway project   are  currently under
consideration.   India's large cities, particularly Bombay   and  Calcutta,
require major investments in public services to keep up with the growth of their
population;  Bombay's water supply and sewerage expansion program is being
assisted through a credit extended last year, a project in support of Calcutta
urban development program was approved recently and further water supply and
sanitation projects in Madras and Uttar Pradesh are under consideration.
17.         The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external resources
in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Banmk economic
reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium.   Having regard to
the fact that emphasis on lending for such critical sectors as'agricultural
or urban development is inevitably leading to a relatively slow transfer of
IDA resources, the Bank seeks to balance its lending program with more ranpci.
disbursing projects, such as telecommunications and railways projects and
industrial program credits. Because of the capacity of the capital goods
sector of the Indian economy, India imports relatively few capital goods.   As
in the case of the credit now proposed, the Association should, therefore, De



prepared to help finance the local cost of high priority projects in support
of India's efforts to secure trarsfer of resources adequate to sustain a
satisfacto-ry rate of growth.
1bs, 3      The Bank Group now contributes sign'ficantly to the provision of
external capital to India.  In the recent years 1966/67-1 968/69 t:he Bank, Group
accounted for some 17 percent of total new commitments of external capital; in
the three years 1970/71-1972/73, this had risen to ')I percent.  Because of
disbursement lags, however, the Bank Group's share in total disbursements has
risen more slowly from 14 percent in 1966/67-1968/69 to 16 percent in 1970/71-
1972/73, but it is expected to accelerate in the future.  As of MIarch 31, 1972,
the Bank Group's share in outstanding external public debt was 19 percent.  If
current trends continue as expected, the Bank Group's share in the total amount
outstanding will rise to approximately 30 percent by 1 979.  Debt service pay-
ments to the Bank Group dur-ing the year endedI March 31, 1972 were 13 percent
of total debt service payments made by India. By 1979, the Bank Group's share
of total debt service is expected to be around 16 percent.
PART III - AGRICULTURE INT TIiDIA
19.         The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the Indian economy,
accounting for about hO percent of India's GNP and employ-ing 70 percent of the
labor force, and the rate of expansion in agricultural output required to meet
demand for farn products during this decade is estimated at slightly more than
5 percent per annum.  Accordingly, the Government is giving great emphasis to
agricultural development and allocating substantial resources to agricultural
investments.  Roughly 24 percent of total development expenditures by the public
sector has been devoted to agriculture in recent years.  Priority has been given
to accelerating the spread of modern agricultural technology through increasing
thle availability of improved inputs such as high-yielding varieties of seeds,
fertilizers, agricultural credit and irrigation.
20.         Last year's severe drought underlines India's need to exploit as
fuhly an.d as quickly as possible its irrigation potential, not only as an
insurance against fhture monsoon failures but to achieve the marketable surpluses
which only greatly intensified cropping based on the irrigation of farm land
can provide. An increased supply of credit for farm investment, and particularly
for rndror irrigation from groundwater supplies, which thlis project is designed
to supply, is essential to continued growrth of production.  The project wiould
also contribute to a better regional balance of a-ricultural Zrowtll by spreading
ie new agricultural technology into the relatively neg',ected and depressed rarali
Rreas of ''ihar.



21.         The Reserve Bank of India has estimated that credit institutions
will require US$2,000 million equivalent for long-term agricultural lending
during the Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74) or ar. annual average of US$,hO00 million
equivalent. Provisional figures show the long-term credit supplY foor 1970-71,
the latest year for which data are available to have been about U7S$210 million
equivalent. There thus remains a substantial agricultural credit gap.
22.         Since 1970 the Associationr has supported agricultural credit
projects in India through nine lending operations in the States of Gujarat,
Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, i4lysore, `Aaharashtra, Mdadhya
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.  The proposed credit wol.ld bring the Associaticon'-
total lending for agricultural credit to US$320 million. The credits are fairl-j
similar in structure; they are designed to provide medium and iong-term credit
to farmers for on-fanr investments and contain special provisions for lerdirng
to snall farmers.  Decause of the wide geographical spread which has been achi.e-.;f-.-
project components hiave varied to accomimodate differing circLuastances and neecl_
from State to State and have included tractors, harvesters, various types of
minor irrigation, land-level'ing, project ecluipment Land teclhnafical assistan-ce.
In all these credits the lending charnnel and main supervisory agency is the
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC). Terms and conditions of on-lendEin
and standards of performlance and viability to be achieved by lending institutic<-
are similar; the technical criteria to be applied to grorundwater exploitation
have var-ed depending on the availability of surply at. p-rOrosed levels of u-t-ili`
zation.
23.         Disbursements under on-going projects wErere at thle start -lower t`han
expected. It took longer than expected to put into effect the institutional
reforms whiich form part of the projects, specifically, to carry out changes iln
lending criteria and lending terrms introduced with the credits and to strengten
the staff responsible for assessing groundwater availabil-ties. These constraint.s;
have now been overcome and the rate of disbursement is acceleratirg.  There LtA'
are  problems connected with the import of tractors under si-- of the  agnicuiturA
credit projects. Procurement of tractors has been held uD by the Grovernment
because of uncertainty over tractor demand which was dampened byr significant
price increases. Earlier estimates of tractor import requirements are consecuent-L
no longer accurate and the proportion of total deLmnd which could be met out of
domestic production has increased. The Government has therefore asked the .Assoeiut
tion to consider financing of both imported and domestic tractors under o;r  r
as well as reallocating some of the tractor fzunds to minor irrigation.  I e0pec-l tc
bring a proposal on this matter to the Fxecutive Directors in the near future.
PART IV - TTE PRLOJECT
24,         The proposed project will finance minor irrigation (diesel and
electric powered tubewells and diesel punpsets for low lift pumping from
surface water) in the Tirhut Division of Northwestern Bihar. The project
was appraised in February/4farch 1973. Negotiations were held in Nits,h1ngton dUnirr'



-8-
September, 1973. The Borrower was represented by Mr. G. Venkataramanan,
Deputy Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs,  Sinistry of Finance and
Mr. E.S. Parthasarthy, Deputy Secretary, IIinistry of Agriculture. ARC
was represented by Mr. '4. A. Chidambaram, Mulcaging Director.  The Govern-
ment of Bihar was represented by Mr. R. C. Sinha, Agricultural Production
Commissioner and Mr. It. P. Sinha, Super-intendent Engineer, Groundwater
Cell.  Tne Bihar State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB) was repre-
sented by lMr. D. P. Chaudhri, Managing Director. A report entitled
fmihar Agricultural Credit Project - Appraisal Report'(23O-IM, dated October 3,
1973) is being trculatE-to the Executive Directors separately. A credit and
project summary is in Annex III to this report.
Background
25.        The Tirhut Division, which comprises the whole of the project area,
is the poorest of the four divisions in Bihar, itself one of the poorest states
in India. Population density in the division (549 per Km2) is over two-thirds
more than that of the state as a whole and about three times that of all of
India. In recent years, per capita income in Bihar has been about one-third of
the national average and is currently about Rs. 225 (US$30).  The average size
of the 2.6 mi7Llion farms in Tirhut is only about 0.9 ha, and fragmentation of
holdings is high.  73 percent of farms are under 1 ha (64 percent state average)
and only 3 percent are over 5 ha. The remaining 24 percent are between 1 and
5 ha; the owners of these form the group most likely to benefit directly from
the project. The region has a sub-tropical monsoon climate; rainfall is con-
centrated in the period from June to September. The soils of the project area
are fertile and typical of the Ganges Plain, the most fertile area in India.
Groundwater is plentifu1, and because the area is relatively flat, land-levellinr_
is rarely requ-ired for irrigation.
Project Description and Cost
26.        Faced with this high population density and extreme poverty but con-
siderable agricultural potential in Tirhut, the Government of India embarked some
time ago on an agricultural lending program througlgh DB and seven participating
co,mmercial banks.  The project would be a three-year continuation and accelera-
tion of this program.  Tt would involve about; 50,000 loans to individual farmers
(.nostl` on farrms  from   to 5 ha) and groups of farmers for investnent in about
17,000 dciesel, and electric powered tubewells an, about 3,000 diesel pumpsets for
ow- Ift. plunping fromr sur>face water. Because of shiortages and unreliability of
spp--ly of elect4ric mower it is likely that coly about 3,000 (6 percent) of the
itubewells wou,d be electric powered;  the rest would be diesel powered. An important
feat,ure of the investments to be financed uricCer thne proposed project would be
-thle geieration of potential water supplies in excess of the needs of many ifdi-f-
.duai larmers whose holdin_s in most cases are fragmented.   These farmers wo-ud
be e-;oecoenl to sell surplus water to neighbors; such arrangements are commor in
ule project area and rates are well-established.



- 9 -
27.        Total project cost is estimated at US$60 million equivalent,
ef which the Association would finance US$32 million.  The proposed. credit
waould finance the estimated foreign exchange component of US$3.2 million
equivalent and 50 percent of local currency costs. Of the total project
costs, IDA would finance about 53 percent; farmers about 12 percent; and
LDB, participating commercial banks and ARC about 35 percent.
Use of Proposed Credit
28.        The Government of India would relend the proceeds of the credit to
ARC, which would repay about 75 percent of the total at the end of nine years.
ARC would pay 5.5  percent interest per annum on this amount. ARC would repay
the remainder at the end of 15 years, at    6 percent interest.   ARC would
supervise and refinance at 7 percent per annum the loan operations of LDB and
participating commercial banks, which would repay ARC in accordance with the
amortization of farmers' loans.  Loans to individual fanrers would bear a minra:c.
interest of 9,5 percent. Repayment periods would not exceed the life of the
asset financed.  For pumpsets they would be 7 years maximumTi to all farmers;
for tubewells and land development they would be 9 years but extending to 15
years for small farmers, defined as those farmers cultivating an area whic?
provides them w^ith an annual net income (after cultivation costs but before
debt service) of -Is. 2,400 or less.  Farmers' contributions including family
labor would range from 10 to 15 percent of the cost of indivrdual investments,
Institutional Arrangements
29.        ARC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RRI) and a familiar
lending channel for IDA lending to the agricultural sector in 7ndia. As a sound
financial institution with experienced and qualified staff, which has demonstrated
its capabilities in supervising similar programs, ARC would ensure that the
lending banks follow the policies, terms and conditions agreed with IDA.
30.        Bihar has an established banking network, which includes, for long-
term investments, LDB and commercial banks. LDR is expected to be the lending
channel for approximately 60 percent of individual loans made under the project.
Although it was established in 1957, it did not begin effective operations until
1968. As a result of an operational study carried out by RBI and ARC, improve-
ments are being made in its staff training and loan and operational nrocedures.
It was agreed during negotiations that this program would continue.   Overdues
have been a problem, but as a condition of credit effectiveness, the State
Government has agreed to take steps to reduce overdues to 25 percent of dernan-
(meaning principal-andidnterestffalling due during the -year in questioh. pl-us
overdues from previous years) both throughout the state and in the project area
and to maintain at least this level.



- 10 -
31.        Seven coimmercial banks are expected to participate in the project.
Commercial banks have so far had little experience in agricultural lending in
the project area, but that role is expected to become more significant in the
future.  The Central Bank of India, the "lead bank" in the area designated to
guide and coordinate banking development, has already made studies of banking
prospects in some of the districts in the project area, and the State Bankr of
India has opened specific agricultural deve opment branches in some areas.
To enable smooth execution of the lending banks' project responsibilities, a
'roject Coordinating Commnittee, chaired by the State Development Commissioner,
would coordinate the work of institutions involved in project implementation.
Moreover it was agreed during negotiations -that participating commercial banks,as
well as LDB, would have assistance from the extension and other State government
services.  On the basis of progress already made and wiul the improvements
agreed upon, the banidng system would be adequate to implement the project
within the three-year period envisaged.
32.        Individual farm investments would be appraised by LDB and commercial
bank staff under the general supervision and guidance of ARC. Government has
agreed to improve groundwater control covering the spacing of wells and off-take
from the aquifer, if necessary through appropriate legislation. Such measures
are not critical in the short-rLun for the project area, which has abundant under-
ground water, but are called for to ensure efficient use of the State's groundwatc-
resources in the longer run. The State Minor Irrigation Department (MdD),which 1 -
continue to provide tec.hnical assistance to farmers and lending institutions, wil>
be strengthened with three geohydrologists from the Central Groundwater Board.
Procurement and Disbursements
33.        Local contractors and MID would drill the tubewells; local
materials woul-d be used and charges are reasonable. Adequate and sufficient
well-drilling equipment is available in Bihar.  Pwnpsets, including repair
and maintenance facilities, are readily available; prices are competitive
permitting farmers to have a fair choice at reasonable prices. Project
execution would involve small investments and operations on as many as
50,000 individual farms spread over a neriod of three years.  International
competitive bidding would not, therefore, be feasible.  Equipment purchases
would thus be through normal commercial chlannels according to the individual
farmier's choice.
3L.        Disbursements by -the Association are expected to extend over 3-½
years and would be against appropriate statements of LDi3 and commercial banks'
lending for project purposes refinanced by ARC. Tlhese disbursements would be
61 percent of loans made to farmers by the lending banks.
Economtic Benefits
35.        The project would have substantial economic  benefits in an
extremely poor and. densely populated region.   fO,OOO farmers  and
their families are expected to benefit directly from the project.  The financial
rate of returr. on incremental investments are estimated at between 16 and 2O
percent; furthermore, an analysis of model farm budgets indicates that at full



- 11 -
production  project farmers' net incomes after debt service should on averafge
be more than doubled. At least: an additional 50,000 farmers will benefit
from the purchase of surplus wa,er. At full production, the project should
generate additional year-round employment, both family and hired labor, of
almost 11 million man-days a year.
36.        The rates of return to the Indian economy are estimated at from
21 to 32 percent. Benefits would include (a) reduced instability in agricultural
production, (b) incremental crop production at full development (636,000 tons)
valued at almost Rs. 280 million a year, and (c) increased enployment. Other
benefits which have not been quantified include (a) strengthening of credit
institutions in the project area, (b) demonstration effect on other farms
(particularly the value of an assured water supply), (c) improved drinking water
supply, and (d) a major contribution to groundwater control, essential for
stabilizing production.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AIND AUTHORIIT

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was
January 31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected
by technical and managerial difficulties connected with the opening of
new collieries to supply IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with
technical consultants, has been providing constant supervision and
progress is being made in resolving the technical issues. On the
managerial side, the Government of India announced on July 20, 1972,
that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years. The
Government has assured us that this action will not interfere -wi-th IISCO's
obligation to the Bank. On August 31, 1973, US$1.6 million remained un-
disbursed of which about US$0.9 million has been earmarked for equipment
on order and technical services, while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by
the closing date of December 1973.  The Bank has approved, with the con-
currence of GOI, some increase in short-term incebtedness and has waived
the Bank's mortgage cover to permit IISCO to make financing arrangements
for a major rehabilitation program. This loan will be fully repaid in
February 1974 and the outstanding balance is covered by the guarantee
of GOI.
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$2h.6 million loan of September 10, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$4O.O million loan of June 3, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Ln No. 902     Tenth Industrial Credit and Investmen. Corporation of
India Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
These loans have supported industrialization in India through
a well-established development finance company. The first three of these
loans are fully committed. The fourth loan has recently been declared

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report

effective and its proceeds are being committed. There bave been delays
in disbursements on the earliest Loan 515-IN as a result of the business
slowdown in the years following 2967. The original closing date of
December 331, 1971 for 515-IN has been extended twice to December 31, 1973.
Loan 683-IN has been fully committed as of December 31, 1972. Disburse-
ments under Loan 789-ZN are ahead of schedule. Loan 902-IN was declared
effective on August 16, 1973.
Cr No. 89      Beas    ipi nt   US$23.0 miillion credit of June 29, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction sorks.   The project, which has
been subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin.   The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery up to
December 31, 1973, and as a result, the original closing date of December 31,
1972, has been postponed by a year.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds   US$13.0 mion loan of June 18      1969;
l         Date  December1, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Developnent Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Association
has approved plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant
and construction of a new plant. Most orders have been placed for the equip-
ment required for the plant expansion and much of this equipment has been
delivered and is being installed. Tenders for civil works and equipment
for the new plant are ready for readvertisement following rejection of
earlier bidding as unresponsive. Also, a major difficulty has arisen
because of a lack of response from contractors to tenders for land-levelling
and from farmers for the service. This problem is being overcome through
demonstrations under field conditions in the project area.   Additionally,
arrangements have been comple-ted wbich would permit contractors to purchase
imported equipment of their choice for land-levelling.
Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 mfllion credit of February 9,
1970; Closing Datej§ September 30, 1976
This credit will help to finance the construction of Kadana dam
on the Mabi river and the expansion of the irrigation area below the dam.
The project will also include field channel construction, land-levelling,
dr?Anage and road works, and a program to support agricultural development.
It is -e: expected that, the project will be completed about two years behind
schedulCe. tie major reason for ihe delay has been the failure of the prime
contrat tor .n the dam itself:  the Government was forced to discharge this
contractoWr in Octcber 1971 and to undertake the work by force account.
More recently, progress with land-levelling has been slow, and this could
lead to further delay in completing the project; a mission reviewed in

August 1973 remedial action to be taken by the project authorities.
The outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory.
As the delays in implementation so far incurred have arisen at the start
of the project, their effect upon the economic rate of return is not
likely to be significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project;   US$35.0 million credit
of June 3, 1970: Closing Date: June 30, 1974

credit of March 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Cr No. 391     Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project;   US$33.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Cr No. 392     Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project;   US$38.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973;   Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
The first seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9
million, are now effective. -acept for the Punjab project, which consists
of mechanization equipment, all are similar in strucfure, being designed to
provide long and medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions
for such on-farm investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling.
Implementation and disbursement have been slower tian was originally expected,
mainly due to delays in the institutional reforms required under the projects
(hiring of groundwater experts, changes in lending criteria and terms, etc.).
These constraints have now been overcome and the rate of disbursement. is
accelerating. By August 31, 1973, US$29.3 million out of US$35 million had
been disbursed under the Gujarat project. In all US$70.9 million had been
disbursed by   August 31, 1973.  Conditions of effectiveness for Credits 391-IN--N
and 392-IN have to be fulfilled by October 31, 1973.
The major unresolved problem is the procurement of tractors, which
account for almost 30 percent of the credits. Since our credits were appraiseo,
demand for tractors has declined substantially as a result of the introduction
of import duties and taxes on tractors, and price increases. Tenders were
recently advertised in Punjab and farmer's demand for tractors in this case

amounted only to about one-fourth of the number of tractors offered.
Consideration is being given to reallocating some of the funds at
present allocated for tractors to minor irrigation and to including
in our credit the financing of locallv manufactured as well as
imported tractors.
Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation;  US$6.0 mi].lion credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing :Date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government has been considering
the procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government
has now indicated that it proposes to proceed with procurement as previously
agreed with the Association and some disbursements are anticipated during
this fiscal year.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV;  US$78.0 million credit of May 3,1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and has
been designed to support; the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74).   Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Production problems
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months. However,
production has now picked up and as of August 31, 1973, US$20.0 million had
been disbursed under the credit. Pull disbursement is expected by the closing
date of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II;  US$75.0 million credit of May 3.1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-IN,
is designed to assist in f'inancing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems asso-
ciated with preparing bid documents suitable for international bidding and
the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but contract awards
