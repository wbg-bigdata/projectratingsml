Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    1



1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Background and Context at Appraisal

The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, land-locked country with a population of 5.3 million. Following
independence in 1991 income levels declined by about 60 percent due to termination of budgetary
transfers from the Soviet Union, disruption of traditional trading relationships, terms of trade shocks and
the collapse of the central planning system. At appraisal, agriculture accounted for about 40 percent of
GDP. Gold and electricity were the two most important exports (though electricity exports had decreased
significantly because of problems with replenishment of the Toktogul reservoir).

The country undertook major reforms beginning in 1993 that helped create the basic foundations of a
market-oriented economic system consisting, including a market-based price system; an open, foreign
trade regime; and substantial private ownership of key productive assets. The Kyrgyz Republic was the
first in the CIS to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). A large number of small and medium
enterprises emerged during this period. The regional financial crisis in 1998, however, halted economic
recovery. It also highlighted continuing vulnerabilities caused by large financial imbalances in the energy
sector, fragile public finances, inefficient safety nets and a poorly developed banking sector.

The Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) was launched in a substantially improved
macroeconomic context. The country had made significant progress in attaining macroeconomic stability
and restarting economic growth. The fiscal deficit had fallen from about 11.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to
5.2 percent of GDP in 2002, mostly as a consequence of expenditure cuts. The current account deficit
declined from an average of 18.4 percent of GDP (in 1996-98) to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2002. As a result
of the fiscal and monetary tightening, inflation fell to 2.3 percent in 2002. Growth averaged about 4.8
percent in 1999-2001.

Despite these improvements, the Kyrgyz Republic remained the second poorest of the FSU republics and
one of the poorest countries in the world. In 2001, per capita income was less than US$300. Severe
poverty affected 13.5 percent of the population, and 47.6 percent were considered poor, with incomes
below PPP US$4.30 per day. Poverty is highest in rural areas, but there are large regional disparities.
Access to public services such as running water, public sewerage, reliable electricity, district heating, and
telephone service is very low.

The country had a heavy burden of external debt - at 477 percent of Government revenues, in net present
value terms, at end-2001. Civil servants were poorly paid and often had to seek alternative sources of
income, which, in turn, reduced the quality of public services and promoted rent-seeking behavior.

Macroeconomic Policy Framework: A 3-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive Board of the IMF in December 2001, provided the basic
underpinnings for the macro-policy framework.

The Government's reform efforts had also been supported through adjustment lending by the World Bank.
Seven prior Bank adjustment operations were active in the following areas:

      privatization and enterprise reform,
      agricultural privatization,
      improvements in the business environment
      financial sector reform,

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009            2


     public sector resource management,
     pension reform and
     power and gas sector reform.

These operations helped the Kyrgyz Republic undertake reforms to orient its policy and institutional
framework to the principles of a free market economy.

Governance environment: While considerable progress had been made in economic reforms, the State
retained many of the characteristics of the previous Soviet system, particularly the culture of control and
the use of personal power, government by executive fiat, and the absence of concepts of accountability
and rule-based decision-making. All of these factors combined to allow corruption and rent seeking to
flourish, particularly at the highest levels of government, and among the President, his family and closest
associates. Corruption permeated society and became entrenched and institutionalized.

The center of government was a pool of competing interests without mechanisms for resolving implicit
conflicts. Individual ministers, regional governors, parliament and business interests would lobby their
own proposals which would represent a mixture of populist measures designed to strengthen political
support, proposals for national development and, frequently, measures to increase the possibilities of rent
extraction. The system was mediated by the President and his administration through ad hoc arbitration
and legal measures. The main expression of policy was through thousands of decrees from the President
and Government, together with laws passed by parliament.                          There thus emerged a patchwork of
legislation and orders, many of which were ambiguous and contradictory, without clear implementation
mechanisms.       Each new legal act would act as a source of power and authority, but would be
counterbalanced by many others.

NPRS Governance assessment. The NPRS recognized that weak governance and an ineffective state
were serious hurdles to achieving development goals. It recognized (at least in formal terms) that the
electoral system needed to be improved, political parties were weak and the communication between the
State and the people was not fully effective. The NPRS assessment noted that the legal framework
suffered from outdated norms, frequent, non-transparent and inconsistent changes, lack of public
discussion of proposed laws and regulations and inadequate public access to normative acts.                       The
judiciary and law enforcement agencies faced serious capacity and integrity challenges that reduced their
ability to uphold the law. At the level of central and local administration, policy making capacity was
extremely weak, implementation of policies was poor and often non-existent, transparency and
accountability were inadequate and Government interference in business activities was excessive.

Local self-governments lacked adequate functional and fiscal authority, management capacity and
community participation. Public expenditure management reforms were needed to strengthen budget
formulation, budget execution and financial accountability.                    The level of political interference and
instability in the civil service was high, while its professional capacity and accountability for performance
were low and declining, as real salaries declined and motivated staff became demoralized and left the
public service. The structure of Government needed to be rationalized. Corruption was a major systemic
problem that plagued many public agencies, as confirmed by surveys of households and firms. For these
reasons, the NPRS accorded a very high priority to measures leading to the formation of an effective State.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The reforms included in the Government's program were urgently
needed to successfully implement the poverty reduction agenda. The Bank had been actively involved in
reforming key public sector institutions through various operations, including the Public Sector Resource
Management Adjustment Credit (PSRMAC), Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grants for
development of public procurement, and projects to reform the Health sector. Recent economic and
sector work, especially, the Public Expenditure Review (PER), the Country Financial Accountability

Assessment (CFAA), and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) had also focused on
identifying critical weaknesses in public sector management.                         Of particular importance was the
Governance and Service Delivery Report of 2002, which originated from a request by the government to
do an assessment of the degree of corruption in the Kyrgyz Republic. In the meantime, the Government
had undertaken additional reforms on its own, or with the assistance of other donors. One of the issues
that was perhaps never fully resolved, however, was how the Bank and other donors could be reasonably
certain that the Government, and particularly President Akaev, was committed to reform, given that close
relatives of the President were among the most corrupt in the country.

The objective of the GSAC was to maintain the momentum of the reform process and provide a coherent
framework which would carry it forward. In developing the GSAC agenda, extensive consultations were
held with the Government and the donor community. As a result, there was considerable consensus
around the program and donors expressed their willingness to participate in the program through grant-
TA assistance. Given the Bank's experience in implementing public sector reforms in the Kyrgyz
Republic and in other countries, its country knowledge and strong relationships with counterparts and
stakeholders, it could have a significant positive impact on the quality, pace and realism of the reforms.
The Bank could also play a key role in coordinating assistance provided by different donors.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) would support the Government's program to
strengthen the effectiveness of the State. GSAC had two complementary objectives: (a) to improve the
transparency and responsiveness of the public sector and enhance the ability of external stakeholders to
hold it accountable; and (b) to increase efficiency, effectiveness and accountability within the public
sector. See Section 3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives for details of key indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDOs were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

With regard to the first objective, the GSAC supported reforms aimed at:

         (i) improving personal accountability of political officials and civil servants;
         (ii) strengthening voice and participation by improving public access to official information;
         (iii) improving the interaction between regulatory agencies and business enterprises; and
         (iv) strengthening external audit.

To advance the second objective, the operation supported reforms directed at:

         (i) strengthening public expenditure management by establishing a more strategic and transparent
         budget formulation process, and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget
         execution;
         (ii) improving the internal control environment;
         (iii) improving transparency, value for money and accountability in public procurement;
         (iv) improving service delivery in the health and education sectors;
         (v) enhancing the effectiveness of the civil service; and
         (vi) streamlining the structure of Government ministries and agencies.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

There were no revisions

1.6 Other significant changes

The most significant changes were the extensions of the program closing date (of which there were four)
from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2008, but there were no significant changes to the program. Note that the
Dutch Government provided an additional Euro1.4 million of retroactive financing to the Government for
actions already completed under the first tranche.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance1

GSAC was a three-tranche operation with the first tranche conditions to be met as a requirement for
Board presentation and the second and third tranche conditions to be met over a two-year period (Table 1).
Although the credit was fully disbursed, there was nearly a four-year gap between the first and second
tranche releases. This delay was mainly because of Government resistance to civil service reform, the
events surrounding the Tulip Revolution and distractions caused by government deliberations over the
HIPC initiative (see Section 2.2 for additional details).

                                      TABLE 1: Tranche Release Dates and Amounts
                          Amount

                    USD)         SDR)          Release Date               Date
   Tranche 1          5.151        3.675       June 30, 2003        July 31, 2003                   Regular
   Tranche 2          5.561        3.675       June 30, 2004        May 29, 2007                    Waiver

   Tranche 3          11.948        7.35       June 30, 2005         June 5, 2008                   Regular
       Total          22.660        14.7
Note: The expected dates are cited at the end of the expected range. Dollar amounts of disbursements differ from
programmed values due to changes in the US$ / SDR exchange rate.

All tranche release conditions were met with the exception of two conditions of the second tranche, both
of which required partial waivers. The waiver of the second condition of tranche 2 (Table 2) was needed
because, in the Bank's judgment, although the Government had sent a substantive Civil Service Law
(CSL) to the Parliament, which was consistent with the reform program and the tranche condition, the
Parliament had amended the CSL in a way that potentially weakened the newly created Civil Service
Management Agency (CSMA) relative to Ministers. However, the waiver, which was granted three years
after the approval of the CSL was justified on several grounds:

     It was not politically feasible to rescind the amendments;
     The CSMA had developed institutional credibility;
     Real progress had been achieved in separating politics from the civil service; and
     There was a track record developing where due process was followed in appointing civil servants.




1Note: Section 3 reviews the main elements of the policy matrix.

     The Government had complied with the Credit Agreement, and it was not clear that Parliament
         could be bound by the conditions, since it was the government that had signed.

Condition 8 was waived, according to the tranche release memo, because the education sector did not
meet the minimum pre-conditions to ensure that grants would be either equitable or would constitute
incentives for greater efficiency. In fact, the reason that condition 8 was waived was because the
condition, as written, was incompatible with the institutional organization of education and local
government financing. Specifically, the issue was that the staffing for schools was controlled by the
Ministry of Education, while the budget was controlled by the local government. The separation of
responsibilities for staffing and school budgets would have made it impossible to administer per capita-
based grants effectively.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

         Revolution of 2005

Following the disputed parliamentary elections of February and March 2005, the previous President and
Government were overthrown in a non-violent "Tulip Revolution" in March 2005. The change of
government opened up possibilities for significant reforms, particularly given that a frustration with
corruption and poor service delivery provided one of the sparks of the revolution. As a result, the new
authorities indicated their formal commitment to transparency and good governance. This change was
also supported by a civil society that had become much more active and demanding.

A presidential election in July 2005 confirmed the new President in office. The next two years were,
however, marked with considerable political instability, including major mobilizations of people and
demonstrations, which, on a number of occasions, paralyzed the government. In addition major tensions
within the government and between the government and parliament led to major changes to the
constitution being approved on at least four occasions. There were also four different prime ministers
during 2007. It was only following the changes to the constitution approved in the referendum of October
2007, and the parliamentary elections of December 2007 that there was a consolidation of political power
and the reestablishment of political stability.

In the final analysis the revolution of 2005 and its aftermath substantially delayed implementation and
required reacquainting the new government with the policy reforms supported by GSAC. Efforts to re-
politicize the civil service system were, to a degree, held back by already implemented civil service
legislation combined with strong leadership (especially the director) of the CSMA.

         The Influence of the HIPC Debate

In addition to the political instability described above, from February 2006 to February 2007, the WB and
IMF staffs were discussing a possible HIPC program with the Kyrgyz authorities.                           Following the
revolution, popular demands for better government and an end to corruption were interwoven with a
resurgent nationalism, and a sense that western institutions bear considerable responsibility for poor
governance and the perceived lack of economic development. There was, therefore, a considerable
degree of skepticism in civil society regarding the HIPC initiative which was seen as a national

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009           8


humiliation, or a means by which western institutions might seize Kyrgyz assets. In addition to this
groundswell of popular feeling there was opposition from much of the administration and particularly
parliamentarians, who saw their interests and rents threatened through a greater focus on transparency and
particularly through reforms in the energy and mining sectors.

The threatened vested interests helped activate the latent opposition in civil society to western institutions
and past failures. Participation in HIPC became deeply entangled with other political debates, and a
highly emotional issue. The result was that HIPC became a political liability for the authorities, and acted
both as a distraction from other issues and the main focus of dialogue and dispute with the World Bank
and IMF. Finally the political liability became so great that the authorities rejected HIPC debt relief in
February 2007.

The effect of the emotional political debate around the issue of HIPC on GSAC was to weaken
implementation. This debate monopolized the government's attention after the revolution and detracted
from other important issues ­ indeed it was probably the most significant political issue during 2006 and
until early 2007. For example, the Bank team recognized that the attempt at civil service reform was
possibly too wide-ranging. However, redesigning the reform was made virtually impossible by the lack
of stable and appropriate counterparts during this period who could focus their attention on this issue.
Thus the focus of the dialogue during the period of instability was on ensuring that appointments were
made through due process and that the Civil Service Agency developed and implemented appropriate
procedures to manage appointments, dismissals and promotions.                          High level dialogue was mainly
concerned with reinforcing political commitment to the main principles of the civil service law.

         Resurgence of Interference in the Private Sector

Following the revolution, there was a resurgence of interference in private sector enterprises by officials
where the potential for financial gains was the greatest. This interference took the form of a redistribution
of productive assets and the opportunistic take over of private concerns by particular groups belonging to
or having contacts with influential politicians, and is the principal reason for the deterioration of
corruption indicators such as the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, which showed
a consistent decline between 2005 and 2008 GSAC was not designed to deal with the phenomenon of
grand corruption, and indeed it is difficult to envisage any development policy operation dealing with
these issues. With regard to the private sector, GSAC was limited to enacting a law on administrative
procedures and to halting the practice of Special Means Financing, which encouraged public officials to
fine private businesses without cause. The GSAC-supported program also required public officials to
disclose their assets.

         The Soviet Legacy and the Emergence of Regional Differences

Kyrgyzstan presented a challenging environment for governance reform even without external factors
adding difficulties for the program. However, the authoritarian Soviet legacy, combined with newly
surfaced regional loyalties (north vs. south, which became important in the wake of the revolution), made
it more difficult to achieve a kind of institutional readiness to carry out governance reforms along the
lines of a "Westminster model." The assumptions of the program underestimated these obstacles, and this
readiness had not been achieved at project launch.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The design of the GSAC program did not provide for an established M&E framework. While some
performance indicators were identified in the policy matrix, these were not systematically monitored and
there was no scheme for overall project reporting, and, therefore, no mechanism for monitoring data to

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    9


feed back into program implementation. Without consolidated M&E reporting, it has been necessary (in
this ICR) to assemble data from various sources to provide some quantitative measures of progress,
whether through outputs or outcomes.

Implementation Arrangements

Implementation of the reforms under the GSAC program was initially overseen by a Coordination
Council (CC), chaired by the Deputy Head of the President's Administration. The Minister of Finance
and other minister or deputy minister level officials were members of the CC. A Project Management
Group (PMG), reporting to the CC was established to facilitate and coordinate implementation of the
reform program, including the management of technical assistance.

The operation was partly supported by a parallel technical assistance operation (GTAC). While the
majority of funds under GTAC were for Treasury Modernization, funds were made available also for a
number of activities to support the CSMA and to improve transparency in the public sector. In addition,
funds were provided under GTAC to fund local consultants in the PMG who would assist the government
agencies to push forward the GSAC agenda in different areas. Funding was also provided for a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) of an existing project to provide services for procurement and financial
management under GTAC.

These arrangements proved to be ineffective and, during the first year of implementation, considerable
supervision resources were used in mediating disputes between the director of the PMG and the PIU as
the former sought to be involved in the procurement and financial management issues (of GTAC) which
were supposed to be dealt with by the PIU (almost certainly for the potential for rent seeking) rather than
supporting the Government in the implementation of the GSAC agenda. Following intensive discussions
the authorities accepted that the arrangement was dysfunctional, and the PMG director was removed, the
PMG dissolved as an institution, although the individual consultants continued working to support the
government's efforts to implement GSAC (more effectively than previously), while the PIU functions
were transferred to another existing PIU in the Ministry of Finance. Overall the poor design of the
implementation structures was remedied by intensive supervision and reorganization of the arrangements.
The effect was that, while this may have contributed to some delay in implementation in the early stages
of the project, process-related tranche release conditions were eventually met without major exceptions.

In addition the Coordinating Council proved ineffective in the post revolutionary period. Because the
chair of the council was the deputy head of the Presidential Administration, continuity was lost as this
position became one of the most unstable posts in the administration, with at least eight changes of the
occupant of this position over the period March 2005 to June 2008. Combined with other frequent
changes of other ex-officio members of the Council, it had no institutional continuity and reflected the
wider fragmentation of the government, and the difficulties of providing a coordinated approach in any
policy area during this period. In this situation the coordination function fell largely to the Ministry of
Finance, which became the central government institution with relatively more institutional continuity
and the one that had most interest in the implementation of the GSAC.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Several follow-up policy operations are planned and ongoing. GTAC will continue with the Treasury
capacity building and computerization effort. The Rural Education Project is also continuing to support
GSAC-related reforms to reform financial arrangements in education sector in order to ensure a more
even distribution of financial resources across the country through introduction of per capita financing.
The SWAP in the health sector and the Reducing Technical Barriers to Entrepreneurship and Trade
project (RTBET) with the objective of improving the business environment are ongoing and DFID, EU

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    10


and USAID continue to support public financial management activities. The Capacity Building for
Economic Management TA project became effective in FY09 as well as a joint donor Trust Fund
operation for Public Finance Capacity building. Thus, there is a substantial amount of continued support
in areas that were covered by GSAC.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The strategy of the GSAC operation was to have a critical set of governance-related policy reforms that
could substantially improve the performance of the public sector. Despite seven prior Bank-supported
adjustment operations, there was a lack of coherence in public expenditure management and policy
formulation, weak social service delivery, and the business climate was unfavorable. The relative lack of
success of previous adjustment operations should perhaps have been a warning sign for GSAC, and
suggests that the Bank was overoptimistic in its assessment of the degree of ownership of the operation
(as proved to be the case). Indeed, this would clearly raise the question of how objective the review
process is, when it comes to assessing ownership, because the only evidence available to outsiders are the
public statements and programs of the government, and possibly the formal enactment of laws. With
hindsight, it is clear that ownership was not sufficiently deep and the Bank team underestimated the risks
of political change resulting (indirectly) from the 2005 elections.

However, the Bank team's estimation of government ownership did coincide with that of other
Development Partners and outside observers. The emphasis of the Government's own formal strategy
(NPRS) on governance issues clearly made a case for an operation to support governance reform. The
objectives were relevant to removing many of the key governance obstacles to improving public sector
performance. These governance obstacles were identified by AAA in the form of a PER and a CAS
completion report and had been experienced in a variety of forms in seven prior adjustment operations.
The reform measures of the programs of individual components aligned well with the priority problems of
the public sector. However, the composition of the operation as a whole was too broad and ambitious to
reasonably expect the required government commitment for program success and timely implementation.
The program simply required more political capital to implement than the leadership actually had at its
disposal.

To reinforce GSAC and enhance its relevance, it was submitted to the Board at the same time as the
supporting TA (GTAC) and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Board did not find any
contradictions or discrepancies in the approaches of the CAS and the two program documents. Bank
management raised the issue whether a highly indebted country such as Kyrgyzstan should be borrowing
money for computerization of the Treasury function (under GTAC). However, this computerization was
justified because it carried with it significant governance benefits (see below).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The major expected outcomes are longer term, especially for civil service, and therefore it is not yet
possible to fully assess these outcomes. Many of the performance indicators in the policy matrix were
process-oriented, referring to completed actions or output indicators, and not true outcome indicators.
There was no formal results matrix so it is difficult to track the progress of outcomes since the time of the
implementation of the first tranche (pre-Board) conditions. However, through the implementation of
specific reforms, related output indicators and an assessment of the reform program's sustainability, there
can be some reasonable assertions of outcome. The overall program was based on the premise that by
simultaneously strengthening the voice of external stakeholders and improving the effectiveness of the

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009                                    11


Government machinery, the operation would enhance the ability of the State to pursue the objectives of
the National Poverty Reduction Strategy.

Macroeconomic Framework

Table 3 shows that a stable macro-framework was maintained during the program. Though growth was
slightly negative during the year of the revolution, 2005, it was positive in 2006 and reached 8.2 percent
in 2007. Inflation increased sharply in 2007, largely due to the increase in international food and energy
prices. It is generally agreed that the authorities responded appropriately to external developments.
Trends in other indicators including the fiscal balance, public debt and external debt were all favorable
through 2007.

Summary of Achievement of Objectives

           Pillar 1: Improve the Transparency and Responsiveness of the Public Sector and Enhance
           the Ability of External Stakeholders to Hold It Accountable

The objectives for Pillar 1 on public sector transparency and responsiveness were essentially achieved. In
Civil Service reform, which could be seen as the centerpiece of the program, the objectives were mainly
achieved, at least in a formal sense, following a long process of detailed engagement by the team with the

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    15


authorities. The Civil Service Management Agency was established and operates professionally. New
procedures for recruitment, dismissal and promotion were introduced, and virtually all civil service
recruitment follows due process procedures. Finally the role of the State Secretary, as the (non-political)
administrative head of agencies has been established. The Borrower's Contribution to the ICR, which
focuses almost exclusively on civil service, further documents these achievements. Public accountability
was improved with 99 percent compliance with asset declaration and with the FOI law and the
establishment of the Public Information Center. It was reported that this center is popular, but it is
recommended that better data on use of the facility be recorded.

The business sector-related objectives achieved more mixed success. Eliminating fines against businesses
that are driven by special means financing was a significant gain. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
publishing of draft laws was useful, but the ministry is not keeping its website in functioning order. The
Chamber of Accounts law was passed, but will not be effective on the ground without further capacity
building.

         Pillar II: Increase Efficiency, Effectiveness and Accountability of the Public Sector

Public expenditure management reform, by all indications, has been a mixed success. All of the specific
technical measures under GSAC were carried out, and in addition there has been a considerable
subsequent effort by the World Bank jointly with other donors to support a government-owned public
finance reform plan. Among results achieved there are lower budget plan vs. actual deviations and there
are now MTBF estimates with two-year projections. The Macroeconomic Council (formerly EPC) has
unified policy and budget planning.                Extra-budgetary accounts and non-cash transfers have been
essentially eliminated. The internal audit function has also been improved. However, despite these
advances, it is not clear that the overall objective of establishing a more strategic budget process has yet
been achieved. While fiscal discipline is maintained, frequent in-year revisions lead to unpredictability
and uncertainty in the availability of resources.

Procurement performance, for which there are detailed indicators, would have to be described as less than
successful. The procurement component scored poorly according to an OECD/DAC methodology that
was used to evaluate progress in procurement outcomes. The progress was evaluated on a 0-3 point scale
with respect to (a) the legislative and regulatory framework; (b) the institutional framework and
management capacity; (c) purchasing operations and market practices; and (d) the integrity and
transparency of the public procurement system. A score below 2 indicates less-than-full achievement
with need for improvement. The legislative and regulatory framework scored a 2.1 which is acceptable,
but the others indicated substantial work was needed. Institutional and management capacity scored only
1.0, while procurement operations and market practices scored 0.7, and the integrity of public
procurement scored 1.2.

In service delivery, GSAC complemented initiatives in the health sector efforts by supporting reform
measures, in particular, the institution of a single payer system. There is now an active health sector
SWAP, which has been supporting improved delivery of health services.

Should GSAC have been cancelled?

While it is true that many of the objectives of the GSAC were achieved, there is general agreement that
the program was overly ambitious and probably not suited to the political and institutional environment of
the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly after the revolution. Even before the revolution, however it is not
unreasonable to suggest that that the proposed operation represented a triumph of hope over experience
and was based upon an overoptimistic interpretation of the commitment and capacity of the authorities for
fundamental governance reform. A key issue to be raised then is whether at some point it would have

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    16


been appropriate to cancel the operation rather than extend it for three years beyond its original closing
date.

There is no clear cut answer to this question. Once the operation began, although there were some delays
during the first year, there was active implementation and dialogue with the Bank in the development of
the laws on the Civil Service, Declaration of Income and Assets and the Chamber of Accounts. There
was also steady progress in the implementation of the measures in the area of public finances. There was
certainly no case for cancellation at this stage. The first major problems occurred with the amendments to
the Civil Service Law in parliament in June 2004 and more importantly the appointment of the
President's (unqualified) sister-in-law as the State Secretary of the Civil Service Agency in October 2004.
This latter was clearly a major setback for the program as it indicated an obvious lack of commitment
and/or understanding of the program at the highest levels. The team indeed responded firmly and made
clear to the authorities that this action was incompatible with the program and that there could be no
question of the second tranche being released while the President's sister-in-law was a senior official of
the CSMA. There continued a period of intense dialogue on this issue until the revolution of March 2005.
With hindsight, given the proximity of the revolution, cancellation at this point, could have been effective
for reorienting the program. However, given that most of the second tranche conditions had already been
fulfilled cancellation at this point might well have been seen as an unreasonable overreaction.

Following the Revolution, the issue of the sister-in-law disappeared, with her resignation. The new
Government moreover was formally committed to governance reform and fighting corruption. Again an
immediate cancellation would have been a pre-emptive judgment of the commitment and capacity of the
new government. However, new problems emerged, firstly with the lack of knowledge of the new
authorities about GSAC and the wider governance reform, and the initial tendency to replace officials of
the previous regime by the new authorities outside due process. The existence of the GSAC program
gave the Bank a strong platform for dialogue on these issues with the new authorities, often at the highest
levels. The effect of this was clearly to reduce the tendencies of the new government towards arbitrary
behavior and towards the importance of institution building. Again a cancellation at this stage, and
particularly during the difficult phase of the HIPC discussions, would likely have signaled that the Bank
and other donors were not interested in engagement and might have strengthened the nationalistic and
isolationist tendencies in the Kyrgyz Republic.                  There was therefore no clear moment at which
cancellation would have had a positive effect on the governance agenda, and indeed, while the operation
lasted it did provide an effective vehicle for dialogue.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

As the summary demonstrates, there were substantial achievements and it is clear that the operation made
significant progress in a very difficult environment. Moreover, the tranche conditions were met with
fairly minor exceptions. What brings the rating down to MU is the incidences of backtracking in some
areas of implementation, particularly with respect to procurement and civil service reform that call the
sustainability of the gains into question. There has been an increasing tendency to treat state secretaries
as political appointees or to remove from them essential HR management functions. Thus the original
aim of de-politicizing the civil service appears to be undermined. This practice became particularly clear
after the closure of the operation. The MU rating also reflects the fact that the operation was
unrealistically ambitious, excessively broad, poorly benchmarked, and focused on the passage of laws in
an environment in which implementation was extremely weak. It is also difficult in some areas, perhaps
because of weak monitoring, to document outcomes in the performance of the public sector.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Part of the expected impact was a system of improved social service delivery. The M&E data do not
provide information on outcomes related to poverty impacts. However, the enactment of a single-payer
health system and the implementation of the health sector SWAP are expected to improve outcomes of
health care delivery. The institution of categorical grants is expected to improve delivery of education
services which would reduce poverty by improving financing for rural schools. However, as explained
above, implementation was delayed because of a failure to recognize that the institutional basis for the
implementation of categorical grants was not in place. This part of the program is now on track and is
expected to produce positive outcomes with respect to poverty and social development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The reform of the civil service was the central institutional change with civil servants now being recruited
under a due process approach (see Table 4). This process withstood a change of government by
revolution and continues to operate. Recruitment is overseen by the CSMA, which was created with
GSAC support, and which, by all accounts, has maintained its institutional integrity. Transparency has
become increasingly institutionalized as well, particularly with regard to asset disclosure by political and
civil servants, elimination of extra-budgetary accounts and special accounts from regulatory fees and fines
that used to enrich specific civil servants, and access to public information (Table 4). Combining the
GSAC with a TA, the GTAC, also strengthened institutions by funding training and technical advisors.
Most of the resources of GTAC were allocated to improving the functioning of the Treasury system and,
therefore, GSAC-supported improvements to budget execution.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

None reported.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Neither a specific beneficiary survey, nor a stakeholder workshop was conducted as this ICR is not an
Intensive Learning ICR.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The country context for comprehensive civil service reform was more challenging than anticipated.
Although the Civil Service reform was sustained to a degree after the Tulip Revolution when a new
government came to power, there has been some backtracking to the extent that the risk to sustainability
remains high. It was recently reported that ministers of two major ministries (Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Economic Development and Trade) had issued internal ministerial decrees on functional
assignments, which maintained that human resources policy and management are the responsibilities of
ministers (and not of State Secretaries), which is counter to the CS law. The Civil Service agency, it was
reported, once again has competent leadership. Nevertheless, previous efforts at public sector reform,
such as those supported by the Bank in the 1990s, were reversed, and the same appears possible again.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009              18


There are also the weaknesses in implementation of the Law on Administrative Procedures, the Chamber
of Accounts Law, and unresolved technical issues in the MOJ's publication of draft legislation, which
will need to be addressed in the near future. The improvements to social service delivery are still untested
because key measures were only recently implemented.

The global economic crisis that hit in late 2008 generally does not pose a serious risk to the sustainability
of outcomes the GSAC program. The reason is that the GSAC achievements are of a governance nature
that does not require substantial financial expenditures. One area where the global crisis, through its
effects on growth and public revenues could threaten GSAC outcomes is in the area of civil service
compensation. With increasing strains on the budget it will be more difficult for the Government to
preserve the real increase in civil service salaries which is an important component of civil service
reform, and particularly for maintaining a merit-based civil service.

The influence of well-connected officials in the operation of successful private sector enterprises remains
a serious concern. Though it is somewhat outside the scope of the GSAC program, such interference
could threaten the modest gains from the program. For these reasons, the ICR concurs with the most
recent ISRs, which acknowledge that the risk to development outcome remains high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Although GSAC was extensively reviewed by management, the fundamental flaws remained: an overly
ambitious set of reforms to be accomplished in too brief a time span, with inadequate government
ownership and understanding by the authorities of the implications of the reforms.                            The Public
Expenditure Review (PER) March 2003, which was the key AAA underpinning the design of the GSAC
demonstrated the excessive optimism with respect to the Government's ability to implement far reaching
institutional change. In addition to recommending comprehensive tax, energy and education reform, all
of which were placed in the "short-term" program, the PER also included in short-term program "the
creation of a professional and stable civil service that is clearly differentiated from political appointees."
Management, particularly the Country Director, expressed strong reservations whether a meaningful
program could be accomplished in some areas of governance, particularly in civil service reform.

The operation went forward because it was clear that poor governance was a key obstacle to development
and because it had the endorsement of public sector management experts in the Bank. Formally it was
also a central plank of the Government's development strategy. The operation suffered from the fact that
ownership was superficial, and perhaps because of a lack of a real strategy of how to initiate a wide
ranging institutional reform process in institutionally weak environments.                          The Bank had previous
experience in public sector reform in the mid-1990s, and very little of the gains from that period were
sustained. Thus, GSAC fell to the general Bank tendency to create Christmas tree programs and over
commit the borrower relative to its political capital to carry out reforms according to a tight timeframe.
Still, the tranche conditions were relevant to priority governance issues with the exception of the
condition relating to categorical education grants, which did not fit the Kyrgyz government structure and
had to be waived (see Section 2.1). The lack of program targets and baselines in many cases, along with
the lack of a coherent process for collecting monitoring indicators added to the future supervision
challenges of this operation. Thus, a rating of Unsatisfactory is appropriate.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009         19


(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

The supervision of the program was detailed and constructive in aiding implementation, particularly in
creating and amending laws required for an upgraded governance framework. Because progress was
being made in areas of Treasury and service delivery, as well as the legislative and operational gains in
civil service, it was decided to extend the closing date four separate times. It was a correct decision to
continue the operation post-revolution because essentially the same governance challenges faced the new
government as well, and to cease the operation, given the time it would take to re-engage and prepare a
new Bank operation, would have posed an unacceptable risk of losing many of the gains achieved by
March 2005 (see section 3.2 for more details on this decision). Continuing the GSAC also helped lead to
other Bank-supported operations such as the health sector SWAP and the Public Finance Capacity
Building operation.

One criticism of the supervision phase was that the lack of M&E framework in the design of the program
was effectively not remedied during implementation. ISRs tracked progress with respect to PDOs, but
did not make systematic use of the indicators described in the policy matrix. ISR ratings appeared
reasonable including the period from the end of 2004 through 2005 when the GSAC program went off
track and was rated unsatisfactory for both implementation and achievement of development objectives.

The country office provided fully satisfactory support to the operation, which included the intensive
involvement of the operations officer for the full life of the program. The TTL was stationed in Almaty
for just over one year of the program (2007-08) and was also country economist over the period 2005-
2008, which facilitated closer supervision at a critical time for the reform program. Supervision also had
the unusual advantage of having a sector manager who had previously worked as a TTL for adjustment
operations in the Kyrgyz Republic several years before.                      The Sector Manager had witnessed the
limitations (and reversals) of earlier reform efforts and was, according to program team members, able to
set a tone of realism during supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The combination of unsatisfactory performance of the Bank at preparation and satisfactory at supervision
leads to a moderately unsatisfactory performance overall. Advocating on behalf of an overly ambitious
program is not serving the best interests of the client. The efficiency of Bank resource use clearly could
have been better had the design been better tailored to the country context. However, the GSAC realized
important achievements for a modest amount of IDA resources. Thus, in terms of effectiveness of Bank
resources, the Bank program could be viewed as worthwhile, despite the significant shortcomings.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

It is true that the government could not control the events which led to the March 2005 `Tulip
Revolution,' which delayed the program. In addition, the political debate on HIPC was unavoidable and
impeded dialogue and any possible restructuring of the program.                          The Government did meet the
conditions of the three tranches with no really substantial waivers. However, the government, on too
many occasions took actions that were contrary to the core objectives of the program, particularly civil

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    20


service reform, including the appointment by the President of his sister-in-law to head the Civil Service
agency, as well as the difficulties in procurement and Chamber of Control reforms.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Ministry of Finance was the main implementing agency, and was generally effective in pushing
forward the GSAC program, but there were 11 other agencies involved in implementing some portion of
the GSAC-supported program. Overall, implementing agencies (IAs) struggled to implement the reforms.
Among these, in addition to the Ministry of Finance, the CSMA and the Ministry of Health performed
well. In the case of the CSMA, the early leadership of the first Director was relatively strong and there
was some pressure on government agencies to separate political changes from civil service management
and increase merit hiring. After some stagnation after the revolution, the current leadership of the agency
has been able to renew leading role of the agency in reforming the civil service. Visible high level
support from the government is still needed.

However, it was difficult for some agencies, including the Administration of the President and the
Procurement Agency to internalize the need and rationale for the governance reforms. This weak
ownership, together with institutional instability, sometimes led to these agencies to support actions
which ran contrary to the reform program.

Justification of Rating for Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The program achieved important gains in key areas, but it was a constant struggle during supervision to
keep the Government from reversing course in the reform program. The good performance of some
agencies has to be set against poorer performance in others, and thus leads to a moderately unsatisfactory
rating overall.

6. Lessons Learned

The cost side of overly complex programs needs to be thoroughly considered

Very complex programs strain the political capital available to leaders. In the case of GSAC, the leaders
had to expend political capital with respect to reforms in public procurement, public expenditure
management, asset declaration of public servants and major civil service reform, all of which clearly
taxed the already thin reform commitment to the point that there were major delays and risks to
sustainability. The Bank needs to acknowledge the pressures to create overly complex programs on both
the borrower (from the ministries) and the Bank side (from the sectors) and find ways to resist over-
complicating project designs and achieve greater focus, particularly in country contexts like Kyrgyzstan.

Development Policy operations are less effective as instruments to support institutional reforms in
poor countries with low implementation capacity

The inherent difficulty of ensuring ownership, together with the implementation gap between the passing
of laws and their implementation, which was clearly observable in the Kyrgyz Republic, implies that
there is a strong incentive to accepting reforms proposed by donors, even when both the ability and
willingness to implement them are absent. The conditionality of a development policy operation will

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009        21


only be effective when policy decisions can be enforced, the conditions are modest and well crafted for
the local environment, there is real government ownership and there is extensive TA and time for
implementation. These conditions were largely absent in the Kyrgyz Republic for the GSAC and other
Development Policy operations.

Public expenditure reforms require a shorter timeline than do civil service reforms

The Bank-supported program design needs to reflect the reality that comprehensive civil service reforms
and public expenditure management cannot be accomplished on the same time schedule; civil service
reforms take significantly longer to achieve, depending not only on major shifts in long-held attitudes
toward hiring, but also the Government's very ability to pay a decent salary to civil servants. To put
public expenditure and civil service reform on the same time schedule and expecting full implementation
is not realistic.

Narrower scope may yield better implementation of civil service reforms

To achieve better results and within the short timeframe of a policy operation, civil service reform could
be scaled down to either of a couple of options:                    reforms that affect only a certain top layer of
management, as was implemented in Albania; or a pilot reform that focuses on selected ministries,
possibly the Ministry of Finance, rather than all ministries at once. If senior management is appropriately
recruited, it can lead to improved recruitment at lower levels. The ministries can then ensure a higher
quality, less pro forma, due process recruitment.

Additional caution in program design is needed in countries with pending elections

The Bank did not tailor the design of GSAC to the risks of disruption of elections scheduled before the
end of the program. More caution is needed even if the consensus is that there will be no change of
government.

Analytic work needs to make realistic recommendations if program design is to be realistic

The fact that there is analytic work underpinning an operation is no guarantee that the operation will be
appropriately designed.          The analytic work itself, while technically sound, may have unrealistic
recommendations for the time frame of a policy operation. The PER (March 2003), in particular,
included a wide range of profound institutional and policy reforms, such as depoliticizing the civil service,
as part of the "short-term" program.

The act of computerization of Treasury operations and streamlining operational processes carry
substantial governance benefits:

     Better reconciliations with the banking system
     Greater detail, better classified budgets, that are also published
     Ability to carry out audits more quickly.
     Reduction of the gap between planned vs. actual

The Bank does not learn adequately from previous experience

A broad institutional lesson from this operation is that the Bank often does not learn from its own
experience. At review meetings for GSAC, it was reported that no analog could be presented of a similar

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    22


program succeeding in an environment similar to that of the Kyrgyz Republic. If such analogs cannot be
found, then program designs need to be scaled back.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Government drafted a Borrower's contribution and, in addition, a draft ICR was circulated to the
borrower and implementing agencies on January 22, 2009. A response was received only on March 4,
2009, after the ICR had been approved. Nevertheless the ICR was withdrawn and now reflects this
response. Both the Borrower's contribution and the response to the draft ICR are shown in Annex 4.

In the response to the draft ICR the Ministry of Finance provided additional data on the results of the
implementation of the GSAC program, which have now been incorporated into this ICR. The response
also mentions the Ministry of Justice legal database, which the ICR described as no longer existing. As
the response, notes this database is no longer available to the public (its principal purpose). Thus the ICR
has been corrected to say that it is no longer available to the public.

The government response also questions the evaluation of moderately unsatisfactory for the overall
outcome of the program. While it is recognized that civil service reform is a long and difficult process
and some progress was made, the central issue is that program was over-ambitious as regarding what
could reasonably be achieved (a joint responsibility of the Bank and the authorities). However, as is
explained in Section 4, developments since the closure of the credit indicate that the authorities are
implementing measures contrary to the central principles of the Civil Service Law (assigning human
resource management to ministers rather than state secretaries, and removing state secretaries from their
positions as if they were political appointees). Such measures imply a high risk that any progress made so
far may be reversed. In the response to the draft ICR it is mentioned that the reversals by the Government
were political in nature, but since the depoliticization of the Civil Service was a central goal of the
program, this is a serious problem.

Finally the response questioned the assessment of the performance of the President's Administration, the
Government Office and the Ministry of Justice. In the first case, given that many of the reversals of the
GSAC program originated in the President's Administration, and that after May 2005 the President's
Administration did not effectively coordinate the implementation of the program, there can be little doubt
that these made implementation of the program slower and more difficult. It was decided however that
rather than formally rating the performance of individual agencies it was more appropriate to consider an
overall rating for the authorities performance, and so the table of ratings for individual agencies was
deleted. The overall rating balances good performance by some agencies with weaker performance in
others with an overall rating of moderately unsatisfactory. This corresponds also the Bank's moderately
unsatisfactory performance in agreeing with the authorities on an unrealistic and over ambitious program,
without sufficiently deep ownership.

(b) Cofinanciers

Annex 5 contains comments submitted from the IMF, UNDP and the European Commission. These
comments are essentially consistent with the conclusions of the Bank ICR. One exception is the comment
from the IMF that it might have been better to cancel the GSAC after March 2005. The ICR addresses
this point in Section 3.2 which summarizes the pros and cons of this issue, and argues that the decision to

Note on IMF PRGF

The PRGF program targeted a reduction in the fiscal deficit of the general government, consistent with
the balance of payments adjustment needed to address the country's external debt problems. The key
elements of this effort were an increase in collections of tax revenue through a combination of measures
that include, a broadening of the tax base and improvements in tax administration led by the
establishment of a modern Large Taxpayer Unit, as well as expenditure restraint. The PRGF program
also required the pursuance of a debt strategy, including seeking debt relief from Paris Club creditors on
Naples terms, a reduction in the size of the Public Investment Program, and limiting external borrowing to
loans with high levels of concessionality.                The program anticipated the implementation of a tight
monetary policy in support of low inflation and a stable nominal exchange rate. Structural reforms in the
PRGF program focused on governance and financial sector reforms.

As regards governance, the PRGF identified measures in the areas of institution building, public
awareness, efficiency of public administration, corporate governance and judicial reforms. In this regard,
it particularly emphasized the restructuring of the Ministry of Finance as a key step to improve the
administration of public finances. In the financial sector, reforms of bank supervision, improvements of
the regulatory framework, the enhancement of debt recovery capacity, the divestiture of state-owned
banks, and the development of the payments system were key priorities.

Report on the GSAC Project Implementation--Civil Service and Asset Declaration
(contribution received December 14, 2008)

Overview

The project has significantly enhanced overall effectiveness of the civil service workings in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The enactment of the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Civil Service" and "On Declaring and
Publicizing Data on Incomes, Liabilities and Assets Owned by Persons Holding Political and Other
Distinctive Government Posts and Their Close Relatives" in 2004 have laid a foundation for an advanced
and brand new system established to organize and manage the civil service.

Public posts were divided into policy-making and administrative posts, principles of competitive
admission to the administrative segment of the civil service were introduced, A Civil Service Council was
established to set a development strategy in the given area, and a working body of the Council ­ Civil
Service Agency - was established to develop and implement a uniform public policy.

Another important achievement is establishment of the institute of state secretaries in all the ministries,
state committees and administrative agencies (with some exceptions) as well as in other central bodies of
the public administration system pursuant to the Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic No 376
as of November 3 2004. Presently, the positions of state secretaries are filled in 31 governmental bodies.

The President K.S. Bakiev held a working meeting on May 23 2008 to discuss the most urgent issues
related to state secretary's functioning and to set further objectives. This is an indicator of the importance
of civil service issues given at the highest government level, thus halting negative practices by some state
officers tending to inhibit operations of the state secretaries. This signals that it is time to open a position
of a state secretary in the law enforcement agencies in order to implement uniform public policies more
effectively in the civil service system.

The implementation of the law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Civil Service" has brought some of its
shortcomings into light, including contradicting norms, technical and stylistic errors, thus leading to
ambiguities in interpretations and preventing a uniform application of the law.                          For example, the
operations of the Civil Service Agency comprise workings of the policy-makers and distinctive civil
servants related to declarations of the earnings and assets owned. Hence, the Agency's authority shall not
include such areas as admission of such public servants to civil service, their performance evaluation and
qualifications upgrade and training.

The current situation results in lack of systemic approach to the civil service issues, waste of public
resources and prevents development and implementation of uniform public policies in the civil service.
To this end, representatives of the President's Administration, the Prime-Minister's Office as well as
GSAC/GTAC consultants and the Agency developed a draft law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On the Public
Civil Service," which sets forth discretions, organization and main principles of the civil service workings
taking the undergoing reforms into account as well as expanding the authority of the Agency related to
developing policies in the area of public administration.

The above draft law regulates operations of the public civil service, stipulates institutional capacity
building measures for the civil service management, sets forth improvement of staff selection and civil
servants promotion mechanisms for better qualified staff, and heightens social and legal protection of the

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    29


civil servants. Based on recommendation of the Administration of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic,
the draft law comprises a separate chapter on the provisions of the Ethics Code for the civil servants,
which had been earlier developed by the Agency in cooperation with the GSAC/GTAC project
consultants. The Agency submitted the draft law to the Administration of the President of the Kyrgyz
Republic for further submission for consideration by the State Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Recruitment of Civil Service Personnel

The Agency in cooperation, with state secretaries of the government agencies, introduced a procedure for
competitive selection of applicants to fill vacant positions available with the administrative civil service.
There is a tendency toward the reduction of cases when vacant positions in the civil service were filled in
a manner contradicting the legislation. This way, according to the data submitted to the Agency by
various government agencies, unlawful appointments amounted to more than 60 percent of the total civil
service appointments in 2005, the figure contracted to 13,7 percent in 2006 and reached 3,9 percent in
2007.

         Civil Service Applicant Testing

Besides, operations of the certification and selection committees within the government agencies,
established to set certification procedures to check if the civil servants fit the positions held and to
conduct professional assessment tests for ranking purposes, were streamlined. To this end, in order to
implement Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  77 as of February 28 2007, the Agency,
under counseling and financial support of the GSAC/GTAC project, established a Test Center, which was
opened on April 16 2008 in presence of the Prime-Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. I.V.Chudinov.

Opening and operation of the Test Center is a significant step toward the implementation of anti-
corruption measures identified as one of important areas in the Country Development Strategy approved
by Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  249 as of May 16 2007.
Use of the most recent IT technologies in the Test Center helps eliminate some elements of corruption
practices and rules out a possibility of forging the test results, increases transparency and strengthens
impartiality of the competitive selection, certification and professional assessment processes.             The
Agency has developed and approved the following provisions:

     «On the Test Center of the Civil Service Agency of the Kyrgyz» ( 74 as of September 22
         2008);
     «On the Procedure for testing civil servants and applicants for vacant administrative public posts
         in the Kyrgyz Republic » ( 75 as of September 22 2008).

At present, mandatory computer-based tests for applicants for vacant administrative public posts are
conducted in the Test Center for civil service competitive staff selections. Also, efforts are made to
establish Test Center branches in the Southern and Northern Representative Offices of the Agency (Osh
and Balykchy towns). The tests are designed to check the candidates' knowledge in the areas of state
structure, public administration, basics of civil service, management issues, human resources management,
paperwork as well as special issues pertinent to workings of the ministries and agencies. To this end, the
Agency developed Terms of Reference for experts to design subject-matter and special purpose issues. It
is necessary to note that the Agency preliminarily submitted a proposal, for consideration of relevant
government agencies, to use the Test Center to test the knowledge and skills of the candidates for the
positions of judges, registers of births, marriages and deaths and notary officers.

Pursuant to Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  77 as of February 28 2007, the Agency
shall:

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    30



     provide counseling and methodology assistance on issues of organizing and operating a civil
         service to all government agencies;
     monitor and supervise operations of the government agencies related to compliance with the
         current legislation on the civil service, including competitive selection procedures undertaken to
         fill vacant administrative government posts and to certify civil servants.

A system was introduced to ensure regular submission of information by the government agencies in line
with the agency reporting formats as per the law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On the Civil Service" approved
by resolution of the National Statistics Committee of the KR No18 as of August 22 2007. Monthly
memos on the appointments and dismissals of administrative civil servants are submitted to the
President's Administration, Prime-Minister's Office, the World Bank Country Office and is posted on the
Agency's web-site. Moreover, pursuant to the order  79 issued by the Agency on November 10 
2006, the Agency staff members are members of the certification and selection committees of the
government agencies for the purpose of rendering methodological assistance.

In order to improve effectiveness of the civil service management, the Agency, under the GSAC/GTAC
project, is undertaking work aimed at developing and introducing HR Management Information System
(HRMIS). With support of the GSAC/GTAC project, pilot modules of the HRMIS have been developed
and are presently introduced.

         Civil Service Training

In 2008, the Agency undertook analysis of the training of administrative civil servants based on the
information submitted by 45 government agencies for 2007. It is worthwhile to note that Article 21 of the
law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Civil Service" establishes allocation of funds from the state budget to
conduct training for administrative civil servants based on the rate of no less than 1% of the total
budgetary allocation to the particular government agency. At the same time, in 2007, none of the
government agencies allocated full amounts of the funds for staff training purposes as stipulated by the
above law.

According to instruction of the President's Administration, the issue is being addressed by the Agency in
cooperation with the Ministry of Finance of the KR. This way, from 2009 onward, allocation of funds for
the administrative civil servants training is planned to be a separate expenditure item, thus facilitating
task-oriented use of the funds pursuant to the law.
In accordance with the tasks legally imposed on the state secretaries and HR officers of the government
agencies, the Agency developed appropriate standard training programs. Besides, training seminars are
conducted on a regular basis, annually, with support of the GSAC/GTAC project.

With a view to develop a uniform training system for civil servants and to design mechanisms for its
management, presently, the Agency supported by the GSAC/GTAC project, drafted a National Strategy
for the Civil Servants Training in the Kyrgyz Republic, which is based on comprehensive analysis of the
existing training system.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Civil Service", the Agency established a
National HR Reserve (NHRR) by means of carrying out competitions among the administrative civil
servants and university graduates. Overall, nation-wide, 955 people took part in the competitions in
2006-2008, where 646 are administrative civil servants and 309 are university graduates. At present, the
NHRR comprises 84 administrative civil servants and 69 university graduates.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    31


More than one third of the HR reserve (38,3%) have two and more higher educations, 15,7%
administrative civil servants participated in the professional upgrade courses held overseas, 11,9% - were
educated abroad. Administrative civil servants with a background in Economics (29%), Engineering
(15,9%) and Law (16%) are prevalent. 13 percent of the HR reserve have master's degrees and 9 percent
­ completed post-graduate studies. About 51,1 percent of the HR reserve presently hold managerial
positions at the levels of division heads and deputy department heads. 32 HR reserve (21%) were
appointed to fill vacant administrative civil service posts.

The Agency conducts training courses for the reserve personnel on modern approaches to HR
management, public policy analysis and development, normative document drafting systems and
methodologies and civil service ethics code development.

Declaration of Assets of Public Officials

Articles 33-35 of the law of the Kyrgyz Republic «On Civil Service» and the law of the KR «On
Declaring and Publicizing Data on Incomes, Liabilities and Assets Owned by Persons Holding Political
and Other Distinctive Government Posts and Their Close Relatives» stipulate submissions of declarations
on earnings and assets owned by the policy-makers and distinctive and administrative civil servants to the
Civil Service Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic.
As a result of declaration campaign held in 2008, the Agency received 1395 declarations of earnings,
liabilities and assets owned by the policy-makers and distinctive civil servants and 15141 declarations -
from the administrative civil servants. The Agency conducted workshops in 2007-08 for senior officers
of the central apparatus within 57 government agencies.

By end of the declaration campaigns for 2005­2008, aggregated data on the earnings and assets owned by
the policy-makers and distinctive civil servants were publicized through the mass media. Additionally,
data on the policy-makers and distinctive civil servants who failed to submit their declarations to the
Agency were publicized through the mass media, posted on the Agency's web-site and reported to the
President, the Prime-Minister and Chairman of the State Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Conclusion

Hence, implementation of the GSAC/GTAC project helped introduce a new institutional base for the civil
service system, increase transparency of earnings and assets owned by the civil servants as well as
processes for admission to the civil service and working in the civil service system. These factors, on their
turn, being based on the international best practices and being advanced by nature, have significantly
increased effectiveness of the civil service.

At the same time, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is hopeful to receive further support from the
World Bank to be used to improve the current institutional mechanisms of the civil service operations,
with special emphasis on the regulatory foundations, which will be in line with the forthcoming
discussions of the draft law "On Public Civil Service" to be held in the State Parliament of the Kyrgyz
Republic. Moreover, there is a need for funding of the activities aimed at ensuring further operations of
the Test Center, professional qualifications upgrade for the state secretaries and HR officers of the
government agencies, and introducing the HR Management Information System.

Comments and Suggestions on the Draft Report on Completion and Results of the GSAC Project2
(contribution received March 4, 2009)

    1. Table 3: Certain key initiatives, results and potential outcomes of the program's
         implementation with GSAC support:

    1) Section 1. "Strengthening the transparency and increasing the public sector's response in line
         with expansion of civil society's opportunities to control its accountability".

         In our view the following clarifications and additions need to be made:

    -    in paragraph (i) "Increase of personal responsibility of political officials and civil servants". In
         the area recording the result of the second indicator being "Declared information on income and
         property of civil servants is available to public" it is stated that "This condition is fulfilled,
         however the data on the number of declarations is unavailable".

         This condition has in fact been fulfilled, because all the declarations of civil servants holding
         political and special posts that were submitted to the Kyrgyz Republic Agency on Civil Service
         Affairs were published in mass media and accordingly made available to public.

         However, as far as the information on the number of declarations available to public is concerned,
         this information was recorded in the results of the first indicator being "The number of published
         and reviewed declarations of the civil servants holding high posts", which was provided to the
         World Bank earlier. This data is stated below:
         976 declarations of the civil servants holding political and special posts were submitted to the
         Agency in 2005, representing 90% of the total number of acting civil servants.
         905 declarations representing 91.3% of the total number of acting civil servants were submitted in
         2006.
                   976 declarations representing 98.5% of the total number of acting civil servants were
         submitted in 2007.
                   1395 declarations representing 99.1% of the total number of acting civil servants were
         provided in 2008.

Accordingly, all the data required on the above mentioned indicators confirming fulfillment of this
condition is available in full and has earlier been provided to the World Bank by the GSAC/GTAC
project implementation group.

- in paragraph (ii) "Strengthening the opportunities for open expression of opinions and participation by
way of improved public access to the official information". In the area recording the result of fulfilling
the second indicator being "The number of non-government organizations and private individuals using
State Public Information Center services", it is stated that "There is no data". However, the information
on this indicator stated below, has also been earlier provided to the World Bank by the GSAC/GTAC
project implementation group.

The services of the Public Information Center are being used by numerous categories of citizens (school
children, students, scientific workers, civil and public servants, pensioners and unemployed) as well
various organizations. For instance, the conference room facilities are being used on average by 10-15


2The response to the government's comments is shown in Section 7.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    33


organizations per annum. The reading room is being visited by up to 500 persons per annum. The
computer room is being utilized by up to 10 thousand persons per annum. Additionally, the civil services
web site has been created (http://www.govservices.kg) and is being maintained. Over 75 141 visits have
been registered on this civil services web site over the period of its operation.
Accordingly, all the data required for the second indicator and confirming fulfillment of this condition is
available, and GSAC/GTAC project implementation group has earlier provided the same to the World
Bank.

     -   We also believe that in paragraph (ii) being "Strengthening of opportunities for open expression
         of opinions and participation by way of improved public access to the official information" the
         indicator on "Consistent modem access to the Ministry of Justice legal data base" is missing.
         Significant funding to fulfill this condition has been allocated and spent from the GTAC project
         on the purchase of goods and consultancy services for the Ministry of Justice as well as for
         training of its specialists in information technologies.

The information on full completion of this task per the above indicator has also been earlier provided to
the World Bank by GSAC/GTAC project implementation group.
In this regard, with a view of creating a unified information system of the Ministry of Justice, improving
the information legal field and providing the public with an open access to draft laws and other legal
information developed by state authorities, modernization of the Ministry of Justice data base has been
carried out and the same was connected to the Internet. The Ministry's IT specialists have also undergone
training. The Ministry of Justice data base is being regularly updated and added to and the public's
access to the same is ensured via the information network resource of the Ministry of Justice
(www.minjust.gov.kg). The success and effectiveness of the Ministry of Justice website is evident by the
fact that in January 2008 the Ministry of Justice site won the 1st prize in the Best Website Competition
among the ministries and departments of the Kyrgyz Republic, carried out in October 2007 by the UNDP
Program on "Democratic Development" together with the Ministry of Transport and Communications of
the Kyrgyz Republic.

     2) Section II. "Improvement of effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of the public sector"
In paragraph (v) "Improvement of the civil service effectiveness" in the area recording the result of the
third indicator fulfillment being "The average number of applications for vacant civil service positions" it
is stated that "There is no data".
However, the data on this indicator for the past three years has been earlier provided to the World Bank
by the GSAC/GTAC project implementation group, namely:

         On average there were 4 applications submitted for one vacant public administrative position in
         2006.
         In 2007, the average number of applications per one vacant position was 2.4.
         In 2008 (11 months), the average number of applications per one vacant position was 2.6.

Accordingly, the data for this indicator evidencing fulfillment of the requirements of the paragraph (V) is
also available and has been provided to the World Bank.

2. Section 3.4 Justification of the Overall Results Assessment.

This section of the report states, that the evaluation is brought down to the level of "moderately
unsatisfactory" due to the cases of deviation from the reforms on a number of work directions, especially
in the area of the civil service reform. It would be difficult to accept this statement, because the same
report gives quite a high assessment of the works carried out in the area of the civil service system
reforms. In particular, the World Bank confirms the fact that the civil service reform was the principle

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    34


institutional transformation, which survived the Government's change in the result of the revolution and
continues to function. This is also confirmed by the fact that despite certain attempts to politicize the
system of civil service following the revolution, it was possible to a certain extent avoid the same having
adopted the legislation on the civil service and having established the Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic on
Civil Service and the State Secretary Institute which is functioning successfully.
We would agree with the fact that there were certain actions on behalf of the Government, which
contradicted the general direction of the civil service reform (appointment by the former country's
President of his wife's sister as the State Secretary of the Kyrgyz Republic Agency on the Civil Service
Affairs, the attempt to liquidate the posts of the State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, information
about violations of the civil service legislation by certain ministers with regard to lawful allocation of the
State Secretary functions). At the same time, we deem it necessary to point out that these actions have a
political inclination and are not systematic. The deviations from the objectives of the reform have been
and presently are temporary, which once again reiterates the necessity of further development of the
initiated transformations. We deem it possible having established the Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic on
Civil Service Affairs, the activities of which were quite highly assessed ­ namely "Satisfactorily" (Table
4 "Assessments Summary of Certain Executing Agencies").

The World Bank has also made a completely objective and correct conclusion about the fact that
significantly more time is required to carry out the reforms in the civil service sector.
Accordingly, within the framework of GSAC program, it was possible to achieve significant advancement
in the area of modernizing the system of the Kyrgyz Republic Civil Service and we would suggest to
exclude from the text of the reviewed Report the statements referring to the project assessment results
having been brought down due to the cases of deviation from the reforms in the civil service sector.

3. Table 4: Summary Assessment of Certain Executive Agencies

1) In this table, the activities of the Kyrgyz Republic President's Administration are assessed as
unsatisfactory. However, we believe that this assessment of their activities on implementation of the
GSAC project is far from being objective. It needs to be stated that despite frequent personnel changes
within the President's Administration, it was due to the coordination and the decisions made by the
President's Administration that the majority of the key conditions of the GSAC program were
implemented, despite significant resistance on behalf of certain conservative politicians. In this regard, we
would propose to give a higher evaluation of the President's Administration for their input towards the
implementation of the GSAC program.

2) We consider Government performance as satisfactory as the Government of the KR took active
participation in the drafting and adjusting normative and legal acts.

3) In the "Notes" Column, under the Ministry of Justice it is stated that the Legal Information Data Base,
for the modernization of which significant GTAC project funding was allocated, is no longer in existence.
This does not reflect the reality. Such data base does exist in the Ministry and was regularly updated and
actualized. However, the access to the same is temporarily unavailable because of the repair and
construction works taking place in the building of the Ministry of Justice as well as certain difficulties
having aroused in hiring and retaining of qualified IT specialists. As you're aware, after a long break, a
State Secretary was appointed in the Ministry of Justice in October 2008 in accordance with the
legislation on civil service, i.e. following competitive selection. At this time the personnel procedures are
being normalized in the Ministry, namely they are being brought in compliance with the legislation on
civil service, and we hope that qualified IT specialists will be hired and following completion of the
repairs the legal information data base will be again accessible for public use in the near future.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

International Monetary Fund

From the narrow perspective of the Fund, the main benefit of GSAC came with the final disbursement.
The timing was fortuitous since it stabilized the government finances when government finances were
under some pressure. The additional financing allowed the authorities to avoid any short term cash-
induced expenditure reductions. Nevertheless, direct fiscal support was not the primary goal of GSAC.

In terms of the wider objectives of GSAC (public sector transparency, accountability, efficiency), the
major constraint was a lack of progress on PFM. Since the demise of HIPC, there has been virtually no
movement in this area. Obviously, the change in government was partly to blame. It was probably
difficult for the Bank to get the new government to endorse the original GSAC reform agenda, since it
was agreed by the old regime. In retrospect, it might have been better to cancel the original GSAC after
March 2005 and negotiate a new arrangement in the hope that there would be more ownership of the
reform agenda.

The lack of progress on PFM also suggests an important lesson. It might have been a good idea to link
some of the GSAC conditionality directly to treasury reform. The original policy matrix had a strong bias
towards legislative conditionality (new laws, regulations amendments etc). However, some conditionality
on upgrading the MoF's infrastructure, better budgetary control etc could have been helpful. There was
probably a greater recognition of PFM reform ­ both directly and indirectly (in terms of a more forthright
discussion of corruption) - in the third tranche disbursement document.

As for key achievements, the government has made some progress towards improving the interaction
between regulatory agencies and the business sector, particularly in the area of legislative reform. The
GSAC conditionality laid the groundwork for the more recent improvements in the doing business survey,
although there remains a significant implementation gap.

UNDP/Kyrgyz Republic and WB GSAC Programme

1. The UNDP democratic governance programme has coordinated some aspects of its activities with the
    WB GSAC programme and several of its activities were closely related to individual GSAC
    objectives. Some of the examples are given below:

         a. in response to Kyrgyz Government request for assistance in creating of efficient and
               streamlined administrative structures, UNDP jointly with DFID provided the expert and
               technical support in accelerating the process of the reform and creating the capacity for the
               development of a professional civil service and modern public administration. Functional
               Reviews conducted together with Kyrgyz Government became tools to define the goals,
               objectives and functions of the state administrative bodies in the Kyrgyz Republic.
         b. Other parts of the UNDP programme, notably the Information Communication Technologies
               for Development (ICTD), the Public Administration and the Anti-Corruption component
               supported the GSAC goals (iv) voice and participation, (iii) streamlining the structure of
               government (ii) improving service delivery and (i) improving personal accountability through
               piloting e-services, functional reviews, capacity building of the civil service agency.
         c. During 2007-2008 UNDP Democratic Governance Programme and GSAC programme jointly
              supported development of the Civil Service Law and Code of Conduct. Eventually the Code
              of Conduct became the biggest part of the Civil Service Law.
         d. Current support to the Civil Service Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic is
              another example of programmes cooperation. Both programmes contributed into
              establishment of the Testing Centers for civil servants in the northern and southern part of the
              country, developing their database, equipping and installing the software, improvement and
              development of testing system modules, updating of the web-site of the Civil Service Agency,
              and conducting trainings on Human Resources Management Informative System to the
              human resources departments of the Governmental bodies

2. At the same time it should be noted that while GSAC main support went to central government
    institutions, a large part of the UNDP programme focused on local governance in order to support
    local economic development. Through its support to the Agency of Local Self Government and to the
    Ministry of Finance it supported inter alia the GSAC goals (iv) strengthening voice and participation
    and (v) public expenditure management. UNDP training programmes and technical assistance were
    undertaken in close cooperation and coordination with the WB, DFID, USAID and the EC.

3. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is still engaged in efforts to reform and modernize its
    institutions and policies. The next phase of the reform program will be continued in Judicial area,
    Public Administration, Local Self-governance and decentralization as well as anti-corruption work
    and increasing the transparency of the state. The achievement of macroeconomic stability, further
    strengthening of a favorable business and investment climate, structural changes and improving the
    effectiveness of social services and social policy are remaining among most important reform areas.

4. A few general lessons learned should be mentioned:

         a. Governance reforms require a longer term approach and sustainable commitment from the
              partners.
         b. They work best where linked to measurable results like in public finance or in service
              provision ­ and less when they are addressing `rules and procedures' e.g. in civil service
              reform.

Our understanding of GSAC

According to the Programme document GSAC was initiated by the WB to support the Government's
program to strengthen the effectiveness of the State, namely (1) by improving the transparency and
responsiveness of the public sector and (2) by increasing efficiency, effectiveness and accountability
within the public sector. Under each objective there were several reforms supported by the WB, of which
the EC had special interest and involvement in the following:

     strengthening public expenditure management, by establishing a more strategic and transparent
         budget formulation process, and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget
         execution;
     improving the internal control environment;
     enhancing the effectiveness of the civil service; and
     streamlining the structure of Government ministries and agencies.

The special interest of the EC towards the abovementioned reforms was expressed by several projects
implemented by the EC during the implementation period of GSAC and EC budget support programmes,
which several times shared with GSAC cross disbursement conditions and were concerned with the
similar reform areas.

Our brief assessment

The WB GSAC in Kyrgyzstan was highly relevant and met both the needs of the country and the broad
development objectives. It represented a combination of relief financing and moves towards the
establishment of a framework for longer term development, and in this reflected the stage of transition of
Kyrgyzstan from a high poverty high unemployment collapsed command economy to a vibrant private
sector led market directed economy.

Rather than introduce supplementary actions to peripherally address the weaknesses, and maintain
dependence on donor assistance, the aim of GSAC was to mainstream Government structural reforms,
increase Government ownership and commitment, and focus support on efforts to build Government's
capacity to formulate, manage, and monitor programmes to realise its objectives.

Levels of poverty, particularly extreme poverty, fell significantly during the WB GSAC period, although
this was also attributed to external macroeconomic factors. Insofar these macroeconomic developments
were supported by the additional fiscal and foreign currency resources provided by the WB under GSAC,
and by its adherence to other donor reforms (including reforms supported by the EC), GSAC played an
essential role in these developments.

We believe that the delivery of GSAC was reasonably efficient. As a deficit financing instrument, the cost
of delivery was relatively small, since use of the Treasury to channel funds, even with the limitations of
the Treasury and overall PFM system, is an efficient method of utilisation of external financial aide.

Currently for us it is very difficult to assess the impact of GSAC, since it is not immediate, but we believe
that it will establish the ground for the adoption of new, deep and more sustainable reform directions. We
also understand that some of the reforms initiated under GSAC are incomplete and on-going, and they
display little sustainability as yet (this specifically refers to PFM and civil service reforms).

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit ­ Implementation Completion Report, March, 2009    38


We also believe that generally GSAC was fully coherent with other donor interventions (specifically with
EC interventions), and either complemented or lead those of other donors. The EC Delegation maintained
close relations with the WB in the key areas of reforms. Generally, both the EC through its budget
support and the WB through GSAC or other similar interventions support Government strategic directions
where they existed, and this support in harmony with broad strategic documents such as the NPRS and
CSD.
