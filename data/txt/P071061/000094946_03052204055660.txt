KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
CREDIT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Kyrgyz Republic
Amount:         SDR 14.7 million (US$ 20 million equivalent)
Terms:          IDA terms with a 40 year maturity, including a grace period of 10 years.
Objectives:     The Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) would support the Government's
program to strengthen the effectiveness of the State. It has two complementary objectives:
(a) to improve the transparency and responsiveness of the public sector and enhance the
ability of external stakeholders to hold it accountable; and (b) to increase efficiency,
effectiveness and accountability within the public sector. With regard to the first objective,
the GSAC would support reforms aimed at (i) improving personal accountability of
political officials and civil servants; (ii) strengthening voice and participation by improving
public access to official information; (iii) improving the interaction between regulatory
agencies and business enterprises; and (iv) strengthening external audit. To advance the
second objective, the operation would support reforms directed at (i) strengthening public
expenditure management, by establishing a more strategic and transparent budget
formulation process, and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget
execution; (ii) improving the internal control environment; (iii) improving transparency,
value for money and accountability in public procurement; (iv) improving service delivery
in the health and education sectors; (v) enhancing the effectiveness of the civil service; and
(vi) streamlining the structure of Government ministries and agencies.
Benefits:       The GSAC would increase the ability of citizens, civil society and the private sector to
demand improvements in State performnance. This would result from enhanced access to
information about key aspects of public sector operations and increased participation in
State activities. In parallel, the program would strengthen core competencies within the
public sector. Reforms in public expenditure management would strengthen the linkage
between policies and public spending, better align resource availability and responsibilities
at the lower levels of Government and improve efficiency, predictability and accountability
in budget execution. Reforms in public procurement would improve cost-effectiveness of
government spending on goods and services. Increased professionalism and capacity of
the civil service would provide much needed skills in critical areas of policy formulation
and execution. Finally, streamlining of the structure of Government would result in
improved administrative efficiency and coordination. On the whole, by simultaneously
strengthening the voice of external stakeholders and improving the effectiveness of the
Government machinery, the operation would enhance the ability of the State to pursue the
objectives of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS).
While reducing corruption in the Kyrgyz public sector would require sustained, long-term
efforts on many fronts, the GSAC would contribute to this cause in several ways. Some of
the reforms covered by the operation, such as publication of declarations of incomes and
assets, creation of administrative mechanisms to address grievances of citizens and the
private sector and strengthening of disciplinary rules applicable to civil servants, have a
direct anti-corruption objective. Others would address the problem indirectly through
systemic institutional reforms that increase transparency and accountability. For instance,
increased awareness of State activities and relevant rules and regulations would enable
external stakeholders to demand higher standards of conduct and integrity from public

officials. Similarly, enhanced civic part6cipation in the budget process; reduced cliscretion
and informality in budget execution resulting from modemization of treasury operations;
strengthening of internal co ritrol and external auclit functions; and increased transparency
in the procurement process would diminish opportunities for fraud and corruption in public
expenditure management. Finally, the eliminaticin of financing mechanisrns that create
perverse incentives for regulatory agenc ies would reduce the tendency of these agencies to
misuse authority.
Risks:          Improvements in public sector petfomiance take a long time to materialize and are
vulnerable to opposition from vested interests. Strong, sustained political commitmnent is
therefore absolutely necessary. Waning of political support can significantly slow or even
derail the rnforn process. 'I'he lirmited institutional capacity of the Government also poses
a serious risk. Fuither, the proposed refomis involve a large number of GovemrrLent
agencies, stakeholders and clonors. Deficiencies in coordination between these actors
could also seriously affect implementation. In order to mitigate these risks, the
government's own reform agenda, as spelled out in the NPRS, has been made the core of
the GSAC reforms, so as ensure ownership. The operation has required the Government tc,
undertake several measures before Boar(d presenlation, to demonstrate its comrnmitment to
reform. Also disbursements have been back-loaded. Significant technical assistance will
be provided to augment the Government's capacity. A broad- based project cooidination
and management structure has been created to ensure active involvement of relevant
stakeholders and close coordination of different activities. Notwithstanding these measures,
the overall risk of the operation will r.emain high This is due to the inherently difficult
nature of institutional and governance reforms, which are subject to a number of, difficult
to control, political, social and economic: variables. The high risk, is however, matched by
potentially high rewards.
Schedule of     SDR 3.675 million (US$ 5 mrillion equ'ivalent) upon Effectiveness, SDR 3.675 nmillion

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003
PROGRAM DOCUMENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT TO
THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
1.    I submit for your approval the following Program Document on a proposed Governance
Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) to the Kyrgyz Republic for the equivalent of SDR 14.7 million
(US$ 20 million). The proposed Credit is the eighth in a series of adjustment operations designed to
support the Government's overall program of stabilization and structural reform.
I.     INTRODUCTION
2.     The Kyrgyz Republic has carried out significant reforms in economic policy since independence.
However, reforms in governance and public sector management have not kept pace with the policy
reforns. Deficiencies in these areas bave emerged as major constraints in the ability of the country to
fight poverty. Accordingly, the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) gives a high priority to
improving the effectiveness of the State. It outlines a multi-dimensional strategy for this purpose,
covering reforms in democratic institutions, law making processes, the judiciary and law enforcement
agencies, public administration, public expenditure management, civil service and local self Government.
3.     Some of the reforms included in the NPRS fall outside the World Bank's mandate, while some
others are being assisted by other development partners. The proposed Governance Structural
Adjustment Credit (GSAC), would focus on institutional reforms, primarily in the Executive branch of
the State. The GSAC would have two complementary objectives: (a) to improve the transparency and
responsiveness of the public sector and enhance the ability of external stakeholders to hold it accountable;
and (b) to increase efficiency, effectiveness and accountability within the public sector.
4.    It is recognized that achieving significant, sustainable improvements in governance and public
sector performance in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a long term endeavor. The public administration in
the country is still at the initial stages of development. The capacity of the Govemment to implement
reforms is limited. Also, institutional reforms in public sector management are intrinsically complex and
difficult, as the World Bank's own record in this area indicates. Therefore, the effectiveness of the State
would have to be built up step by step, through iterative reforms spread over many years.
5.     The Government has taken several initial steps in the last few years. These include
implementation of first generation reforms in public expenditure management under the World Bank
financed Public Sector Resource Management Adjustment Credit (PSRMAC), creation of a Chamber of
Accounts, adoption of a modern Public Procurement Law, enactment of a Civil Service Law,
retrenchment of staff at the central level, reduction in the number of ministries and State bodies,
launching of a concerted action plan to remove administrative barriers to investment, establishment of
elected local self Governments, implementation of major reforms in the health sector, increasing public
access to information about the functioning of the State and efforts to encourage participation of citizens
and civil society in public affairs. Annex 2 provides details of the some of the reforms implemented in
the recent past. The GSAC represents a continuation of the reform process. In the areas covered by it,
the program is expected to deepen the reforms that have already been initiated and make incremental
improvements in the capability of the State. It would also prepare the ground for more advanced reforms
in the future.
6.     While the experience of the Government in implementing the first order reforms will be
extremely helpful, significant technical assistance (TA) would be needed to successfully implement the



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjushnent Credit - Program Document,, April .21, 2003  2
GSAC program. Important grant-based TA would be provided for many activities by other donors,
including the DFID, USAID, TJNDP, IMF and EU-TACIS. TA for the remaining activities will be
provided through the Bank financed Governance Technical Assistance Credit (GTAC), which
accompanies the GSAC.
7.     The GSAC would be disbursed in three tranches: SDR 3.67'i million (US$ 5 million equivalent)
upon Effectiveness , SDR 3.675 million (US$ in million ecluivalent) after satisfaction of second tranche
release conditions (expected in first/second quarter of 2004e), and SDR 7.350 million (US$ 10 millionl
equivalent) after satisfaction of third tranche release conditions (expected in first/second quarter of 2005).
II. TIHE ECONOMY
A.     Macroeconomic Performance and Policy Framewiork
8.     Macroeconomic Performance: The K:yrgyz Republic is a small, land-locked country with a.
population of 4.9 million. Agriculture accounts for about 4() percent of GDP. Gold and electricity are the
two most important exports. Following independence, income levels declined by about 60 percent due to
discontinuance of budgetary transfers from the Soviet Unionr, disruption of traditional trading
relationships, terms of trade shocks and a 50 percent cumulative decline in GDP between 1991 and 1995.
9.     The country has undertaken systemic reforms since 1993 that have helped create the basic
foundations of a market-oriented economic syst-m consisting, inter alia, of a market-based price system;
an open, foreign trade regime; and substantive Fprivate ownership of key productive assets. The Kyrgyz
Republic was the first in the CIS to join the W1"O. The econorric reforms contributed to GDP growth in
1996 (7.1 percent) and 1997 (9.9 percent). A large number of small and medium enterprises emerged
during this period. The regional financial crisis in 1998, however, halted economic recovery. It also
highlighted continuing vulnerabilities caused ba large financial imbalances in the energy sector, fragile
public finances, inefficient safety nets and a poorly developed banking sector.
10.   Although these weaknesses have not been fully addressed, the country has made significant
progress in attaining macroeconomic stability anid restarting economi c growth. The fiscal deficit fell from
about 11.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to an estimated 5.2 percent of GDP in 2002, mostly as a consequence
of expenditure cuts - primarily, externally financed public investment expenditures and, to a lesser extent,
social transfers. Similarly, efforts have been made to reduce quasi-fiscal deficits since 2000 by steadily
increasing power sector tariffs above inflation and taking complementary measures in the sector. The
current account deficit declined from an average of 18.4 percent of GrDP (in 1996-98) to 3.2 percent of
GDP in 2002. As a result of the fiscal and monetary tightening, inflation fell to 2.3 percent in 2002. The
debt service-flow relief from the Paris Club in early-2001 hlas also helped authorities move forward wvith
the ongoing fiscal adjustment process.
1l.   Despite the disruptions from the regional financial crisis, growth has averaged about 4.8 percent
in 1999-2001. Although significant disturbance!s from landslides at the Kumtor gold mine and the
reduced external demand for power in 2002 inte-rrupted this progress - with growth rate estimated to turn
slightly negative in 2002 - growth is expected to return to its positive trend from 2003 onwards, barring
any unexpected shocks. The economy's production base continues to be narrowly defined, but the
spending patterns entered into a more viable path. On the supp]ly side of the economy, growth has been
led by agriculture and two major, non-labor intensive industrial sectors, i.e. gold mining and power, with
first signs of recovery in manufacturing performance over t he last decade being signaled only in 2002.
On the demand side, it is encouraging that the recent adjustmrrents in the fiscal deficit and the external
account deficit have resulted in a more sustainable stance, with an increase in domestic savings.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003               3
12.     These favorable developments notwithstanding, the country continues to face serious challenges.
The Kyrgyz Republic remains the second poorest of the FSU republics and one of the poorest countries in
the world. In 2001, per capita income was less than US$300. Severe poverty affected 13.5 percent of the
population and 47.6 percent were considered poor, having incomes below PPP US$4.30 per day.
Poverty is highest in rural areas, but there are large regional disparities. Access to public services such as
running water, public sewerage, reliable electricity, district heating, and telephone service is very low.
Most of the population is vulnerable to poverty because of the low savings levels and the absence of
financial instruments to allow for consumption smoothing.
13.     Notwithstanding the fiscal adjustment, the country is saddled with a heavy burden of external
debt - at 477 percent of Government revenues, in net present value terms, at end-2001. The Paris Club
Agreement did not change the stock of external debt, although the agreement includes a goodwill clause
that allows for a potential stock reduction operation in the future. There are also issues relating to the
quality and sustainability of fiscal adjustment efforts to date. Adjustment in recent years has been
achieved largely on the basis of across-the-board expenditure cuts that are unsustainable and have often
failed to reflect strategic priorities. Civil servants are poorly paid and often seek alternative sources of
income, which reduces the quality of public services and promotes rent-seeking behavior. Reduced
maintenance of infrastructure has affected such critical areas as irrigation networks, transportation and
education and health facilities. Public expenditures on social protection, other than pensions, have been
severely constrained. Finally, the Government is still incurring substantial quasi-fiscal expenditures,
estimated to be over 10 percent of GDP in 2001, by pricing public utility services below their economic
costs.
14.     Despite the Kyrgyz Republic's liberal trade regime and WTO membership, international trade has
so far failed to boost growth'and productivity. The country is dependent on its neighbors for access to
markets. None of them, except China, has, however, joined the WTO. They also have inconsistent trade
policies and'place various restrictions on flow of goods from the Kyrgyz Republic. Uncertainties in
regional trade and transit arrangements have discouraged foreign direct investment in the country, which
has averaged only 2.2 percent of the GDP since 1996. There are also well-documented internal barriers to
investment, including excessive regulation, through permits, certification, licensing and inspections, and
absence of basic financial services and credit.
15.     Macroeconomic Policy Framework: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and growth, reducing
external debt and achieving further gains in poverty reduction requires continuation of fiscal and external
adjustment; further progress in structural reforms; and continued support from external creditors, both in
the form of further debt rescheduling and increased grant and concessional financing. A 3-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive Board
of the IMF in December 2001, provides the basic underpinnings for this policy framework'. The
implementation of the PRGF program has thus far remained on track and the specific targets established
under the program have generally been met, and even exceeded in some key areas.
' The PRGF program targets a reduction in the fiscal deficit of the general govemment, consistent with the balance of payments adjustment
needed to address the country's external debt problems. The key elements of this effort are an increase in collections of tax revenue through a
combination of measures that include, a broadening of the tax base and improvements in tax administration led by the establishment of a modem
Large Taxpayer Unit, as well as expenditure restraint. The PRGF program also requires the pursuance of a debt strategy, including seeking debt
relief from Paris Club creditors on Naples terms, a reduction in the size of the Public Investment Program, and limting external borrowing to
loans with high levels of concessionality. The program anticipates the implementation of a tight monetary pohcy in support of low inflation and
a stable nominal exchange rate Structural reforms in the PRGF program focus on governance and financial sctor reforms. As regards
govemance, the PRGF identifies measures in the areas of institution building, public awareness, efficiency of public administration, corporate
governance andjudicial reforms. In this regard, it particularly emphasizes the restructuring of the Ministry of Finance as a key step to improve
the administration of public finances. In the financial sector, reforms of bank supervision, improvements of the regulatory framework, the
enhancement of debt recovery capacity, the divestiture of state-owned banks, and the development of the payments system are key pnonties.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Progrmn Document,, April 2J, 2003  4
16.    The Government's reform efforts have Elso been supported through adjustment lending by the
World Bank. Seven Bank adjustment operations supported privatization and enterprise reform,
agricultural privatization, financial sector refonr, public sector resource management, pension reformn and
power and gas sector reform along with imnprove ments in thle business environment. These operations
helped the Kyrgyz Republic undertake reforms to orient its policy and institutional framework to market
economy principles, although reforms are far from complete. The proposed Governance Structural
Adjustment Credit (GSAC) and the accomnpanying Governance Technical Assistance Credit will broaden
and deepen the progress made so far in public sector reform. These cperations complement both the
PRGF program and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS).
B.     Macroeconomic Prospects
17.    Prospects for Growth: In view of the country's low income and high poverty levels, achieving
sustainable growth is the most fundamental requirement for progress in poverty reduction. A
considerable further adjustment both in external and fiscal accounts will need to underpin these efforts.
Public investment and consumption-led growth of 1996-01, financed primarily by external resources, is
no longer affordable over the medium tern. Along with redlucing the reliance on external financing,
increased access to grants and concessional financing are critical to the sustainability of this adjustme-nt.
In addition, a greater effort is needed to shift the origins of the externil imbalance from public investrnent
to private sector activities. While growth performance since 2000 was comparatively more balanced,
private investment and export performance are still far from iproviding tangible growth stimulus.
18.    Clearly, a more vibrant and outward-oriented private sector will be critical to maintaining the
momentum of growth, broadening its base and increasing the economy's access to diversified inflows of
extemal capital, including foreign direct investment. In the period ahead, diminishing gold reserves in the
Kumntor gold mine are already expected to make it more difficult to sustain exports and growth. The
reforms in the agricultural sector, if broadened and deepened to create an enabling environment for
private sector initiatives and to induce productivity gains, are likely to play a major role in maintaining a
positive trend in export and overall economic growth. Similar efforts are needed for improving the
investment climate for SMEs, which is key to ermiployment ge:neration and diversification of sources of
growth. In addition, it is necessary to attract private investments in sectors where the econonmic potential
of the Kyrgyz Republic is significant, such as hydro-generation as well as mining.
19.    These efforts will need to be complemenited by a coherent trade sector promotion strategy, with
an emphasis on trade facilitation and diversification. The country's geographical location implies that:
improvement in the regional trade environment is equally essential for its future growth prospects. Trade
barriers imposed by the neighboring countries, especially during the period of the regional financial crisis,
have had a considerable negative impact on the country's exports. An anticipated improvement in the
regional trade environment over the medium-term through increase in demand from the neighboring
countries as well as gradual progress in their integration into the WTCO are essential to the country's future
growth prospects. Continued public finance and governance reforms will also be needed to underpin
efforts to broaden the base of growth over the medium-tenn (see Section mII for detailed discussion).
20.    As reflected in their NPRS, the authorities have pledged them,elves to press forward with their
economic reform programs. Under a scenario of continued policy refonn, simulations indicate that
maintaining a per capita growth rate of over 3 percent and reducing the fiscal deficit below 4 percent of
GDP over the medium term would be consistent with a steady improvement of the debt burden in the
period ahead. However, reduction of the external debt burden to sustainable levels through this decade
would be possible only if the ongoing efforts to maintain access to corcessional external financing anci to
secure a concessional debt stock reduction are successful. It should be emphasized that improving the
depth and pace of structural reforms and fiscal capacity over the medium-term is critical for maintaining

access to such strong donor assistance and the realization of full benefits of reforms. Falling short of this
target may result in a forced domestic and external adjustment, without addressing the fundamental
weaknesses of the economy. As such, it would have a negative impact on growth prospects, would re-
generate fiscal pressures and could undermine the hard-won gains toward poverty alleviation. (see
Country Assistance Strategy, Attahment 1, for detailed elaboration on extemal and fiscal debt
sustainability analysis).

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  6
III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM TO INCREASE
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE
21.    The quality of governance will be a key determinant of the success of the Kyrgyz Republic in
achieving sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The State would need to play a major role in the
implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS). It would have to develop pro-poor
policies that maintain macro-economic stability; spur sustainable growth; protect the vulnerable;
encourage the emergence of a vibrant private sector; and promote a free, open and just society, where
citizens have the opportunity to achieve their potential. The State would also need to muster the requisite
financial, human and physical resources needed to put the policies into effect. Finally, it would have to
ensure that the policies are implemented effectively and their benefits actually reach the poor. To
discharge these responsibilities, the State would need to have the requisite technical and administrative
capacity. But even more important, it would need to operate in a manner that inspires trust and galvanizes
the people around the goal of poverty reduction. This would be possible only if the State is focused on
promoting the interests of the poor, its policies are formulated and executed in a transparent manner, the
voice of the people is heard and the agents of the State are held accountable for their actions.
22.    As already mentioned, in recent years, the Government has taken various steps to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the State. However, there is still a long way to go. The NPRS provides a candid
diagnosis of the problems that continue to limit the effectiveness of the State. At the political level, the
electoral system needs to be improved, political parties are weak and the communication between the
State and the people is not fully effective. The legal framework is still in the process of development and
suffers from outdated norms, high frequency of change, lack of public discussion of proposed laws and
regulations and inadequate public access to normative acts. The judiciary and law enforcement agencies
face serious capacity and integrity challenges that reduce their ability to uphold the law. At the level of
central and local administration, policy making capacity is extremely weak, implementation of policies is
uneven, transparency and accountability are inadequate and Government interference in business
activities is excessive. Local self-Governments lack adequate functional and fiscal authority,
management capacity and community participation. Public expenditure management reforms need to be
deepened to strengthen budget formulation, budget execution and financial accountability. Further
improvements are needed in the system of inter-Governmental finance. The level of political interference
and instability in the civil service remains high, while its professional capacity and accountability for
performance remain low. The structure of Government needs to be rationalized. Corruption is a major
systemic problem that plagues many public agencies, as confirmed by surveys of households and firms
(Annex 6 summnarizes of the key findirngs of the surveys).
23.    The Government recognizes that weaknesses of the State will pose a serious hurdle in the
country's development path and in its effort to alleviate poverty. For this reason, the NPRS accords a
very high priority to the formation of an effective State and includes a multi-faceted strategy, sketched in
Figure 1, below and summarized in Annex 7.

24.         For the purpose of the GSAC, the Government has selected a subset of high priority reforms that
are indicated in italics in Figure 1. Reforms of the judiciary and tax and customs administrations, though
important, were not included in the GSAC program in order to avoid overloading the operation. Some of
the political reforms proposed under the NPRS fall outside the Bank's mandate. Some of the other
reforms are being supported by other donors2.
25.         The reforms supported by the GSAC fall under two mutually reinforcing categories. First,

ability of external stakeholders to hold it accountable. Second, reforms aimed at increasing efficiency,
effectiveness and accountability within the public sector. Specific actions proposed to be taken under
these categories, discussed in detail below, would operate to (a) improve rules and restraints; (b)
strengthen voice and participation; and (c) increase competitive pressures, as illustrated in Figure 2.
These actions are expected to gradually realign incentives within the public sector and build the State's
capability to play its expected role in the achievement of the country's strategic objectives.

26.    The Govenmment realizes that strengthening the effectiveness of the State will be a long process,
requiring sustained efforts spread of over several years. This is due to the inherent complexity of
institutional reforms that seek to bring about behavioral changes, the large number of exogenous variables
that could affect progress and the evidently weak institutional capacity of the State at present. Therefore,
improvements in governance will be realized only slowly and incrementally. Yet, given the centrality of
good governance to development and poverty reduction, it is imperative to undertake the next steps in the
reform process. Also, due to the inter-linkages between different areas of public administration, it is
necessary to move forward along several dimensions at the same time. The proposed reformns are seen as



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structrral Adjustnent Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  9
important, but modest next steps that will build on recent initiatives and would, in turn, be complemented
by future interventions. With regard to feasibility of implementing the proposed reforms, the Government
is of the view that it has already implemented the first phase of most of the reforms included in the
program. Efforts have been made to keep the level of sophistication of the reforms within achievable
limits. As such, the Government is reasonably confident that, given adequate technical assistance, it
would be able to implement the second generation reformns.
A.     IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS OFTHE PUBLIC
SECTOR AND ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
TO HOLD IT ACCOUNTABLE
(i)    Improving Personal Accountability of Political Officials and Civil Servants
27.    One of the instruments frequently used to promote integrity amongst political leaders and civil
servants who exercise State authority, is to require public officials to periodically declare their own and
their close relatives' incomes and assets and make their declarations public. The obligation to file the
declarations makes it harder for politicians and bureaucrats to hide gains from corruption; imposes an
implicit obligation to explain sources of investment in property; and creates potentially incriminating
evidence that could be used against them in future corruption investigations. At the same time, the
publication of the declarations provides the media, civil society and the public with useful benchmarks
against which they can measure the actual life styles of public officials and demand explanations for
observed discrepancies. By increasing the likelihood of detection of corruption, the system dissuades
many public officials from venturing into it. By providing documentary evidence of corruption, it
facilitates punishing those who persist.
28.    Currently, the Election Code, the Law on KR Jogorku Kenesh Deputies' Status and Civil Service
Law3 have some provisions for declaration of income and assets by candidates, deputies to Parliament and
civil servants, respectively, but these need to be improved and expanded. None of the laws requires
publication of the declarations. The declarations filed by Deputies and civil servants are explicitly treated
as secret. Also, these officials are not required to file any declarations regarding the income and assets of
their close family members. The State Revenue Committee, which receives the declarations of deputies
and civil servants does not have the capacity to systematically scrutinize these to identify cases of illicit
enrichment.
29.    The Government is keenly interested in increasing the accountability of persons in authority, in
order to combat corruption. For this purpose, it proposes to improve the effectiveness of the system of
declaration of income and assets. The Government has issued decrees indicating its intention to submit
to Parliament (a) a draft Law on Declaration and Publication of Income and Assets of High State Officials
in the Executive, Judicial and Legislative Branches of the State, including the President, Prime Minister,
Vice Prime Ministers, Ministers, Deputies Ministers, Judges and members of the Parliament and their
close family members; and (b) amendments to the Civil Service Law, satisfactory to IDA, to (i) require
declaration of income and assets of civil servants and their close family members and (ii) make the
declarations of incomes and assets of civil servants available to the public, and declarations of incomes
and assets of their close family members available to specified state bodies. Before second tranche
release, the Law on Declaration and Publication of Income and Assets of High State Officials and the
aforesaid amendments to the Civil Service Law will be enacted. Before third tranche, the Government
will ensure publication of declarations of income and assets of High State Officials and their close family

Article 13, the Law on Civil Service, 1999.

members, in accordance with the aforesaid La-zv. It will also make the declarations of income and assets
of civil servants available, on request, to the putblic5. Appropriate administrative arrangements, to ensure
regular, effective examination of the declarations of civil servants and their close family members will be
implemented to detect conflict of interest and illicit enrichmenet.
(fi)   Strengthening Voice and Participation by Improving Access to Official Information.
30.    The availability of relevant and timely information about the functioning of the public sector is an
important pre-requisite for enabling civil society, the media and the public to contribute to policy
dialogue, participate in consultative processes and oversee the performance of public sector entities. The
Kyrgyz Republic has a relatively open Govermnent and is making e Fforts to increase the transparency of
the public sector and increase public engagement in Governmental activities. For example, public budget
hearings were held to receive feedback on the annual budget for 2OC2. The budget and the Fiscal Bulletin
are published. Web sites of several Government entities have been created to disseminate informnation on
the internet. However, the penchant for secrecy still survives in several areas of Government and the
quality and accessibility of official information remains quite limited, as revealed by surveys of
households and enterprises.
31.    The NPRS places a high priority on strengthening civic participation in budget formulation and
execution at all levels of Government and in other decisions involving general community interests. It
also aims to increase the ability of civil society to monitor activities Af State agencies. For this purpose,
the Government plans to improve public access to information on activities of State agencies and local
authorities. In accordance with agreements wilh IDA, the government has already published annual
audited financial Statements and audit reports of 10 largest joint stock companies with State share of 51
percent or more, for FY 2001; information on public procurement contract awards exceeding $20,000
made in 2002; the complete annual audit report of the Chamber- of Accounts on the execution of the
republican budget for FY 2001, as adopted by the Parliament; the lisi: of firms receiving tax concessions
and exemptions, as an investment incentive; andc the list of 50 largest delinquent taxpayers and energy
users. It has also organized a workshop to disseminate the "Governance and Service Delivery" report
prepared by the World Bank, based on service delivery survey conducted in 2001. By second tranche, the
Government will institute mechanisms, satisfactory to IDA, for the regular publication of the documents
mentioned above, including information about the public sector reform program implementation and
results of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the health sector reforms.
32.    Before third tranche release the Govermment will: (i) enact amendments to the Law on
Guarantees and Freedom ofAccess to Informaiion, satisfactory to IDA, to enhance access of the public to
official information, strengthen the mechanisms of individuals to appeal against denials of requests for
information, and provide a system for monitoring of compliance of state bodies with the Law. It will also
establish a Government Public Information Center to provide free access to official information of public
interest and to the portal and websites of the Government.
(iii)  Improving the Interaction between Regulatory Agencies and Business Enterprises
33.    The creation of a competitive business environment is one of cornerstones of the growth and
poverty reduction strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic. However, the interaction between the State and
enterprises suffers from various problems that dampen the development of the private sector.
34.    Many regulatory agencies are partially financed by 'special means funding', which includes fees
from licenses, permits, certificates and fines levied for infraction of regulations. This creates incentives
5 Italicized text in this section indicates actions that are conditions of release of the secon d and third tranches.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  1 1
-for regulatory excesses. To prevent misuse of regulatory and enforcement powers, through a Presidential
Decree, the Govemment has taken a decision to prohibit formnation and use of special means funding of
Governmental institutions through receipts from issue of permits, licenses and certificates and fines
imposed through inspections, except as specifically allowed by law. License fees were eliminated from
special means funding from the fiscal year 2002. The Government has issued a decree to prohibit
forrnation and use of special means funding of Governmental institutions through fees from issue of
permits. A similar action will be taken, before second tranche, with regard to fees from issue of
certificates and receipts from imposition of fines resulting from inspections. Before second tranche, the
Government will execute the Budget on the basis that fees from issue of licenses, permits and other
similar requirements placed on economic activities, are directed only to the State budget and not credited
to the Special Means Accounts of regulatory agencies, except for the State Energy Agency (SEA) and the
National Communications Agency (NCA). By third tranche, fees from certificates and receipts from
imposition of fines resulting from inspections would also be directed to the State budget. Thus, by third
tranche the Government would have successfully implemented a set of legislative and other measures,
satisfactory to IDA, to ensure thatfees, from issue of licenses, permits, certificates and other similar
requirements placed on economic activities, and fines resulting from inspections are directed only to the
State budget and not credited to the Special Means Accounts of regulatory agencies, with the exception of
SEA and NCA, and that regulatory agencies are provided compensatory funding through the State
budget.
35.    On the nornative side, there is multiplicity of laws and regulations affecting businesses, many of
which are outdated. There is inadequate participation of the private sector in development of new laws
and regulations. Little assessment of the impact of new regulatory instruments on the business
environment is carried out before they are put into effect. This also encourages proliferation of
regulations. To rectify these deficiencies, the Government has formed an inter-departmental commission
in the Ministry of Justice to review proposals for improvement of legislation. Draft amendments to the
Law on Normative Legal Acts, requiring all draft nonnative legal acts regulating or otherwise restricting
entrepreneurial entities to be made public, publicily discussed, harmonized and studied for their
economic, social and budgetary impact before being enacted, have been submitted to Parliament. Before
second tranche release, these amendments to the Law on Normative Legal Acts will be enacted and by the
third tranche, its provisions will be fully implemented for all Acts, issued after the passage of the Law.
There will also be a requirement for publishing brief information about draft Acts proposed to be
enacted, in the state gazette. Furthermore, the Government will conduct Regulatory Impact Assessments
of three new Laws and three new regulations, to be agreed with IDA, in accordance with the new Law.
36.    With regard to enforcement of regulations, regulatory agencies have overlapping authority, as a
result of which businesses face multiple inspections by different agencies for similar purposes. Private
firms are often unaware of the regulatory norms applicable to them, as also their rights and obligations
when they are subjected to inspections by State agencies. The mechanisms for addressing grievances of
enterprises against abuse of authority by regulatory agencies are weak.
37.    To address these problems, before the second tranche, the Government will connect the database
of the Ministry of Justice, which contains draft laws, enacted laws, regulations and instructions, to the
Internet to make it publicly available. By third tranche, the Government will enact a Law on
Administrative Procedures, satisfactory to IDA, to, inter alia, institute specific procedures for internal
administrative review of all actions which impose a penalty or burden upon, or deny a request sought by a
citizen or legal entity, and provide the right of appeal to a court, after exhaustion of administrative
appeals. With regard to regulatory activities of specific agencies, by second tranche, the Government will
develop and implement a plan for rationalizing public health related inspections carried out by the
Sanitary and Epidemiology Services (SES) and for rationalizing the pharmaceutical inspections carried
out by the Pharmaceutical Control Laboratory, publicizing their rules, regulations and results, improving



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance StructurolAdjustment Credit- Program Docuim ent,, April21, 2003  12
oversight by the Ministry of Health and creating effective grievance mechanisms against regulatory
abuse. Also before second tranche, the Government will develop a plan for rationalization of the
functions and reorganization of Kyrgyzstandarcd, satisfactory to IDA. By third tranche, the Governrnent
will implement the plan for rationalization of tELe functions and reorganization of Kyrgyzstandard.
(iv)   Strengthening External Audit
38.    An effective, independent external audit is essential for enforcing accountability in the public
sector and enabling the Parliament to oversee the working of the executive. Significant efforts were made
to improve external audit, under the PSRMAC., including clarification of responsibilities among the
various audit institutions such as the Chamber of Accounts (CA) - the equivalent of a Supreme Audit
Institution, the State Financial Inspectorate (SF:) under the Primne Minister's office and Internal Audit
Department in the Ministry of Finance. The Law on the Chamber of' Accounts6, established a 13-member
CA, reporting to both to the President and the Parliament. In 2000, the SFI was merged with the
Chamber of Accounts with a view to avoid duplication of funclions.
39.    The external audit function, however, continues to have some deficiencies, as detailed in a recent
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CZFAA). The indepenidence of the CA is compromised by
the fact that President approves its structure, staffing and emxrployee salaries and Ministry of Finance
approves its budget. Besides the Republican budget, the CA is also entitled to receive 10 percent of the
amount recovered to the budget as a result of its activities. This financing arrangement leads to perverse
incentives. Further, while the Law requires the CA to 'control' a large number of financial transactions, it
does not require it to prepare a comprehensive re port on the audit of the annual financial Statements of the
Government. There are also no requirements regarding the adoption of audit standards. The majority of
the staff in the Chamber of Accounts was transf5,rred from the SFI. The staff, though proficient in
conducting compliance audits, lack skills in and exposure to financial audits.
40.    The NPRS includes the Government's objective of improving external audit to strengthen
accountability and transparency in Government spending. 'Witlh this end in view, before release of the
second tranche, amendments to the Law on the Chamber of Accounts, satisfactory to IDA,would be
enacted to inter alia, (i) ensure that the Budget Committee of the Parliament has an opportunity to review,
jointly with the Ministry of Finance, the draft bLidget of the Chamber of Accounts prior to its submission
to the Government; (ii) eliminate the provision entitling the Chamber of Accounts to retain 10 percent of
the amounts recovered to the budget as a result of its activity, aund provide compensatory funding through
the State budget; and (iii) adopt international audit standards acceptable to the Association. From the
Fiscal year 2005 onwards, the Budget Committee of the Parliament will review, jointly with the Minmstry
of Finance, the draft budget of the Chamber of Accounts prior to its submission to the Government.
Technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of the CA will be financed by DFID.
B. INCREASE EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS AND) ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE
PUBLIC SECTOR
(i)    Strengthening Public Expenditure Man,agement
41.    A transparent, well-performing public finance system is essential for good governance and
effective economic management. It ensures thai: macro-economic discipline is maintained; scarce public
resources are allocated according to the Govermlent's priorities; funcls are spent according to allocations
approved by Parliament; transactions are properly documented; and regular reports on the budget are
6 Law on the Chamber of Accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic. 1998



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003      13
made available to the Parliament and public, to enable them to hold the Government accountable for
public expenditures and performance.
42.     Since independence, the Kyrgyz Republic has made important progress in establishing the basic
elements of public expenditure management (PEM) institutions, including a legal framework and
procedures for budget management, a basic framework for inter-governmental finance relation, a
Treasury system -the first among CIS, and an external audit function. These reforms, however, are only a
first step in a long and continuous process. Several issues remain to be addressed to ensure the
sustainability and effective functioning of the PEM system. These include: (a) ineffective and
unpredictable budget allocations as a result of weak budget policy formulation processes, (b) inadequate
implementation of the inter-governmental finance system, (c) limited functionality of a manual Treasury
system and weaknesses in budget execution and (d) weak financial and managerial accountability as a
result of underdeveloped internal control systems and inadequate quality of External Audits. The
Government's reform agenda on public financial management included in the NPRS encompasses all
these issues. The main challenge is to deepen the first generation reforms in order to respond to new
realities of handling a significant fiscal adjustment, allocating resources to poverty reduction programs
and addressing the consequences of weak governance and public administration.
(a)     Establishing a more Strategic and Transparent Budget Formulation Process
43.     The main objective of the reforms in this area will be to remove the structural impediments to a
more strategic and open budget policy formulation. Reforms will aim to improve the linkages between
policy planning and resource allocation and establish the budget as the main strategic instrument for
formulating, implementing and monitoring public programs. By strengthening the policy focus of the
budget, the Government will aim to establish a framework for prioritization of public expenditure
programs, and integration of the objectives of the CDF and NSPR within the budget. A more transparent
and strategic policy formulation process is also likely to create a buffer against pressures from vested
interests, which become difficult to resist in a policy vacuum.
44.     The Government has intensified its efforts towards more strategic budgeting. It is making good
progress with the preparation of a simplified version of a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) for
2004-2006, which aims to combine three important elements in budget formulation, the macroeconomic
framework, sectoral strategies and expenditure plans to implement these strategies. However, a
substantial agenda remains to expand and fully institutionalize the MTBF process as the main instrument
for Government's budget policy formulation. Initial actions include (i) consolidation of the economic
policy decision making process; (ii) improvements in the format for presenting the budget to the
Parliament; and (iii) better integration of the recurrent and investment planning processes.
45.     Integrating the decision making process. Economic policy and budget decision making is
fragmented between the Budget Commission7 which reviews and approves the recurrent budget and the
Goskominvest Committee8 which reviews and approves the Public Investment Program (PIP) and the
Development Budget (annual investment plan). Subsequently, both budgets are consolidated (as
aggregates) and sent to the entire cabinet for approval. This practice leads to incoherent decisions with
regard to macro and fiscal discipline, sector policies and resource allocation, which in turn can undermine
the effectiveness of the MTBF.
7The Budget Commission is established every year at the start of the budget process by decree of the Government and it is chaired by the
Minister of Finance. It includes representatives of the Prime Minister's Office, and several ministers , State commnittees and admninistrative
agencies.. The commission also includes representatives of the Legislative Assembly and People's Representative Assembly.
' Goskominvest committee is a permanent committee of the Government that reviews approves and coordinates foreign financed public
investments and economic assistance. It is chaired by the PM and has the First Vice PM, the Governor of the National Bank, various ministers,
Heads of Regional State administrations, Heads of local self Govemments and the Mayor of Bisbkek as its members.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Aidjusbnent Credit - Pr ograrn Docuomert,, April 21, 2003  14
46.    The Government has recently established an apex level Economic Policy Council (EPC) for
strengthening economic policy rnanagement in the country9. As the Government budget provides the
strongest measure of the Government's participai:ion in the economy, i:he authorities are considering
merging the budget related funci ions of the Goskominvest andi the Budget Commnission into the EPC.
This is to ensure that overall macroeconomic and fiscal policy decisions occur at a point in the policy-
making process that allows the (Government to impose fiscally sound, realistic and binding budget
constraints and make policy trade-offs. By second tranche, the Government will implement appropriate
actions, satisfactory to IDA, for integrating the finctions of the existing Budget Commission and the
budget relatedfunctions of the C;oskominvest in the Economic Poglicy Council.
47.    Integrating recurrent and investment budget pilairuning processes. At present investment and
recurrent budgets are planned separately, to the e 'tent that they are often driven by different objectives
and there is little consideration of recurrent cost implications of investment decisions. Moreover, there is
very little integration between domestic investment planning and foreign investment planning, as the
majority of the investment budget is financed by donors. Budget: classification structures are not
consistent between recurrent and investment budgets. In order to better integrate the budget planning
process, by third tranche, estimal es of recurrent cost implications of alt investment projects will be
included in the Medium Term Budget Framework (MBTF), beginning with the MTBF for 2005-2007.
48.    Enabling the Parliament to review budget policy priorities. The format in which the
Government presents the annual budget to Parliarnent is geared towarcLs the economic expenditure iterms
and agency expenditure levels, rather than sectoral and inter-sectoral policies and priorities. Such forrmat
not only makes it difficult for the Parliament to see what policies the Government is proposing to finance,
but also creates confusion about the authority that can authorize c hanges in the budget. It requires
Parliament to approve even unimportant changes in the course of budget implementation, distracting ils
attention from major policy issues. Before second tranche., the Government will revise the format for
presentation to the Parliament of the annual budget law, with the view to (i) make more transparent the;
policy priorities financed by the budget, and; (ii) present sectoral ceilirgs for two consecutive years,
based on the MTBF; and (iii) integrate recurrent and investment expenditures. By third tranche, the
Government will present to Parliament its annual budget law for 2005, in the revisedformat.
49.    Improving Effectiveness of Inter-Governmental Finanaces. Improvements in Inter-
governmental fiscal relations are directly linked with better budget fonnulation and overall improvements
in revenue generation and expencliture management. The Government has made some progress since
1997, by defining expenditure responsibilities of various Government levels, establishing appropriate
revenue assignments and codifying the framework. for a system of inter govemmental transfers between
the national Govemment and the Oblast level, with support fi-om PSRMAC. The decentralization process
has also progressed with elections of local self Governments (lowest tier of Government) in December
2001.
50.    Implementation of the ref orms, however, has been erratic, especially with regard to shifting of
expenditure responsibilities to sub-regional Governments, calculaLtion and allocation of categorical and
equalization grants and the extension of the rules for revenue sharing al: the lower levels of Government.
Back sliding in several fronts has produced a sericusly distorted structure in which elements of the inter-
govemmental finance system are implemented in a manner, individually and as a whole, that fails to
produce desired outcomes. The implicit overridinig objective of thle cuirent implementation appears to be
EPC is headed by the PM and includes key members ol the Goverrmnent who also participate in Lhe other two committees. It can also call in
other tmembers of the Govemment or other institutions, ss necessary. Finally, the EPC' has the right to consult the Parliament on most matters of
importance.



Kyrgyz Republi: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  15
to provide flexibility to and insulate the Central Government from budgetary risks. This is being done by
shifting those risks to regional and sub-regional Govermments, which are the levels less able to
accommodate such risks.
51.    Making the existing rules transparent: One the significant problems faced in the
implementation of the inter-governmental finance system is the non-transparent application of the existing
rules and procedures for allocating resources to the regional and especially sub-regional Governments.
This has created room for negotiated, unstable, discretionary and unpredictable budgets at the local level.
Local Governments, especially below the Oblast level, are not aware of how categorical and equalization
grants are allocated to them from the higher levels. In addition, various expenditure responsibilities are
shifted to them during budget implementation, especially in cases where they are able to collect more
revenues than planned. Such practices allow room for inefficiencies, discretion and rent seeking in the
course of allocating and executing the budget. To mitigate this problem, the Government has agreed to
make transparent all the existing rules and procedures, as well as the methodology used by the Ministry of
Finance to allocate resources to the local Governments. Before third tranche, the new rules and
procedures for the calculation of all transfers between different levels of government will be developed,
published, and made available to all interested parties, especially local Governments at all levels.
52.    Establishing stable tax sharing at the sub-regional level: The Law on the Basic Principles of
the Budget (1997) defines a tax sharing system between the Central Government and the Oblast
Governments. However, below the Oblast level, tax sharing is very unsystematic and usually subject to
negotiations of rayons and cities with. Such a system does not assure any stability or predictability for the
sub-regional Governments. In addition, these negotiations and the high level of discretion available to the
Oblast to allocate resources to the sub-regional levels, totally undermine the role of elected local self
Govemments. Recently, the government has extended the tax sharing system to the rayon level in
Bishkek City and Jalal-Abad. The Government has also extended the tax sharing system to the rayon
level in three additional oblasts.
(b)    Strengthening Accountability and Transparency in Budget Execution
53.    The main objective of the Government's reform program on budget execution will be to reduce
discretion and non-transparent practices in the disbursement of the budget funds, by improving financial
planning and cash management, bringing all the accounts of the budget institutions under the Treasury
control and phasing out non-cash settlements. It is expected that this will not only make budget execution
more transparent, but it will also improve predictability in the financing of government policies and
programs.
54.    Improving financial planning and cash management. The introduction of a manual Treasury
system in 1996 substantially improved budget execution. However, several weaknesses have emerged,
which undermine the Govemment's capacities to implement policies and programs and create
possibilities for extracting rents and favors during budget execution. The disbursement of budget funds
(spending authorization process) has resulted in an ad hoc system of daily negotiations between the
budget department, Treasury and spending agencies to finance mainly protected expenditure itemsl. This
comes from the lack of a proper system for financial planning and cash management, which is essential in
a country with very limited financial resources and an uneven flow of liquidity in the Govemment
accounts during the year. The existence of special means accounts and other accounts outside the
Treasury General Ledger (TGL) also inhibits good financial planning and cash management during
budget implementation.
'° Protected expenditure items consist mainly of wages, pensions, and social security contributions.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance StruduralAdjustnent Credit- Program Documen4, Aprl 21, 2003  1 6
55.    The Government recognizes these issues and is taking rmeasures to address them. It has already
created a new Financial Planning department willtin the Treasury and is working on streamlining the
MOF procedures for authorizing spending. The Government has also adopted a regulation that
establishes a new procedure for the preparation oF the monthly financial plan. The new procedures for
financial planning will be implemented before release of the second tranche.
56.    Phasing out extra budgetary operations of Budget Institutions. Lack of appropriate cash
management systems in the MOF and the tight controls imposed on the budget institutions in the use of
cash resources have encouraged the emergence o03 fiscal operations oul side the Government budget, in
violation of the Law on the KR Treasury1. Over 40 percent cf the aggregate extra budgetary resources at
the end of 200012 were held outside the Treasury Single Account (TSA), probably in cash or other bank
accounts. Almost every central Budget Institution maintains a so called "Special Means Accounts",
which, until recently, was operating outside the TSA. The amount of inoney deposited in these accounts
in some cases is equal to a Budget Institution's regular budget allocation.
57.    The Government has initiated various actions to control the opening of such accounts, including
the reiteration of the basic provisions in the Annual Budget L:aw for 2002. However, a more systematic
approach needs to be adopted with regard to controlling extra budgetary fiscal operations of any form. By
second tranche, the Government will adopt an Action Plan, satisjfactory to IDA, for transferring all
Extra-budgetary Accounts, with the exception of the Social Flund, into the Treasury General Ledger and
make satisfactory progress in its implementation. By third trannc he, the transfer of all Extra-budgetary
Accounts, with the exception of the Social Fund, into the Treasury General Ledger will be completed..
58.    Phasing out off-set transactions in the Treasury. There is a widespread use of off-set
transactions within the Treasury for paying utilities and some contractors. Such transactions have reached
a magnitude of around 25-30 percent of the annual budget (practically all the utility payments). These off-
sets are legitimized in the Treasury Manual, which permits the settlement of dues between the
Government and the suppliers of goods and services on a non-cash barter basis. While the Government
has designed special accounting rules to record these transaclions, they present inappropriate budget
management practices and might conceal liquidity problems in the real sectors, such as energy, for paying
tax liabilities to the Government's budget. Moreover they undermine linancial planning since the
amounts dedicated to off-sets become by default non-discretionary spending and cannot be reallocated.
The Government will issue a resolution, adopting an Action Pl] an for phasing out off-sets and non-cash
transactions in the budget and the Social Fund, satisfactory to IDA, by second tranche. By third tranche,
the Government will make satisfactory progress in the implementation of the Action Plan.
59.    Establishing systematic reconciliation between the Treasury records on payments made mnd
reimbursements received from the agent banks. At present there is no reconciliation between the
Treasury records on payments made during the day on behalf of the Government and the amount of
reimbursement to the agent banks for these transactions. This process creates possibilities for the agent
banks to over-report on payments, be over-reimbursed from the National Bank of KR (NBKR) and utilize
the float during the month for their own purposes. Apart frorn the ineflfective management of the
Government's idle funds, such practice may create possibilities for non -transparent use of the funds on
the bank's side as well as conceal difficulties they might have in mneetinig reserve requirements. A
comparison between the Treasury records and the Settlements Saving Company (SSC) (one of the main
agent banks) for the month of December 2001 revealed major differences. At the end of December 2001
the cumulative difference was around 5 million soms"3. To address these problems, the MOF has
L Law on the Principles of the Treasury of the Kyrgyz Republic passed on May 28w'. 1994

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit- Program Document,, April 21, 2003  17
recently implemented a systematic mechanism for daily reconciliation of Treasury transactions and
reimbursements from the NBKR.
60.    The improvements in budget execution mentioned above will be complemented by the
modemization of the Treasury with assistance from the GTAC.
(ii)  Improving the Internal Control Environment
61.    While an external audit function is important to provide Parliament and outside stakeholders a
means to hold the executive responsible, within public entities, there is a need for a strong internal audit
function to assess financial and operational risks, design appropriate intemal control systems to mitigate
the risks and conduct internal audits to assure management that the control systems are working and the
organization is operating in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
62.    The Intemal Audit function in the Kyrgyz Republic is underdeveloped. The Ministry of Finance
continues to maintain a small internal audit unit to carry out compliance tests for treasury transactions.
However, currently, there are no internal audit units within the line ministries, except in the Ministry of
Labor and Social Protection. There is a lack of clear legal obligations requiring line ministries to
maintain an adequate intemal control framework. Ad hoc steps taken to ensure financial probity have
proved to be ineffective in preventing abuse and waste of resources, as is indicated by several instances of
non-compliance with laws and fraud/corruption reported by the CA in its annual reports.
63.    The Govemment recognizes the need to strengthen the internal control environment within the
public sector. Therefore, by second tranche, the Government will develop a Strategy for the creation of
an effective intemal audit function in public entities. By third tranche release, it will issue an appropriate
legal instrument, satisfactory to IDA, to implement the Strategy. The Government will also implement
the Strategy in at least three Ministries, by the third tranche.
(iii)  Improving Transparency, Value for Money and Accountability in Public Procurement
64.    Procurement of goods, services and works constitutes about 35 percent of budgetary
expenditures. An open, competitive procurement process, conducted on a level playing field, has the
potential of significantly increasing the efficiency of this substantial amount of public spending. The
resulting savings would have the implicit effect of expanding the envelope of scarce resources, thus,
enhancing the ability of the State to better implement public policies. At the same time, it is important to
increase the transparency and accountability in procurement, as this is an area where the risk of corruption
is very high.
65.   In 1997, a Public Procurement Law (PPL) based on the UNCITRAL Model Law was enacted.
This law established a decentralized procurement system, under which procurement is carried out by
individual public entities; created an independent oversight body (the State Procurement Agency), with
authority to issue regulations; and established modern procurement processes. However, as indicated by
the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), conducted in 2002, the procurement system
continues to suffer from various organizational, normative, procedural, fnancial and capacity
deficiencies.
66.    The State Procurement Agency was merged with the State Material Reserves Fund in 2001, to
form the State Commission on Public Procurement and Material Reserves (SCPPMR). This has created a
potential conflict of interest, as the agency is now responsible for both procuring for the Reserves and for
supervising itself in connection with those procurements. The organizational structure of the SCPPMR
needs to be improved to enhance its capacity in legal, monitoring and evaluation, and procurement



Kyrgyz RepubUic: Governance Structara& Adjustment Credit - .r,'grwn Document,, April 21, 2003  18
capacity building functions. The funding mechanisms of thc SCPPM/[R also needs to be changed. While
part of the costs of the agency are met by budgetary allocations, it is also entitled to receive 1 percent of
notional savings made on conthacts concluded through unlimited tendlers, creating conflict of interest. By
second tranche, the Governrnent will prepare and implement a restructuring plan, satisfactory to IDA, for
the State Commission on Public Procurement and Material Reserves (SCPPMR), to separate the
procurement function from the functions of the Slate Material Reserves, within the SCPPMR; strengthen
the legal, monitoring and evaluation and procu rement capacity building functions of the SPA; and
strengthen the capacity of procuring entities.
67.    There has been a proliferation of procurement rules issued by different authorities. Since 1998,
26 decrees, instructions and orders, dealing with differerii: aspects of procurement, have been issued.
Many of these rules have led to confusion in the division of responsibilities and distortions in
procurement practices. There also appear to be Frequent deviations from procurement procedures
established by the PPL, for instance, procuring entities frequently disclose estimated contract values to
bidders, extend bid submission deadlines inforrnally and sometimes negotiate contact prices with selected
bidders. Although the PPL does not stipulate it, the SCPP'NIMR has assumed a direct role in procurement
through review of bidding documents, evaluatiorn reports, contracts, etc. This makes the procuring
entities excessively dependent on the SCPPMR mnd seriously comprcmises the latter's oversight and
supervision responsibilities.
68.    The efficiency and cost effectiveness of public prOcureenent is also affected by deficiencies in
budget execution. Public agencies enter into contractual commitmenms based on their approved budget
allocations. But due to cash flow constraints of Lhe Treasury, they do not receive the required funds in a
timely manner. Therefore, payments to contractors are frequently deiayed. This discourages enterprises
from bidding for Government contracts, thus, lirriting competition. It also raises the cost of goods and
services procured, as contractors factor the cost of potential )ayment delays in their bid prices. There is
no training strategy or program for providing procurement training to public servants on a regular basis.
As a result, procurement is being conducted largely by untrained and unqualified public officials.
69.   In order to deal with the aforesaid deficiencies, the Government has already confirmed its
agreement with the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) Action Plan. By second tranche,
the Government will implement the activities pertaining to 2003 included in the CPAR Action Plan. By
third tranche, the implementation of the remaining activities of the CBAR Action Plan will be completed.
In addition, the Government will prepare and irrrplement a Procurement Training Strategy and introduce
an attestation program for Procurement Officers, to raise the qualification level of persons engaged in
procurement.
70.    In order to enhance accountability and transparency in the pu blic procurement, before second and
third tranche, the Government will arrange to cairy out procturement audits of selected, high value items,
to be agreed with IDA, that affect service quality in the Health and Ecducation sectors (e.g. selected
pharmaceuticals on the List of Essential Drugs, text books etc.). The audits will verify compliance with
the procurement rules and regulations, assess value for money with reference to international and national
market prices and recommend consequential renmedial actions. The procurement audit reports will be
made public.
(iv)   Improving Service Delivery in the Health, Education and Social Protection Sectors
71.    The health sector of the Kyrgyz Republic, similar to those of other transition economies, is facing
the challenge of providing quality health services to the popu]lation in the context of shrinking public
expenditures on health care, an excessive number of health facil ities and personnel and a weak emphasis



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003              19
on cost-effective preventive and primary health care approaches. To address these problems, since 1996,
the Kyrgyz Republic has been implementing a comprehensive health sector reform prograrn, in a phased
nanner14. Key elements of the reform program include: (i) rationalizing health facilities and personnel;
(ii) improving equity in the geographical allocation of resources, (iii) making the health system more cost-
effcctivfe by strengthening preventive and primary health care services, (iv) making providers accountable
f-or efficienlcy, quality and access at the health facility level, and (iv) reducing corruption in the health
sector. New health care financing (the single payer reform'5), was introduced in two regions in 2001 and
in two more regions in 2002. It extends the output-based purchasing methods of the Mandatory Health
Fisuirance Fund (MHBIF) to budget funds and also includes the formalization of hospital co-payments.
16
Implementation progress on health reforms is satisfactory, but critical challenges remain . In particular,
the organizational changes in primary care have not been supported by a corresponding shift in resource
allocation from the tertiary to the primary level.
72.     Single Payer Law: Implementation of recent reforms in the health sector and especially the
introdu-ction of the Single Payer System requires changes in institutional arrangements for budget
r-a agement. As noted above, these changes relate to the output-based purchasing and pooling of health
rec,sources, This new practice is quite different from the current process of input based budgeting, where
I.ea]th providers (e.g. hospitals) are financed on the basis of physical norms (number of beds, staff).
A*lthoiigb some changes in budget management practices for the health sector have taken place in selected
Oblasts, these are based on temporary regulations rather than legislation, and this puts the health sector
reforrn process in a rather tenuous position. Another problem, especially in those oblasts that are
iinplernenting the formal co-payment policy for hospitalizations, is unplanned and non-transparent re-
allocations from health to other sectors. Therefore, suitable changes need to be made in the legislative
basis for budget management and other reforms in the health sector, while ensuring that these are
consistennt with overall budget management and financial accountability systems. By second tranche, the
Govenrment wvill enact a Single-payer Law, satisfactory to IDA.
73.     Establishing the Bishkek Territorial Health Insurance Fund: Despite the progress in the
health sector, there have been few changes in the allocation of public funds towards primary care and
regions with the greatest health needs. For example, hospitals consume 70 percent of public expenditures,
and the geographical allocation of resources is skewed with Bishkek being favored over the other regions.
Tmprovements in allocative efficiency and geographical equity of public funds are needed to improve the
poverty impact of public expenditures on health care. Reallocation is contingent on the implementation
of the single-payer system in all oblasts and, especially, in Bishkek .  Before second tranche, the
Govemment will issue a decree, satisfactory to IDA, establishing the Bishkek Territorial Health Insurance
Fund and the rules and regulations guiding the operation of the Fund.
74.     Financing of Healthcare Insurance for Pensioners and the Unemployed: Since its
establishment in 1997, the MiHIF has faced the challenge of timely and adequate transfer of funds from
the Social Fund (SF) for employed persons and pensioners and from the Republican budget for children
and persons with social benefits"8. Among all categories, transfers for pensioners is the most problematic.
For example, between 1997-2002, only 18% of planned revenues for pensioners has been transferred to
The Manas Health Reform Program.
" The siugle payer system refers to an arrangement where all funds at the oblast level (from oblast, rayon and city) are collected within a single
crganization (TDMHIP). The purpose of the single payer reform is to reduce the fragmentation and duplication among the various levels (oblast,
rayon and eity) and streamline the financing and delivery of health services. Since one payer is responsible for contracting of health services, this
Trd,uees zidrinistrative costs and also strengthens the abiity of the MHI] to offer a coherent set of incentives to providers.
'5 The recunLly completed Kyrgyz Republic Public Expenditure Review discusses these challenges is greater details.
1 I.aplernentation ofthe single payer system in Bishkek is needed to create incentives for supply-side rationalization which is needed to reduce
t,c Overall envelope of publie spending on Bishkek health facilities. Rationalization in Bishkek is supposed to free-up resources for improving
the geographical equity and increase spending on public health, preventive and primary health care services.
1 The recently completed Kyrgyz Republic Public Expenditure Review discusses these challenges is greater details.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Docurnent,, April 21, 2003  20
the MHIF. Pensioners are generally heavy users of heallh services, and the fact that the MHIF does not
receive adequate funding for th is is one of conlibuting factors for MIHIF financial stress. By second
tranche, the Govemment will amiend current legislation to establish iesponsibility of the Republican
budget for the financing of allocations for healthcare insurance of pensioners and unemployed. The 2005
budget will include funds for tIis expenditure ilem.
75.    Rationalizing Finctioinal and Expendtiture Responsibilities in Health and Education
Sectors: In order to advance reforms in health and education, there is a need to have a fresh look at how
expenditure responsibilities can be streamlined and made stable among various Govemment levels to
ensure better service delivery. The Government will, by second tranche, prepare draft amendments to the
relevant legislation, satisfactory to IDA, to streamline and clearly de ine functional and expenditure
responsibilities in the health sector. By the thini tranche, the G overrnment will amend legislation,
satisfactory to IDA, to streamline and clearly define functional and expenditure responsibilities in the
health sector. The Government will also amend legislation, satisfactry to IDA, to streamline and clearly
define functional and expenditure responsibilities in the education sector, by third tranche.
76.    Establishing a system for defining minimum service standlards in Health and Educatioii
Sectors: In order to assure local fulfillment of r egional and national priorities, minimum service
requirerments must be defined for priority services. Without this, there is no basis for determining
appropriate financing, or holding sub-national CGovernments accountable for the proper execution of
expenditure responsibilities. To the degree thai: standards currently exist in the Kyrgyz Republic, they are
based on physical and facility riorms and are nor: conducive lo assuring any meaningful level of
accomplishment. Especially in the health sector, where a diiffer-ent financing and service provision system
is being implemented, the use of inputs and physical norms as a means for allocating expenditures has
proven outdated. It is important therefore, to start the development cf service standards. Before second
tranche, the Govemment will issue decrees defining the melhodology for developing minimum service
standards in the education sector and refining those in the hIealth sector.
77.    Categorical Grants for Health and Education: An important problem affecting basic service
delivery is local Government contributions to the health sector, especially from categorical grants (CG).
The resource allocation formula under the CG iE linked to inputs (mainly salaries) and therefore
negatively affects health sector allocations which are incre.asingly moving towards output-based
allocations. The design of CGs needs to be synchronized wlith tLhe current developments in the health'
system. In the education sector, the practice of financing teacher saliry costs under the Republican
budget treats existing teacher costs as non-discretionary and hence tends to legitimate what may be an
inefficient delivery of education. A preferred basis for central financing of education costs is through a
differentiated capitation system of financing, which pays for education on the basis of the number of
students enrolled in each type of program. Under this approach, it is important that the financing formula
reflect intrinsic sources of higher costs - such as dispersed -population, and a higher-than-average density
of students with specials learning needs. But developing such a formula will require preparation in the
form of a careful examination of the sources and magnitudes of intrinsic cost differences prior to
implementation of the formula. Another problem is that the curTent financing formula provides virtually
no financing for in-service teacher training. Fai]ure to fund teacher t-aining is a high-risk and low-
efficiency option, because it means that the education systemn's most important asset - its teachers - are
not equipped to perform their work effectively, especially in introducing the important innovations
planned under the education reform. As a condition of second tranche release, the Government will
adopt an appropriate legal act ro define capitation-basedfoirmula for calculating categorical grants in
the health and education sector The new formnuae will be irnplemented before the third tranche release.

78.     Costs of Pre-University Education: In principle, local Governments finance primary and
secondary schools from their own resources. The current practice of financing teachers' salaries under
the Republican budget has the very compelling advantage that it ensures that even the poorest localities
are able to pay teachers' salaries and keep their schools open. But it has a serious disadvantage in that it
does not include financing for textbooks. Textbooks are financed by parents under a textbook rental
scheme. Although rental charges appear modest in an absolute sense, the extremely low level of incomes
means that many households cannot afford the cost of textbook rental, thus preventing children from
having textbooks. This is a major reason for low quality and incomplete school attendance in poor areas
of the country - including many rural areas. By second tranche, the Government will develop and
implement a plan to modify the textbook rental scheme to ensure that low household income does not
prevent students from receivng textbooks.
79.     Social Protection: Pension reform in the Kyrgyz Republic is at a critical juncture. The recently
completed Public Expenditure Review highlights the need for the Government to clarify priorities among
the multiple objectives of the current pension system, based on the 1997 reforms. Proposals for a new,
fully funded pillar within the Kyrgyz pension system have been advocated because of a concern that
incentives for contributors to participate in the current system are inadequate, and a belief that
introduction of a funded pillar could promote economic growth by raising the level of savings and
encouraging the development of financial and capital markets. The Bank's technical assessment of the
proposal for a fully-funded pillar indicates the need for first investigating the prerequisite costs, and
feasibility of this approach in current Kyrgyz circumstances, before taking any irrevocable steps to create
and implement a funded system. By second tranche, the Government will identify the prerequisites and
necessary lead-time for adopting a funded approach to pensions by developing an action program and
timetable, satisfactory to IDA, for creating the policies, institutions and systems required to introduce a
fully funded element in to the basic structure of the Kyrgyz pensions system. By third tranche, the
Government will demonstrate progress, satisfactory to IDA, in implementing an agreed subset of the
action plan required to introduce a fully funded element into the basic structure of the Kyrgyz pensions
system.
(v)     Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Civil Service
80.     The country is in the initial stages of developing a professional civil service'9. A Law on Civil
Service (LCS), enacted in 1999, defines the civil service in very broad terms and covers political
appointees, such as the Prime Minister, members of the Government, nominees of the President and
Deputies of the Parliament and their assistants and advisers, as well as career civil servants. Thus, the
line between permanent civil servants and the political executive is blurred. Political appointments also
extend quite deep down the administrative hierarchy. Changes in political heads of ministries and
agencies, therefore, lead to large scale changes in incumbents at lower levels. The LCS also provides
inadequate protection to career civil servants against politically motivated dismissals. As a result, the
independence, impartiality and quality of advice provided by them to the political executive suffers.
81.     While the LCS and associated regulations have created a basic framework for human resource
management in the civil service, this framework has not been fully institutionalized. In addition, the
current rules need to be improved in several respects. Remuneration of the civil service, as also of other
public services, remains way below competitive levels. Low salaries lead to low quality of public
services, encourage misuse of regulatory authority and create incentives for corruption. Turnover of staff
at skilled levels is quite high. Although the Government has carried out retrenchment of staff in the past
"9IThe terms 'Civil Service' or 'Civil Servant' are meant to include permanent public employees, exercising State authority as managers and staff
in Ministries, State Agencies, State Committees, State Comrnissions, Oblasts, Rayons and Local Governments, as distinguished from political
appointees, support staff, teachers, healthcare workers, uniformed services and workers in State Owned Enterprises. The terms 'Public Service'
or 'Pubic Servant' are used in a broader sense and refer to all persons paid out of the national budget.



Kyrgyz RepubiUc: Governance StructurGaI Adjustment Credit - Program DocNwwent, April21, 2003  22
years, there still appears to be scope for further nghtsizing. While new skills are sorely needed to equip
civil servants to handle the evolving role of the State, no systematic training needs assessment is carried
out. Most training is ad hoc and depends on donor funding. Finally, the lack of adequate institutional
arrangements for managing the civil service is i major deficiency. The capacity of the Civil Sector
Division in the President's Administration, which performs this function, is extremely lirnitedl, as is the
capacity of the personnel departments of mninisxies and agencies.
82.    The Government is keenly aware of the need for a well-qual]ified, professional civil service, that
would assist it in formulating ;md implementing policies f0r effective governance and poverty reduction.
It has taken various measures tn the recent past towards this objective. Merit-based competitive
recruitment was launched in 2001; the compressi on ratio cf sa'laries in the CS was increased to improve
motivation; a process of assigning Class Ranks to civil servants was initiated in 2001; in order to trim the
size of the civil service 1,200 civil servants were retrenched in 2001 and 1750 civil servants and managers
in budgetary entities are expected to be retrenched in 2002; a Presidential decree on Ethics of Civil
Servants was issued and Ethics Comnnissions were createcl at the level of the President's Administration
and other Ministries and Central agencies. In continuation of its efforts, the Government has initiaced
discussion of draft amendments to the Law on Civil Service with relevant stakeholders. By second
tranche, the Government will: (i) enact amendmnents to the Law on Civil Service, satisfactory to IDA, with
a view to separate political appointees and co reer civil servants; increase competitiveness irn recrui'tment
and promotion; reduce politicail interference in personnel management decisions; improve incentives for
performance and integrity; and improve institutional arrangements for management of the civil service.
By third tranche, the Government will: (i) establish the Civil Service Management Agency (CSMA) and
ensure that it is fully operational, by appointing management and staff, providing adequate budgetary
resources, and developing rules and regulations for the functioning of the agency. In addition, before
third tranche, the Government will take measuies to ensure thalt all civil servants recruited for the fi st
time to 'main' and 'senior' positions are recruiled on the basis of open competition and rnerit, in
accordance with the Civil Service Law and that all persons promoted to "main" and "senior" positions are
promoted on the basis of results of performance evaluation or attestation. Further, the Government will
implement a revised remuneration structure for the civil service, satisfactory to IDA, before the third
tranche.
(vi)  Streamlining Structure of Government Ministries and Agencies
83.    The State in the Kyrgyz Republic, like all other FS1J countries, inherited a wide range of
functions. While its role has shrunk since then., its span of activities continues to be too large relative to
its resources and capacity. The roles and responsibilities of Governmnent at the central, oblast, rayon aLnd
local level are not entirely clear. At the central Government level, there is duplication and overlapping of
functions between different ministries and between different units, cepartments and agencies under
individual ministries. At the regional level, there is ambiguity about the authority of the governors and
the ministries over subordinate organizational tnits and their accountability for service delivery.
84.    In addition to the functional review of the Ministry of the Health mentioned above, the
Government has carried out functional reviews of the organizational structure of the Ministries of
Education and Agriculture and Water Resources, with a view to rationalize the organization structure and
remove duplication of functions. Other ministries and agencies are in the process of carrying out thzir
own functional reviews, with assistance from DFID and UND]?. By second tranche, the Government will
extend Functional Reviews of Ministries of Health, Education and Labor and Social Development and
one additional ministry to be agreed with IDA, to cover their local branches and affiliated agencies, such
as the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund. It will also prepare an action plan for rightsizing of staff in
these Ministries and agencies, based on the results of the Ifunctional reviews. By third tranche, the
Govemment will make satisfactory progress in. implementation of recommendations of the functional



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, Apil 21, 2003  23
reviews in the Ministries of Health, Education andLabor and Social Development and one additional
ministry to be agreed with IDA,, at the central and local levels, and in their affiliated agencies. It will also
make satisfactory progress in implementing the action plan for rightsizing of staff in these ministries and
agencies.
IV. THE PROPOSED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
85.    The proposed Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC), would support the
Government's program discussed above. Focusing primarily on the executive branch of the State, the
operation would have two complimentary objectives: (a) to improve the transparency and responsiveness
of the public sector and enhance the ability of external stakeholders to hold it accountable; and (b) to
increase efficiency, effectiveness and accountability within the public sector. With regard to the first
objective, the GSAC would support reforms aimed at (i) improving personal accountability of political
officials and civil servants; (ii) strengthening voice and participation by improving public access to
official information; (iii) improving the interaction between regulatory agencies and business enterprises;
and (iv) strengthening external audit. To advance the second objective, the operation would support
reforms directed at (i) strengthening public expenditure management, by establishing a more strategic and
transparent budget formulation process, and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget
execution; (ii) improving the internal control environment; (iii) improving transparency, value for money
and accountability in public procurement; (iv) improving service delivery in the health and education
sectors; (v) enhancing the effectiveness of the civil service; and (vi) streamlining the structure of
Government ministries and agencies.
86.    Borrower and Credit Amount: The Borrower is the Kyrgyz Republic. The Credit amount would
be SDR 14.7 million (US$ 20 million equivalent). The Credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a 40
year maturity, including a 10-year grace period.
87.    Relation to Country Assistance Strategy: In line with the NPRS, the Country Assistance
Strategy, Report # 25708-KG dated April 22, 2003, identifies three key priorities: (a) supporting
sustainable private sector-led growth, (b) providing essential services and (c) strengthening the
Governance Framework20. The proposed Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) would focus
primarily on the third goal. It would, however, also contribute to the attainment of the first two goals. To
improve governance, the operation would, on the one hand, support measures to increase the
transparency, openness and accountability of the public sector. On the other hand, it would aim to
strengthen the institutional framework and capacity of the public sector in key operational areas, so as to
increase its effectiveness and efficiency. To facilitate private sector-led growth, it would help the
government rationalize some of its important regulatory activities that impose significant costs on finms.
Finally, to improve the quality of essential services, the GSAC would support reforms in the health and
education sectors.
88.    Rationalefor Bank Involvement: The reforms included in the Government's program are
urgently needed to successfully implement the poverty reduction agenda. The Bank has been actively
involved in reforming key public sector institutions through various operations, including the Public
Sector Resource Management Adjustment Credit (PSRMAC), Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
Grants for development of public procurement, and projects to reform the Health sector. Recent
economic and sector work, especially, the Public Expenditure Review (PER), the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) have also focused
' The Country Assistance Strategy( Report No. 17641-KG, April 14, 1998) and CAS Progress Report (Report No. 23185-KG, November 9,
2001), supported four major strategic objectives of the Kyrgyz Republic: attaining sustainable growth, reducing poverty, improving governance
and strengthening public finances. These goals are also consistent with those of the GSAC.



Kyrgyz Repubblc: Governance StructuralAdjushnent Credit-- Program Docisntent,, April 21, 2003                   24
on identifying critical weaknesses in public sector management. In the meantime, the Government has
undertaken additional reforms on its own, or v ith the assistance of other donors.
89.      The objective of the GSAC is to maintain the momentlum olF the reform process and provide a
coherent framework in which it could be carried forward. The operation would help deepen the reforms
that have already been implemented, assist in removing distortions that have crept into some areas over
time, initiate reforms in a few additional areas and prov ide leverage for implementation of ongoing
reforms that need support at the top levels of the Government. In developing the GSAC agenda,
extensive consultations have been held with the Government and the donor community. As a result, there
is considerable consensus around the program       and donors have expressed their willingness to participate
in the program through Grant assistance. Thus, the GSAC wilI be a vehicle for the Government to
mobilize grant resources for its public sector reform program. Given the Bank's experience in
implementing similar reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic and in other countries, its country knowledge and
strong relationships with counterparts and stakeholders, it wotuld have a significant positive impact on the
quality, pace and realism of the reforms. The 13ank will a lso play a key role in coordinating assistance
provided by different donors.
90.      Monitorable Actions and Tranche Release Conditions: Tranche release will be dependent on (i)
an acceptable macro-economic policy framework being in place; (ii) the satisfactory implementation of
the Government's Program described in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 3) and (iii) the
fulfillment of the specific tranche release actions (Table 2, below). All Board presentation conditions have
been met.

it is rated 'U' and does not require an environmental assessment.
94.    Disbursement and Auditing: Disbursements under the proposed credit will be made to art
account ("Deposit Accounts") of the Ministry of Finance establish,-d at the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic. The credit will be disbursed accorcling to the ]3,ank's simplified disbursement procedures iFor
adjustment operations. Thus disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases and there will be no
procurement requirements. If the credit proceeds are used for ineliigible purposes, the International
Development Association (IDA) will require the Borrower to either (a) return that amount to the account
for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA, in which case IDA will cancel an
equivalent undisbursed amount of the credit. IDA will require an audit of the deposit account. The audit
reports would be submitted to IDA no more than six months after the date of IDA's request. The expected
closing date of the proposed Credit is June 30, 2005.
95.     The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic have in place the basic
financial management systems in terms of accounting, reporting, auditing and internal controls. The
NBKR adopted IAS in 1997 and is audited by internationailly recognized auditing firms. As the IMF
intensifies its safeguards assessments, there will be consultations with the IMiF and disbursements under
the credit will be dependent upon a continuing favorable assessment by the IMF.

96.    To date, the country strategy and program has supported the improvement in financial
management capacity, most notably through the Public Sector Resource Management Adjustment Credit
(PSRMAC), the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC) and under the proposed operations i.e.
GSAC and GTAC. Budget execution was improved in mid-1998 when a system of warrants was
introduced that required Treasury authorization of payments on the basis of commitments and the budget
framework was improved through an IDA supported Law on the Principles of Budget.
97.    Management, Reporting and Supervision: The program will be implemented by a Coordination
Council (CC). It is chaired by the Deputy Head of the President's Administration and the Vice Prime
Minister is the Deputy Chairman. The Minister of Finance, as well as other officials of the Government,
will be members of the Coordination Council. A Project Management Group (PMG), reporting to the
Council will be established to facilitate and coordinate implementation of the reform program, including
the management of technical assistance. The PMG will submit progress reports to the Government and
the IDA, one month after the end of each quarter. Technical Committees, whose members would be
drawn from line managers and staff, will be formed to guide and coordinate the technical aspects of the
reforms and ensure buy-in at the operational level. These Committees would be supported by full-time
project coordinators. Implementation of the program will be supervised through at least two IDA
supervision missions every year. Follow up actions between missions will be taken by staff based at
headquarters and at the Resident Mission at Bishkek. Strong donor coordination will be maintained
during project implementation. This would take the form of joint review of TORs for important
consultancies with relevant donors; coordination of TA activities to ensure that inter-linked activities are
completed on time; exchange of supervision reports; joint supervision missions, wherever feasible; and
discussions with development partners during each supervision mission.
98.    Poverty Category: The operation does not have direct poverty reduction interventions. However,
improvements in govemance and public sector management supported by the Credit will significantly
improve the capacity of the Govermment to implement the National Poverty Reduction Strategy.
99.    Collaboration with IMF and other donors: The preparation of the GSAC has been closely
coordinated with the IMF. The operation is consistent with and complements the structural reform
measures included in the PRGF. A member of the Task Team also participated in the Fund mission to
review the working of the Kyrgyz Treasury System. Extensive consultations have been held during the
design of the Credit with the DFID, UNDP, EU-TACIS, USAID, ADB, the Swiss Aid Agency and their
consultants, with a view to take into account ongoing initiatives, share knowledge and coordinate and
mobilize grant funds for technical assistance.
100.  Benefits: The GSAC would increase the ability of citizens, civil society and the private sector to
demand improvements in State performance. This would result from enhanced access to information
about key aspects of public sector operations and increased participation in State activities. In parallel,
the program would strengthen core competencies within the public sector. Reforms in public expenditure
management would strengthen the linkage between policies and public spending, better align resource
availability and responsibilities at the lower levels of Govemment and improve efficiency, predictability
and accountability in budget execution. Reforms in public procurement would improve cost-effectiveness
of govemment spending on goods and services. Increased professionalism and capacity of the civil
service would provide much needed skills in critical areas of policy formulation and execution. Finally,
streamlining of the structure of Government would result in improved administrative efficiency and
coordination. On the whole, by simultaneously strengthening the voice of extemal stakeholders and
improving the effectiveness of the Govemment machinery, the operation would enhance the ability of the
State to pursue the objectives of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS).

101.   While reducing corruption in the Kyrgyz public sector would require sustained, long-term efforts
on many fronts, the GSAC would contribute 1.o this cause in several ways. Some of the reforms covered
by the operation, such as publication of declarations of incomes and assets, creation of administrative
mechanisms to address grievances of citizens and the private sector and strengthening of disciplinary
rules applicable to civil servants, have a direct anti-coirnption objective. Others would address the
problem indirectly through systemic institutional reforms that increase transparency and accountability.
For instance, increased awareness of State activities and relevant rales and regulations would enable
extemal stakeholders to demand higher standards of conduct and integrity from public officials.
Similarly, enhanced civic participation in the budget process; reduced discretion and informality in budget
execution resulting from modernization of treasury operations; strengthening of internal control and
external audit functions; and increased transparency in tlhe: procurement process would diminish
opportunities for fraud and corruption in public expendiiture management. Finally, the elimination of
financing mechanisms that create perverse incentives for regulatory agencies would reduce the tendency
of these agencies to misuse authority.
102.   Risks: Improvements in public sector perforrmance take a long time to materialize and are
vulnerable to opposition from vested interests. Strong., sustained political commnitment is therefore
absolutely necessary. Waning of political support can significantly slow or even derail the reform.
process. The limited institutional capacity of the GoveniLment also poses a serious risk. Further, the
proposed refonns involve a large number of Government agencies, stakeholders and donors. Deficiencies
in coordination between these actors could also seriously affect implementation. In order to mitigate
these risks, the government's own reform agenda, as spelled out in the NPRS, has been made the core of
the GSAC reforms, so as ensure ownership. The operatioDn has required the Government to undertake
several measures before Board presentation, to demonstrate its coramitment to reform. Also
disbursements have been back-loaded. Significant technical assistance will be provided to augment the
Government's capacity. A broad- based project coordination and management structure has been created
to ensure active involvement of relevant stakeholders and close coordination of different activities.
Notwithstanding these measures, the overall risk of the operation will remain high. This is due to the
inherently difficult nature of institutional and governance reforms, which are subject to a number of,
difficult to control, political, social and economic variables. The high risk, is however, matched by
potentially high rewards.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Report of the President, April 21, 2003  46
Annex 3
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
1.    The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has carried out significant reforms in economic policy
since independence. However, reforms in governance and public sector management have not kept pace
with economic policy reformns. Deficiencies in these areas have emerged as major constraints in the
ability of our country to fight poverty. Accordingly, the National Poverty Reduction Strategy that we
have prepared recently gives a high priority to improving the effectiveness of the state. In that strategy
we have outlined several dimensions that would need to be addressed to build an effective state. Those
dimensions include reforms in democratic institutions, law making processes, the judiciary and law
enforcement agencies, public administration, public expenditure management, civil service and local self
Government.
2.     We hope that the proposed Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC), in coordination
with assistance we are receiving from other donors, will assist us to achieve two complimentary
objectives: (a) enhance the transparency, openness and accountability of the public sector to our external
stakeholders; and (b) improve effectiveness and efficiency within the public sector.
3.     Our Government has taken several initial steps to improve the public sector in the recent past.
These include reforms in public expenditure management under the World Bank financed Public Sector
Resource Management Adjustment Credit (PSRMAC), creation of a Chamber of Accounts, adoption of a
modern Public Procurement Law, enactment of a Civil Service Law, retrenchment of staff at the central
level, reduction in the number of ministries and state bodies, launching of a concerted action plan to
remove administrative barriers to investment, establishment of elected local self Governments,
implementation of major reforms in the health sector, increasing access to information about the
functioning of the state, and efforts to encourage participation of citizens and civil society in public
affairs. We believe that the GSAC operation will assist us to continue and deepen these reforms that have
already been initiated and make incremental improvements in the capability of the state. It would also
help us to prepare the ground for more advanced reforms in the future.
4.     While the experience that our Government has accumulated in implementing the first order
reforms will be extremely helpful, significant technical assistance (TA) would be needed to successfully
implement the GSAC program. We have secured and are in the process of agreeing with other important
donors, including the IMF, DFID, USAID, UNDP and EU-TACIS, that will provide grant-based TA for
several activities that support the GSAC reform agenda. We are also seeking TA from the World Bank
for the remaining activities, through the Governance Technical Assistance Credit (GTAC), which
accompanies the GSAC.
L      Macroeconomic Policy Framework
5.     We realize that maintaining macroeconomic stability and growth, reducing external debt and
achieving further gains in poverty reduction requires continuation of fiscal and external adjustment;
further progress in structural reforms; and continued support from external creditors, both in the form of
further debt rescheduling and increased grant and concessional financing. An IMF Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility Arrangement (PRGF), approved in December 2001, provides the basic



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  47
underpinnings for this policy framework. The implementation of this program has so far remained on
track. We have met and in specific cases even exceeded performance benchmarks.
6.     Our reform efforts have also been supported through adjustment lending by the World Bank.
Seven Bank adjustment operations supported privatization and enterprise reform, agricultural
privatization, financial sector reform, public sector resource management, pension reform and power and
gas sector reform along with improvements in the business environment. These reforms helped our
country to undertake reforms to orient its policy and institutional framework to market economy
principles, although reforms are far from complete. The GSAC program will help us take this reforms
further and consolidate our prospects for growth and poverty reduction.
11.    The Government's Program to Increase the Effectiveness of the State
7.     We believe that the quality of governance will be a key determinant of the success of our country
in achieving sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The State would need to play a major role in the
implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS). It must formulate pro-poor policies
and maintain macro-economic stability; spur sustainable growth; protect the vulnerable; encourage the
emergence of a vibrant private sector; and promote a free, open and just society, where citizens have the
opportunity to achieve their potential. The State must also muster the requisite financial, human and
physical resources needed to put the policies into effect. Finally, it must ensure that the policies are
implemented effectively and their benefits actually reach the poor. To discharge these responsibilities,
the State would need to have the requisite technical and administrative capacity. But even more
important, it would need to operate in a manner that inspires trust and galvanizes the people around the
goal of poverty reduction. This would be possible only if the State is sharply focused on promoting the
interests of the poor, its policies are formulated and executed in a transparent manner, the voice of the
people is heard and the agents of the State are held accountable for their actions.
8.     We have highlighted some of the problems for the effective functioning of the state in the NSPR.
At the political level, the electoral system needs to be improved, political parties are weak and the
communication between the State and the people is ineffective. The legal framework is still in the
process of development and suffers from outdated norms, high frequency of change, lack of public
discussion of proposed laws and regulations and inadequate public access to normative acts. The
judiciary and law enforcement agencies face serious capacity and integrity challenges, that reduce their
ability to uphold the law. At the level of central and local administration, policy making capacity is
extremely weak, implementation of policies is uneven, transparency and accountability are inadequate
and Government interference in business activities is excessive. Local self Governments lack adequate
functional and fiscal authority, management capacity and community participation. Public expenditure
management reforms need to be deepened to st-engthen budget formulation, budget execution and
financial accountability. Substantial improvements are needed in the system of inter-Governmental
finance. The level of political interference and instability in the civil service remains high, while its
professional capacity and accountability for performance remain low. The structure of Government needs
further rationalization. Corruption is a major systemic problem that plagues many public agencies, as
confirmed by surveys of households and firms.
9.     We recognize that weaknesses of the Slate will pose a serious hurdle in the country's
development path and in its effort to alleviate poverty. For this reason, we give a very high priority to the
formation of an effective state through a multi-faceted strategy laid out in the NSPR.
10.    For the purpose of the GSAC, we have selected a subset of high priority reforms, which fall under
two mutually reinforcing categories. First, reforms designed to enhance the transparency, openness and
accountability of the public sector to external stakeholders. Second, reforms aimed at improving

e Ffectiveness and efficiency within the public sector. We realize that strengthening the effectiveness of
the State will be a long process, requiring sustairind efforts spread of over several years. This is due to the
inherent complexity of institutional reforms that seek to bring about behavioral changes, the large number
of exogenous variables that could affect progress and the evidently weak institutional capacity of our
State at present. Therefore, improvements in governance vill be realized only slowly and incremental[y.
Yet, given the centrality of good governance to cLevelopment and poverty reduction, it is imperative for us
to undertake the next steps in the reform process. Together vith the World Bank team we are making
efforts to keep the level of sophistication of the rr;forms withini achievable limits. As such, the
Government is reasonably confident that, given adiequate technical assistance, it would be able to
implement the second generation reforms.
A.     IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC
SECTOR AND ENHIANCE THE ABILITY OF EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
TO HOLD IT ACCOUNTABLE
(i)    Improving Personal Accountability of Political Officials and Civil Servants
11.    We are committed to increase the accourrability of persons in authority, in order to combat
corruption. For this purpose we will improve the effectiveness of the system of declaration of income and
assets as one of the instruments used to promote integrity amnongst political leaders and civil servants who
exercise state authority. Currently, the Election Code, the Law on KR Jogorku Kenesh Deputies' Status
and Civil Service Law22 have some provisions for declaration of income and assets by candidates,
deputies to Parliament and civil servants, respectively, but these need to be improved and expanded.
None of the laws requires publication of the declarations. The declarations filed by Deputies and civil
servants are explicitly treated as secret. Also, these officials are not required to file any declarations
regarding the income and assets of their close farrily members. The S1Fate Revenue Committee, which
receives the declarations of deputies and civil servants does not have the capacity to systematically
scrutinize these to identify cases of illicit enrichment.
12.     For this purpose, we propose to take the following measures. The Government has issued
decrees indicating its intention to submit to Parliament (a) a draft Law on Declaration and Publication of
Income and Assets of High State Officials in the E,xecutive, .Judicial arid Legislative Branches of the
State, including the President, Prime Minister, Vice Prime Ministers, Mlinisters, Deputies Ministers,
Judges and members of the Parliament and their close familv members; and (b) amendments to the Civil
Service Law, satisfactory to IDA, to (i) require declaration of iincome and assets of civil servants and their
close family members and (ii) make the declaraticns of incornes and assets of civil servants available to
the public, and declarations of incomes and assets of their close family members available to specifiecl
state bodies23. Before second tranche release, the Law on Declaration and Publication of Income and
Assets of High State Officials and the aforesaid amnendments to the Civil Service Law will be enacted.
Before third tranche, we will ensure publication of declarations of income and assets of High State
Officials and their close family members, in accordance with the aforesaid Law. We will also make the
declarations of income and assets of civil servants available, on reque.,t, to the public. Appropriate
administrative arrangements, to ensure regular, efiective examination of the declarations of civil servants
and their close family members will be implemented to detect conflict of interest and illicit enrichment.

tu)    Strengthening Voice and Participation by Improving Access to Official Infornation.
13.    We realize that the availability of relevant and timely information is an important pre-requisite for
enabling civil society, the media and the public to contribute to policy dialogue, participate in consultative
processes and oversee the performance of public sector entities. We have made a lot of efforts to create
an open Government, increase the transparency of the public sector and increase public engagement in
Govemmental activities. For example, public budget hearings were held to receive feedback on annual
budget for 2002. The budget and the Fiscal Bulletin are published. Web sites of several Govemrnment
entities have been created to disseminate information on the intemet.
14.   In the NPRS we place a high priority on strengthening civic participation in budget formulation
and execution at all levels of Govemment and in other decisions involving general community interests.
We also aim to increase the ability of civil society to monitor activities of state agencies. For this
purpose, we will improve public access to information on activities of state agencies and local authorities.
In accordance with agreements with IDA, we have already published annual audited financial Statements
and audit reports of 10 largest joint stock companies with State share of 51 percent or more, for FY 2001;
information on public procurement contract awards exceeding $20,000 made in 2002, the complete
annual audit report of the Chamber of Accounts on the execution of the republican budget for FY 2001, as
adopted by the Parliament; the list of firms receiving tax concessions and exemptions, as an investment
incentive; and the list of 50 largest delinquent taxpayers and energy users. We have also organized a
workshop to disseminate the "Governance and Service Delivery" report prepared by the World Bank,
based on service delivery survey conducted in 2001. By second tranche, we will institute mechanisms,
satisfactory to IDA, for the regular publication of the documents mentioned above, including information
about the public sector reform program implementation and results of ongoing monitoring and evaluation
of the health sector reforms.
15.    Before third tranche release we will: (i) enact amendments to the Law on Guarantees and
Freedom of Access to Information, satisfactory to IDA, to enhance access of the public to official
information, strengthen the mechanisms of individuals to appeal against denials of requests for
information, and provide a system for monitoring of compliance of state bodies with the Law. We will
also establish a Government Public Information Center to provide free access to official information of
public interest and to the portal and websites of the Government.
(iii)  Improving the Interaction between Regulatory Agencies and Business Enterprises
16.    Our Government is placing particular importance to the development of a competitive business
environment as one of the cornerstones to achieve growth and poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic.
However, the interaction between the state and enterprises suffers from various problems that dampen the
development of the private sector. Many regulatory agencies are partially financed by 'special means
funding', which includes fees from licenses, permits, certificates and fines levied for infraction of
regulations. This creates incentives for regulatory excesses. To prevent misuse of regulatory and
enforcement powers, through a Presidential Decree, the Govemment has taken a decision to prohibit
formation and use of special means funding of Govemmental institutions through receipts from issue of
permits, licenses and certificates and fines imposed through inspections, except as specifically allowed by
law. License fees were eliminated from special means funding from the fiscal year 2002. We have
issued a decree to prohibit formation and use of special means funding of Governmental institutions
through fees from issue of permits. A similar action will be taken, before second tranche, with regard to
fees from issue of certificates and receipts from imposition of fines resulting from inspections. Before
second tranche, we will execute the Budget on the basis that fees from issue of licenses, permits and other
similar requirements placed on economic activities, are directed only to the State budget and not credited
to the Special Means Accounts of regulatory agencies, except for the State Energy Agency (SEA) and the



KyrgyzRepubic: Governance SructuralAdjustment Credit - Prr9gr0nD Th2c.. n nt, April 1, 2003  50
National Communications Agency (NCA). By third tranche, fees froJn certificates and receipts from
irnposition of fines resulting from inspections would also he directed to the State budget. T'7us, by third
tranche we would have succesoslly implementfd a aset f vJle,gislative rind other measures, satisfactory to
IDA, to ensure thatfees, firom Issue of licenses, permits, ec efifates and other similar requirem7ents
placed on economic activities, andfines resulting from inspections are directed only to the State budget
and not credited to the Special Means Accounts cf regularaty ogencies, with the exception of SEA and
NCA, and that regulatory agencies are providexl c lonipensijtor) fulncing through the State budget.
17.    On the normative side, there is multiplscity of laws and reguiations affecting businesses, many of
which are outdated. There is inadequate partic i pation of the private sector in development of new laws
and regulations. Little assessrrient of the impac: of new regulatory instruments on the business
environment is carried out before they are put into effect. 'rhis also encourages proliferation of
regulations. To rectify these deficiencies, we have formed an inter-departmental comnission in the
Ministry of Justice to review proposals for improvement of legislation. We have also reviewed more than
150 laws and 30 Presidential decrees. Amendments to the Law on Nornative Legal Acts that require that
draft normative legal acts regulating or otherwise restricting entrepreneurial entities should be made
public, publicly discussed, harmonized and studied for their economic, social and budgetary impact
before being enacted, have been submitted to th- Parliament. Before second tranche release, we will
enact these amendments to the Law otn Nonmativ e LUgal Acts and, by the third tranche, its provisions will
be fully implemnented for all Acts, issued after the passage of the Lavw There will also be a requirement
for publishing brief information about draft Act:s proposed to be enacted, in the state gazette.
Furthermore, we will conduct Regulatory Impact Assessments of three new Laws and three new
regulations, to be agreed with IDA, in accordance with the new Law.
18.    Regulatory agencies continue to have overlapping authority, as a result of which businesses face
multiple inspections by different agencies for si rnilar purposes. Private firms are often unaware of the
regulatory norms applicable to them, as well as their rights and obligations when they are subjected to
inspections by state agencies. The mechanisms for addressing grievances of enterprises against abuse of
authority by regulatory agencies are weak. To address th.ese problenms, before the second tranche, we will
connect the database of the Ministry of Justice, which contains draft laws, enacted laws, regulations and
instructions, to the internet to make it publicly available. In addition, by third tranche, we will enact a
Law on Administrative Procedures to, inter alia, institute specific procedures for internal administrative
review of all actions which impose a penalty or burden upon, or deny a request sought by a citizen or
legal entity, and provide the right of appeal to a court, after exhaustion of administrative appeals. Before
second tranche release, we will also develop and implement a plan for rationalizing public health related
inspections carried out by the Sanitary and Epidemiology Services (SES) and for rationalizing the
pharmaceutical inspections canied out by the Pharmaceuticxl C'ontrol Laboratory, publicizing their rules,
regulations and results, improving oversight by .he Ministry of Health and creating effective grievance
mechanisms against regulatory abuse. Further, iefore second tranche release, we will develop a plan for
rationalization of the functions and reorganization of Kyrgyzstandarct, satisfactory to IDA. The
implementation of the plan for rationalizing of t`ie functiorns and reotganization of Kyrgyzstandard will be
implemented prior to third tranche.
(iv)   Strengthening External Audit
19.    An effective, independent external audit is esseniial for enforcing accountability in the public
sector and enabling the Parliament to oveisee the working of the executive. Our Government has made
significant efforts to improve external audit, wit i previous support from the World Bank, including
clarification of responsibilities among the varioLcs audit institutions sujch as the Chamber of Accounts
(CA) - the equivalent of a Supreme Audit Instit, tion, the State Financial Inspectorate (SFI) under the
Prime Minister's office and Internal Audit Department in the Ministry of Finance. Though the Law on



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  51
the Chamber of Accounts24, we have established a 13-member CA, reporting both to the President and the
Parliament. In 2000, we merged the SFI with the Chamber of Accounts to avoid duplication of
functions. We are aware, however, that the external audit function continues to have deficiencies, as
detailed in a recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted by the World Bank.
20.    The independence of the CA needs to be strengthened. In addition to the funds received by the
republican budget, the CA is also entitled to receive 10% of the amount recovered to the budget as a result
of irregularities detected by it. This financing arrangement leads to perverse incentives. While the Law
requires the CA to 'control' a large number of financial transactions, it does not require it to prepare a
comprehensive report on the audit of the annual financial statements of the Government. There are also
no requirements regarding the adoption of audit standards. The majority of the staff in the Chamber of
Accounts was transferred from the SFI. The staff, though proficient in conducting compliance audits,
lacks skills in and exposure to financial audits.
21.    As we have emphasized in our NPRS we are commnitted to improving external audit to strengthen
accountability and transparency in Government spending. With this end in view, before release of the
second tranche, we will enact amendments to the Law on the Chamber of Accounts, satisfactory to
IDA,would be enacted to inter alia, (i) ensure that the Budget Committee of the Parliament has an
opportunity to review, jointly with the Ministry of Finance, the draft budget of the Chamber of Accounts
prior to its submission to the Government; (ii) eliminate the provision entitling the Chamber of Accounts
to retain 10 percent of the amounts recovered to the budget as a result of its activity, and provide
compensatory funding through the State budget; and (iii) adopt international audit standards acceptable
to the Association. From the Fiscal year 2005 onwards, the Budget Committee of the Parliament will
review, jointly with the Ministry of Finance, the draft budget of the Chamber of Accounts prior to its
submission to the Government.
B. INCREASE EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE
PUBLIC SECTOR
(i)    Strengthening Public Expenditure Management
22.    We believe that a transparent, well-performing public finance system is essential for good
governance and effective economic management. Since independence, we have made important progress
in establishing the basic elements of public expenditure management (PEM) institutions, including a legal
framework and procedures for budget management, a basic framework for inter governmental finance
relation, a Treasury system -the first among CIS, and an external audit function. These reforms,
however, are only a first step in a long and continuous process. Several issues remain to be addressed to
ensure the sustainability and effective functioning of the PEM system. We continue to have ineffective
and unpredictable budgets as a result of a weak budget policy formulation process. The implementation
of the inter governmental finance system established in 1997 has been inadequate. There are also
weaknesses in budget execution given the limitations associated with a manual Treasury system and
underdeveloped Internal Control and External Audit systems. We are committed, however, to address all
these fronts and have given high priority to this agenda in our NPRS.

Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structura I Adjustnent Credit - Program Docum ent,, April.'1, 2003  52
(a)    Establishing a more Strategic and Trmnsparent Budget Formulation Process
23.    Our main objective of the reformLs in t:tis area will be to establish a more strategic and open
budget policy formulation. We will aim to improve the linkrages between the policy planning and
allocation of resources and establish the budgel as the main strategic policy instrument for formulating,
irnplementing and monitoring public programs. By strengthening the policy focus of the budget, we will
aim to establish a framework for prioritization of public expenditure programs, and open the way for
integrating the objectives of the CDF and NSPRZ within the budget. A more transparent and strategic
policy formulation process is also likely to create a buffer against pressures from vested interests, which
become difficult to resist in a policy vacuum.
24.    We have intensified eiforts towards more strategic budgeting in the last three years. We are
making good progress with the preparation of a simplified version of a Medium Term Budget Framework
(MTBF) for 2004-2006. However, a substantial agenda remains to expand and fully institutionalize the
MTBF process as the main instrument for Government's budget pol Icy formulation. Initial actions that
we will undertake include (i) consolidation of thie economic policy decision making process; (ii)
improvements in the format for presenting the budget to the Parliament; and (iii) better integration of the
recurrent and investment planning processes.
25.    Integrating the decision making process: Eco:nomic policy and budget decision making is
fragmented between the Budget Commnission w hich reviews and approves the recurrent budget and the
GOSKOMINVEST Committee which reviews and approves the Public Investment Program (PIP) and the
Development Budget (annual investment plan),. Subsequently. both budgets are consolidated (as
aggregates) and sent to the entire cabinet for approval. This practice can lead to incoherent decisions with
regard to macro and fiscal discipline, sector policies and resource allocation, which in tum can undermnine
the effectiveness of the MTBF.
26.    We have recently established an apex I vel Econocrruc Policy Council (EPC) for strengthening
economic policy management in the country and are now considering merging the budget related
functions of the Goskominvesi and the Budget Commission into the EPC. This will allow our
Government to ensure consistency in economic policy. It will also ensure that overall macroeconomic
and fiscal policy decisions are taken at a point in the policy-.-making process that allows the Governmaent
to impose fiscally sound, realistic and binding budget const-aints and make policy trade-offs. By second
tranche, we will implement appropriate actions, satisfactorv to IDA, for integrating the functions of the
existing Budget Commission and the budget relatedfunctions of the Goskominvest in the Economic Policy
Council.
27.    Integrating recurrent and investment budget pl[atnning processes: At present investment and
recurrent budgets are planned separately to the extent that they are often driven by different objectives
and little consideration of recurrent cost implications of in vestment decisions. Moreover, there is very
little integration between domestic investment planning and foreign investment planning, as the majority
of the investment budget is financed by donors. Budget c lassificaticin structures are not consistent
between recurrent and investment budgets. We are committed to undertake several measures to better
integrate the budget planning process. By third tranche, estimates of recurrent cost implications of all
investment projects will be included in the Medium Term 'Budget Framework (MBTF), beginning with
MTBF for 2005-2007.
28.    Enabling the Parliament to review budget policy priorities: The format in which we present
the annual budget to Parliament is geared towards the economic expenditure items and agency
expenditure levels, rather than sectoral and inter-sectoral policies and priorities. Such format not only



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  53
makes it difficult for the Parliament to see what policies we are proposing to finance, but also creates
confusion about the authority that can authorize changes in the budget. It requires Parliament to approve
even unimportant changes in the course of budget implementation, distracting its attention from major
policy issues. Before second tranche, we will revise the format for presentation to the Parliament of the
annual budget law, with the view to (i) make more transparent the policy priorities financed by the
budget, and; (ii) present sectoral ceilings for two consecutive years, based on the MTBF; and (iii)
integrate recurrent and investment expenditures. By third tranche, the Government will present to
Parliament its annual budget law for 2005, in the revisedformat.
(b)    Improving Effectiveness of Inter-Governmental Finances
29.    We have made some progress in establishing an inter governmental finance system since 1997.
More recently progress has been made also in the area of administrative decentralization with elections of
local self Govemments (lowest tier of Government) in December 2001. Implementation of the reforms,
however, has been erratic, especially with regard to the ad hoc shifting of expenditure responsibilities to
sub-regional Governments, calculation and allocation of categorical and equalization grants and the
extension of the rules for revenue sharing at the lower levels of Government. Back sliding in several
fronts has produced a seriously distorted structure that fails to produce desired outcomes.
30.    We fully recognize the importance of addressing weaknesses in the implementation of inter
governmental finances and are committed to embark on a program for improving various elements of the
system.
31.    Making the existing rules transparent: Non-transparent application of the existing rules and
procedures for allocating resources to the regional and especially sub-regional Governments has created
room for negotiated, unstable, discretionary and unpredictable budgets at the local level. Local
Governments, especially below the Oblast level, are not aware of how categorical and equalization grants
are allocated to them from the higher levels. In addition, various expenditure responsibilities are shifted
to them during budget implementation, especially in cases where they are able to collect more revenues
than planned. Such practices allow room for inefficiencies, discretion and rent seeking in the course of
allocating and executing the budget. To make transparent all the existing rules and procedures, as well as
the methodology used by the Ministry of Finance to allocate resources to the local Governments, before
third tranche, the new rules and procedures for the calculation of all transfers between different levels of
government will be developed, published, and made available to all interested parties, especially local
Govemments at all levels.
32.    Establishing stable tax sharing at the sub-regional level: The Law on the Basic Principles of
the Budget (1997) defines a tax sharing system between the Central Government and the Oblast
Govemments. However, below the Oblast level tax sharing is very unsystematic and usually subject to
negotiations of rayons and cities with the Oblast level, with perhaps some small improvements in
Bishkek City and Jalal-Abad oblast. Such a system does not assure any stability or predictability for the
sub-regional Governments. In addition, these negotiations and the level of discretion that the Oblast has
to allocate resources to the sub-regional levels, totally undermine the role of elected local self
Govemments. Recently, the government has extended the tax sharing system to the rayon level in
Bishkek City and Jalal-Abad. We have also extended the tax sharing system to the rayon level in three
additional oblasts.
(c)    Strengthening Accountability and Transparency in Budget Execution
33.    Our main objective of the reforms on budget execution will be to reduce discretion and non-
transparent practices in the allocation and disbursement of the budget funds, by improving financial



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structar7l Adjustnent Credit -- Program Docament,, April 21, 2003  54
planning and cash managemeat, bringing all tire accounts of the bucdget institutions under the Treasury
control and phasing out non-cash settlements. We believe that this will not only make badget execution
more transparent, but it will also improve the predictability of funding policy programs and activities.
34.    Improving financial planning and cash management: The introduction of a manual Treasury
system in 1996 substantially improved budget execution. lHowever, several weaknesses have emerged,
which undermine our Government's capacities to implemeiit policies and programs and create
possibilities for extracting rents and favors during budget execution. The disbursement of budget ftnds
(spending authorization process) has resulted in an ad hoc system of daily negotiations between the
budget department, Treasury ,and spending agencies to finance mainly protected expenditure items25. This
comes from the lack of a proper system for financial planning and cash management, which is essential in
a country with very limited financial resources and an uneven flow of liquidity in the Government
accounts during the year. The existence of special means accounts and other accounts outside the
Treasury General Ledger (TGL) also inhibits eood financial planning and cash management during
budget implementation.
35.    We recognize these issues and are taking measurcs to addre ss them. We have already createcl a
new Financial Planning department within the Treasury andi are working on streamrlining the MOF
procedures for authorizing spending. We have also adepted a regulationthat establishes a new procedlure
for the preparation of the monthly financial plan. The new procedures for financial planning will be
implemented before release of the second tranche.
36.    Phasing out extra budgetary operations of Budget Institutions: Lack of appropriate cash
management systems in the MOF and the tight controls imlposed on the budget institutions in the use of
cash resources have encouraged the emergence of fiscal operations outside the Governrment budget. in
violation of the Law on the KR Treasury. Over 40 percen-t of the aggregate extra budgetary resources at
the end of 200026 were held outside the Treasury Single Account (rSA), probably in cash or other bank
accounts. Almost every central Budget Institution maintains a so called "Special Means Accounts",
which, until recently, was operating outside thie TSA. The amount of money deposited in these accounts
in some cases is equal to 100 percent of a budget institution's budget allocation.
37.    We have initiated various actions to control the opening of such accounts, including the
reiteration of the basic provisions in the Annual Budget Law for 2002. However, we realize that a more
systematic approach needs to be adopted with regard to conitrolling extra budgetary fiscal operations of
any form. We will adopt an Action Plan, sati..factory to iDA, for transferring all Extra-budgetary
Accounts, with the exception of the Social Funtd, into the 7reasury General Ledger and make satisfactory
progress in its implementation. By third tranchie, the transfer of all Evxtra-budgetary Accounts, with the
exception of the Social Fund, into the Treasury General Ledger will be completed..
38.    Phasing out off-set transactions in the Treasury: There is a widespread use of off-set
transactions within the Treasury for paying utilities and some contractors, which has reached the
magnitude of around 25-30 percent of the annual budget (pFactically all the utility payments). These off-
sets are legitimized in the Treasury Manual, which permnits the settlement of dues between the
Government and the suppliers of goods and seurvices on a non-cash barter basis. While we have designed
special accounting rules to record these transactions, they present inappropriate budget managemenit
practices and might conceal liquidity problems in the real sectors, such as energy, for paying tax liabilities
to the Government's budget. Moreover they undermnine firnancial planning since the amounts dedicated to
off-sets become by default non-discretionary spending and can not be reallocated. We will issue a



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - P'rogram Document,, April 21, 2003  55
resolution, adopting an Action Plan for phasing out off-sets and non-cash transactions in the budget and
the Social Fund, satisfactory to IDA, by second tranchie. By third tranche, we will make satisfactory
progress in the implementation of the Action Plan.
39.    Establishing systematic reconciliation between the Treasury records on payments made and
reimbursements received from the agent banks. At present there is no reconciliation between the
Treasury records on payments made during the day on behalf of the Govemment and the amount of
reimbursement to the agent banks for these transactions. This process creates possibilities for the agent
banks to over-report on payments, be over-reimbursed from the National Bank of KR and utilize the float
during the month for their own purposes. Apart from the ineffective management of the Government's
idle funds, such practice may create possibilities for non-transparent use of the funds on the bank's side as
well as conceal difficulties they might have in meeting reserve requirements. To address these problems,
the MOF has recently implemented a systematic rmechanism for daily reconciliation of Treasury
transactions and reimbursements from the NBKR.
(iv)   Improving the Internal Conttol Environment
40.    We realize that the Internal Audit function in the Kyrgyz Republic is underdeveloped. The
Ministry of Finance continues to maintain a small internal audit unit to carry out compliance tests for
treasury transactions. However, currently, there are no internal audit units within the line ministries,
except in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. There is a lack of clear legal obligations requiring
line ministries to maintain an adequate internal control framework. Ad hoc steps taken to ensure financial
probity have proved to be ineffective in preventing abuse and waste of resources, as is indicated by
several instances of non-compliance with laws and fraud and corruption reported by the CA in its annual
reports.
41.    We recognize the need to strengthen the internal control environment within the public sector.
Therefore, by second tranche, we will develop a Strategy for the creation of an effective intemal audit
function in public entities. By third tranche release, we will issue an appropriate legal instrument, to
implement the Strategy. We will also implement the Strategy in at least three Ministries, by the third
tranche.
(v)    Imnproving Transparency, Value for Money and Accountability in Public Procurement
42.    We are committed to improve substantially the procurement of goods, services and works which
constitute about 35% of budgetary expenditures. We realize that an open, competitive procurement
process, has the potential of increasing the efficiency of this substantial amount of public spending. At
the same time, improvements are important to increase the transparency and accountability in
procurement, as this is an area where the risk of corruption is very high.
43.    In 1997, we enacted a Public Procurement Law (PPL) conform international standards. This law
established a decentralized procurement system, under which procurement is carried out by individual
public entities; created an independent oversight body (the State Procurement Agency), with authority to
issue regulations; and established modern procurement processes. However, as indicated by the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), conducted in 2002, the procurement system continues to suffer
from various organizational, normative, procedural, financial and capacity deficiencies.
44.    The State Procurement Agency was mer-ged with the State Material Reserves Fund in 2001, to
form the State Commission on Public Procurement and Material Reserves (SCPPMR). This has created a
potential conflict of interest, as the agency is now responsible for both procuring for the Reserves and for



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Docuiment,, April-'1,2003  56
supervising itself in connection with those procurements. The organizational structure of the SCPPMR
needs to be improved to enhance its capacity in legal, monitoring and evaluation, and procurement
capacity building functions. The funding mechanisms of the SCPPMR also need to be changed. While
part of the costs of the agency are met by budgetary allocations, it is also entitled to receive 1% of
notional savings made on contracts concluded lhrough unlimited tenders, creating conflict of interest. By
second tranche, the Government will prepare anid implernent a restructuring plan, satisfactory to IDA, for
the State Commission on Public Procurement and Material Reserves (SCPPMR), to separate the
procurement function from the functions of the State Material Reserves, within the SCPPMR; strengthen
the legal, monitoring and evaluation and procurement capacity building functions of the SPA; and
strengthen the capacity of procuring entities.
45.    There has been a proliferation of procurement rules issued by different authorities. Since 1998,
26 decrees, instructions and orders, dealing with different aspects of procurement, have been issued.
Many of these rules have led to confusion in th. division of responsibilities and distortions in
procurement practices. There appear to be frequent deviations from procurement procedures established
by the PPL, for instance, procuring entities frecluently disclose estirriated contract values to bidders,
extend bid submission deadlines informally and sometimes negotiate contact prices with selected bidders.
Although the PPL does not stipulate it, the SCPIPMR has assumed a direct role in procurement through
review of bidding documents, evaluation repor.s, contracts, etc. This makes the procuring entities
excessively dependent on the SCPPMR and seriously compromises the latter's oversight and supervision
responsibilities.
46.    The efficiency and cost effectiveness of public procurement is also seriously affected by
deficiencies in budget execution. Public agencies enter into contractual commitments based on their
approved budget allocations. But due to cash flow constraints of the Treasury, they do not receive the
required funds in a timely manner. Therefore, payments to contractors are frequently delayed. This
discourages enterprises from bidding for Government contracts, thus, limiting competition. It also raises
the cost of goods and services procured, as contractors factor the cost of potential payment delays in their
bid prices.
47.    There is no training strategy or prograrn for providing procurement training to public servants on
a regular basis. As a result, procurement is being conducted largely by untrained and unqualified public
officials.
48.    In order to deal with the aforesaid deficiencies, the Government has already confrmned its
agreement with the CPAR Action Plan. By second trancht, we wili implement the activities pertaining to
2003 included in the CPAR Action Plan, dated December 24, 2002. By third tranche, the implementation
of the remaining activities of the CPAR Action Plan will be completed. In addition, we will prepare and
implement a Procurement Training Strategy and introduce an attestation program for Procurement
Officers, to raise the qualification level of persons engaged in procurement.
49.    In order to enhance accountability and transparency in the public procurement, before second
and third tranche, we will arrange to carry out procurement audits of selected, high value items, to be
agreed with IDA, that affect service quality in the Health arnd Education sectors (e.g. selected
pharmaceuticals on the List of Essential Drugs, text books etc.). The audits will verify compliance with
the procurement rules and regulations, assess value for mcnrey with reference to international and national
market prices and recommend consequential remedial actions. The procurement audit reports will be
made public.

(iv)    Improving Service Delivery in the Health, Education and Social Protection Sectors
50.     The health sector of the Kyrgyz Republic, similar to those of other transition economies, is facing
the challenge of providing quality health services to the population in the context of shrinking public
expenditures on health care, an excessive number of health facilities and personnel and a weak emphasis
on cost-effective preventive and primary health care approaches. To address these problems, since 1996,
the Kyrgyz Republic has been implementing a comprehensive health sector reform program, in a phased
manner27. Key elements of the reform program include: (i) rationalizing health facilities and personnel;
(ii) improving equity in the geographical allocation of resources, (iii) making the health system more cost-
effective by strengthening preventive and primary health care services, (iv) making providers accountable
for efficiency, quality and access at the health facility level, and (iv) reducing corruption in the health
sector. New health care financing (the single payer reform28), was introduced in two regions in 2001 and
in two more regions in 2002. It extends the output-based purchasing methods of the Mandatory Health
Insurance Fund (MIEIF) to budget funds and also includes the formalization of hospital co-payments.
Implementation progress on health reforms is satisfactory, but critical challenges remain29. In particular,
the organizational changes in primary care have not been supported by a corresponding shift in resource
allocation from the tertiary to the primary level.
51.     During 2002, implementation of health reforms slowed down as there was little progress in the
expansion of the single-payer system to other oblasts, and the flow of funds into the MHIF and the single-
payer system was seriously jeopardized. These problems faced by the health reforms have been discussed
at the highest levels of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and in February, 2003, at a Roundtable
organized by the MOH with the help of the World bank, WHO and other donors, the President of the
Kyrgyz Republic expressed his strong support for the refonms. The resolution based on this Roundtable
has been adopted by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. A time-bound action plan based on this
Resolution has been developed. The action plan highlights the importance of timely and adequate flow of
funds in the health sector and the further expansion and strengthening of the single-payer reformns in the
Kyrgyz Republic. We will implement the Action Plan and closely monitor and publish the results. In the
context of the GSAC the Government will pursue specific reforms in the health, education and social
protection sectors as discussed below.
52.     Single Payer Law: Implementation of recent reforms in the health sector and especially the
introduction of the Single Payer System requires changes in institutional arrangements for budget
management. As noted above, these changes relate to the output-based purchasing and pooling of health
resources. This new practice is quite different from the current process of input based budgeting, where
health providers (e.g. hospitals) are financed on the basis of physical norms (number of beds, staff).
Although some changes in budget management practices for the health sector have taken place in selected
Oblasts, these are based on temporary regulations rather than legislation, and this puts the health sector
reform process in a rather tenuous position. Another problem, especially in those oblasts that are
implementing the formal co-payment policy for hospitalizations, is unplanned and non-transparent re-
allocations from health to other sectors. Therefore, suitable changes need to be made in the legislative
basis for budget management and other reforms in the health sector, while ensuring that these are
consistent with overall budget management and financial accountability systems. By second tranche, we
will enact a Single-payer Law, satisfactory to IDA.
n The Manas Health Reform Program.
7 The single payer system refers to an arrangement where all funds at the oblast level (from oblast, rayon and city) are collected within a single
organization (TDMHIF). The purpose of the single payer reform is to reduce the fragmentation and duplication among the various levels (oblast,
rayon and city) and streamline the financing and delivery of health services. Since one payer is responsible for contracting of health services, this
reduces administrative costs and also strengthens the ability of the MHIF to offer a coherent set of incentives to providers.
29 The recently completed Kyrgyz Republic Public Expenditure Review discusses these challenges is greater details



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit- "rogre avL' cDz.mlent, April 21, 2003    58
53.     Establishing the Bishkek Territorial Health Insurance Fund: Despite the progress in the
health sector, there have been few changes in the allocation of public funds towards primary care and
regions with the greatest healtht needs. For example, hospitals consurne 70 percent of public expenditures,
and the geographical allocatiorn of resources is s kewed w~ ith Bishkek being favored over the other regions.
Improvements in allocative efficiency and geographical ecluity of pu5lic funds are needed to improve the
poverty impact of public expenditures on healtir care. Rea location is contingent on the implementation
of the single-payer system in atl oblasts and, especially, in Bishkek .:' Before second tranche, we will
issue a decree, satisfactory to IDA, establishing the l3ishikek Territorial Health Insurance Fund and the
rulds and regulations guiding the operation of the Fund.
54.     Financing of Healthcare Insurance ftur Pensioners and the Unemployed: Since its
establishment in 1997, the MIHF has faced the lchallenge of timely and adequate transfer of funds from
the Social Fund (SF) for employed persons and pensioners and from the Republican budget for children
and persons with social benefits3t. Amnong all categories, transfers for pensioners is the most problematic.
For example, between 1997-2002, only 18% of planned revenues for pensioners has been transferredl to
the MHIF. Pensioners are generally heavy users of health services, and the fact that the MHIF does not
receive adequate funding for tlhs is one of contiibuting factors for MHIF financial stress. By second
tranche, we will amend current legislation to esi-ablish responsibility of the Republican budget for the
financing of allocations for healthcare insurance of pensioners and the unemployed.. The 2005 budget
will include funds for this expenditure item.
55.     Rationalizing Functional and Expenditure Responsibilities in Health and Education
Sectors: In order to advance reforms in health and educa,ion, there is a need to have a fresh look at how
expenditure responsibilities can be streamlined and made stable among various Govemment levels to
ensure better service delivery. The Government will, by second tranche, prepare draft amendments ito the
relevant legislation, satisfactory to IDA, to streamline and clearly define functional and expenditure
responsibilities in the health sector. By the third tranche, we will arrend legislation, satisfactory to IDA,
to streamline and clearly define functional and expenditure responsibilities in the health sector. We will
also amend legislation, satisfactory to IDA, to streamdine and clearly define functional and expenditure
responsibilities in the education sector, by third tranche.
56.     Establishing a system for defining minimun serice standards in Health and Education
Sectors: In order to assure local fulfillment of regional and national priorities, minimum service
requirements must be defined for priority servic es. Withouit this, there is no basis for determining
appropriate financing, or holding sub-national Governments accountable for the proper execution of
expenditure responsibilities. To the degree that standards currently exist in the Kyrgyz Republic, they are
based on physical and facility norms and are not conducive to assuring any meaningful level of
accomplishment. Especially ir the health sector, where a different f.nancing and service provision system
is being implemented, the use of inputs and ph sical norms as a means for allocating expenditures has
proven outdated. It is important therefore, to start the development of service standards. Before second
tranche, we will issue decrees defining the methodology for developing minimum service standards in
the education sector and refining those in the health sector.
57.     Categorical Grants for Health and Education: Ann .mportant problem affecting basic service
delivery is local Government contributions to the health sector, espe:ially from categorical grants (CG).
The resource allocation formula under the CG is linked to inputs (mainly salaries) and therefore
30 Implementation of the single payer systemin Bish-kek is needed to create incentives for supouly-side rationalization whichis needed to reduce
the overall envelope of pubbc spending on Bishkek health faci1iii,s Rationalization mi Bishkek is supposed to free-up resources for improving

31 The recently completed Kyrgyz Republbc Public Expcnditure Review disctusses the.e challenges is greater details.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit- Program Document,, April 21, 2003  59
negatively affects health sector allocations which are increasingly moving towards output-based
allocations. The design of CGs needs to be synchronized with the current developments in the health
system. In the education sector, the practice of financing teacher salary costs under the Republican
budget treats existing teacher costs as non-discretionary and hence tends to legitimate what may be an
inefficient delivery of education. A preferred basis for central financing of education costs is through a
differentiated capitation system of financing, which pays for education on the basis of the number of
students enrolled in each type of program. Under this approach, it is important that the financing formula
reflect intrinsic sources of higher costs - such as dispersed population, and a higher-than-average density
of students with specials learning needs. But developing such a formula will require preparation in the
form of a careful examination of the sources and magnitudes of intrinsic cost differences prior to
implementation of the formula. Another problem is that the current financing formula provides virtually
no financing for in-service teacher training. Failure to fund teacher training is a high-risk and low-
efficiency option, because it means that the education system's most important asset - its teachers - are
not equipped to perform their work effectively, especially in introducing the important innovations
planned under the education reform. As a condition of second tranche release, we will adopt an
appropriate legal act to define capitation-basedformulae for calculating categorical grants in the health
and education sector. The new formulae will be implemented before the third tranche release.
58.    Costs of Pre-University Education: In principle, local Governments finance primary and
secondary schools from their own resources. The current practice of financing teachers' salaries under
the Republican budget has the very compelling advantage that it ensures that even the poorest localities
are able to pay teachers' salaries and keep their schools open. But it has a serious disadvantage in that it
does not include financing for textbooks. Textbooks are financed by parents under a textbook rental
scheme. Although rental charges appear modest in an absolute sense, the extremely low level of incomes
means that many households cannot afford the cost of textbook rental, thus preventing children from
having textbooks. This is a major reason for low quality and incomplete school attendance in poor areas
of the country - including many rural areas. By second tranche, we will develop and implement a plan to
modify the textbook rental scheme to ensure that low household income does not prevent students from
receivng textbooks.
59.    Social Protection: Pension reform in the Kyrgyz Republic is at a critical juncture. The recently
completed Public Expenditure Review highlights the need for the Government to clarify priorities among
the multiple objectives of the current pension system, based on the 1997 reforms. Proposals for a new,
fully funded pillar within the Kyrgyz pension system have been advocated because of a concern that
incentives for contributors to participate in the current system are inadequate, and a belief that
introduction of a funded pillar could promote economic growth by raising the level of savings and
encouraging the development of financial and capital markets. The Bank's technical assessment of the
proposal for a fully-funded pillar indicates the need for first investigating the prerequisite costs, and
feasibility of this approach in current Kyrgyz circumstances, before taking any irrevocable steps to create
and implement a funded system. By second tranche, we will identify the prerequisites and necessary
lead-time for adopting a funded approach to pensions by developing an action program and timetable,
satisfactory to IDA, for creating the policies, institutions and systems required to introduce a fully funded
element in to the basic structure of the Kyrgyz pensions system. By third tranche, we will demonstrate
progress, satisfactory to IDA, in implementing an agreed subset of the action plan required to introduce a
fully funded element into the basic structure of the Kyrgyz pensions system.
(vii)  Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Civil Service
60.    Our country is in the initial stages of developing a professional civil service. A Law on Civil
Service (LCS), enacted in 1999, defines the civil service in very broad terms and covers political
appointees, such as the Prime Minister, members of the Government, nominees of the President and



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural A djustment Credit - PF ogram Docement,, April 21, 2003  60
Deputies of the Parliament and their assistants and advisers, as well as career civil servants. Thus, the
line between permanent civil servants and the po litical execLutive is blurred. Political appointments also
extend quite deep down the administrative hierarchy. Changes in political heads of ministries and
agencies, therefore, lead to large scale changes iin incumbents at lower levels. The LCS also provides
inadequate protection to career civil servants against politically motivated dismissals. As a result, the
independence, impartiality and quality of advice provided by them to i:he political executive suffers.
61.    While the LCS and associated regulations have created a basic framework for human resource
management in the civil service. this framework has not been fully institutionalized. In addition, the
current rules need to be improved in several respects. Rernuneration of the civil service, as also of other
public services, remains way below competitive ].evels. Low salaries Lead to low quality of public
services, encourage misuse of regulatory authority and create incentives for corruption. Turnover of staff
at skilled levels is quite high. Although the Government has carried cut retrenchment of staff in the past
years, there still appears to be scope for further rightsizing. VWhile new skills are sorely needed to equip
civil servants to handle the evolving role of the State, no systematic training needs assessment is carried
out, Most training is ad hoc and depends on donor funding. IFinally, the lack of adequate institutional
arrangements for managing the civil service is a major deficiency. The capacity of the Civil Sector
Division in the President's Administration, which performs this function, is extremely limited. The
capacity of the personnel departments of ministries and agencies is similarly constrained.
62.    We are committed to establish a well-qualified, professional civil service, that would assist the
Govemment in formulating and implementing policies for effective governance and poverty reduction.
We have taken various measures in the recent past towards this objective. Merit-based competitive
recruitment was launched in 2001; in order to trim the size of' the civil service 1,200 civil servants were
retrenched in 2001 and 1750 civil servants and managers in budgetary entities are expected to be
retrenched in 2002; a Presidential decree on Ethics of Civil Servants was issued and Ethics Commissions
were created at the level of the President's Administration and other M4inistries and Central agencies. In
continuation of these efforts, we have initiated discussion of draft amendments to the Law on Civil
Service with relevant stakeholders. By second tranche, we will: (i) en2ct amendments to the Law on Civil
Service, satisfactory to IDA, with a view to separate political appoini,ees and career civil servants;
increase competitiveness in recruitment and promotion; reduce political interference in personnel
management decisions; improve incentives for performance and integrity; and improve institutional
arrangements for management of the civil service. By third tranche, we will: (i) establish the Civil
Service Management Agency (CSMA) and ensure that it isfidly opercational, by appointing management
and staff, providing adequate budgetary resources, and deveioping rules and regulations for the
functioning of the agency, In addition, before third tranche, we will take measures to ensure that all civil
servants recruited for the first time to 'main' and 'senior' positions are recruited on the basis of open
competition and merit, in accordance with the Civil Service Law and that all persons promoted to "main"
and "senior" positions are promoted on the basis of results of performance evaluation or attestation.
Further, we will implement a revised remuneration structure for the civil service, satisfactory to IDA,
before the third tranche.
(viii) Streamlining Structure of Government Ministries and Agen cies
63.    Our State, like all other FSU countries, inherited a wide rangt of functions. While its role has
shrunk since then, the span of activities continues to be large relative to its resources and capacity. The
roles and responsibilities of Government at the central, oblasit, rayon and local level are not entirely clear.
At the central Govemment level, there is duplication and olverlapping of functions between different
ministries and between different units, departments and agencies under individual ministries. At the
regional level, there is ambiguity about the authority of the governors and the ministries over subordinate
organizational units and their accountability for service delivery.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003  61
64.    In addition to the functional review of the Ministry of the Health mentioned above, the
Government has carried out functional reviews of the organizational structure of the Ministries of
Education and Agriculture and Water Resources, with a view to rationalize the organization structure and
remove duplication of functions. Other ministries and agencies are in the process of carrying out their
own functional reviews, with assistance from DFID and UNDP. By second tranche, we will extend
Functional Reviews of Ministries of Health, Education and Labor and Social Development and one
additional ministry to be agreed with IDA, to cover their local branches and affiliated agencies, such as
the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund. We will also prepare an action plan for rightsizing of staff in these
Ministries and agencies, based on the results of the functional reviews. By third tranche, we will make
satisfactory progress in implementation of recommendations of the functional reviews in the Ministries
of Health, Education and Labor and Social Development and one additional ministry to be agreed with
IDA,, at the central and local levels, and in their affiliated agencies. We will also make satisfactory
progress in implementing the action plan for rightsizing of staff in these ministries and agencies.
Continuing Reforms in the Energy Sectors
65.    In addition to the reforns discussed above, the Government places high priority on the energy
sector, as a means of economic stability and a key source of medium to long-term economic growth for
the Kyrgyz republic for the following reasons:
•  Current economic and financial losses of the sector threaten macroeconomic stability and fiscal
prudence. They also expose unnecessarily the country to changes in weather conditions affecting
electricity and water service demand from neighboring countries-which further complicates the
already difficult challenge of conducting stable macroeconomic policies.
*  Availability of reliable and adequate quantities of electricity is fundamental to other sector of the
economy which are targeted for contributing to economic growth, including agricultural
production, development of mineral resources, development of SMEs, and Information and
Communication Technologies;
*  Electricity itself is the second largest exported commodity, but there is additional significant
potential to further increase pure electricity exports, separately from water release services, and
capitalize on Kyrgyz Republic's rich hydropower base;
*  Electricity sector has the potential to contribute to increase in domestic private sector and SME
activities in small hydro and other renewable energy sources and in energy efficiency services;
*  Lack of the reliability in the system is creating unnecessary social unrest among the population
which do not perceive any benefit from higher electricity bills.
•  Meeting the country's electricity needs in a least cost manner will also de-escalate the regional
tensions arising due to the water-energy nexus.
66.    The Government's energy sector reform  aims at improving the financial condition and overall
efficiency of the companies in the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) and gas sectors. In addition to
spearheading continued efforts to reduce unacceptably high levels of commercial losses, the Government
will continue implementing deep structural reforms of the energy sector, since these are critical to reduce
its contribution to unsustainably high Quasi-Fiscal Deficit, restore quality of service which is essential to
increase consumers' willingness to pay, and tap its potential as an engine of growth. In particular, the
Government is comrnitted to:
* Attracting experienced and reputable private management and mostly private and non sovereign
guaranteed investment resources; both are critical to achieve a significant and sustainable
reduction of the technical and commercial losses in the sector;



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structral Adjustmen Credii' - Progran Document,, Apnl 21, 2003  62
*   Gradually moving towards tariffs thal: cover long run marginal costs (LRMC) of the electricity
and gas industries; and,
*   Better targeting of the social protection mechanism which is a necessary measure to improve the
coverage of the poorest, given budgetary constraints faced by the Kyrgyz Republic.
67.    To achieve these objectives, Government will pursue t,he program of actions documented in
Government Resolution # 175-r of April 8, 2003..

Annex 4
Estimated Costs of Reforms
1.    In the tables below, an attempt has been made to estimate the costs, other than those
covered by the GTAC and other donors, that are likely to be faced by the Government in
effectively implementing the proposed reforms.
2.     The costs related to salary improvements of the civil service and retrenchment of civil
servants, will depend on the policy decisions taken by the government regarding the quantum of
annual salary increases and adjustments in staffing numbers. The details of these costs will be
worked out in the course of development of the remuneration and rightsizing strategies, as a part
of project implementation. However, in order to get a broad sense of these costs, four scenarios
have been presented below, assuming different percentage of salary increases and staff
reductions. It must also be mentioned that available data on the number of civil servants and
salaries and allowances has various deficiencies. Therefore, the costs presented below should be
viewed only as indicative of the order of magnitude.

means to the state budget. We assume that actual collection will dechne by
about 20% due to decline of pervasive incentives to collect state fees. So
budget will have to refund that amount to the state bodies lost special
means. hI 2004 all special means related to regulatory fees will be shifted to
the sate budget and some of them will be eliminated. We assume the cost

or one month payment (e.g. $17/12=$ 1.5 million). The MoF has to pay this
mount in cash to service providers (e.g. KyrgyzE.nergo, Kgas, Ktelecom,

Annex 5:
Public Service Employment and Pay Issues
1.     This annex provides an overview of civil service employment and pay issues, highlights the
critical linkage with broader systemic issues, and identifies steps that must be taken in order to build a
sound basis for analyzing pay and employment issues as part of overall public administration reform.
A.     STATUS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT
2.     According to official data, total budget-financed civilian government employment32 - including
the republic-level and local governments - was 308,597 in 2001. Of this number, approximately 13,00033
are estimated to be civil servants, covered by the current civil service law. Due to data shortcomings,
however, the exact number and location of civil servants throughout the administration are somewhat
unclear. Table I shows the distribution of budget-financed civilian government employees by financing
source, branch of government and sector. Since a number of entities finance staff through so-called
special resources, there may be additional workers who are technically not financed from the budget and
thus excluded from this figure.

3.     At about 6.3% of population, this falls within a broad range for a number of other transitional and
OECD countries (see figure 1). Of course, such broad-brush comparisons give little indication - except at
the extreme margins - of the appvropriateness of the employment level and, more importantly, of the
government's ability to deliver on its responsibilities. Furthermore, a smaller administration is not
necessarily an indicator of better standing. As countries develop, their governments tend to grow, in part
because they are providing a larger range and number of functions and services.

4.     The bulk of civilian staff (231,881 or 75.1 %) are employed by local governments, largely in the
education and health sectors that account for 92% of local government employment (see figures 2 and 3

5.       At the republic level, most employees work for the executive branch, which had 66,630 staff in
2001. Of this number, only 1,108 or less than 2%       worked in the ministry headquarters offices themselves
(figure 4).35 Indeed, after several rounds of "restructuring" over the years, headquarters' staffing is so low
as to raise concems about the capacity to fulfill organizational objectives, particularly since skill sets of
existing staff may be outdated or inadequate, and long-standing management and administrative practices
often impede effective staff performance.
35 All data exclude the ministries of Defense and Interior, whose employment levels are confidential. The vast majority of executive branch
employees worked in deconcentrated offices (at sub-national levels) or in subsidiary entities, as well as in state conmnittees, commissions and
agencies and their deconcentrated or subsidiary units. In 2001 civil service employment in the following ministry headquarters was: Foreign
Trade 93, Health 45, Education 75, Agriculture 75, Transport 69, Labor 51, Environment and Emergency 58, Finance 275.

6.      The size of the civil service is estimated at around 13,000, though as noted above, data on the
number and distribution of civil servants lack sufficient detail. Estimates based on available data show
that about 4% of civil servants work in nministry headquarters, 4% in deconcentrated offices of ministries,
66% in headquarters of subsidiary entities of ministries, and 26% in deconcentrated offices of such
subsidiary entities.
PAY AND WAGE BILL ISSUES
7.      The Kyrgyz Republic has several separate wage systems for various groups of employees
including the civil service, social sectors, central bank, and uniformed personnel. In practice, a large
number of regulations govern each wage system, posing a challenge not only to those charged with
implementing current legislation but also, at the republic: level, to anyone who seeks to oversee
implementation of regulations, develop policy options or analyze their fiscal impacts. In fact, for reasons
that include difficulties with information flow and constraints on technical skills and staff capacity, little
systematic, in-depth analysis of this nature appears to have lbeen done to date.36
STRUCTURE OF CIVIL SERVICE EARNINGS
8.      The civil service is paid according to its own wage scale, established by presidential decree and
last updated in decree 196 of August 1, 2000.37 In addition to base salary, civil servants are eligible for a
wide array of allowances and bonuses that account for a significant proportion - generally 50 to 70% - of
an employee's total earnings. Payment of certain allowances is mandatory while others may be reduced
in amount, depending upon the entity's wage bill allocation."' Job-related non-monetary (in-kind)
benefits do not appear to be a significant issue, at least for regular, non-uniformed staff.
36 Many records are still kept in paper, rather than electionic form. To date, centoal oversight of employment levels has largely been limited to
compiling an annual record (in paper form) that lists a total employment figure foi each entit) without greater detail.
37 The decree details 25 sub-scales for employees throughout the civil service, as currently defined. Prominent republic-level institutions tend to
pay higher salaries, and headquarters offices pay more than deconcentrated offices or territorial bodies.
38 For example, payment of the seniority allowance is mandatory whereas the quarterly bonu, (which is generally considered to be an
entitlement, rather than a real bonus tied to individual performance) can be reduced or suspended as a function of available funds.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit - Program Document,, April 21, 2003                    73
9.       The system of allowances and bonuses raise numerous concerns. The sheer number of bonuses
and allowances (at least 11) and the fact that each has its own criteria make administering the wage
system burdensome (at the level of individual institutions, subsidiary entities and offices) as well as
making it difficult (at the republic level) to monitor implementation and ensure that funds are allocated as
intended.39 Furthermore, the effectiveness and targeting of these payments is unclear. Several allowances
appear to serve similar purposes and, while the criteria for ceitain allowances (most notably, seniority) are
clear, others involve a significant degree of discretion. Such discretion can easily be abused, particularly
in a country like the Kyrgyz Republic, where managerial accountability is weak. Similarly, with few real
incentives to focus staff on quality performance, and little in the way of meaningful measures of actual
staff performance,40 allowances that ostensibly reward good performance may not actually achieve that
objective.
10.      As figure 5 illustrates, even in much more developed public administrations with a stronger
performance orientation (and, in theory, a greater ability to evaluate performance) it is unusual for
allowances to comprise a large proportion of total earnings.

CIVIL SERVICE EARNINGS
11.      While the civil service wage scale is significantly higher than the tariff net used by the social
sectors (see below), civil service pay levels remain modest at best, and are considered inadequate by most
observers (though, bearing in mind the poverty that afflicts the Kyrgyz Republic, the same might be said
of salaries in other sectors). Based on 2001 data and estimates for nine of 12 ministries,42 one of the
lowest civil service posts (specialist, category 1) in a ministry headquarters earns about 1,960 soms ($40
US) per month, including all allowances and bonuses, while a deputy minister earns about 9,105 soms
($188 US) in total. Table 2 gives an indication of salaries - as well as the importance of allowances - for
39 Indeed, the Ministry of Finance discovered in spring 2002, in the course of collecting detailed pay and employment data, that certain entities
had becn following obsolete regulations. The cause in this case is unclear, but the large number of regulations (and amendments) issued in the
Kyrgyz Republic, and the difficulty in disseminating this information effectively, compound the complexity of the wage system.
40 For example, the new system of attestation asks about employee characteristics and attitudes, but contains no evaluation of specific work
peiformed, nor does it set substantive, performance-related targets for upcoming work. Similarly, one official noted that his unit is evaluated
principally on whether it meets deadlines and On the number of papers they process; neither of these measures assesses the actual quality of work
cronc.

12.     Given the underdeveloped nature of the private sector, public-private salary comparisons are
difficult and of limited practical relevance. Regular salary surveys are generally unavailable and, for all
but a few staff with niche skills - lawyers or financial specialists with western expertise -- or special
opportunities, moving to a comparable post outside the administration is not a real option.       While some
individuals in Bishkek may find employmrrent in connectiort with donor projects, the majority of rank and
file staff has little option but to try to make ends meet by minimizing expenditures.
13.     An additional feature of the pay system - less impoitant than earnings levels or structure, but
worth noting nevertheless - is that the salary scale is somevvhat compressed.43 High-ranking ministry staff
at the top of their careers earn perhaps four to five times moire than the most junior civil service position.44
This means that the official salary provides only a moderate incentiva for an individual to take on the
greater responsibilities and workload that are presumably associated with more senior posts.
Civil Service Salaries in Context
14.     National Statistical Committee (NSC) data on earnings by sector as well as the poverty line
provide a context for civil service earnings. As figure 6 indicates, earnings in the state administration
(assumed here to be roughly equivalent to the civil service) would place a sole wage-earner's family
below the poverty line.45 However, the data also show only one sector - finance - as paying average
eamings above the poverty line; and the state administration along with several other sectors shows
markedly higher earnings than the social and agricultural sectors. Furthermore, the state administration
falls into the top 20%  of the population by average monthly earnings (2147 som in 2001).46 Thus while
43 In addition to the base salary scale, some managers report redistributing "extra" wage bill finds (from vacancies or other under-spends) in a
manner that gives preference to lower level staff, who are particularly hard-bit by lDw salaries.
44 In contrast, in developed economies where the public sector must compete wilsh private opportunities for top skills, compression ratios
between 7 and 10 are not uncommon. For example, compression ratios are 9.8 in the United lingdom, 8.9 in the US, and 8.2 in the NethrTlands
(Ready for Europe: Public Administration Reform and European union Accession [n Central and Eastern Europe, World Bank., 2000).
Cotnpression ratios serve as a rough and easily available indicator of earmings potential, thoug'i they are not as insightful as other, more data-
intensive methodologies.
45 Data are from a PHRD-financed study by the SMEC consulting firm, Study 2 Public Service Employment, Remuneraton and Retrenchment
(January 2003 draft), which cites sources as the National Statistical Committee (NSC) in general, and the NSC's Economy of Kyrgyzstan in
2001. Family poverty line is calculated from annual per capita poverty line and avvcrage family size data.

many civil servants clearly struggle to make ends meet, they appear - based on this quick analysis -- to be
relatively better off than many other income earners in a country that is, unfortunately, afflicted by high
poverty rates.

15. This is not to dismiss the need for pay reformns. Indeed, there is a strong case for focusing
attention on civil servants who, as the elite administrative backbone of a country, maintain the framework
of the state through important activities such as policy formulation, coordination and implementation.
However, the critical need is for a careful, analytical approach that considers not just appropriate (and
affordable) earnings levels but also systemic problems that include: an opaque, discretionary salary
structure; little ability to ensure that wage funds are in fact spent appropriately; a weak legislative and
institutional framework; work environments fraught with management weaknesses and distorted
incentives - and also takes into account equity issues and the effect of civil service reforms on the much
larger group of public sector employees covered by the tariff net.
SOCIAL SECTOR SALARY SYSTEM
16.      In the social sectors, jobs are slotted into a 23-level tariff net that calculates monthly base salaries
by applying a series of coefficients to a cornerstone amount. Following an April 1, 2002 increase in the
cornerstone, monthly salaries should range from 196 som ($4US) at the bottom to 1120 som ($23) at the
top.47 An individual's total earnings, however, take into account additional factors such as workload and
particular tasks performed.48
WAGE BiLL ISSUES
17.      In 2001, government expenditures on wage and salaries amounted to an estimated 5.8%                of
GDP.49 As with employment numbers, cross-country comparisons of wage expenditures are of limited
47 As an example, a newly-graduated teacher might earn 500 soms ($10). Nation-wide, the average monthly salary for doctors was 985 soms
($20), of which 780 soms were budget-financed and the remainder from insurance payments. Mid-level medical personnel eamed 705 soms
($15), of which 562 soms were budget-financed. The exchange rate used throughout this text is $1 = 48.4 sorns.
48 This system includes work norms -- for blue collar as well as professional jobs - that in some cases have not been updated since the Soviet era.
Mechanistic approaches effectively result in a system that pays far less than a living wage while restricting worker output, rather than allowing
managers to hire a smaller number of productive staff at more acceptable salaries. In the case of professional staff the restrictive nature of the
tariff net and lack of managerial authority over and accountability for budget expenditures have grave implications for service delivery.
49 The actual cost of the government workforce is higher, since some entities use self-generated revenues ("special resources") to finance
additional posts or to supplement budget-funded salaries. An analysis of the 2001 budget execution report shows that 414 million som (0.6%

use except at the extremes due to the h-igh level of aggregation of such data, concerns regarding data
accuracy, and legitimate variations in country needs and contexts. That said, by this limited measure, the
Kyrgyz Republic's wage bill is not excessive, and even falls at the low end of ranges. Judged by more
meaningful criteria such as the sustainability and effectiveness - in te.rms of administrative performance -
of wage expenditures, however, there is little reason for complacency. Furthermore, since budget flows
in the Kyrgyz Republic often take the form of in-kind transtfrs rather than monetary transactions, the
wage bill takes on added impottance since it is in fact one of the larger monetary flows.
OVERSIGHT OF EMPLOYMENTAND WAGE BI'LL EXPEND[TURES
18.      In the absence of computerized payroll and personncl systems, the Kyrgyz Republic does not
have a robust system for monitoring whether wage bill funds are well spent. Monitoring of employment
expenditures relies on paper submissions (such as detailed accounting forms for individual salary
payments) and rote compliancc checks of paperwork as it gets passed up through the system; these reports
are highly aggregated by the tine ministries submit them to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to
request transfers of their wage bill allocation. It is difficult to imagiiie how such a system could
safeguard against intentional mis-appropriation of funds or simple errors (such as. recently-discovered
cases of organizations using obsolete wage guidelines).50 WVhile audits by the Chamber of Accounts
might theoretically uncover some problems after the fact., that body presently lacks sufficient staff to
adequately scrutinize personnel expenditures.
19.      Until now, central records of employment levels have consisted primarily of an annual paper-
based report that compiles total employment figures submitted by each organization. Employing
organizations and their subsidiary units do hold more disaggregated (lata, albeit not always in readily
accessible electronic form. However, it had not been systernatically compiled until the Ministry of
Finance in Spring 2002 collected data - albeit covering only headquarters civil service staff -- that details
employment and expenditures down to the level of individual posts and allowances.
20.      Beyond data and record-keeping issues, however, there are questions about appropriate levels of
autonomy over budget management, and incentives for entities to manage their expenditures (and
emnployment) effectively.5'
GDP) of the total amount of special resources was used for salaries and contnbutions to the social fumd. This means that about 10% of total
salaties is financed from special resources. The extent of reliance on these funds varies signific,intly among functions, with little or no salary-
related use of such funds in defense, public order, social protection/social msurance, and mining. In contrast, such financing amounts to 39% of
total salaries in the transport &comnmunications sector, 19% in housing, and 16% in education.
50 Indeed, the medium-term need is for a computerized payroll system that ensures control an accuracy in wage bill expenditures, linked to a
human resource management infornation system (HRMIS) that enables effective management of the workforce.
51 For example, under the present system, any cost savings resulting from employment cuts are returned to the general budget, with none kept by
the body that bears the cuts. As of spring 21)02, a pilot initative was underway to officially allw the saving instituton - in this case the Miimstry
of Education - to retain a portion of funds thus saved for its own use. Such measures could help institutions focus on attaining a rational
employment structure, and slightly mitigate the damage to morale caused by staff reductions 1 must be noted, however, that retrenchments do
not immediately translate into savings, due lo severance and unemployment costs. Furthermore, it any savings that do eventually arise ma) not
be sufficient to finance a noticeable rise in salaries for remaining staff.

Oualitv of Service and Corruption
Summary of Survey Results
1.     Surveys of households, business enterprises and public officials were conducted with the
assistance of the PHRD Grant in March 2001. The surveys covered 1,000 individuals, 400
enterprise managers and 350 public officials. The results of these surveys are summarized
below.
2.     Service Delivery: Feedback provided by survey respondents indicates considerable
variability in the quality of services provided by the State. Enterprises provided high ratings to
telephone and water utilities and the post office. However, few enterprise managers were
satisfied with the quality of service provided by police, courts, inspection agencies, tax
administration and customs. Households gave high marks to the mass media. However,
education, garbage collection, health services, social protection benefits, railways, police and the
courts had poor satisfaction rates ranging from 22% to 8%. The responses of public servants
broadly mirrored those of enterprises and households.
3.     Corruption: Not unlike some of the other countries of the region, the surveys reveal
widespread corruption in almost all aspects of the State's dealing with firms and individuals.
Table 1 summarizes the responses of the business community and households about the
frequency with which they have to pay bribes and the average amount of the bribe paid. As
would be seen from the table, the percentage of firms who reported encountering corruption in
their interactions with the judiciary, police, traffic police, tax inspectors, customs and registration,
licensing and inspection agencies is quite high. Similarly, a large percentage of households report
having to pay bribes while coming in contact with courts and traffic police, or in the course of
using public services relating to health care, education, social assistance, veterinary services and
agricultural services. Even public officials confirmed the existence of corruption in some aspects
of public sector functioning. One in five public officials familiar with procurement practices in
their institutions said that unofficial payments are frequently made to gain contracts in public
tenders. Further, 17% of the surveyed public officials said that embezzlement of public funds
sometimes occurs where they work, and 7 percent said that it happens very often.
4.     While Table 1 indicates systemic administrative corruption, the surveys also provide
some evidence of State capture. One in four firms said that they are significantly affected by
corruption in enactment of laws and decrees. Seventeen percent of the elected officials that
participated in the public officials survey said they had been offered money or an expensive
present in the 12 months prior to the surveys. One in nine public officials said that their
institution does accept bribes for granting monopoly rights from time to time.

Annex 7
Reforms Proposed in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy for
the Formation of an Effective State and
their Linkage to the GSA C/GTA C
1.     The National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NSPR) covers eight areas related to
govemance and public sector management, namely, (a) democratic institutions, (b) the
legislature; (c) the judiciary and law enforcement agencies; (d) central and local public
administration; (e) decentralization and local self-government; (f) state financial management; (g)
civil service; and (h) electronic government. In each of these areas, the NSPR discusses the
recent achievements of the government, the continuing problems and proposed actions for the
future.
2.     Democratic Institutions: With the holding of elections for Local Self Govemment
(LSG) in all localities of the country in 2001, the electoral system has expanded significantly. A
mechanism of partial elections by party lists has been introduced in the national parliament,
residence qualifications have been established for deputies of the Assembly of the People's
Representatives and immunity of parliamentarians against criminal prosecution has been lifted.
To stimulate the involvement of the people in national development, people's conventions were
held throughout the country in 2001 and extensive consultations were carried out at the
community level in the context of the CDF/ NSPR. Local associations of user of local services
have been formed. There are more than 3.500 registered NGOs, political parties and movements.
A National Human Rights Program has been initiated.
3.     The main problems in democratization are continuing weaknesses in the electoral system,
weak political parties, instances of violation of constitutional and human rights of the people by
state agencies and officials, inequities in access to public infrastructure and services, and lack of
effective communication between the state and the people. The proposed strategies include
improving the electoral system, strengthening of political parties, enhancing civil control over the
military and law enforcement agencies, increasing transparency in the distributive functions of
the state, capacity building of LSGs, promoting community associations and trade unions,
empowering citizens through increased access to informnation about the operation of the state,
increasing consultation between the government and the community and civil society,
strengthening community control over state and local budgets, protecting the rights of ethnic
minorities and safeguarding religious rights, while resisting religious extremism.
4.     Raising the effectiveness of the legislature: This section essentially pertains to legal
reform. In the last 11 years more that 1,100 laws have been passed. However, many of the laws
and regulations are outdated, conflict with treaty obligations, or are inconsistent with each other.
There is a lack of a well-established legislative process. Many laws are declarative in nature,
without clear implementation mechanisms. No systematic analysis of the impact of proposed
laws is carried out. Laws change too frequently, creating confusion for the public and the private
sector. The law making process does not provide for obtaining feedback from the people and
civil society. The public has limited access to existing legal and normative acts.
5.     The proposed strategy includes measures designed to streamline the legislative process
through review and improvement of existing legislation, improved coordination between different
state bodies engaged in legislation, enabling the public to comment on draft laws and regulations,



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Struactural Adjustment Credit -- Progrant Document,, April 21, 2003  80
increasing public access to legislation, requiring assessment of impact of proposed legislation
before it is enacted and strengthening the capacity of the parliament.
6.     Reforming the Judiciary and Law Enforcement Agencies: Various laws have been
passed in recent years to create the institutional framework for the judiciary. A training center
for judges has been established and salaries of judges have been inicreased. Also Arbitration
Courts have been set up and are being increasingly resorted to. Congresses of Judges and
Barristers have been held to consider issues relating to the rule of law. However, serious
problems weaken the rule oF law. These include corruption and professional incompetence in law
enforcement agencies and the judiciary, leading to lack oF public trust in these institutions; lack of
access to justice to the poor and lack of transparency in judicial decision making. The NSPR
strategy consists of an extensive set of actions to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
judiciary, introduction of the principle of election of judges, involvement of direct participation of
people's representatives in the administration of j ustice, ensuring access to justice to all,
provision of legal aid to the poor, reduction in the duration of court proceedings, strengthening
control of citizens on activities of judges, strengthening imnplemerntation of court decisions, and
promotion of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. WTith regard to law enforcement agencies,
the strategy envisages strengthening their capacity to fight crime amd corruption, including
introduction of measures to reduce corruption within these agencies themselves, and improving
prison administration. There is also a proposal to strengthen the Blar.
7.     Reforming Central and Local Public Administration: The government has taken
various measures in the last few years to streamnline the structure of the government at the central
and regional levels and reduce staff. Functional reviews of three ministries have been completed
and of other ministries and agencies are underway. Inter-department groups and commissions,
including NGOs representatives are being widely used tO develop national, regional and sector
programs and review draft laws. However, various issues remain. The policy making capacity of
the public sector is weak; implementation of policies is unleven; new management systems
attuned to the emerging role of the public sector have yet to develop; there is inadequate
transparency and accountability in the functioning of the state; and there is undue government
interference in business activities. The strategy for the future includes clarification of the roles
and responsibilities of executive authorities are various levels, optimization of the structures of
public entities, improving accountability, openness and transparency, reallocating regulatory
functions between agencies with privatization of some of these, intensifying the fight against
corruption and developing staff capacity.
8.     Decentralization and Local Self Governance: The Local Self Government elections
were a major step in the decentralization process. A Law on LSG and local state administration
was passed in 2002. There are now 487 LSGs at village and city level. The Law on the Courts of
the Elderly promotes resolution of disputes locally. Public hearings on local budgets have been
introduced. Additional powers have been transferred to L.SGs from the Ministry of Labor and
Social Protection. LSGs have also been given greater authority in budgeting and local taxation
and communal property has been transferred to them. Continuing problems in LSGs include
weak legal framework, need for additional delegation of a,uthority., continuing centralization of a
significant part of the local budget, mismatch between mandates and financial resources and lack
of managerial, administrative and technical capacity. The strateg) to strengthen local self
government includes improvement in legislation, increased fiscal dlevolution, improvement in
asset management, enhancement of capacity of municipal civil servants and building civil society
partnerships.
9.     Reforming State Financial Management: This section does not discuss the first
generation reforms in public expenditure management that have already been implemented in



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjustment Credit- Program Document,, April 21, 2003  81
recent years. The important deficiencies highlighted are the need to improve budget formulation
to ensure financing of priority areas under the NSPR, grant greater autonomy to ministries,
departments and regions in budget management, increase predictability of budget flows and
increase transparency, accountability and timeliness in budget execution. The strategy to
strengthen PEM include improving macro-economic forecasting, strengthening project planning
and prioritization capacity, improving budget formulation through the gradual introduction of a
Medium Term Budget Framework and program budgeting, improving the budget code,
computerization of the Treasury and restructuring of the Ministry of Finance.
10.    Creating an Effective Civil Service: A Civil Service Law was passed in 1999. Since
then a register of civil service positions has been developed, regulations on attestation, grading
and promotion of civil servants and creation of a civil service reserve have been developed and
civil service salaries have been raised. A Code of Ethics of Civil Servants has been instituted.
Ethics Commissions have been set up at the central, regional and local levels. However, reforms
in the the civil service system need to be deepened. There is a lack of clear differentiation
between political and career positions, civil servants have inadequate protection against dismissal
for political reasons, the level of civil service skills is low, especially in policy making and
implementation areas that are key to poverty reduction, salaries are inadequate, organizational
arrangements for management of the civil service are weak and there is a lack of a performance
and client service orientation. The reform strategy comprises of improvements in the civil service
law and regulations, strengthening civil service management, implementing a medium term
strategy to adjust the size of the civil service and improve its remuneration, and upgrading skills
in critical areas.
11.   Electronic Government: Initial steps to increase the use of the Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) in govemment have been taken with the creation of the State
Computer Network and training of senior executives in use of computers. Also web-pages of
some of the main state organs have been created. The future strategy includes the development of
a system to monitor the implementation of the CDF and NSPR. In addition, it includes an
ambitious vision of re-engineering the structure and business processes of the whole public
administration and development of a National Information Network that would improve
efficiency and cost effectiveness of public sector operations, provide real- time information for
decision making and facilitate communication with the public.
12.   The GSAC/GTAC would help the government in meeting some of the important strategic
objectives included in the NPRS. These are:
*  Increasing the dissemination of information about important aspects of the functioning of the
public sector to citizens and civil society, to strengthen transparency, accountability and
participation.
* Enhancing transparency in the process of development of legal and normative acts, to ensure
stakeholder inputs and improve consistency.
* Strengthening of grievance and appellate mechanisms, to provide recourse against
administrative excesses.
*  Reducing perverse incentives of regulatory agencies through elimination of 'special means'
funding derived from regulatory activities.
*  Strengthening extemal and internal audit systems.
* Improving public expenditure management through improvements in budget formulation,
budget execution and the structure of the Ministry of Finance.
* Rationalizing the structure of the government to reduce functional duplication and improve
efficiency.



Kyrgyz Republic: Governance Structural Adjushnent Credit- Programn Document,, April 21, 2003  82
* Improving the professionalism and capacity of the civil service, to formulate and execute
policies aimed at sustainable growth and poverty reduction.
13.     In addition to the above, we have also included in the GSAC agenda improvement in the
system of declaration of assets and incomes and public procuremnnt. Almost all the interventions
under the GSAC/GTAC would directly and indirectly contribute to the fight against corruption.

Annex 8
Development of a Communications Strateny to Support the Reform ARenda
1.     The GSAC and GTAC    operations aim at improving transparency of State affairs and
govemment accountability to stakeholders. To achieve these objectives, it will be necessary to
increase public access to relevant information about public sector reform through effective
communications channels. This will ensure that the public has the necessary information and the
means to act as an effective enforcer of good government.
2.     At the same time, key groups within the administration of the State are expected to
participate actively in the implementation of reforms under GSAC and GTAC in order to make
these operations successful. Many of these reforms imply a drastic change in the status quo (i.e.
publication of tax declarations of high state officials, enacting of a new Civil Service Law, greater
attention on public grievances regarding performance of public institutions, etc.) Identifying these
groups' perceptions of project components affecting them, positively or negatively, will help
pinpoint possible roadblocks to project implementation early on and map out mitigation activities.
3.    In collaboration with ECA External Affairs, a Needs Assessment relating to
communication relating to the GSAC and GTAC would first be developed. The objective of this
exercise will be to identify opportunities and obstacles that may affect smooth design and
implementation of project activities. Once the needs assessment is completed, an Action Plan will
set out short-, medium- and long-term objectives. It will also map out communications activities
and a timeframe for implementation.
4.     A preliminary review of the activities to be implemented under GSAC and GTAC
suggests the need to focus support on three areas: i) overcoming possible obstacles to
implementation by addressing the risk of vested interest opposition early on; ii) strengthening
public access to relevant information on State affairs, and iii) creating public demand for public
sector reforms.
I.     Overcoming obstacles to project implementation:
5.     Activities under this focal area would be geared towards identifying political, cultural and
social roadblocks to the successful preparation/implementation of program activities in order to
map out specific strategies to overcome them. Efforts will also aim at identifying constituents
that strongly support this operation and developing mechanisms to consolidate and echo this
support.
6.     Perceptions of main stakeholders affected by the project, positively or negatively will be
identified during the needs assessment. This analysis will include the following groups:
+ Civil servants & public officials
+ Parliamentarians
+ Officials in the ministries that will be reorganized under the project (i.e. Ministry of Health)
+ Teachers and other education professionals
+ Procurement staff in line ministries
+ Chambers of Account
+ Users of public services



Kyrgyz Republic: Governane StructuralAdjustment Credit- Program Document,, April 21,2003  84
7.     Based on this analysis, activities to overcome potential roadblocks and enhance public
support for public reforms will be included in a communications strategy in support of the GSAC
and GTAC operations.
II.    Strengthening public access to relevant infomlnation on State affairs:
8.     Activities under this focal area would be geared towards putting in place the right
communications mechanisms to ensure availability of relevant informnation on State affairs and
public sector reforms.
9.     Communications activities will help define which segments of civil society are more
active in promoting State tiansparency and therefore more willing to act as "enforcers" of good
practice in this domain (i.e. chambers of commerce, NGOs, AcacLemia, etc.) Although
communications efforts should ensure that information on State affairs is accessible to the general
population, this group would constitute the main target audience for this kind of information flow.
10.    Once the main audience has been identified, the most effective communications channels
to reach them will be selected.
11.    More specifically, communications activities will focus on increasing public access to the
following data:
+ status of public sector reform under GSAC and GTAC
+ declarations of income and assets of high State officials
+ audit reports
+ new legislation and draft laws
+ procurement process (including publication of contraci awards)
+ process of developing and implementing naticnal and r egional budgets
+ progress on health reform
+ public perceptions of the performance of selected government agencies
12.    Staff at the Govemnment Public Infornation Center (GPIC) which is to be established
under the project would be responsible for all issues related to the provision of information on
State Affairs. It will also act as a conduit for bottom-up information flows.
III.   Creating public demand for public sector reforms:
13.    Efforts will also be geared towards creating public demand for good govenmment by
implementing communications strategies that build credibility for the reforms to be carried out
under the GSAC and GTAC operations. These will be based on public opinion data that identifies
public expectations and concerns regarding public sector performance and looking at the fit
between these concerns and the GSAC and GTAC refon-n activities.
14.    Communications activities will also aim at enabling public consultations on government
policy, draft laws and regulations; and supporting the creation of effective public grievance
mechanisms to create two-way communications channels and st-engthen public participation in
government decision-making.
15.    By being able to effectively communicate with civil society on key areas of public sector
reform, the government will build public understanding of its program which is necessary to
secure comrnitment to refonns on the part of all stakeho]lders. This approach will also contribute
to promote transparency in the govemment, integrity in public sector activities, and a culture of
professional ethics across public institutions.
