MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DMVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A SECOND BORGOU RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Benin for SDR 15.9
million (US$21 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity,
and would assist in financing a project to improve rural development in
the Borgou Province and supporting an action program designed to
restructure and rehabilitate the cotton sub-sector.
2.        Background.  Agriculture, the most important sector in Benin.
accounts for about 45? of GDP and half of recorded exports, provides for
the livelihood of over 85 of the country's 4 million inhabitants, and
is the source of income and employment of about 500,000 farm families.
Benin has been historically self-sufficient in food production, with
cereals production increasing at the rate of about 42 per annum. The
cotton sub-sector is rapidly becoming important for the economy,
representing over 1OZ of the value of agricultural output and 24Z of
exports for 1985.
3.        The Government's principal support for agriculture has come
through integrated rural development projects implemented by Provincial
Rural Development Agencies, the CARDERs, and assisted by various
multilateral and bilateral donors, including IDA.  Results from these
projects, combined with a return to normal climatic conditions, over the
past five years, have been quite impressive with an approximate increase
of 502 in foodcrop production and an eightfold increase in cotton
production. Technological advance at the farm level is demonstrated by
the adoption of animal traction and improved seed, notably in the Borgou
Province. However, possibilities for further rapid expansion of the
sector appear less favorable than over the last few years because of
constraints related to low, even if increasing, world market prices for
cotton; a production potential constrained by limited foodcrop markets;
and a lack of efficient management in. and adequate funding for, the
expanding agricultural parastatals. These constraints require that the
Government's strategy focus on the redefinition of the public sector
role in managing the rural sector. This would involve greater
responsibility for investments by the private sector and farmer groups,
improved parastatal management and better support to agricultural
services. These issues would be addressed in the sector study included
in the proposed project.



4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is designed to
initiate structural reforms in the rural sector of Benin while
continuing IDA's support to improve production in the largest province.
Borgou. The project represents an appropriate mix between project and
program lending to encourage the Government to pursue needed policy
reforms. In Benin's current difficult financial situation, agriculture
provldes the best hope for increasing the incomes of a large segment of
the population and the country as a whole. The Government has responded
positively to XDA's recomuendations through the ongoing rural
development projects by introducing policy improvements and reducing
subsidies over time and pursuing a more attractive pricing policy for
cotton. Farmers have responded rapidly to these more liberal economic
policies. Nevertheless and in spite of substantial gains made through
area-based rural development projects, signs of stress have appeared in
this approach, such as weak coordination of actions at the national
level; financial difficulties in supporting institutions, and slow
adjustment to changing internal and external conditions. The
Government's financial situation is such that it cannot sustain the
gains made under the first Borgou Rural Development Project without
external support. It has, therefore, asked IDA to help consolidate the
gains of the first project and to support the reorientation of its rural
development strategy through the reorganization of the cotton sub-sector
and a rural sector study. The project has been designed to respond to
the Government's request.
5.        Project Obiectives.  The project would consolidate the results
of the first Borgou Rural Development Project by strengthening farmer
organizations. import and credit supply and extension services;
increasing the productivity of smallholders; and reorganizing the cotton
sub-sector and improving its financial viability. The national and
regional studies included in the project would be the backbone of a
sector adjustment program for the longer term.
6.        Project Description.  The rural development component would
aim at improving extension services and training; promoting animal
traction; supplying agricultural inputs and cotton ginning factory spare
parts; strengthening applied foodcrop and cotton research; consolidating
farmer groups; and rehabilitating and maintaining feeder roads. The
institutional component would help in strengthening the financial
management and procedures of the CARDER Borgou and the national cotton
processing agency, SONAPRA; and preparing a medium-term development
program for the sector. The cotton sub-sector rehabilitation component
would involve the reassignment of responsibilities among institutions
and introduction of far-reaching measures to reduce costs and improve
management. Counterpart funds for IDA-financed improved inputs and
spare parts would be used to increase the working capital of agencies
involved in the sector to enable them to settle their outstanding debts
toward the outside economy. The project actions dovetail with the
adjustment actions planned in the program of macroeconomic reforms under
discussion by the Government, the Bank and the IMF (see Benin Country
Brief, September 1987).



7.        Total project cost is estimated at US$67.3 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$26.5 million, or 39Z. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are show in Schedule A.
Procurement methods and disbursements are given in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Benin are presented respectively in Schedule C and D. Two
maps showing project location are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 6460-BEN dated January 12, 1988 is being distributed
separately.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
main actions: (a) implementation of agreed recommendations of an FAO
study on CARDER organization; (b) IDA agreement on annual work programs
and budgets for CARDER Borgou, SONAPRA, the Stabilization Fund and the
Research Units, URP Ina and RCF, and annual audits of the accounts of
these institutions; and tc) employment of satisfactory managers in
CARDER Borgou, SONAPRA, and the Stabilization Fund. Conditions for
effectiveness include: (a) staffing of the secretariat of the Management
Committee of the Stabilization Fund and structural modification of
SONAPRA; (b) signature of satisfactory contracts for the technical
assistance positions in SONAPRA and for export marketing of cotton
through sales agents; (c) signature of financing agreements between the
Government, the Stabilization Fund and SONAPRA; (d) establishment of a
project account and the Government's deposit of its initial
contribution; and (e) signature of the first annual working agreement
between SONAPRA and the CARDERs. The Government and IDA also agreed on
the content of the cotton sub-sector program which the Government
subsequently sent to IDA in the form of a Policy Statement. Financing
linked to the rehabilitation program would be released in two tranches:
the first on effectiveness of the credit and the second, about one year
later. based on satisfactory progress in implementation of the cotton
sub-sector rehabilitation program.
9.        Benefits.  Economic benefits would primarily derive from
production improvement, and consolidation and increase of yields
achieved under the first Borgou Project. Increases in production and
productivity would raise the average per capita income despite lower
producer prices and higher input prices.  By helping to finance and
restructure Benin's key cotton sub-sector, the project would help it
survive the abrupt drop in export prices that occurred during the
1985/86 and 1986/87 seasons, thereby averting a possible depression in
the economy at large, and would improve its financial viability and
comparative advantage. The project would also assist in restoring the
viability of key rural institutions and would prepare the way for
sector-wide adjustment programs in the future. The economic rate of
return is 252 and is not overly sensitive to variations in yields, world
market prices or cost overruns.
10.       Risks.  The main risks concern the possibility that
international cotton prices may recover more slowly than anticipated,
the negative reaction of farmers to cotton price reduction and market
constraints on foodcrop production. The project is designed in such a
way that if international cotton prices were to stay at their present
low level in real terms for a long time, adjustments could be made to



-4-
introduce more extensive production methods that would reduce input cost
through the adoption of simple technical recommendations for cultural
practices. Research is also being undertaken into crop diversification
possibilities.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit
complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
