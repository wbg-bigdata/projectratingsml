MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRED1T TO MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A RURAL REHABILlTATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for SDR 14.5 million, the equivalent of US$ 20 million, o, standard IDA terms
with a matuity of 40 years to help finance a Rural Rehabilitation project for Mozambique.
2.                  d. More than a decade of conflict in Mozambique has resulted In the
massive displacement of rural populations and the destruction of rural infrastructure, including
schools, clinics, storage facilities, shops and roads. A peace accord was Figned in October 1992 and
ini  steps have been taken towards restoring peace. As a result of these positive developments, the
Government and donors are preparing a National Reconstruction Program (NRP) to plan post-war
rehabilitation activities and support for the voluntary resettlement of about four million people,
including refugees and internally displaced people, who are expected to retm spontaneously to their
land.
3.         War has impeded agricultura production and marketinj and weakened agricultural
services. Agriculture accounts for 40-50% of GDP and 80% of export earnings, employing over 80%
of the labor force. The resource base is favorable; land is plentifuil; soils are reasonably fertile, and
raill usually adequate. From Independence to 1987, however, the sector performed poorly;
between 1981 and 1986, agricultural production fell by about 30% and exports by nearly 75%, at a
time when large amounts of land where abandoned. Such poor perfomace can be attributed to the
war, poor pricing and marketing policies, neglect of smal1holder farmers and concentration of public
resources on large projects and szate farms, and natural calamities. Sma11holders produce over 95%
of food production and about 50% of export crops. For this, and poverty considerations, they now
constitute the focus of Government policy and Bank support Under the Economic Recovery Program
adopted In 1987, Government liberalized pricing and marketing policies and discontinued operation
of most state farms. Prices to farmers have increased significantly and the rural trade network is
stating to recover.
4.         To rehabilitate the rural economy in newly safe areas, the Government adopted the
Priority Districts Program (PDP) in 1989 as an interim program targeting interventions in safe, high-
potent  districts. With the advent of peace, the govermnent has incorporate the PDP into the first
phase of the NRP. This first phase focuses on nral resettlement and production recovery. It
stimuates agricultural recovery by providing basic inputs to households for agricultural production,
as well as simple infrastructure (such as rural water supply) and social services to allow communities
to function again. The second phase of the NRP will consist of larger, integrated reconstuction and
developmental programs. Authorities wiUl decide on these programs based on the geographical
distribution of population resulting from the resettlement process supported by the first phase. A
large proportion of the programs to be implemented during the second phase will be identified,
prepared and implemented using decentalized procedures o be tested duing the first phase.
Substanti benefits are expected to rest from the NRP. Over the short-term, improved seurity and
the reselemenat of between 20% and 30% of Mozanbique's population would lead to increased
agriculturl output.



5.         TheAe are several constraints to the execution of major rehabilitation activities, including
excessive centralization in the allocation of resources, the limited capacity of government services and
a lack of clear direction on critical land use and land tenure issues. Post-war rural rehabilitation will
require a significant modification in mechanisms for planning and implementing rural development
activities. A consultative mechanism must be developed so that communities can become involved
in the definition of interventions based on local needs. An implementation mechanism must be
available at the provincial and district levels so that necessary funds can be channeled direcy to
priority interventions, without the bureaucratic delays caused by excessive centralized control.
Substantive training and capacity building must be provided at the provincial and district level to
implement the NRP. New data on land use and land tenure must be developed and clear policies
designed to provide land tenure security need to be articulated.
6.         Poect OWeetjys. The project is designed to support the NRP. Its primary objective
is to undertake, on a pilot basis, activities to support decentralized rural economic recovery while
creating the institutional capn^ity and procedures necessary to address the broader post-war
rehabilitation needs. Specific objectives are: (i) to strengthen the capacity of the provincial
institutions that will plan, implement and manage nadonal reconstruction activities; and to test and
further improve the procedures for decentralized rural development; (ii) to provide information about
land use to assist with planning future infrastructure investments and acilitate the resettlement of
returnees; and to support the development of land policies that wil provide greater tenure security
for smallholders; (iii) to help households returning to their traditional lands recover their self-
sufficiency, reduicing the need for food imports and restoring the country's productive capacity; and
(iv) to improve the living conditions and health of rural households by providing access to potable
water and to reduce the amount of time and energy spent by women and children in collecting and
carrying water, thus increasing their opportunities for productive work, education and social
activities.
7.         fQWe DendQi.  Field activities would take place in Sofala and Zambezia
provinces. The project includes four components: (J) Suppr for Den traifza1mSo Comnnct
(34% of base costs). A pilot activity will be undertaken in two provinces to test and refine
procedures for financing and implementing sub-projects to benefit smaliholder production, rura trade,
and the environment. The capacity of public insttions that will implement these decentalized
procedures nationwide under the National Reconstruction Program will be strengthened. Courses and
seminars will be conducted to train government officials, NGO staff and community leaders about
the mechanisms for decentralized, community-based rural development; (ii) land CgMgoe  (1S%
of base costs). This component will support the development of land policies that will provide greater
tenure security for smallholders, including the design and test of procedures for d&'narcating
smalwholder lands. It will also provide information about land use at the national level as well as in
high priority districts in Sofala and Zambdzia; (iii) Dhhbution ofAgsks Comgonet (25% of
base costs). To assist with spontaneous post-war resetdement, the project will fina   packages of
seeds and tools (AgPacks) for households returning to their traditional lands in the project area. The
packages of improved seeds and agricultural hand tools will be procured and distributed by NGOs
active in the area. During the first year, all inputs wiUl be distributed without charge to make a
massive distribution feasible and to allow the NGOs to focus on the effective distribution of inputs,
rather than struggle with the administration of symbolic payments. Beneficiaries requiring inputs
during the second year would be required to participate in seed-for-work programs to ensure a
process of self-selection where only the households truly in need of additional seed would participate;
and (iv) Rural Water Supply Compont (26% of base costs). This component will increase the



- iii -
coverage of rural water supply in the project area and will improve the arganization and management
of provincial water supply institutions and open the way for a wider participation by the private
sector. It also will strengthen community participation in operation and maintenance through support
of the Community Education Program and the purchase of easy-to-maintain hand pumps. The project
costs and financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Schedule B provides the procurement methods
and disbursements, as well as the estimated disbursements by fiscal year for the project. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank group operations are given in Schedule C and
D respectively.
8.        1r .mpLqmOneation Managershavebeenidentifiedfor each ofthemainactivities,
and are located in existing administrative units in the Institute of Rural Development (INDER), the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Construction and Water and the ProvincW  Planning
Commissions of Sofala and Zambezia Provinces. A Steering Committee, comprising the Directors
of all implementing units, will be responsible for ensuring consistency and strengthening linkages
among the four components of the project. Community based subprojects will be identified by
district and provincial officials and NGOs, approved by the provincial governments, and implemented
by communities with the support of NGOs. NGOs will be selected according to IDA guidelines.
Selection criteria for subprojects include: technical feasibility and efficiency, benefits relative to costs,
minimum beneficiary contribution, targeting to the poor and beneficiary commitment to operation and
mantenance.
9.         Project Sustainability. Project activities are sustainable in terms of their financial and
institutional impact. Incremental recurrent costs of the project will be smali and the project's long-
term impact on the recurrent cost budget will not be significant. The project will affect the structure
rathe than the level of the budget. If the pilot is successful, the Government may decide to assign
a greater proportion of the investment budget to decentralized investments, reducing the share of
centrally implemented investments. In relation to the institutional impact, the project will provide
skils and an institutional capacity for continued investment in rural areas. The project does not
create new institutional structures; instead It concentates in strengthening exstg ones. The proji4
also strengthens, through technological change and training, community operation and mainnce
of rural water systems. Input distribution is designed to help smaliholders recover their self-
sufficiency.
10.        Lessons I&aMed    While no PCRs have been carried out on IDA assistance to
agriculture in Mozambique, Country Implementation Reviews were held in 1991 and 1992 and
revealed a number of generic lessons for the future. Some of the most important lessons are that:
(i) dynamic local involvement is fundamental to achieving project objectives; (ii) strong donor
coordination during project preparation helps to avoid duplication/gaps in effort and reduces the
* management and reportng burden on local institutions; (iii) streamlining Governmet procedures for
contracting technical assistance and civil works can facilitate project implementation, as can the use
of standard bidding documents; and (iv) project coordination and management systems need to be
firmly established at the outset and strengthened continuously through appropriate staffing, in-service
training, and use of local consultants. These lessons and others have been fillly incorporated in the
design of the proposed project, which was formulated by the Mozambican officials in those
instittions that will be responsible for implementation.
11.        Rationale for IDA Involvement and Unks wlth Country Strateg. This project is
designed in accordance with the main elements of IDA's country strategy for Mozambique, the focus



- iv -
of Which includes: (i) strengthening the Govemment's capacity to plan and manage policies and
prioritize public expenditures towards agriculture and infrastructure, (U) reducing food insecurity by
increasing agricultural production, and (iii) enhancing pivate sector opportuoities through the
rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. With respect to strengthening the Government's capacity, the
project provides support to the Government's efforts to make effective its decentralizaion policy,
developing channels to prioritize expenditures in agriculture and infrastructure according to the needs
of communities; it also supports the Government in developing a land policy. With reference to
reducing food insecurity, the project includes investments focused on the poor and will increase food
security by providing seed, tools and other support to smallholders retning to their traditional lands
after the war. Opportunities for the private sector will be enhanced by the rehabilitaton of r
infrascture which will allotv private sector activities to develop in areas devastated by war.
12.                            . An environmeotal analysis for this Category B project was
completed before appraisal. Its main conclusion s that the project would have so negative
environental impact.
13.         gmQObjective CagQdmes. (i) The project would have a positive impact on
women farmers; the process of identification and monitoring of subprojects, the development of land
policy, and the water supply activities are designed to improve women's welfare; (ii) All project
acvities would support private sector development, in farming, tading and constucdon; t(i) NGOs
would play a major role In project implementation, helping smallholder farmers to prcass ,obprojects
and as vehicles for the distribution of inputs and the provision of technical assistance; (iv) As the
project addresses the poorest populaton strata, it would have a major effect on poverty alleviaton
and, by enhancing production and income-earning capacities of the poor, would also Improve food
security.
14.       .Eues and Agd=    During negotiations, assurances were receved from the
Government that: (i) all subprojects wiUl be processed according to the procedures described by the
Operations Manual; (li) by the end of Year 3 of project implementat, the Govment will produce
a revised Operaions Maal incorporating lessons learned during project implemtation and a report
of the Land Study containing methodology for demarcating smallholder lands; and; (ii) a study on
the Organization and Management of Provincial Watr Supply and an Inventory of Ruri  Water
Supply Infrastructure for Sofala and Zamb"ia wil be completed during the first year of project
implementation. The following will be a condltion of credit effectiveness: approval of the fnal
veio of the Opertions Manua. The following wilI be a condition of disbu _emet for the
community-based subprojects: The deposit of US$50,000 equivalent into project accounts in Sofala
and Zambzia provinces.
15.        Bmenfet. The Project is expected to provide benefits at two levels; fist, by intat
rhabilitation of the smallholder sector In Sofia and Zambezia provinces and second, by preparing
instiutons and human resources for nationwide, post-war reconstruction. Smalholders ithe project
area will benefit from increased investment in local infrastructure, a greater role in defi   and
prioriizing local needs, more secre land riS  and improved water supplies. in addition,
smallholders reting to their traditional lands In the project area will receive seeds and tools. 
should result in incresed food production, opportunties for marketing  urplu   and impoved
health. Procedures for decentralized rural investment will be developed and tested. Lad policies
designed to strengthen the secrty of tenure of smallholders will be articulated, and lnd use



inormatio will be made avalable. Traning and instuion buildiug vill create capacI to respond
to fure needs.
16.         U. Scurity rwams the greatest risk, even though a peae eor has beeo  gnod.
It Is possile that law and order wil not be flly restored for years or Jat fiurher unrest will erupt
as demiltaizato  and the pbnned eections proceed. Projec a4vitle wil be concentrated in
diticts that have been sdected, in part, for thei retve secUrity. The disticts can be changed
during project implementation if waranted. The second major risk is the Govrnme's weak
Implementatin capacity.  The project design addresses this weakness through Is focus on pilot
activities, training and capacity building, as well as its inclusion of technical assistane and NGO
paicipatio
17.         O_B         9. I am satisfied tat the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agrement of the Assoiation and reconmmend that the Execudve Directrs appe the
propsed credit

Mozembiquo'e portfolio of IDA-supported project. io relatively young with moot projecte belng les than thre
yre  old. All IDA-cupported project. are smnaged fineancelly by the Central Bank, Sens de Mlocambique (8dM).
Preylously, understff ing and the erosion of adminlitrative procedures over the lonI period of the eivil war
contributed to 5dM being the main bottleneck to smooth disbursement.. Steps have now been taken to decentralize
the flnancial canagement of projects to the Implementing agncles through dicusesion  with odM       through the
conditional lty employed under the Economic Recovery Credit. IDA Is continuing Its offort to build up
administrative copacity and to put In place workable systems that facilitet. project leplasntation. To this
end, specific ections taken Include: si) the stationing of as enlor Bank staff membr In th  field to help
accelerate/faciltate lmplementation; (11) the continued review of lmplementtion issue  via regular Country
Implemntation Reviews (CIRm); (iii) training for local saff In a number of basie Implementation ares and;
(iv) the judicious use of suspension of disbursemnt. where evidence of non-cmpliance Is obvious.
