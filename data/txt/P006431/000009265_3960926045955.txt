PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
SKILLS FORMATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2810-BR)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Skills Formation Project
in Brazil, for which Loan 2810-BR in the amount of US$74.50 million was approved
on May 12, 1987. The loan amount disbursed was US$13.04 million and US$58.90
million was canceled.  The difference, an undisbursed amount of US$2.56 million,
will be disbursed before loan closing no later than June 30, 1996.
This PCR was prepared by the Human Resources Division of the Technical
Department in the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office following a mission
to Brazil between May 6 to 17, 1991. Preparation of the report was based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the record of the Board discussion of this
project, the Loan Agreement, all material in the Bank's file pertinent to this
project and the findings of the mission.
The draft PCR (Parts I and III) was sent to the Borrower with a request
to Prepare Part II in July 1991.   Their comments (Part II) were received
October 30, 1991.

PROJECT COMPLiTION REPORT
BRAZIL
SKILLS FORMATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2810-BR)
EV.1LUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Identification of the Skills Formation Project was carried out by a Bank
mission in November 1985. The project was appraised in August 1986, approved by
the Board May 12, 1987 and the loan became effective December 15, 1987. The
project's total cost was estimated at US$166.40 million, including US$74.50
million from the Bank loan and US$81.90 million from the Government of Brazil.
Because of Brazil's unprecedented economic difficulties and implementation
problems, the Government requested cancellation of the Loan on October 17, 1990.
An amount of US$58.90 million was canceled.
Obiectives and Content of the Proiect
2.    The objective of the project was  to improve the responsiveness of
vocational training to rapidly changing technologies through: (a) strengthening
the CFMO and the SMO to develop their policy f rmulation capabilities so they
could inform and guide the evolution of NVTS p. - cy; (b) improving the policy and
program management and implementation capacicies of SENAI. SENAC, SENAR and
FUNDACENTRO; and (c) enhancing the quality, relevance and coverage of training
provided by the three training agencies and FUNDACENTRO.
3.    At appraisal,  the nine-year project was comprised of the following
elements: (a) several background studies aind proj -sals for institutional
development; (b) a comprehensive human resources training program for about
15,080 technical staff and administrators; (c) a technical assistance program of
specialist services for about 2,780 staff-months, and fellowships for about 2,020
staff-months; (d) occupational analyses of about 95 professions to update
training content; (e) new training modules for about 650 skills; (f) preparaticon
of instructional materials (manuals, slides, cae-attes, etc.); (g) instructional
equipment for 208 mobile units/sets and 42 existing training centers; and (h)
construction and equipping of 37 training centers (29 new ones and eight existing
ones).
Implementation: Experience and Results
4.    Project implementation was cut short after three and a half years.
Total disbursements were only US$13.04 million* or just about 17% of the US$74.50
million equivalent committed. The substantial cutback in project implementation



- iv -
was due in part to factors beyond the content of project management: political
instabllity, rapidly rising inflation, and growing budgetary restrictions, which
froze the use of counterpart funds both for government-financed (SMO and
FUNDACENTRO) and autonomous agencies (SENAI and SENAC). Insufficient and delayed
financial support by the government for MOL (SHO) and FUNDACENTRO also
contributed to implementation difficulties.
5.   The significant organizational changes that took place in the MOL
contributed to the limited accomplishments of the aborted project. Although
overall project performance was far below acceptable Bank standards, the project
achieved a modicum of success in partially implementing some components in SENAI
and SENAC (para. 10). The SENAR's component were never initiated, however and
the institutional development objectives such as reinforcing the capability of
the MOL to guide policy formulation and provide supporting services for the NVTS,
were not achieved at all.
Sustginabilitv
6.    The project did not achieve its major objectives.   Therefore, it is
unlikely that the institutional strengthening of the NVTS will be sustainable.
Nevertheless, since expanding the demand for services ensures institutional
sustainability, the SENAI, SENAC, and FUUDACENTRO training centers will continue
to function over the medium to long term.
Findings and Lessons
7.    The project appraisal team paid insufficient attention to the provision of
counterpart funds for SMO and FUNDACENTRO, it was overly optimistic regarding the
Borrower's commitment to the institutional development objectives of the project
and it underestimated the project management weaknesses of the MOL. Experience
with this project highlights the need for: (a) ensuring firm political and
financial commitment for projects, including more careful assessment and
projections of counterpart funding availability over the life of the project; and
(b) instituting a viable implementation mechanism.

PROJECT COMPLETION UPOT
BRAZIL
SKILLS FORMATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2810-BR)
PART Is PROJECT REVIEW  SROM T   EMKS' PERSPECTIVE
A.    Proiect Identity
Project Name: Skills Formation
Loan Number:  2810-BR
RVP Unit:     LA1PH
Country:      Brazil
Sector:       Education
Subsector:    Vocational Training
B.    Proiect Background
1.          Sector DeveloDment Objectives.   During project appraisal,  the
Brazilian government envisaged a continuation of the rapid economic growth of the
early 19809 and of technological advances particularly in ranufacturing. The GOB
also intended a concerted drive to expand exports of manufactured goods, which
required keeping pace with rapidly changing and increasingly complex production
methods (for example, digitally controlled machine tools, laser technology,
robotics. biogenetics). With Brazil's proven ability to waster and incorporate
new technologies, these objectives were realistic and under more stable
circumstances  achievable.    Incorporating  new  technologies  into  economic
production at the expected rapid pace required an equally rapid expansion of
programs for orienting and training workers in their use and maintenance.
2.          Policy Context. Goverrment policies toward vocational training were
meant to enhance labor productivity.  Key policies were to: promote a shift
toward the private sector in responsibility for training; retrain workers to meet
changing industrial needs and to promote safety in the work places and, raise the
quality of vocational training.  Particular emphasis was given to providing
service-related training for rural youths in poorer regions to increase their
employability. Effective use of existing and potential training resources and
expansion of training opportunities were also part of the overall policy
objectives.
3.          Linksges between Proiect. Sector and Macro Policy Objectives.
These general policy aims complemented broader sectoral objectives for economic
and social development and were appropriately linked with project objectives.



-2-
The project was intended to improve sector policies, enhance management
capabilities, and trai.-tng effectiveness, in addition it was to improve coverage
and quality of training.
C.    Prolect Obiectives and Description
4.          Prolect Obiectives. The objective of the project was to improve the
responsiveness of vocational training to rapidly clanging technologies through:
(a) strengthening the CFMO and the SMO to develop their policy formulation
capabilities so they could inform and guide the evolution of NVTS policy; (b)
impsrving the policy and program management and implementation capacities of
SENAI, SENAC, SENAR and FUNDACENTRO; and (c) enhancing the quality, relevance and
coverage of training provided by the three training agencies and FUNDACENTRO.
5.          Prolect  ComDonents.    The  project  components  encompassed  the
following:
(a)   preparing  several  background  studies   and  proposals   for
institutional development;
(b)   implementing a comprehensive human resources training program for
about 15,080 technical staff and administrators;
(c)   implementing a technical assistance program for specialist services
of about 2.780 staff-months and fellowships for about 2.020 staff-
months;
(d)   executing occupational analyses of about 95 professions to update
training content;
(e)   developing new training modules for about 650 skills;
(f)   adapting instructional materials (manuals, slides, cassettes, etc.)
(g)   providing instructional equipment for 208 mobile units/sets and 50
existing training centers; and
(h)   constructing and equipping 37 training centers (29 new ones and
eight existing ones).
D.    Proiect Desian and Organization
6.          The project was  designed and prepared by the government over a
period of nine months with assistance from Bank staff and international
consultants. Based on the experience of the previous Bank project (Ln.1452-BR)
with the MOL in Brazil, the conceptual basis of the project was clear. However,
the organization and the management models had risks and flaws that inhibited
effective project implementation. While the role and responsibilities of MOL



-3-
under the project were clearly defined and nnderstood at the onset, changes in
staff, reorganizations within the Government and shifts in policy priorities
contributed to the delays and the abrupt termination of the project.
7.          In the case of SENAC, in retrospect, it appeai a that while the Bank
"packaged" all project components appropriately with subs,antial institutional
development subcomponents,   SENAC does not appear to have ever been fully
committed to its essential elements.  During implementation, this agency failed
to carry out a serious analysis of the economic efficiency of its vocational
training programs,  although this was meant to be the first step in the
institutional strengthening of SENAC.  Given the government's perspective as
indicated in Part II, the Bank also failed to meet the perceived needs of the
government in the design of the project, suggesting a possible breakdown in
relations sometime during preparation.
E.    Prolect ImDlementation.
8.          After three and a half years of implementation, only 'JS$i. 20 million
or 16% of the US$74.50 million loan was disbursed. Implementation of the project
faced many adverse circumstances, some unforeseen and others overlooked, that had
serious implications for project content, progress and outcome: (a) a substantial
fall in the country's economy, new government restrictions (1987 and 1988) and
new economic policies (1989 and 1990), which effectively froze the use of
counterpart funds both for government-financed (SMO FUNDACENTRO) and autonomous
agencies (SENAI and SENAC); (b) a change of government administration in 1989,
which caused a period of uncertainty and delays in decisionmaking because the CMF
was eliminated and its responsibilities transferred to SMO; and (c) an economic
crisis in Brazil in 1989/1991, which led to drastic austerity measures and
changes in Government priorities concerning external financing, including
cancellation of outstanding loans.
9.          The following lessons for future project design, organization and
implementation may be drawn: the borrower's capability to provide counterpart
funding and manage the project should be assessed carefully at appraisal, pending
organizational changes and sensitive political issues need to be considered and
projects designed accordingly, project design and supervision need to be
sufficiently flexible to adapt: to changing circumstances. The experience in this
project shows that the appraisal assessment did not identify a number of risks
that ultimately compromised the project including freezing of counterpart funds,
and shifting of institutional roles and responsibilities. In addition, although
the SAR indicated the risk of management weakness, the severity of this risk and
its consequence for project implementation were perhaps underestimated.
F.    Proiect Results.
10.         The  first  objective,  of  institutional  development  through
strengthening of NOL capabili. os in policy formulation and supporting services
for the NVTS, was not met t .1.. The second objective, improving policy and



- 4 -
program management and implementation capacities of the training agencies, had
only a marginal impact, and much remains to be done in this area. The third
objective, to improve the quality, relevance and coverage of training, was
somewhat achieved, but not within the framework envisioned at project appraisal.
11.         The project contributed somewhat to improvements in vocational
training standards, particularly in SENAI, by introducing new teaching
techniques, providing more technologically appropriate training equipment and
upgrading instructors' skills. Its fellowship programs enabled staff to receive
advanced training in the so called "tecnologias de ponta".  Some expansion of
canacity, particularly in the commercial and services fields (SERAC), also took
pLace. The project fell quite short in meeting its targets in FUNDACENTRO where
the project implementation component proved to be a frustrating task for the
agency's managers. This was due mainly to difficulties in obtaining timely
counterpart funding.   SERAR was caught in the shifts in its legal standing.
Counterpart funds were never authorized for SENAR by the MOL since the
Constitution endowed it with autonomous status. However, SENAR's autonomy was
never made effective and therefore resources were not budgeted for the agency.
G.    Proiect Sustainabilitv.
12.         Given the recent transfer from the MOL to the MOE of policy, strategy
and coordination functions for vocational training, there is uncertainty
regarding the policy formulation capability of and source within the federal
government. Once the economy improves, the benefits from ongoing efforts under
the project can be realized, and could raise the investment returns of the
project. These efforts are unknown at present, however. As sustainability also
results from growth in demand for training, the SENAI,SENAC, and FUNDACENTRO
training centers may be sustained over the medium and longer terms.
H.    Bank Performance.
13.         Bank performance during project development was strong in introducing
the innovative institutional development components to the Borrower. From the
initiation of project implementation, Bank staff contributed timely professional
advice to complement the research efforts of the Borrower. However, the Bank did
not provide adequate guidance to the Government and should have been more active
in addressing two important issues: (a) the lack of counterpart funding.  In
1990, the project agencies were unable to use the counterpart funds allocated in
the national budget because the Ministry of Economy froze the accounts of some
projects; and (b) the Government's decision to cancel the project.   In the
interval from May 1989 to June 1990 no supervision mission was carried out.
During this period, the reorganization of the public institutions took place, and
the Government first indicated that project cancellation was a possibility.
14.         The lesson here is that project supervision and implementation should
be given the same degree of attention as design and preparation. Missions should
be fielded at appropriate and flexible intervals, they should be adequately



-5-
staffed, and problems should be dealt with immediatrly and with the neceonary
resources. Project flexibility could have been enhanced by closer supervision
as well.   Moreover. it is evident from Part II that Bank staff were not
sufficiently clear in their instructions and guidance to Brazilian officials
during implementation.
I.     Borrower Performance.
15.         The major weaknesses in the Borrower's performance can be categorized
as financial, political and managerial.   The Borrower had serious financial
difficulties in meeting its counterpart funding obligations, a major reason for
the slow pace of project implementation.   Additionally, the Ministry of Economy
hindered the smooth implementation of the project by restricting counterpart
funds, even where budgetary allocations had already been approved. The Borrower
made several decisions for reasons of expediency (understandably given changes
in government and the economic crisis) that reduced project effectiveness: new
staff appointments; shifts of functions and personnel within the MOL; transfer
of policy, strategy and coordination responsibilities from the MOL to MOE.
16.         The agencies' performance was unever, varying according to their
organizational and staffing capacities and autonomy, and to the availability of
counterpart funds. There were a few notable exceptions, such as SENAI's high
level of professionalism, which facilitated the effective use of loan funds for
training abroad.
17.         The main lessons learned are that:
(a)   adequate coordination of all executing agencies is paramount to
effective and smooth implementation; and
(b)   executing agency staff must be aware of contractual  agreements
between the Borrower and the Bank in all areas, including financial
agreements, to ensure that they act in accordance with Borrower and
Bank requirements.
J.    Proiect Relationships.
18.          Despite the unexpected cancellation of the project there were
amicable working relations between the Bank and the Borrower, and among the
various participating agencies themselves.   Effectiveness of communication,
however, appears to have been less than ideal due to the confusion expressed by
the Government in Part II.
K.    Consulting Services.
19.         The Bank relied heavily on consultants during project preparation and
appraisal. Judging from the files, the consultants seemed to have performed
well, and the consultant services contracted by the MOL and the other agencies
were adequate in most cases. Consultant services during project implementation



fell short of expectations. At the time of project cancellation, only about 10
percent of the technical assistance targeted under the project implementation
schedule had been contracted.  In retrospect, closer Bank supervision of the
technical assistance component would have improved loan utilization and the
definition of priorities.
L.    Prolect Documentation and Data.
20.         The Staff Appraisal Report included several action plans that were
critical to the success of the institutional development component of the
project.   Although they provided a useful framework for the Bank during
implementation, it is not clear that this was true for the Borrower. Action
plans have limited usefulness if the Borrower finds them difficult to implement,
for financial, political, legal, or other reasons. In retrospect, it is better
to have the Borrower resolve critical issues prior to appraisal rather than as
actions to be addressed during project implementation. If the Borrower faces the
issue at the onset, the Bank and Borrower can define an appropriate and mutually
acceptable project design at the planning stage and avoid subsequent delays and
misunderstandings.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
SKILLS FORMATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2810-BR)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE'
A.    Introduction
1.          The project now under examination was canceled by the Government in
October 1990. It was canceled for economic policy reasons as part of the effort
to reduce public expenditures, trim subsidies, etc. The Ministry of Economy also
based its decision on operating difficulties and the high cost of its project
functions.
2.          Because of this, the analysis cannot be performed as if the project
had been completed. The early cancellation--even before the mid-term evaluation
scheduled for June 1991 (Section 3.05 of the Loan Agreement)--makes it impossible
to achieve the objectives and the anticipated medium- and long-term impacts.
3.          In order to avoid repetition, the following review is limited to
aspects not covered in Part I, and those covered but requiring some qualification
or where our views differ.
B.    Prolect Design and Organization
4.          The project was conceptually well designed and reflected a keen
perception of Brazil's Vocational Training problems and needs. It was designed
as a logical continuation of Loan Agreement 1452-BR, implemented between 1977 and
1985. The evaluation of that loan indicates that the project was successful in
terms of its physical and financial objectives but fell short in its
institutional development objectives (see PCR. World Bank, January 1990).
5.          For this reason, the design of the new project, along with large
investments in key technological and sectoral areas, placed great emphasis on the
institutional question., aimed at changes and adjustments to optimize the
'Translation of submitted review in Portuguese by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security. Original is in Annex 2.



-8-
management capability of the Vocational Training System and its executing
agencies.
6.          Despite the strong signals of social change (democratic transition,
drafting of a new Constitution. and other economic, political and institutional
changes), the underlying assumption at appraisal was "business as usual." 2 The
sole alternative scenario was suspension of project disbursements as no
flexibility was built in to accommodate changing circumstances.
7.          In light of these factors, the institutional design of the project
did not take into consideration the operational characteristics and institutional
relationships of the SENAI-SENAC systems. For example, for efficient project
implementation it would have been preferable if the Borrower had concluded
agreements with the National Directorates (DNs) of the SENAI and SENAC agencies
who would have had the power to make the regional directorates (Drs) comply with
their agreed plans.
8.          Since the regional branches are legally autonomous agencies, the
commitments entered into by the National Directorate are not automatically
binding for the Drs. This autonomy led the SENAC DR-SP (which in the project had
important responsibilities in the CFP construction works) to withdraw from the
project because it did not agree with the bidding rules and procedures (eg.
multiple and long drawn-out approval procedures), arguing that the reimbursement
rate  (19 percent)  was below the monthly  inflation  rate.    Honoring its
commitments, SENAC-DN decided to replace the Sao Paulo CFPs by others in the
Northern and North-eastern states, financing them from its own resources.
9.          This decision had its costs in a general lag in the  construction
timetable. Less drastic effects occurred in connection with SENAI. Even when
authorized by the National Directorate, SENAI regional branches delayed their
investment applications under the project. It should be noted that in these
circumstances neither the Project Management Units (of the MTb and the agencies)
nor the National Directorates themselves had the capacity (power) to resolve the
situation.
10.         Another critical flaw in the design of the project stemmed from the
fact that about 30 percent of the loan amount was accounted for by the item "not
allocated" (physical an.1 price contingencies), and that disbursements were
conditional on the existence of an entity (SENAR) that would have to be created
by the Brazilian legislature.   This raised the project costs, and involved
considerable risk for project implementation.
2 The sole reference to an alternative scenario can be found in section
5.01 (a) of the Agreement, which mentioned that the Bank would suspend the
project in the event that FUNDACENTRO, SENAI and SENAC ceased to exist in their
conventional form. This wording reflected concern about the discussions in the
Constituent Assembly, in which reference was made at one time to possible
nationalization of SENAI and SENAC.

11.         The case of SENAR also illustrates the "business as usual" assumption
and the weakness of the institutional appraisal. The investment cost and demand
definition was based entirely on information from an entity in process of
extinction (SENAR-Mtb), which would have to be replaced by an institution, to be
created and managed by the private sector. It was apparently assumed that the
new entity would take over the functions and obligations of SENAR without
significantly altering the institutional base or priorities. This position was
at the very least rash, since the change-over meant transferring the management
of SENAR to the private sector, which would obviously set its own priorities and
working arrangements with government entities.
12.         These design shortcomings, in addition to those mentioned in Part I,
hinderad implementation, generating delays and providing a strong basis for
project cancellation.
C.    Proiect Implementation
13.         Implementation of the project began during a fairly critical phase
in the country's development. The fiscal crisis, that was already looming due
to the slowdown in economic activity, assumed major proportions following the tax
reforms of the 1988 Constitution. The traditional high monthly inflation rates
(running into triple digits), economic agents channeling their surpluses and
savings to the financial market, unorthodox shocks, economic plans, etc. added
to instability. Moreover, the enactment of the 1988 Constitution significantly
reduced the Executive Branch's room for action by (a) giving the National
Congress control over the budget; and (b) placing restrictions on the Executive.
14.         The period was also marked by great administrative instability:
between 1987 (effective date) and 1990 (cancellation date), the Ministry of Labor
went through four internal reorganizations. In addition to the formal structural
changes, three different interpretations of the mandate and functions of the
Ministry of Labor occurred over the three years.
15.         It also must be borne in mind that preparation of the project began
at the end of 1985, became formally effective at the end of 1987, and reached
a normal execution pace at the end of 1988, four years after it was designed.
Even given absolute administrative continuity, it would be natural to expect that
during the interval between the project's design and effectiveness dates, the
agencies' priorities could have been changed; and new ideas, new technologies,
new commitments could have emerged; etc.
16.         In addition,  the Vocational Training area of the extinct Mtb
presented a special feature: for the first time in recent years, its management
was assumed by people with no background or connection with the agencies.
Traditionally (for example, Loan Agreement 1452-BR), the relationship of the SM0
with the agencies was very fluid because, among other reasons, its management
staff and a large part of its technical staff consisted of agency officials
transferred to the Mtb.



- 10 -
17.         Moreover, by empowering Congress to draw up, control and define the
budget, the provisions of the new Constitution also created unprecedented
situations. The level of detail of the accounts was extended and the Executive's
budget flexibi'lity was restricted. For example, differing interpretations of a
standard or of an accounting classification sufficed to block implementation of
the project for long perioda.
18.         Until 1991, there were no corstraints in counterpart (financial)
funds, and resources were available to SENAI and SENAC to meet their
expenditures. The exception was 1987, when counterpart funds were available--
with some delay at the beginning of each year--even to the SMO and FUNDACENTRO.
IBRD resources were always present in the CESA and FESA account.
19.         Financial resources were available during the entire project life.
What did not exist (because it was delayed or incorrect) was a budget. According
to the rules, even if resources existed expenditures (agency reimbursements)
could not be made without a budget. Thus, the agencies slowed their rate of
activity because they knew that they would not be reimbursed until the government
released the budget for project execution. [Thus there was a budget allocation
but no appropriation was made to authorize release of funds for project
implementation.]
20.         Added to this, agencies' management engaged in the practice common
to all enterprises in times of high inflation: while awaiting release of the
budget, they redirected their investments to other projects relevant to the
fulfillment of outstanding commitments; and, as a way of protecting resources
against erosion by inflation, invested in the financial market. Note that the
SAR (Annex III) analyses financial flows in static nominal terms, without
considering possible operational constraints on agencies' cash flow and their
relationship to the investments to be made under the project. Nor did the SAR
contain a financial analysis of the agencies' current and medium-term liquidity
ratios. These omissions are consistent with the previous comments in the section
on project  design.    The  combination  of  these  factors  added  to  design
deficiencies, and inevitably led to relatively low project execution levels.
21.         The Bank's statement that SENAC was never truly committed to the
essential elements of the project (page 3, Part I, paragraph 7 of this report)
needs to be qualified, since the agency's physical and financial performance
demonstrates the opposite. Contrary to what is said in Part I, SENAC's position
on the question of evaluating the economic efficiency of Vocational Training was
that the agency did not accept the methodology suggested by a Bank consultant;
this position was endorsed unanimously by the Research Committee. Leaders of
SENAC were intransigent in defending this position, even going so far as to
propose that the Studies and Research component be canceled. Subsequently, on
the basis of a new proposal drafted by Dr. Mehedef and Dr. Beloni (and approved
in part by IBRD), the agency after some hesitation agreed to participate in the
process.
22.         This hesitation reflected the fear that the Vocational Training
System might be evaluated and judged purely on financial and economic criteria
without due attention to the agency's social and educational functions. This



- 11 -
process of negotiation was difficult and delayed the progress of this activity,
which was truly vital to the project.
23.         It must, however, be remembered that the contractual responsibility
to perform that evaluation belonged to the Ministry--Agreement, Annex 2, Part A
(b) (iii)--and not to the agencies; from that point of view, responsibility for
the defects that occurred over this issue lies primarily with the Ministry. But
blame must be shared by the Bank itself, which also did not know how to, or was
not in a position to, define its expectations clearly, confining itself to
covering a "cost-effectiveness" evaluation without clarifying the relevant cost
criteria or effectiveness concepts.
D.    Prolect Results
24.         It is clear that, because of the cancellation, none of the project's
three major objectives was achieved. The IBRD's analysis in this PCR (page 3,
Part I, F.10) is valid and irrefutable.
25.         However, reference was made in the previous item to a low relative
level of project execution.  This statement is confirmed by the statistical
indicators in Section III: of the first 12 indicators listed, at least three
show execution percentages compatible with (or higher than) those of the
execution timetable; two show performance lags of a year, while others show two
lags of two years.
26.         Bearing in mind that effective project "take-off" did not take place
until 1989, their performance is even more significant since it indicates that,
even with all the problems indicated, the agencies and the Mtb accomplished a
great deal and did so with a relatively high degree of efficiency.   It is
reasonable to assume that with conducive operating conditions and adequate
maturation time, the project would in large part have achieved its objectives.
E.    Bank Performance
27.         The Bank's performance, like that of the project, left much to be
desired, particularly considering its long operating experience in Brazil.
Mention has already been made in Part I of a number of shortcomings (Evaluation
Summary, para. 7, and various sections in Part I); none of the factors mentioned
is recent, they existed throughout the project.
28.         Other shortcomings (not all attributable to the Bank) have also been
dealt with here in Part II (Project Design). However, a number of questions
concerning IBRD's behavior in the understanding of the contractual aspects
deserve to be examined for their impact on project execution.
29.         These inconsistencies and contradictions in the Bank's behavior
ultimately undermined and restricted the ability of the executing agency (the
extinct Mtb) to influence and pressure other government agencies I involved in the



- 12 -
execution of the project. This behavior suggests that] contract compliance may
be at least partially optional, and that in the extreme noncompliance with
contractual clauses can be overcome or resolved through a good understanding with
Bank officials.
F.    Borrower Performance
30.         As seen in Part I and various sections of Part II, Borrower
performance, as is normally the case at the start of any project, was generally
weak and in many cases inconsistent. Even when the executing agencies sought to
overcome the difficulties encountered, as a whole they were defeated by the
special circumstances within which they worked.
31.         It must be stressed that significant results were obtained in the
single normal year of operation, which points to the existence of managerial,
financial and political capacity. It would be unreasonable to expect or require
normal results in a project that suffered from design constraints and was
implemented under unstable or even inimical risk conditions.
32.         The Borrower's inconsistency is reflected in its instituting a
technical upgrading policy setting forth objectives identical to, and requiring
investments similar to, those provided for in the project, and at the same time
partially canceling the Loan Agreement.  While criticizing the poor project
performance, it was not sufficiently competent to bring about the minimum
conditions required to improve that performance.
33.         The lessons learned are many and fruitful.  A number of these have
been mentioned in Part I and throughout this section. They concern the entire
project cycle from design to the cancellation process itself, wUhch was
unprecedented in the confusing manner in which it was conducted by all parties.

Annex 2
Part II as submitted by the GOB
Project review from borrower's Perspective
Introduqao
01.  Por decis&o do Governo, o Projeto ora em exame foi cancelado
em outubro do 1990. As razoes do cancelamento foram de politica
economica, como parte do esforqo em reduzir o gasto pTblico, cortar
subsidios etc.   0 representante do Mutuario,  o Minist6rio de
Economia, baseou tamb6n sua decislo nas diticuldades operacionais
e no alto custo de seus-encargo6.
02. Neste sentido a anilise nao pode oer realizada como se a
projeto tivesse chelado normalyRqntC a Rijn rAtA tie t6rmino. 0
^.a.a4mwcLamenro precoce -antes mesmo da "mid term evaluation" prevista
para junho de 1991- (Seq&o 3.05 4o Acordo de Emprestimo) fez
inviAvel a alcance de objetivos e dos impactos esperado6 a medio a
longo prazo.
03.  Visando e.itar repeti;des,  a revis&o apresentada a sequir
limita-se aos aspectos nao tratados na Parte I ou aspectos que
mesmo tendo sido tratados merecom alguma qualificaq&o e os que
apresentam diverg6ncias nos pontos de vista.
Projei-.L Dun1jn and vrganizarton
04.  Projeto foi ben concebido em seus aspectos conc  ;iag e
&yid3=&,_a gu4d percep'ao aos proo1emas e necessidades brasileiras
na  Area  de Formaqo  Prof issional  e  foi  desenhado  como ura
continuacao l6qica do Acordo de Empr6stimo kr. 1452-BR implantado
ontre 1977 a 1985.  As avaliages levadas a cabo a respeito do
Acordo 1452 indicaram que a Projeto foi ur sucessos do ponto de
vista de seus objetivoa ficicos a financeiros, mae deixou a desejar
em seus aspectos e alcance de objetivos de desenvolvimento
institucional (cfr: PCR, Banco Mundial, Janeiro de 1990).
05.  Por  esta  raz&o  a  novo  Projeto,  a  par  do  importantes
investimentos voltados, notadamente, parax as Areas de tecnologias
de ponta e de desenvolvimento setorial, tol concebido com una
grande dnfase na quostla institucional, objetivando mudanqas e
ajustes para aprimorar a capacidade de gerenciamento do Sistema do
Formagao Profissional e das ag&ncias executoras.
06. Apesar dos fortes sinais de transformaSaes sociais (transi.50
democritica,   prepara&Ao  de   nova   constituigAo,   alterag6es
econ8micas, politicas e institucionais), a hipotese subjacente, 6
de quo o Projeto gs desenvolveria em um quadro de "business as
usual".   A dnica referencia a um quadro alternativo podo ser
percebida quando, no contrato (cfr 3eqao 5.01 (a)), se menciona quo
o projeto seria suspenso polo Banco caso FUNDACENTRO, SENAI a SENAC
doixassem de existir em sua forma convencional; esta redaqA0
ref letia preocupaq5es com as discussOeS na assembleia constituinte,
que,  em  determinado  momento  sinalizaram  sobre  uma  poss1vel
estatiza;lo das agqncias SENAI e SENAC. Ou seja o 6nico quadro



- 24 -
alternativo induziria'a uma suspens&o dos desembolsos do Projeto.
07 Considerando estes elementos, o desenho institucional do
Projeto (basvado na anrlise de viabilidade institucional do mesmo)
nao considerqA Sg caractArfst1iAS a particularidace speLacio1.aiw
dos Sistemas SENAI-SENAC. 0 exemplo mais acabado desta deficioncia
reside no fato de que para a eficiente implementa;&o do projeto
soria  suficiente que o  nutuArio celebrasse  convenios com as
Diretorias Nacionais das ag6ncias SENAI e SENAC e que estas teriam
capacidade de fazer com que as diretorias regionais cumprissom com
os planos estabelocidos.
08. Ora, como as regionais sao legalmente ag6ncias autOnomas, os
compromissos assumidos pela DN nao comprometiam automaticamente as
regionais. Esta autonomia levou a qua o SENAC DR-SP (que no
projeto tinha responsabilidades importantes nas constru;6es de CFP)
decidisse retirar-se do projeto por nAo concordar com as regras e
procedimentos de licitavAo ( md1tiplos e demorados processos do
aprova;1o), alegando que a percentagem de reembolso (19%) era
inferior A taxa mensal de inflagAo ;  o SENAC-DN honrando seus
compromissos, resolveu substituir os CFPs de Sao Paulo por outros
nos estados do norte e nordeste a serem financiados com seus
recursos pr6prios.
09.  Esta decisAo teve um custo: o atraso geral nos cronogramas de
execu,cfo das obras.    Situag6es renos dr&sticas  foram tamb6m
observadas em relaq&o ao SENAI: regionais, ainda quando autorizados
pelo Nacional, atrasavam suas aplicagdes.Ae investimento previstas
polo projeto. Note-se que nestas circunstancias, nem as Unidades
de Gerenciamento do Projeto, (do MTb e das Ag&ncias) nem as
pr6prias Dire98es Nacionais tinham efetivamente capacidade (poder)
de reverter a situa9Ao.
10.   Outro elemento critico no desenho do Projeto se referia ao
fato de que aproximadamente 30% do valor do emprestimo equivaliam
a rubrica do "n5o alocado" (conting6neias fisicas a pregos) ou de
desembolso condicionado a existencia de uma entidade (SENAR) quo
deveria ser   criada pelo poder  legislativo.    Esta situa98o
encareceu os custos dos encargos do projeto e, do ponto de vista da
teori.a de avalia9&o de projeto, estaria indicando um investimento
super dimensionado ou de alto risco.
11. 0 caso do SENAR 6 tamb6m ilustrativo da hip6tese "business as
usv'al", e da pobreza da avaliaqao institucional.  Toda a detini9So
de custos a de demanda de investimentos foi feita baseada em dados
de uma entidade em extingdo (SENAR-MTb) que deveria ser substituida
por outra a ser criada e gerenciada polo setor privado.
Aparentemente  se  pensava  quo  a  nova  entidade  assumiria
integralmente os direitos e obriga98es da anterior sem alterar
significativamente  a  base  institucional  e  as  op;8es  do
investimento. Esta hip6tese era no minimo temer&ria, J& quo a
mudanfa implicava transferir o gerenciamento do SENAR para o setor
privado qua obviamente utiliza outros padr6es de gerenciamento.

12.  Estas deficienc1as de desenho, alfm das mencionadas na Parte
I deste relat6rio contribuiram para- dificultar a implementagao,
gerar atrasos e proporcionar apoio a tese de cancelamento do mesmo.
Project implementation
13.  0 projeto inicia sua implementarao em um periodo bastante
critico da vida do pals. A crise fiscal que ja so anunciava em
razAo do decr6scimo da atividade econ6mica assume maiores
proporg6es  a  partir  da  reforma  tributhria  instituida  pela
Constitui;Ao de 1988; as tradicionais altas taxas de inflag&o
caminhando  para  os  3  digitos  mensais,    agentes  econ6micos
direcionando seus excedentes e poupanga para o mercado financeiro,
choques heterodoxos, planos econdmicos etc.
14. Por outro lado a promulgagAo da Constitui9Ao de 1988 reduz
significativamente as margens de aqao do poder executivo, dando ao
Congresso Nacional capacidades de controle e ingerencia no
executivo a partir da definiq;Ao orqamentlria e das restrig8es
impostas ao executivo.
15.  0  periodo  foi  tamb6m  caracterizado  por  uma  grande
instabilidade administrativa: entre 1987 (data da efetividade) e
1990 (data do cancelamento), o Ministerio do Trabalho teve 4
dirigentes, tres propostas de reestrutura9&o administrativa e duas
reorganizaaes  internas  efetivas.   PM4m dos aspectos  formais
(estruturais), o entendimento do mandato e funq8es do Minist6rio do
Trabalho sofreu tamb6m pelo menos tres alteraees.         1
16.   Tampouco pode  ser  esquecido  quo o Projeto  iniciou  sua
prepara&o em fins de 1985, sua efetividade formal se deu em fins
de 1987 e o ritmo de execuqAo so se tornou normal em fins de 1988,
ou seja 4 anos depois de sua concepOAo. Mesmo se houvesse absoluta
continuidade administrativa, seria normal admitir que, face ao
tempo decorrido entre o desenho do projeto e sua efetividade,
prioridades das agancias pudessam ser  lteradas,  novas id4ias,
novas tecnologias, novos compromissos a sumidos etc.
17.  No Ambito destas mudan9as, a Area de FormaqAo Profissional do
extinto MTb apresentou ainda uma particularidade: pela prizeira ves
em anos recentes, a direqA&o da mesma foi assumida por pessoas sea
un background de vinculaqAo com as agOncias;  tradicionalmente (ex:
Acordo de Emprksttmo 1452-BR) a rela&Ao da EMO con as ag6ncias era
muitto fluida, entre outras circunst&ncias, porque cs quadros de
diregAo e grande parte dos quadros t6cnicos da SMO estava composto
por funcionArios das ag4ncias cedidos ao MTb.
18.  Por outro lado,  as novas disposi,9es constitucionais,  ao
conterir ao Congresso poderes de elaborar, controlar e definir
orgamento, geraram tambdm situages in6ditas. 0 nivel de
detalhamento das contas foi extendido e restringido ao executivo
* 1_ .....       . -_ .  _. _.

legislativo),  interpretaqes  dispares  de  uma  norma,  ou  de
o1assifEiaq&o c4LGIal f ucm suficiente para bloquear a execuqlo do
Projeto durante longos perfodos.
19.  De  fato.  at&  1Q41,    runca  houvc  restrigao  de  fundo5
(financeiros) de contrapartida: o SENAI o SENAC sempre tiveram
dispon1tvpi ns recurcoc para Custear seus gauLou s, exceco em 1987,
mesmo a SMO e a FUNDACENTRO, com algum atraso no come;o de cada
ano, tiveram disponibilidade de contrapartida; recursos do BIRD
sempre estiveram presentes na conta CESA a FESA.
20. Ou seja, recursos financeiros estiveram disponiveis todo o
tempo. 0 que nAo existia (por estar atrasado, incorreto)   era
or9amento;   e  como,   segundo  a  norma,         mesmo  existindo
disponibilidade financeira nao se pode -sem orgamento- efetivar
gastos (rembolsos As agencias), as ag&ncias reduziam seu ritmo de
atividade pois sabiam que nAo seriam reembolsadas enquanto o
governo n&o liberasse a execu;do do or9amento.
21. A estes fato deve-se acrescentar que o management das agtncias
repetia a pratica comum As empresas em momentos de elevada
lnflaqAo: aguardando a liberago orgamentAria, redirecionavam o6
seus  investimentos  em  outros  projetos  pr6prios  a    tamb6m
importantes, na liquida;Ao de compromissos j& assumidos, ben como,
resguardando os SOUs recursos da erosao inflacionAria, realizavam
aplicag6es significativas no mercado financeiro. - Note-se quo a
SAR (Anexo III) estuda do forma estAtica o fenOmeno das aplicag8es
financeiras,   nao   indicando  possiveis   efeitos  operacionais
restritivos no cash-flow das ag6ncias em relatao aos investimentos
previstos pelo Projeto. Tampouco realiza uma anilise financeira
dos Indices de liquidez corrente r de m4dio prazo das agdncias.
Estas omiss8es analiticas sAo consistentes com os comentArios
anteriores realizados na seqao relativa ao desenho do Projeto.
22.  A combinaAoo destaRs  lpmpnton, associadoc &a dofioi6naias de
desenho, redundou nos baixos niveis relativos de execug&o para o
Projeto.
23.  A afirmaqAo do Banco de que o SENAC nunca esteve realmuent
comprometido cost os elementos essenciais do Projeto ( pag.3, Parte
I, D.7, deste relat6rio) merece ser qualificada, pois a desempenho
fisico e financeiro da agencia demonstra o contrArio.   A posig!o
do SENAC em relaq&o a questao de avaliar a eticiAncia econ6mica da
Forma95o Profissional, ao contr&rio do que consta na Parte I, foi
a de que a agencia n5o aceitava a proposta metodol6gica sugerida
por uma Consultor do Banco; esta posi9ao foi ref erendada
unanimemente pelo Comit6 de Pesquisas. Ao defender esta posiglo,
dirigentes  do  SENAC  foram  intransigentes,  chegando  a propor
inclusive o cancelamento do Componente de Estudos e Pesquisas.
Posteriormente, em base a uma nova proposta elaborada por Dra.
Mehedef e Beloni (e aprovada parcialmente pelo BIRD), a agencia,
depois de alguma hesita'!o, aceitou engajar-se no processo.



- 27 -
24.  Esta hesitagao refletia o temor de que o Sistema de FormaQao
Profis'sional pudesse ser analisado e julgado por critfrtos
puramente financeiros a economlcistas, sem a devida ateng8o aos
mandatos e fungoes socials e educacionais 42 AgAfnni,A,   Uutn
nrnnnnno id  IviL   uAt&c, LVI ujlj. e atrasou o progresso desta
atividade realmento vital ao Projeto.
25. Ngo obstant., dove-se recordar quo a responsabilidade
contratual de realizar tal avaliagAo cabia ao Minist6rio (cfr.
Acordo, Anexo 2, Parte A (b)(iii)) e n8o U ag8ncias; neste sentido
as responsabilidades sabre as falhas ocorridas   neste "issue'
residem primariamente no Minist6rio mas devem ser compartidas
tamb6m polo pr6prlo Banco, qua tampouco soub- ou pOde qualificar
claramente suas expectativas, limitando-so a cobrar uma avalia9go
"custo-efetividade" sem clarificar crit6rios de custo ou conceitos
de efetividade aplic&veis ao caso.
Project results
26. Tomando como referencia o8 tree objetivos maiores do Projeto,
torna-se  evidento  que,  devido  ao cancelamento,    nenhum  fol
plenamente alcan9ado. A anAlise do BIRD neste PCR (Parte I, F. 10,
pag 3) 4 procedente e irretoc6vel.
27. No entanto, no   item anterior mencionou-se um baixo nivel
r.fativa   de  execu9&o  do projeto.    Esta  afirmaq8o  pod.  ser
confirmada observando-se os indicadores estatlsticos da Seg8o III:
dos 12 primeiros indicadores listados, pelo menos 3 apresentas
porcentagens de exeauq&o compativeis (ou superiores) com as do
cronograma de implementa98o; dois apresentaa desempenho atrasado em
um ano a outros 2 com atraso do 2 anos.
28. Se considerarmos que o "take off" efetivo do Projeto dou-se
somente em 1989, o desempenho 6 ainda mais significativo,
indicando quo mesmo com os todos Os problemas apontados houve us
grande esforgo de implementag&o por parts das ag6ncias e do pr6prio
NTb e com grau de eficiencia relativamente olevado.   t razo&vel
supor-se que, com um minimo de condi;8es operacionais a o tempo de
maturagio, o projeto alcancaria grande parte dos objetivos
propostos.
Bank Performance
29. 0 desempenho do Banco, tanto quanto o do Projeto, deixou muito
a desojar, principalmente considerando-se a longa experi&ncia do
mesmo em operaq8es no Brasil. Ao longo da Part- r deste rolat6rio
ja foram mencionadas vhrias defici6ncias (Evaluation Summary.7,
E.9, H.12 e 13): nenhum dos olementos mencionados & recente;. ago,
de fato, constantes na existAncia dos projetos.



- 28 -
30.  Otras deficienctas  (nao todas  imputAveis ao Banco)  foram
tamb6m apontadas nesta Parte II (Desenho do Projeto).
31.  Entretanto algumas questaes relativas ao comportamento do BIRD
no entendimento dos aspectos contratuais merecem ser examinadas por
seu impacto na execuqao do projeto.
32. 0 acordo estipula que as aquisiq5es de bens devem dar-se de
acordo com o "Guidelines" do Banco; no entanto o convenio entre o
MTb e as ag6ncias (pre-condigdo para a efetividade; Seoao 6.01 (c))
estabelece que as aquisiq8es se darao segundo estabelecido na let
brasileira (DL 2.300); a aceita,cAo pelo arRD desta condiq&o nega na
prttica o estipulado no contrato, introduz uma dupla norma para o
mesmo obJeto e cria confus5es no ambito da execu;Ao.   Outro
exemplo, o Guidelines e o PTN 6 (Procurement Technical Notes Nr. 6
-  PD-BIRD)  consideram  inaceit6veis    procedimentos  de  p6s-
qualifica9&o ou a utilizaQAo do sistema de dois envelopes; ambos
procedimentos foram aceitos e utilizadosr inclusive em concorr#ncias
internacionais.
33.  As Condiqes Gerais estipulam tamb6m que c8 compromisso6 e
obr4qaqOes do acordo ado validos e devem ser implementados
independente da exist&ncia de lei qu eastipule o contrario. Ora,
um dos compromissos vitais do mutuArio (e do executor) era o de
fazer o repasse de recursos as agAncias executoraS; se, por raz8es
quaisquer, o executor se declara incapaz de faz6-lo por existir lei
recente que o proibe (ou norma que, em termos praticos inviabiliza
o repasse), seria razoavel esperar que o Banco exigisse o
cumprimento do contrato em sua plenitude, requeresse medidas
corretivas (Se&o 5.01 (b)) e caso isto nAo fosse obtido, restariam
os "Remedios" previsto5 na Se9do 6 das CondiLqes Gerais.    Nada
disto ooorrcu,  as pcm4s5sA&, u empenho dos executores em buscar
solu.oes ou simplesmente oferecer explica9pes conjunturais foi
aceito pelo BIRD como   suficiente,  ainda quando as causas e
condigOes estruturais permanecessem inalteradas.
34.  Estas inconsistAncias e contradir8es no comportamento do Banco
terminam por enfraquecer e restrinrgir a capacidade do agents
executor  (o  extinto  MTb)  em    pressionar  os  demais  niveis
institucionais envolvidos nos processos operacionais (ag6ncias au
o pr6prio governo).    Permite que se interrogue quals partes do
contrato slo para serem cumpridas, e no limite,  permite tamb6m que
se deduza que, o nAo cumprimento de clausulas contratuais pode ser
superado oam um bom entendimento com oficiais do Banco.
Desempenho do Mutuhrio
35. 0 desempenho do mutuArio, conforme foi visto na Parte I e
v6rios itens desta Parte Il, e como normalmente ocorre no inicia
de qualquer Projeto, fot de modo geral, pobre e em muitos casos,
inconsistente.    Ainda quando os executores buscaram superar as
dificuldades encontradas, no seu conjunto, foram vencidos pelas
circunstancias especiais nas quais se involucravam.



- 29 -
36.  Dave-se salientar que em um (nico ano de operaqAo minimamente
norma 1 resultados significativos -foram alcanqados, indicando
existencia de capacidade gerencial, financeira e politica.   N&o
seria razoavel esperar ou exigir resultados normais em un projeto
com restri6es em seu desenho   a implementado em condi;8es de
risco, instaveis ou at4 hostis.
37. A inconsist4ncia do mutu&rio decorre do fato de qua, no mesmo
momento em que instalava uma poliltica de capacita9ao tecnol6gica,
explicitando objetivos iddnticos aos estabelecidos no Projeta s
exigindo investimentos semelhantes aos previstos no Projeto,
decidia pelo cancelamento parcial do AcOrdo de Empr6stimo.   Ao
mesmo tempo que criticava o baixo desempenho do Projeto, n8o foi
suficientemento   competente   para   viabilizar   as   condic6as
operacionais minimas quo permitiriam melhorar tal desempenho.
38. As liq8es aprendidas sAo muitas e ricas. Na Parte I e ao longo
desta secAo vdrias foram mencionadas; referem-se a todo O ciclo do
Projeto, desde o desenho at6 o pr6prio processo de  cancelamento
que foi inBdito e conduzido de forma confusa por todas as partes.
