MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SKILLS FORMATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Brazil for
US$74.5 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
repayable over 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and charges.
2.       Background.  Technical/vocational education and training in Brazil
evolved in a pragmatic way daring the first three quarters of this century.
Responsibilities for technician training at the secondary and post-
secondary levels were assumed by publicly-supported technical schools
administered by the Ministry of Education, while the formation of specific
job skills accrued to semi-autonomous training agencies linked to the
Ministry of Labor and financed through a payroll tax. In the mid-1970s,
the Government initiated several measures designed to strengthen skills
training effectiveness, inter alia: (i) all the major non-formal training
agencies were brought under the aegis of a newly-created National
Vocational Training System (NVTS); (ii) the Federal Manpower Council (CFMO)
and its technical arm, the Manpower Secretariat (SMO), were created within
the Ministry of Labor to oversee the System; and, (iii) a Fiscal Incentives
Law was promulgated to allow enterprises greater freedom in meeting
directly their own training needs. After a decade of operations under the
reorganized system, institutional shortcomings and concerns for the
efficiency of the training system still remain: the CFMO and SMO do not
coordinate effectively either policies or their technical support
functions; representation from the private sector is still insufficient;
and shortages of adequately trained staff and cumbersome procedures reduce
the effectiveness of the two bodies. Institutional constraints also exist
in the main training agencies. For example they need to improve
communications with labor and private sector interests; extend planning
beyond the yearly budgetary exercise; and decentralize some administrative
functions (SENAC). There is a particular need to strengthen SENAR, which
lacks the semi-autonomous status of the other training agencies, needed to
operate flexibly and effectively in the complex Brazilian agricultural
sector.
3.       Project Objectives.  Project objectives are consistent with
Government policies and strategies to strengthen the institutional
framework, response capacity and training functions of the NVTS, and to
promote cost-effectiveness in the provision of trainirg. Institutional
capacities of the federal agencies would be improved through measures to:
(i) enhance the role, functions and impact of the CFMO in policy
formulation and coordination, and (ii) strengthen the technical support
function of the SMO. Policy and program implementation by the training
agencies would be enhanced through the introduction of revised planning,
programming and monitoring practices. To support these objectives, policy
formation processes (including broadened private sector participation),



-2-
strategic planning capabilities, management information systems and
organizational structures would be reinforced. Under the project,
guidelines would be established on the division of training
responsibilities among public sector agencies and between the public and
private sectors. These guidelines would be designed to avoid wasteful
duplication of effort and to encourage greater provlsion of training by the
private sector and increased cost recovery.
4.       Project Description.  The project would pursue the above
objectives through the provision of funding for: (i) training and
fellowships (about 23% of the base cost) for about 15,000 NVTS managers,
technicians and administrators; (ii) studies and research (about 7Z) to
evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of training programs, assess
alternative financing and delivery mechanisms and guide curricula design in
new trades; (iii) instructional materials (about 14%) in the form of 650
new training modules; (iv) related technical assistance (about 13%) in the
form of 2,500 staff months local and 285 staff months expatriate
consultants; (v) equipment and furniture (about 29Z) and (vi) civil works
(about 142), which together would build or remodel, furnish and equip 79
centers and 26 mobile units. When the facilities are fully operational in
1995, they would provide improvements to the quality of training directly
benefitting about 253,000 trainees annually, and capacity for additional
enrollments of 230,000 annually. Policy development and the reinforcement
of key structures (including the conversion of SENAR into a more autonomous
financial and administrative structure, with adequate private sector
representation) and management processes (such as the adoption of action
plans and rolling programs and the application of study recommendations)
would be supported through staff training, studies and technical
assistance. The project would be carried out over 8 years. A mid-term
review (1991) would be carried out to monitor progress in all major areas.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$166.4 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$40.7 million (27%). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, the disbursement schedule and the allocation of Loan proceeds
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map (IBRD-1568R) is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6564-BR dated April 3, 1987 is being distributed separaterly.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The loan would be the fifth to
ameliorate manpower deficiencies and to support efforts to strengthen
technical/vocational education and training systems In Brazil. Three
projects assisted secondary and post-secondary institutions (Loans 755-BR,
1067-BR and 2366-BR), while the Vocational Training Project (Loan 1452-BR)
assisted non-formal vocational training agencies presently under the NVTS.
Under the previous projects, facilities were established, remodeled and
equipped, training programs were improved and expanded, and the quality of
instruction was upgraded. The Vocational Training Project, in particular,
significantly strengthened the capacities of the major training agencies,
but further support is needed at both the federal and agency level in
training policy formulation and management. The project would build on the
experience gained under the previous projects, and would support
collaboration among the training agencies and foster the use of economic
criteria in the selection of training methodologies and activities.

6.       Agreed Actions.  The Special Informatics Secretariat has
authorized procurement of equipment through ICB containing electronic data
processing parts included in the SENAI components. The Government provided
assurances that it would: (i) establish and staff, by May 31, 1987, the
Project Management Unit (within the SMO) and Project Management Teams
(within the training agencies); (ii) establish with the loan funds a
cruzado expenditures special account in the Central Bank to cover local
expenditures and a foreign exchange expenditures account in US dollars in a
commercial bank abroad acceptable to the Bank to cover minor foreign
exchange expenditures; (iii) establish acceptable mechanisms for quick
reimbursement of SENAC and SENAI from the local currency special account
and prompt payment of foreign exchange expenditures to be financed through
the foreign exchange expenditure special account; (iv) establish, by
September 30, 1987, an interagency Research Committee (chaired by the
Secretary, SMO), develop guidelines and criteria acceptable to the Bank for
approving studies and research, and carry out a series of studies on
alternatives for financing vocational training and increasing cost recovery
and private sector participation; (v) establish guidelines delineating
training responsibilities by June 30, 1987; broaden private sector
representation on the CFMO by August 31, 1987; establish the revised SMO
structure by September 30, 1987 and appoint ten additional staff by
October 31, 1987; and prepare revised policies and implementation
strategies for the training agencies by June 30, 1989 and rolling plans by
June 30, 1990; (vi) implement annual reviews and a mid-project review to be
completed and submitted to the Bank by June 30, 1991 which would focus,
inter alia, on progress towards introducing the guidelines on the division
of training responsibilities; (vii) develop an accounting and auditing
system satisfactory to the Bank; and (viii) provide adequate counterpart
funds in each annual budget for project implementation and maintain the new
staff of the SMO on a permanent basis. Approval of SENAR legislation
changing SENAR legal status to a foundation in order to give it more
autonomy would be a condition of disbursement for the respective component.
If the legislation has not been approved as envisaged by July 31, 1987,
steps would be initiated to cancel this component.
7.       Justification.  Rapid and sustained gains in labor productivity
are essential to Brazil's continued economic growth, particularly in light
of the need to increase debt-servicing capacity and to overcome setbacks in
human resources development associated with the financial crisis of the
early 1980s. Project benefits would accrue to a wide range of participants
in the labor force, from industrial technicians trained in advanced
technologies to commercial and agricultural skilled workers. Estimates of
the poverty impact of the project suggest that between 35 and 55 percent of
total project costs would benefit poor individuals. The project would
strengthen occupational safety in the workplace. It would not only build
on earlier efforts to improve the quality and relevance of training
programs, but a2so reinforce the institutional structures and processes of
the NVTS, and thus lay the foundation for continued adjustment to changing
training needs.
8.       Risks.  There are some risks associated with achievement of
institutional development objectives. The greatest risks are associated
with the objectives for improving the technical support capacity of the SMO
and for strengthening SENAR. Additional specialist staff for the SMO, a



- 4 -
sizeable provision for training and consultant assistance for technical ard
managerial staff at the two agencies, and the new SENAR structure should
substantially reduce these risks. If, on the other hand, the SENAR legal
structure is not changed, the small size and the limited and independent
objectives of this component ensure that the broad objectives of the
project would be unaffected. A related risk is that implementation will
suffer as a result of weaknesses in the SMO's capacity to coordinate
project management. To minimize this risk, direct responsibility for
project management has been given to the individual training agencies
whenever possible. Additional (full-time) staff would be assigned to the
SMO Project Management Unit. Further, a mid-project review has been
scheduled to coincide with completion of most of the institutional
development measures included under the project. This review will assess
progress made in all project activities, emphasizing accomplishments in
policy formulation and institutional development, and will culminate in
those adjustments needed to ensure rapid completion of project
implementation.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
