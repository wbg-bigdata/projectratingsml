MENORAMDUM AND RECOSMEND&TION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A FIRST URBAN PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to Uganda for SDR 20.7
million (US$28.7 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with forty years maturity
and help finance a First Urban Project. The Project would be cofinanced by
the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) for US$4.6 million equivalent and by the
Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) for US$0.6 million
equivalent.
2.       Background.    Uganda is well-endowed with human and natural
resources, but its economy has been devastated by nearly two decades of
political instability, economic mismanagement, and internal discord. The
establishment of a stable government by the National Resistance Movement in
1986 has been accompanied by the restoration of peace and security, the re-
establishment of political institutions that reflect the plural character
of Ugandan society and the creation of a measure of discipline in the
public service. Since 1987 the Government has adopted a multi-phased
economic adjustment program aimed at stabilizing its domestic and external
imbalances through greater financial and monetary discipline, and promoting
growth through greater dependence on market forces. Measures have been
taken to liberalize trade, to establish a more realistic exchange rate
policy, and to encourage strong private sector participation.
3.       This improved policy framework needs to be complemented by
improvements to social and infrastructure services in an effort to improve
living conditions for the population as a whole and alleviate urban poverty
in particular if the adjustment and reform program is to retain public
support.   Improved maintenance of streets and drains, upgrading of urban
markets, and the strengthening of solid waste management in Kampala (pop.
700,000) would direct benefits to the urban poor, especially those involved
in informal sector activities, including a large proportion of women and
children. In addition, in order to ensure the sustainability of physical
rehabilitation efforts, measures are needed to improve planning for the
urban sector and its management including the generation of revenue by the
local authorities concerned, selectiveiy increasing employee compensation
to improve staff retention rates, and the provision of staff training.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement:  IDA's country assistance strategy
for Uganda supports the Government's economic recovery by helping to
restore productive capacity while steering the economy towards sustainable
long-term growth. The three main elements of this strategy are: i) the
restoration of macro-economic stability; ii) the rehabilitation of physical
infrastructure ; and iii) institutional capacity building and human
resources development to address longer-term development objectives.
5.       The restoration of macro-economic stability, expedited by the IDA-
financed Economic Recovery Program (ERP), will be to the benefit of the
majority of Ugandans in the medium term. However, the short-run impact of
the ERP means that the needs of some of the worst victims of the period of



civil unrest and economic decline will not be met. These groups include
the urban poor living in dangerously unhealthy slum areas of Kampala. The
proposed Project, therefore, has as one of its objectives, the alleviation
of poverty in Kampala and would complement the recently approved Project
for the Alleviation of Poverty and the Social Costs of Adjustment (PAPSCA).
6.       Existing IDA credits are assisting in the rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure, viz., Highways III and IV, Railways I, Water
Supply I and II, and Telecommunications TI. Operations under consideration
include Power III, additional transport sector rehabilitation and a water
supply project for small towns. The proposed Project would be the third in
a series dealing with the rehabilitation of local authority infrastructure
but with emphasis on services other than water supply. The Project
includes components with significant impact on improving living conditions.
7.       The Project would support Uganda's aim to invest in- human capital
development by financing the institutional strengthening of government
bodies at both central and local levels. Such capacity building is
necessary if local authorities are to resume the provision of social and
infrastructure services with minimal dependence on central government
resources, both financial and human.
8.       The Project would also act as a catalyst in attracting other donor
support for the urban sector as demonstrated by the participation of The
Nordic Development Fund (NDF) and Gesellschaft fuer Technische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) as co-financiers of the proposed project.
9.       Proiect Obiectives:    The Project would include the following
objectives: i) improving living conditions and alleviating poverty in
Kampala by restoring key infrastructure services and related maintenance
activities; ii) improving urban financial management by strengthening the
revenue base of Kampala City Council (KCC) and promoting sound urban cost
recovery policies; and iii) strengthening institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Local Government (MLG) to assist local authorities to increase
their revenue base and strengthen financial management, and KCC to maintain
urban services and manage urban land development. The proposed Project
would support the Government's efforts to decentralize responsibility for
the planning, design and management of urban services to local authorities
while assisting with reconstruction of the country after a period of
political instability, social strife and physical destruction.
10.      Proiect Descriptions    The Project includes support for: (i) the
rehabilitation of urban markets, streets and drains, refuse collection and
disposal, and selected office and workshop accommodation in Kampala; (ii)
the servicing of land for residential development; iii) the preparation of
up-to-date topographical mapping and a strategic urban development plan for
Kampala; and iv) technical assistance and training for KCC, MLG and PPD
staff. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Uganda are



- 3-
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8921-UG dated December 3, 1990 are also attached.
11.      Agreed Actions:   Prior to negotiations Government had ti)
declared Kawaala as a planning area under the Town and Country Planning Act
(1964); (ii) confirmed the availability of land to be acquired for the
Project; and (iii) prepared a draft plan for involuntary resettlement and
compensation for bona fide occupants in Kawaala and the urban markets
identified for upgrading. By negotiations KCC had demonstrated its
commitment to strengthening the revenue base of the city by carrying out a
specific action plan covering improved property valuation and rating,
billing and collection including issuance of demand notes based on
provisional rating of 68,000 properties, and the collection of U Sh 130
million.
12.      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government with
respect to the following issues: ti) a timetable for settlement of arrears
in rates owed to KCC on all properties owned by public sector entities;
(ii) KCC's authority to increase in a timely manner user charges and fees
for municipal services to cover the real cost of providing the services;
(iii) improvement in KCC's revenue collection efficiency, measured as a
percent of total outstanding revenue receivable -- from 27 percent in
FY1990 to 87 percent in FY1994 and thereafter; (iv) limitations to KCC's
use of bank overdraft facilities; (v) adoption of an urban environmental
policy with special attention to solid waste management by April 30, 1992
and increase in refuse delivered to municipal landfill areas from 7,000 m3
to 16,00 m3 by December 1993; (vi) submission to IDA of annual road
maintenance programs by June 30 of 1991, 1992 and 1993 for review and
privatization of vehicle repair; and (vii) beneficiary selection criteria
for allocating housing plots in Kawaala. The following condition of
disbursement will apply to the two project components requiring acquisition
of land (development at Kawaala and urban markets) -- that GOU submit
evidence of both KCC's leasehold title to land required for carrying out
the two project components and a resettlement and compensation program
satisfactory to IDA.
13.      Conditions of Effectiveness:  During negotiations agreement was
reached regarding the following conditions of effectiveness; (i) the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and KCC will have been
entered into; (ii) conditions of effectiveness of co-financed grants and
loans will have been fulfilled; and (iii) the municipal engineer for PCU
and the municipal financial management specialist for KCC will be in post.
14.      Benefits:  The Project would have significant positive social,
institutional and environmental benefits, as one in a series of operations
to alleviate poverty and the social costs of adjustment.   The upgrading of
major markets will improve environmental and health conditions affecting
the handling of most of the food consumed in Kampala as well as re-
establish the city's authority over this important revenue source. The
urban poor would benefit in the form of healthier food and less illness-
related work interruption. The consistent maintenance of roads, drains and



- 4-.
footpaths will ease motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic, in
particular along major public transport routes and access roads to
previously neglected lower income, high density areas of the city.
Improved solid waste collection and disposal will ameliorate environmental
conditions in the city. The development of a pilot sites and services
area, a new approach to housing delivery in Uganda, will help reduce the
housing shortage for middle income groups who would be provided with the
opportunity to build moderately priced houses and, in the process, create
opportunities for low-income rental accommodation within the scheme. The
development will also increase KCC's experience in managing land
development projects and establish a replicable model for future
development of residential areas in Kampala and other towns. Market
improvement, road maintenance and the servicing of residential land will
also create employment, particularly for the informal sector.
15.      Improvements in financial and administrative management combined
with the mobilization of higher revenues would enable KCC to provide a
higher level of services without causing a financial burden on the central
government. By FY1993, KCC's revamped property tax system should generate
an increase of more than ten times in real terms the amount of rates
actually collected in 1989. Administration and management of KCC finances
would have improved owing to staff upgrading by means of a twinning
arrangement with an overseas local authority and a Ugandan-based training
resource center for local government to be established under the Project.
This combined approach would also be used to strengthen the financial
management of other towns and the monitoring and support capabilities of
the Ministry of Local Government, thus setting the stage for possible
future improvements in other urban areas.
16.      Risks:   The main risks affecting the Project concern the
effectiveness of the two key implementing agencies, KCC and MLG, given that
they are emerging from a long period of institutional deterioration. KCC
is facing a shortage of qualified staff and political constraints to rapid
increases in municipal taxes, rates and charges. The Ministry suffers from
low salary levels and overall central government budgetary constraints.
However, KCC has already made dramatic progress in the past year in
recruiting qualified staff and increasing revenue. The proposed components
of technical assistance and training in this project, together with macro-
economic measures designed to continue overall economic recovery supported
by IDA restructuring operations, are expected to mitigate these risks.
17.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
