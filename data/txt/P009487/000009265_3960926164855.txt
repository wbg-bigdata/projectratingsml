MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SECOND FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 18.2 million
(US$25.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. It
would help to finance the priority requirements for emergency reconstruc-
tion of flood control, drainage and irrigation facilities; roads, bridges
and associated structures; water transport facilities; and primary schools
damaged or destroyed in the flood disaster of July-September 1987.
2.      Background.  Most of Bangladesh is a low-lying alluvial plain
subject to floeding from both heavy monsoon rainfall and snow-melt surges
of two of the world's largest rivers, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges.
High ocean tides and ryclones also caule serious flooding in southern
coastal areas.  About half of the country is vulnerable to annual flooding
to a depth of at least 30 cm, and one-sixth to depths of 1-4 m.  The
substantial damage that these floods cause in normal years is tolerable
because the farming systems are adapted to and benefit from the floods
through recharge of aquifers and improvements in soil fertility through
silt deposition. However, major floods at irregular intervals (five since
1964) have overwhelmed the country's growing flood control system and
caused tre-nendous losses. The 1987 floods appear to have been the worst
in over 25 years. Coming in three surges over a three-month period, they
caused agricultural losses of over $400 million, including about US$330
million in the monsoon rice crop, equal to nearly 10Z of annual rice
production. Other crops including jute, the country's major foreign
exchange earner, suffered too, as did the livestock and fishery subsec-
tors. Damage to rural infrastructure--flood control, drainage and irriga-
tion, roads, railways and water transport, schools, health centers and
power facilities--is estimated at US$235 million.
3.      Government, supported by international donors, responded quickly
and effectively by providing relief including food and medicines, and
prevented much of the post-flood famine and disease which has followed
some past major floods. Government's major flood-related efforts now
focus on reconstruction, for which it has requested IDA's assistance. IDA
has in response developed a three-element program: first, the proposed
second flood rehabilitation project to provide emergency assistance to
take advantage of the 1987/88 dry season and accelerate subsequent
efforts; second, specific reconstruction components included in the



-2-
recently-appraised Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irriga-
tion Project and the Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and Maintenance
Project primarily to cover work to be carried out in the subsequent two
years; and third, reallocation of the proceeds of credits of four ongoing
projects in the primary education, population and health, and power sec-
tors to provide for flood rehabilitation. Total IDA assistance planned
under these three elements is estimated at about US$108 million. In
addition, the Asian Development Bank plans reconstruction loans in water
control (US$14.3 million, in the southwestern region) and in roads and
railways (US$17.5 million for roads east of the Jamuna-Padma and US$15
million for railways nationwide), and is considering assistance in secon-
dary education and other social infrastructure. Bilateral donors are also
planning reconstruction assistance. The choice of sectors and items to
be financed by individual donors is the result of discussions between the
Government and the donors.
4.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  As a major provider of development
assistance to a very poor country, with heavy involvement in most of the
sectors that sustained heavy flood damage, it is approoriate that IDA
provide assistance for flood rehabilitation as it did following the 1970
cyclone (Coastal Area Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project,
Cr. 339-BD, US$25 million) and the 1984 floods (Flood Rehabilitation
Project, Cr. 1587-BD, US$30 million).
5.      Project Objectives.  The project would rehabilitate or replace
priority elements of flood-damaged infrastructure and equipment in five
subsectors: flood control, drainage and irrigation; main roads; local
roads; primary education; and inland water transport. These works would
in all cases be well underway and substantially completed by June 30,
1988. The project would also advance the start of civil works design for
the flood rehabilitation components of the planned Second Small Scale
Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project and the Rural Road& and
Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project.
6.      Project Description.  The project would comprise
(a) rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection works in
all but the southwestern region (US$9.3 million); (b) rehabilitation of
roads and associated structures in the northwestern and southwestern
regions (US$9.3 million); (c) reconstruction and refurnishing of primary
schools (US$6.9 million); (d) replacement of tugboat, navigational aids
and water-gauging equipment (US$3.0 million); (e) repair of river landing
jetties (US$0.6 million); and (f) provision of technical services by local
and foreign consultants (US$1.2 million). The project components would
be implemented by the relevant Government agencies as follows: flood
control, drainage and irrigation by the Bangladesh Water Development Board
(BWDB); main roads by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD); local roads
by the Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment, Rural Development and Cooperatives using its technical arm, the



-3-
Local Gcvernment Engineering Bureau (LGEB); primary education by the
Facilities Department under the direction of the Directorate of Primary
Education (DPE) of the Ministry of !ducation (MOE); and water transport by
the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA). Since each
agency will be responsible for implementing the work within its purview,
there would be no need for any special coordinating mechanism. Consult-
ants would be selected to assist in selection and design of works, selec-
tion of contractors and suppliers, and supervision of procurement and
construction for all except the small water transport component and the
schools component, for which procedures set up under the ongoing Second
Primary Education Project (Cr. 1574-BD) would be used. To ensure that road
works deal with major rehabilitation needs and can be adequately
monitored, no individual works to be financed under the RHD and LGD com-
ponents of the project would have a value of less than Tk 500,000
(US$16,000) and Tk 200,000 (US$6,400), respectively, and all works under
these components would be grouped into contracts of at least Tk 2,500,000
(US$80,noo) and Tk 1,000,000 (US$32,000) respectively. Because the small
scale and scattered nature of the civil works would not be attractive to
foreign bidders, civil works contracts would be let through the existing
arrangements of the five implementing agencies for local competitive
bidding (LCB) in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA; there
would be a small amount of force account work not exceeding SDR 2.5 mil-
lion in the aggregate. Bailey bridges and navigational and gauging equip-
ment would be procured through ICB. In view of the urgency of emergency
flood repairs Government has already embarked on certain civil works; it
is proposed that retroactive financing of up to US$4.1 million be per-
mitted for expenditures on rehabilitation of flood damaged infrastructure
incurred after October 1, 1987, which meet the agreed criteria
(paragraph 7). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursc..Ients, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. No staff appraisal report
was prepared because of the emergency nature of the project.
7.      Agreed Actions.  IDA's total flood rehabilitation program is
expected to last three years, of which activities in years two and three
would be implemented mainly under separate projects in the flood control,
drainage and irrigation and the roads sectors.  To ensure continuity in
the post-first year works during negotiations it was agreed that the
consultants to assist the implementing agencies for these sectors would be
appcinted to carry out subsequent design work for the follow-up projects.
The paramount damage in the roads subsector has been the destruction of
bridges, approaches and other drainage structures due to scour. During
negotiations it was therefore agreed with GOB that the consultants to be
employed by RHD and LGD would develop improved standards for design. The
rehabilitation works to be undertaken under this project would be selected



-4-
and carried out according to criteria agr4d between IDA and the Govern-
ment; these criteria specify, inter alia, that repairs would be the reault
of, or integrally related to. the 1987 flood damages, would restore struc-
tures to original specifications or such higher specifications an may be
warranted to ensure optimal performance over a reasonable life, and would
not be financed by other sources. The Government would also ensure that
adequate funds are allocated for subsequent operation and maintenance of
the project works.
8.      Benefits.  Without restoration, the efficiency of road and water-
way systems would be seriously impaired, flood protection and irrigation
and drainage schemes would be in jeopardy, and the primary education of at
least 170.000 children would suffer. There would be substantial and
continuing economic losses. Given these circumstances, the restoration of
flood damage, which the proposed project would assist, has one of the
highest priorities for expenditures in Bangladesh at this time.
9.      Risks.  Delay in executing the project might result from institu-
tional constraints. However, all the works to be utidertaken are simple
and are well within the capacity of the concerned agencies, and Government
has introduced streamlined procedures for project start-up. To ensure
that only emergency works arising from flood damage would be undertaken,
and that they would be carried out to appropriate design and construction
standards, consultants would be employed to assist key implementing agen-
cies.
10.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposod credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
BANGLADESH
SECOND FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
A. THE FLOOD PROBLEM AND GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
Physical Backg -und
1.      The geography and climate of Bangladesh make annual flooding practi-
cally inevitable. Most of 3angladesh is a low-lying alluvial plain
criss-crossed by 24,000 km of waterways (including three of the world's major
rivers, the Brahmaputra [Jamuna], Ganges and Meghna), draining a catchment
area of about 160 million hectares of which only about 7.5% lies in
Bangladesh. A fourth river system lies in the Southeastern Hill basin with a
catchment covering the limited hilly areas of Bangladesh and extending into
neighboring India. Rivers and streams in this basin are highly susceptible
to flash flooding.
2.      Flows in the Ganges and Brahmaputra riverR are derived from snowmrelt
in the Himalayas and rainfall in cheir lower catchment areas. Annual rain-
fall in Bangladesh ranges from 1.25 m in the southwest and west to more than
5 m in the northeast. About 80% of the rainfall occurs during the five-month
monsoon season, May through September. Periods of intensive rainfall result
in flash flooding of the smaller rivers and general flooding due to the
inability of natural drainage systems to cope with the excess water. Par-
ticularly destructive floods are most likely in July and August when flood
peaks from snc."me1t and rainfall coincide.  High ocean tides and cyclones are
also major causes of floods in southern coastal areas. About one-sixth of
the country is flooded every year to deptns of 1-4 m anu about one-half of
the country is vulnerable to arnual flooding in excess of 30 cm.
3.      Routine flooding during normal years yields benefits, including the
recharge of aquifers and improvement of soil fertility through silt deposi-
tion. Systems of farming that take advantage of and are dependent upon
annual flooding have evolved in routinely flooded areas. However, in years
of heavy flooding, major crop losses and substantial damage to rural and
agricultural infrastructure occur.
4.      Flood Protection.  Embankments and channel improvements are the only
practical methods of preventing flooding by the major rivers. Storage reser-
voirs upstream could be effective, but they would have to be very large and
the only suitable fites for them are outside Bangladesh. They can become



-12-
practical only after an agreement has been reached between the riparians of
these rivers. Experience has shown that protective embankments and
associated infrastructure is not cost-effective in areas susceptible to
strong river attack and deep flooding, and priority has therefore been given
instead to the protection of areas flooded to shallower depths. The Bank has
financed six such projects and a seventh is scheduled for Board consideration
in January 1988. Bangladesh's National Water Plan projects that a 20-year
program of flood control and drainage works emphasizing shallower flooded
areas would not exhaust all opportunities for treating these areas, indicat-
ing that much of the country will remain subject to flooding for the foresee-
able future.
5.      Flood  Warning.  With UNDP and World Meteorological Organization
assistance, Bangladesh has established a Flood Forecasting and Warning Center
to monitor rainfall and water levels, and issue daily bulletins, accompanied
by forecasts for the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers and flash-flood prone
rivers in the southeast, that provide key data for the organization of the
Government's response to flood disasters.
6.      Flood Disaster Response.  In the event of a flood disaster, all
agencies of the Government, including the armed services, are mobilized. The
Ministry of Relief is the key agency and its Minister chairs a Central Coor-
dination Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation made up of the
secretaries of other appropriate Ministries. The Committee decides on the
response and relief policies to be followed and allocates responsibilities.
Monitoring the implementation of these policies is usually undertaken by an
operations center located in Dhaka. First priority is given to essential
evacuation, followed by food distribution, restoration of communications,
provision of shelter and clothing, cash assistance, and finally, as floods
recede, programs of preventive medicine and agricultural rehabilitation. The
response system works generally well, but lacks an effective mechanism to
provide direction and materials to strengthen threatened embankments and
other flood protection structures. To address this problem, the Flood
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1587-BD) included a flood preparedness study to
investigate possible mechanisms for a more rapid response to floods. Follow-
ing delay that study is now underway, regrettably not in time to provide help
for the recent emergency.
The 1987 Floods
7.     The 1987 floods were severe, probably the worst in over 25 years.
Flooding affected 56 of 64 Districts, 390 of 460 upazilas, and over 50,000
sq km. The floods began in early July when heavy rain over northern Sylhet
District caused flash flooding and local damage. However, the main floods
came in three surges starting in the last ten days of July, beginning with
record rainfall in the north and above average rainfall throughout 90Z of the



-13-
country. Neighboring areas, chiefly in India, also experienced high rain-
fall, and this exacerbated the flooding. Rainfall in August was again excep-
tionally heavy. Six of the Bangladesh Water Development Board's (BWDB) 34
monitoring stations registered record monthly totals, 32 were above average
and msany recorded over 200Z of normal rainfall. The combination of these
exceptional rains with the impaired drainage and flooding resulting from the
high levels in the major river systems caused widespread and devastating
flooding. A third flood peak came in September, when rainfall was again
above average over most of Bangladesh and neighboring territories. This
delayed the recession of the flood. The Ganges flowed above the danger level
continuously from August 2 through September 28, with the exception of three
days in August. The September rainfall was particularly heavy over northern
Sylhet, causing severe local flooding, and parts of the south where severe
cyclonic storms aggravated existing floods and caused strong tidal surges
which damaged coastal protection works.
Crop Damage 1/
8.      Probably the most damaging aspect of the 1987 flooding was its timing
and duration relative to the critically important aman rice crop. About 20%
of the aman crop area was damzged, reducing aman production by an estimated
1.55 million tons, or 19% below the FY84-87 average aman crop of 8.25 million
tons. Some aman areas remained unplanted because of the late recession of
the flood, others because of scarcity of planting material - particularly in
areas where replanting had begun only to be devastated a second time. Large
areas had to be replanted to lower yielding local varieties because it was
too late to plant high yielding varieties. Also large areas suffered yield
reduction due to late planting. A joint FAO/WFP damage assessment mission
produced a report in October 1987, estimating that even with the expectation
of a very good boro (dry season) rice crop, total foodgrain production in
1987/88 will be about 1.4 million tons below what might reasonably be
projected in a normal year, or 9% below the FY84-87 average foodgrain produc-
tion of 16.22 million tons.
Infrastructure Damage
9.      Following recession of the floods government agencies prepared
estimates of damages to infrastructure. A summary of the physical damage
reported as of mid-October is set out below.
1/   Damage estimates have focussed on foodgrain production, and have not
been made for other crops, although it is known that large areas undet
jute, sugarcane, banana and other crops were damaged.

10.     Costs of the 1987 Floods.  It is too early to give accurate estimates
of the cost of the floods, but a compilation of preliminary estimates yields
a figure of US$640 million, as outlined in Table 1. The main costs to the
Government budget will be for the additional commercial foodgrain pur-
chases--US$141 million--and the repairs to infrastructure--estimated at
US$235 million. Infrastructure damage estimates exclude the nearly two
million houses damaged or destroyed. The human costs are incalculable. An
estimated 30 million people were affected, with over 1,800 deaths--about 440
from drowning and the balance mainly from diarrhoeal disease.

Government Response to the 1987 Flood Disaster.
11.     Government has handled the 1987 flood emergency well, having acquired
considerable experience in managing relief activities, foodgrain procurement
and distribution, and aid donor coordination, and having developed effective
flood and weather monitoring and forecasting systems. As a result, the human
suffering was much less than in the 1974. There were only about one fifth



- 16-
as many deaths from drowning as in 1974, no reported deaths from hunger, and
the diarrhoeal disease situation was contained.
12.    As a matter of routine, BWDB's Flood Information Cen:er and the Flood
Control Cell of the Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation were in operation
from the onset of the floods. By mid-August, when the full severity of the
floods became evident, Government took several important steps. First, a
Flood Monitoring Cell was established in the President's Secretariat, ensur-
ing that flood matters received top priority. Second, donors were approached
to provide both emergency food relief and medium term assistance for
rehabilitation. Third, Government itself moved quickly to purchase addi-
tional quantities of foodgrains. Food relief and prompt securing of
foodgrain import commitments quickly eliminated early speculative increases
in foodgrain prices. Fourth, line agencies were instructed to begin prepara-
tion of estimates of damage and rehabilitation requirements.
13.     Throughout the emergency, Government's interaction with the donor
co.imunity was excellent. As a result, by mid-October, pledges had been
received for the 435,000 tons of incremental foodgrain aid requested by
Government on August 25, 1987. A wide range of emergency relief donations
were also received from bilate-   donors and NGOs including cash, medicines
and seeds. The World Bank and ihe Asian Development Bank were also
approached early for rehabilitation assistance and, by mid-October, both
institutions had received specific proposals for short term assistance,
including the subject of this report.
14.     By September 1, the Ministry of Agriculture had prepared and pub-
lished an agricultural recovery plan. While elements of this are open to
criticism, in particular the inclusion of requests for assistance for a large
number of items which are not flood related, the basic strategy is sound.
The short term focus was to maximize aman crop replanting, with large
programs of seedling production and distribution (seedlings were produced in
upland areas and transported to inundated areas as the floods receded), and
seed distribution. Outstanding agricultural loans in flood affected areas
also were rescheduled to enable credit to play its part in the recovery
effort. The longer term focus will be to maximize winter crop production.
One element of this will be to maximize the area irrigated, with special
programs to rehabilitate flood damaged and otherwise unserviceable equipment.
Additional wheat seed has been imported to allow area expansion, and promo-
tional efforts will be made through the extension service to expand
vegetable, pulse and oilseed production. The latter will also be supported
by imports of seed. Overall, the aim is to increase winter crop production
by the equivalent cf 1 million tons of foodgrains.

B. PREVIOUS BANK-FINANCED DISASTER RELIEF PROJECTS IN BANGLADESH
15.     On November 12 and 13, 1970 a cyclone struck coastal districts of
what was then the East of Pakistan killing as many as 500,000 people and
causing enormous damage. Due to the war of liberation, the reconstruction
program made little progress, but after independence, a cancelled
IDA-assisted rehabilitation project was re-appraised and relaunched as the
Coastal Area Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project (Cr. 339-BD, for
US$25 million), on October 18, 1972. Eight categories of investments in the
devastated area were financed involving seven implementing agencies. The
project took seven and a half years to complete instead of the three years
foreseen at appraisal. In addition to problems in procurement, supervision
and physical access, the complex organization of the project, involving an
unnecessary coordinating board, was identified as a principal reason for slow
implementation.
16.     The second IDA-assisted disaster relief project, the Flood
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1587-BD for SDR 31.3 million) was a response to
the disastrous flooding which occurred during the 1984 monsoon. Processed as
an emergency operation by both IDA and Government, following abbreviated
procedures, the credit was signed April 11, 1985. Reflecting experience with
the earlier project, the project was designed to be implemented directly,
without central coordination, by the four concerned agencies. Project
implementation has gone well, and works are about 95% complete. An important
lesson from this project which will be applied in the proposed project is
that consultants for implementation assistance and monitoring must be in
place to assist in selection and supervise implementation of works. Under
the project consultant appointments were delayed and there was initially come
suboptimal selection and implementation of work. Low standards of design and
construction have reduced the ability of embankments, bridges, schools and
other infrastructure to withstand even normal flooding.
17.     Inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure, includ-
ing much infrastructure financed under IDA Credits, is the subject of an
ongoing dialogue with Government. As a result of inadequate maintenance,
flood damage is often more severe than it would be otherwise. In the water
and highways sectors improved O&M is a major focus of a number of important
ongoing and planned operations. With respect to the proposed project an
assurance would be sought from Government that adequate funds would be allo-
cated for the O&M of infrastructure to be rehabilitated.

C. THE PROJECT
Objectives
18.     The proposed project is the lead element of a more comprehensive and
longer term proposed program of IDA assistance for the Government's flood
rehabilitation efforts. It is intended to provide quick, 'mergency assia-
tance for priority works to be carried out mainly in the current construction
(dry) season. The other elements of the program include the addition of
flood rehabilitation components to the recently negotiated Second Small Scale
Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project and to the Rural Roads and
Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project appraised in October 1987, and
the reallocation of funds for rehabilitation under ongoing Credits: Second
Primary Education (Cr. 1574-BD), Third Population and Family Health (Cr.
1649-BD), Rural Electrification (Cr. 1262-BD), and Ashuganj Thermal Power
(Cr. 1254-BD). Total IDA assistance would be about US$108 million, or 46% of
major infrastructure damages. In addition, the Asian Development Bank plans
reconstruction loans in water control (US$14.3 million, in the southwestern
region) and in roads and railways (US$17.5 million for roads east of the
Jamuna-Padma and US$15 million for railways nationwide), and is considering
reconstruction assistance in secondary education and other social infrastruc-
ture, which would complement IDA assistance. Bilateral donors are planning
reconstruction assistance on a smaller but as yet unspecified scale. Table 2
shows the sectoral and project distribution of IDA's rehabilitation assis-
tance and estimated infrastructure damages.

19.     The proposed project was prepared by the staff of the Bank's Resident
Mission with the assistance of headquarters staff visiting Bangladesh in
September and October 1987. Reflecting the emergency nature of the opera-
tion, conventional, detailed appraisal was not undertaken and a Staff
Appraisal Report was not prepared.



-20-
210.    In lieu of conventional project preparation and appraisal, it was
agreed with Government that consultants would be employed by three of the
agencies involved (BWDB, RHD and LCD), to make verifications of the agencies'
own damage assessments, to prepare lists of works to be included under the
project, and subsequently to provide monitoring and technical assistance
during implementation (para 29). In the case of DPE, the large number of
small, remote school jobs and an agreement to carry out works according to
the same standards and conditions as apply in the Second Primary Education
Project make consultants neither practical nor necessary. UNICEF has
assisted in damage assessments for primary schools. Further consultant
responsibilities, described below, were agreed at negotiations. Both Govern-
ment and IDA agreed to sole source hiring of consultants to speed the
process. By mid-October some consultants were already at work and the hiring
of the rest was well advanced. In the case of the education and inland water
transport components it was not considered necessary to use consultants in
damage assessments.  To provide for central mon.toring of project progress,
the Resident Mission would recruit two full time local consultants.
Components
21.     This project would comprise priority components of the Government's
program to rehabilitate flood damaged infrastructure and equipment and would
include:
(a) rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection
works;
(b) rehabilitation of roads and associated structures;
(c) reconstruction and repair of primary schools;
(d) replacement of navigational aids and water-gauging equipment;
(e)  repair of river landing jetties; and
(f) provision of technical services by local and foreign consult-
ants.
22.     A large part of project works would be completed in the 1987/88 dry
season. However, there would inevitably be some slippage of works into the
1988/89 dry season. The proposed project completion and credit closing
dates, December 31, 1988 and June 30, 1989 respectively, reflect this. The
project would be implemented by five agencies: the Bangladesh Water Develop-
ment Board (BWDB), the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), the Local Govern-
ment Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development
and Cooperatives, the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) in conjunction
with the Facilities Department of the Ministry of Education, and the



-21-
Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA). The implementing agen-
cies would ensure that rehabilitation works financed under the Project werf
executed in accordance with design standards and ccnstruction specifications
satisfactory to IDA. A more detailed description of project components
follows.
23.     Rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage, and flood protection works
(BWDB). Restoration works carried out by BWDB would include compected fill-
ing of embankment breaches; the resectioning, strengthening and protecting of
damaged embankments; and the retirement of embankments where the existing
location is no longer tenable. Damaged or destroyed water control structures
and canals would be repaired and replaced. Particular attention would be
paid to retaining walls and other protective work and damaged or lost flap
gates would be replaced. Town protection works maintained by BWDB would also
be eligible for reconstruction under the project. Such protective works
would include groynes, sheet piling, brick mattressing, boulder and cement
block revetments, aid flood walls.
24.     Restoration work on roads and associated structures (RHD and LCD).
Road works financed under the project and carried out by RHD and LCD would
include compacted filling of embankment breaches; the resectioning,
strengthening, and protecting of eroded embankments; and reconstruction of
damaged culverts, bridges, and retaining walls. Road surfaces would include
the restoration of road shoulders and the repair and strengthening of damaged
pavement. Additional drainage and culverts would be provided in recon-
structed and strengthened embankments and where otherwise appropriate.
25.     Reconstruction and repair of primary schools (DPE).  The project
would reconstruct and provide furniture for about 600 of the estimated 2,100
primary schools destroyed by the floods, to be selected from all
flood-affected upazilas. The destroyed schools were all of the rudimentary
type of construction but would be rebuilt to the standards of the Second
Primary Education Project (which, through savings generated primarily through
exchange rate movements, it is proposed would finance the balance of the
primary school reconstruction). The project would also finance the recon-
struction, repair and furnishing of 860 flood damaged primary schools,
situated outside the project area of the Second Primary Education project.
26.     Replacement of navigational aids and other equipment (BIWTA).  River
flooding washed away a number of BIWTA navigational aids and destroyed or
severely damaged critical water gauging equipment. Under the project, BIWTA
would procure and replace steel lantern buoys, shore beacons, markers, moor-
ing gear, dredger pipe, gauges and recorders. A worn-out 85-foot tugboat
would also be replaced to facilitate flood rehabilitation work, in particular
pontoon repair and placement.
27.     Rehabilitation of ferry docks, jetties and related facSlities
(BIWTA). Repairs would be carried out to ferry docks and related structures



-22-
at five locations, to cargo jetties at 19 locations, and to about 50 pas-
senger jetties at about 40 locations. Damaged port facilities would be
repaired at seven locations and 21 pontoons would be repaired and their
mooring tackle replaced.
28.     Provision of technical services (BWDB, RHD, LGD).  The technical
services to be included in the project are described below. To facilitate
speedy engagement of consultants it was agreed that Government would ini-
tially make use of existing sources of funds. Thus the unspent balance of
the UNDP .-oject (BCD/84/047) associated with the Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project was used to finance a damage assessment for RHD and LGD
in the northwest region, and it is proposed to use funds of the ongoing,
first Flood Rehabilitation Project to emiploy consultants for the balance of
damage assessments and initial implementation assistance until funds become
available under the proposed credit.
29.     The technical services included in the project would comprise:
(i) Consultants employed to verify damage assessments produced by
Government agencies and to compile prioritized listings of works
to be included in the project;
(ii) Consultant services required by BWDB, RHD and LGD to assist in
the implementation of project activities. Coosultant's respon-
sibilities would include: (a) checking that all sub-projects
selected for financing under the credit were consistent with the
criteria agreed between the Government and IDA, (b) approval of
the design of project works, preparation of detailed design and
bid documents where necessary for this project and the flood
rehabilitation components of the proposed IDA-assisted projects
in the water and roads sectors, and preparation of plans and
estimates and of a programi for implementation, (c) supervision
of project works, including monitoring the quality and progress
of project works, (d) preparing progress and completion reports
on the basis of which reimbursement would be made by IDA, and
(e) contributing to the production of the Project Completion
Report that the Government would prepare for the project.
Specifically for the two road components, the consultants would
also analyze the reasons for failure of drainage structures
during the flood, and prepare an action plan including recommen-
dations on improved design to be implemented in the proposed
follow-up project (which would include rehabilitation works to
be executed in FY88/89 and FY89/90). It is estimated that BWDB,
RHD and LGD would require 64 staff-months of foreign consultant
services and 462 staff-months of local consultant services. All
of the staff-months required would be the services of mid-level
engineers and above.



-23-
30.     The qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment
of consultants under the project would have to be satisfactory to IDA.
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
31.     The project would be implemented by thp five agencies, BWD8, RHD,
LCD, DPE, and IWTA and would be completed by December 31, 1988. There would
be no need for coordination at a higher level. Each agency's basic programs
have been reviewed and approved by their respective ministries and by the
Planning Commission.
32.     BWDB would be responsible for reconstruction work under the project's
flood control, drainage and irrigation component. BWDB is under the
administrative control of the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Development and
Flood Control and is managed by a Chairman and five board members respon-
sible, respectively, for planning, implementation, operation and maintenance,
finance, and administration. In the field, BWDB is organized under a
geographic system of zones supervised by Chief Engineers, circles under
Superintending Engineers and divisions under Executive Engineers who handlc
both new construction and the operation and maintenance of completed struc-
tures. Reconstruction of works would be the responsibility of Executive
Engineers under the suDervision of their Circle Superintendency Engi' !er and
zonal Chief Engineer. The responsibilities of Executive Engineers would
include, with assistance of the consultants, preparation of tender documents;
selection of contractors and award of contracts; and construction supervision
and quality control. They would also be responsible for implementation of
works under force account and accounting and detailed financial control.
Design assistance, when required, would be provided by BWDR's central Design
Directorate. The Chief Engineering, Monitoring and Evaluat: on, would act as
the principal contact of IDA for project matters.
33.     Administration of the principal road network is the responsibility of
RHD, a department of the Roads and Road Transport Division of the Ministry of
Communications.  RHD is responsible for road design, construction and main-
tenance and for the installation and operation of truck, car and passenger
ferries. Its Chief Engineer is the chief executive. The field organization
of RHD is similar to that of BWDB and under the project the Department's
Executive Engineers would have primary day-to-day responsibility for recon-
struction work. The Additional Chief Engineer at RHD headquarters has been
designated as the principal contact with IDA for project-funded activities.
Procurement of portable bridging would be managed by RHD's Additional Chief
Engineer, Foreign-Aided Projects Wing.
34.     The rest  ition of flood-damaged feeder and urban roads, whose main-
tenance is the il   J sibility of districts and municipalities, would be
executed by the Lcca ')vernment Engineering Bureau (LGEB) of LCD which is



-24-
headed by a Secretary. The country's 64 districts and 86 municipalities have
their own engineering departments which are funded by locally generated taxes
and central Government grants. Most districts have an Executive Engineer in
charge of their engineering departments, but municipal engineers are usually
of the lower sub-divisional engineer or more junior grades. The implementa-
tion of LGD work woultd be the responsibility of the engineers in charge of
the districts or the municipalities concerned and would include, with the
assistance of the consultants, tendering and awarding of contracts and super-
vision.  They would also be responsible for payments to contractors and
maintenan.ce of accounts. Supervision would be by LGEB whose chief executive
is the Engineering Adviser. One of LGEB's superintending engineers would be
appointed for IDA liaison.
35.     Implementation of the primary school component would be fully in
accordance with the arrangements being followed in the Second Primary Educa-
tion Project. Thus DPE would have overall responsibility for implementation
and would, in consultation with upazila authorities, prepare the final list
of schools to be constructed and repaired. The Ministry of Education's
Facilities Department (FD) would be responsible for handling the construction
program and the repair program would be executed by the respective upazila
authorities under the oversight of Upazila Education Officers who would
ensure that regular monitoring reports, in the standard format being
developed under the Second Primary Education Project, were sent to DPE. It
has been agreed that, to enable FD to carry out its enlarged responsibilities
arising from the flood construction program, Government would from its own
resources strengthen FD as follows: four Superintending and four Executive
Engineers will be added to FD's senior staff; all FD Assistant Engineers will
be added to FD's senior staff; all FD Assistant Engineers at district level
will be provided with jeeps to improve their supervision capacity; and FD's
Sub-Assistant Engineer at upazila level will no longer supervise repair work.
36.     BIWTA is an agency of the Ports, Shipping and Inland Water Transport
Division of the Ministry of Communications, and is responsible for the
development and control of inland ports, and the preparation of regulations
governing inland water transport and waterways. Its functions include water-
ways and river conservancy, navigational regulations and aids, and improve-
ment of inlan' water traffic.  BIWTA has a Board headed by a Chairman wno
serves as chief executive. Project activiries to be undertaken by BIWTA have
been specified and agrced u4'h IDA.  Procurement of equipment and materials
would be handled centrally by BIWTA's Purchase and Storage Department with
the assistance of the consultants. Repair and replacement of pontoons would
be implemented by the Conservancy and Pilotage Department, replacement of
buoys and pontoons by the Mechanical and Marine Engineering Department and
jetty repair by the Engineering Department. BIWTA's Director of Planning
would serve as liaison officer and principal contact with IDA for the execu-
tion of project-funded activities.



-25-
Selection of Goods and Works for Inclusion in the Project
37.     Other than LGD, the implementing agencies themselves made overall
flood damage assessments and subsequently proposed initial selections of
priority goods and works for inclusion in the project. In the case of LCD,
overall damage assessments were submitted by all districts and
municipalities, from these LGEB made initial proposals for works to be
included in the project.
38.     In the final selection of project works the implementing agencies and
their consultants would ensure that, inter alia, the works selected were
consistent with criteria satisfactory to IDA as follows:
(a) damage to be repaired would be:
(i) a consequence of the 1987 floods, or damages which, if not
repaired, will vitiate or seriously diminish the effective-
ness of other flood damages being repaired under the
Project; and
(ii) of significant nature, not include minor works of deferred
maintenance, and in respect of the RHD and LGD components
have an estimated value of Tk 500,000 or more, and
Tk 200,000 or more, respectively;
(b) reconstruction work would restore structures to their original
specifications or to such higher specifications, including
necessary additions or alterations, as may be warranted to
ensure their optimal performance and integrity over a reasonable
life;
(c) other external sources of finance would not be available; and
(d) the works (other than those under the DPE and BIWTA components)
have been approved by the supervising consultants employed under
the Project.
Proposals for works involving expenditures of over US$500,000 would be sub-
mitted to IDA for prior review and approval. IDA approvals for these
proposals would be handled by the Bank's Resident Mission to Bangladesh with
reference to headquarters as necessary.



-26-
Project Costs
39.     Total project costs are estimated at US$30.3 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$7.5 million or 251 of total costs. These project
costs are based on provisional damage assessments and lists of project goods
and works, but because the project is only one of several IDA operations with
flood rehabilitation elements, its size would be fixed, and the other opera-
tions would finance most rehabilitation needs beyond this fixed project size.
Accordingly, no contingencies are included in the cost estimates. The credit
would finance a large portion of local costs because of the emergency nature
of the works, the size of the floods' budgetary and economic impact, and the
extreme poverty of the country.

/a   Local cost includes about US$1.89 million equivalent in Food for Work Program
financed embankment work not financed under proposed project.
/b   The total project cost, net of duties and taxes (US$2.16 million) is
US$28.19 million.
Project Financing
39.     The proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million would cover about 89% of
project costs net of duties and taxes. Government's US$5.3 million share of
costs would include all duties and taxes, and about US$1.9 of Food for Work
Program grants for embankment works. Food for Work resources are provided
mostly through the World Food Program and can be used for a wide range of
works, hence their inclusion as Government counterpart resources. The



-28-
proceeds of the IDA credit and the Government's contribution would be passed
on to the implementing agencies through direct budgetary allocations.
40.     Bangladesh operates a complex and formal allocation process for its
Annual Development Program (ADP). Two features of the process are par-
ticularly important: (a) approval by the Economic Committee of the National
Executive Council of a Project Proforma for each new project to be included
in the ADP (without which, no expenditures can be made on the project); and
(b) allocation within each ADP of funds for each year of implementation of
specific projects. In the case of the proposed project, the Government has
decided that the Project Proforma process will be waived and a block alloca-
tion adequate to cover all project costs will be provided under the revised
FY88 ADP and the ADP for FY89.
41.     Retroactive Financing.  Retroactive financing in aggregate not
exceeding US$4.1 million, would be permitted for works started by the project
implementing agencies, or goods and services procured by the agencies for use
.ider the project after October 1, 1987, provided that works undertaken were
selected on the basis of criteria set out in paragraph 38 and, in the cases
of BWDB, RHD and LGD, the consultants verify that the works were performed to
specifications which will ensure their integrity over a reasonable life.
Procurement
42.     International competitive bidding (ICB) would not be appropriate for
civil works contracts because (i) the project would involve work at a large
number of sites scattered throughout Bangladesh; (ii) all contracts would be
of a relatively low value; (iii) the dispersal of sites and small contract
values would meke the packaging of works into single contracts of sufficient
value to attra:t foreign bidders impossible; (iv) most of the work would be
labor-intensive, involving a minimum of equipment, and easily and cheaply
organized by small local contractors; and (v) the time involved in letting
contracts through ICB would delay the start of works. Civil works contracts
would be let through the existing arrangements of the implementing agencies
for local competitive bidding (LCB) among pre-qualified contractors. These
arrangements have been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory. There would
also be a limited amount of force account work.
43.     Portable steel bridging required by RHD and LGD would be procured
through ICB in accordance with World Bank guidelines, as would be the
majority of instruments and gauges to be procured by BIWTA, and the BIWTA
tugboat. However, a small amount of equipment for BIWTA cou'd be procured
through direct shopping where goods of a proprietary nature are needed for
replacement purposes. Pontoon repairs, buoys, and related items required by
BIWTA would be procured through LCB.
44.     The standard civil works tender documents used by each of the
implementing agencies have been reviewed by IDA and found suitable for



-29-
project procurement. However, it was agreed at negotiations that local
procurement procedures would conform to those agreed for use in the Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Cr. 1827-SD). For equipment, the
standard documents used by RHD, LGD and BIWTA for ICB and LCB procurement are
satisfactory. Review and approval by the Bank prior to award would be
required for all contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or
more.
Disbursement
45.     Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit would cover:
(a) 95% of the expenditure on civil works, including construction
materials and any work done on force account, excluding Food for
Work financing;
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditure on directly imported bridging,
hydrological and miscellaneous equipment;
(c) 100% of the ex-factory price of equipment manufactured within
Bangladesh, or 70% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally; and
(d)  100% of foreign and local expenditures incurred for consultant
services.
On the basis of the above, it is expected that the credit would be employed
approximately as follows: BWDB---US$6.9 million, RHD--US$6.4 million,
LGD--US$3.0 million; DPE--US$6.3 million; and BIWTA--US$2.4 million. Full
documentation would be sent to IDA in support of withdrawal applications in
respect of equipment, consultants and civil works contracts, except for small
civil works contracts of less than US$150,000 equivalent and for force
account operations which would be reimbursed against statements of expendi-
ture accompanied by a listing of the contracts of works included in the
application and the total expenditure on each. The actual documentation
would be retained by the implementing agencies and be made available for
review by IDA representatives on request. To ensure the uninterrupted flow
of funds for approved project activities, a Special Account would be opened
in Bangladesh Bank. The authorized allocation for the Account would be
US$8.2 million equivalent.
Accounts and Audit
46.     Each implementing agency would maintain separate records of all
expenditures incurred. The accounts of all implementing agencies are audited
by their own internal audit systems and by the Comptroller and Auditor
