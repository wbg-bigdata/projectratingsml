PROJECT COMPLETION: REPORT
THAILAND
SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1871-TH)
Preface
1.       Loan 1871-TH in the amount equivalent to US$75 million was approved
on June 12, 1980 to help the borrower, Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
finance its Accelerated Rural Electrification Program comprising the
electrification of 34,800 villages during the period FY1980-86. The project
components were: (i) the electrification of 7,878 villages and the
installation of the required support facilities during FY1980-85; (ii) the
implementation of a pilot project consisting of two mini-hydroelectricity
generating plants; and (iiij the implementation of a study of PEA's operation
development and a study of mini-hydro systems for Thailand. The closing date
of the loan was extended one year to June 30, 1987 and the loan was fully
disbursed on December 15, 1987.
2.       As of FY 1987 the following main project objectives were accom-
plished:
(a) expanding PEA's distribution system and electrifying 6,048 villages;
the balance of the 7,878 villages are scheduled to be electrified by
end-FY 1989;
(b) evaluating Thailand's mini-hydroelectricity prospects and success-
fully completing and operating two mini-hydro pilot plants;
(c) enhancing PEA's operational and institutional development;
(d) maintaining the power sector's financial soundness through the
observance of financial covenants in this and other Bank projects;
and
(e)  contributing to the qtility of life and other social benefits of the
rural pocr in line with a basic aim of Bank lending in Thailand.
3.       This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Industry and
Energy Division of Asia-Country Department II. The PCR is based on a
completion report prepared by PEA, reports, data and other documents in the
project files and on information obtained during a visit to Thailand in
November, 1988.
4.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower and the co-financiers
for their comments; comments received from the Borrower have been attached
(See Attachment following the Annexes). Applicable sections of the PCR have
been amended to reflect the Borrower's comments.

THAILAND
SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT (LOAN 1871-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The Bank loan of US$75 million helped the borrower, the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA) finance a time slice of its rural electrification
program. PEA, a government-owned enterprlse, is charged with the distribution
of electricity throughout all of Thailand except for the metropolitan Bangkok
area. The project included: (i) the electrification of 7,878 preselected
villages; (ii) the required primary and secondary electric lines, transformers
and other accessories; (iii) the installation of two mini-hydroelectricity
generating plants, and (iv) the services of consultants to conduct a study of
PEA's operW'ions development and a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand.
2.       Project objectives were largely accomplished (Preface, para. 2).
Shortcomings, mainly with PEA's finances and the lower than projected
electrification rate did exist, but they were minor compared to the overall
achievements.
3.      "PEA's rural electr'fication program for FY1980-86 called for the
electrification of 34,800 villages over this seven year period. The program
required tripling the village electrification rate and this greatly over-
extended PEA's state of preparedness and capabilities at the time. Despite
the resulting initial linplementation difficulties, PEA complete! 762 of the
program in the specified time frame, a creditable accomplishment under the
circumstances. The project villages were part of this program and were
originally scheduled to be electrified by FY1985, but the last of the lot is
now scheduled for electrification in late 1989. This protracted schedule is
mainly due to shifting plans and priorities typified by the fact that by the
time the project got underway almost two thousand of the villages had already
been electrified under a different project.
4.       Including US$12.6 million equivalent in local expenditures to
complete electrifying the remaining project villages the final pro,ect cost is
estimated to be US$259.1 million, US$10.1 million (4t) less than the project
appraisal estimate. In addition to the US$75 million Bank loan, the remaining
foreign costs were financed by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA)-US$10.6 million, the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)-US$19.2 million,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Special Fund (OPEC)-US$5.9
million and a grant from the Kingdom of Norway for US$2.7 million. Except for
US$2.1 equivalent local expenditure financed by OPEC the remaining US$143.4
million were financed by PEA. The Bank loan was fully disbursed on
December 15, 1987 and the other disbursements were completed before
September 30, 1987.
5.       The study of PEA's operations development was combined with a
similarly oriented study included in the follow-up project (Loan 2312-TH) and



financed by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADA). ADAB
subsequently allocated &dditional funds to finance experts for helping PEA
implement the recommendations which were developed by the study. The benefits
derived from adopting these recommendations are an important element in the
institutional development which is transforming PEA into a well-managed and
efficient electric utility.
6.       PEA's operations so far have been satisfactory in terms of the
quality of the service it is providing to its customers. However, power
outages are becoming a cause for concern which will require PEA to assign a
higher priority in its future operations to the maintenance and reinforcement
of the power distribution network.
7.       The two min_-hydro projects were located at Mae Tian and Mae Chai iin
Northern Thailand. Implementation proceeded smoothly with construction and
commissioning completed for both plants in January 1985. Both plants have
operated satisfactorily since then; the Mae Tian plant has a firm power
delivery of 400 kW and the Mae Chai plant 310 kW.   Mae Tian has an IERR of
0.12 and Mae Chai 5.32 indicating that these sites are not economic based on
the value of electricity which is generated and does not have to be purchased
from EGAT.
8.       PEA earned a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets during the
project period rangi ! from 3.52 to 6.4Z, which were not of particularly poor
rates of return fro a utility like PEA wh*ich principally serves rural areas
and secondary towns however, as a result of increasing interest payments and
foreign exchange losses over, the last three year (FY 1985-87), PEA
experienced net operating losses and a growing debt/equity ratio which by FY
1987 marginally exceeded the debt limit prescribed in the Bank loan agreement.
To help PEA restablish a sound financial position the Government will have to
help reduce its debt/equity ratio by direct infusion of capital, by enabling
an increase in its net income or a combination of the two. Increased net
income can be accomplished by either raising PEA's revenues through tariff
level or structural adjustments or reducing the electricity rate paid to EGAT.
9.       The internal economic rate of return (IERR) from the project is now
computed to be 13Z compared to the 152 estimated at appraisal.  The lower rate
is mainly due to a slower than forecast pace of village electrification.
10.      The PCR cites the following lessons learned which are summarized as
followss
(a) the Bank could play a useful role by helping by inexperienced
borrowers plan and prepare large-scale programs;
(b) the Bank could help minimize procurement disputes by insisting on
comprehensive and unambiguous procurement documents; and
(c) the economic costs and benefits should be carefully analyzed before
embarking on a mini-hydro project. The Borrower notes in this regard
that the economic evaluation of the mini-hydro project was quite low
because it was a pilot operation and the capital cost covered
training, survey, design, construction supervision and installation.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1871-TU)
1. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.1 Three government-owned utilities generate and supply all the electricity
consumed in Thailand except for a relatively insignificant amount bought and
distributed by one franchise operated bv the Thai Navy and the power generated
by a number of industries for their own use. The three utilities are the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan
Electricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
EGAT is responsible for the generation and high voltage transmission of
electricity to MEA, PEA and a number of large indastrial consumers; MEA is
responsible for electricity distribution in the greater Bangkok metropolitan
area; and PEA distributes electricity throughout the rest of Thailand not
served by MEA. In addition, PEA generates a small amount of electricity in
certain isolated areas.
Rural Electrification
1.2 The supply of electricity to provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. In 1973, the government directed PEA 11
to plan an accelerated rural electrification program giving priority to the
more backward areas of the country. Since then, the rural electrification
effort has expanded in scope and intensity and now comprises the following
constitutents2
(a) the normal village electrification program carried o'lt by the PEA
regional offices which connect villages on receiving a capital
contribution of about 302 of the initial cost; the Bank's Power
Distribution Project (Loan 2312-TH) supnorts this program;
(b) the accelerated rural electrification program (ARE) coordinated by
PEA's Office of Rural Electrification (ORE). This program is
geographically oriented and coimits a specific ARE project to
specific regions and provinces;
(c) the Tambon program is intended to supply electricity to all Tambon
headquarters and the surrounding villages which can be connected at
a reasonable cost; and 21
(d) miscellaneous small-scale electrification projects.
1.3      Annex 1 shows the status of rural electrification in PEA's service
area during the period FY1977 to FY1987. The number of villages electrified
during this decade increased from 11,269 to 46,766 by the end of FY87 when 812
of the 57,391 villages then in existence in PEA's area had access to
electricity. Under the 4th and 5th National Economic and Social Development
Plans PEA's target for FY1992 is to bring the total number of electrified

approved by the Council of Ministries on August 28, 1973; it stated
that all villages in Thailand were to be electrified in the next 25
years.

villages to 59,322, representUng 96Z of the 61,826 villages estimated to be in
its territory by then. Included in the electrification number are 1,805
villages which are programmed to be completed under this project by FY1989.
It is interesting Lo note that the number of villages is growing at a rate of
about 1.52 per year. This increasing number of villages is due to the policy
of the Ministry of Interior to split a village into two when the number of
households reaches a prescribed limit of about a thousand units.
The Project
1.4      The Bank's first loan to PEA (Loan 1527-TH approved in March 1978)
helped finance the first stage of PEA's Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program (ARE 1) which was directed at 16 provinces in the Northeast region and
four other provinces. This project comprised the second stage of the ARE
Program (ARE 2) over the period FY1980-1985. Its main components were the
electrification of 7878 villages in the regions not covered by ARE 1, the
development of two mini-hydro plants and the services of consultants for two
studies. In addition to the Bank loan, financing was providei by the OPEC
Special Fund, the Saudi Fund for Development, the Government of Norway and the
Canadian International Development Agency.
The Borrower
1.5      PEA was established in September 1960 under the Provincial
Electricity Act. The act empowered PEA to generate, purchase and sell
electricity throughout Thailand except for MEA's area of operation. In
practice, however, PEA purchases practically all its electricity from EGAT,
generating only the very small amount needed to supply areas still not having
access to its distribution grid.
1.6      PEA's current organization chart is shown in Annex 4.  The Board of
Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministries and consists of a chairman
and nine members who are senior officials of government agencies and bodies
connected with the electric power sector. The governor of PEA is the chief
executive officer and ex-officio member of the Board. PEA is organized into
five functional lines of commands Corporate Services, Economics and Finance,
Operation, Technique and Planning and Development, each headed by a deputy
governor.
1.7      After being established in 1960, PEA underwent rapid growth and has
now developed into an efficient and competent power utility. However, the
greatly expanded electrification program from 1978 onward gave rise to
difficulties in some area of its operations. The project accordingly provides
for consultants to assist PEA in strengthening operational efficiency and
competence.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
Prolect Appraisal
2.1      Following the ARE 1 project preparation, PEA carried out a



feasibility study, completed in late 1978, which examined the next stage of
the rural electrification program. The study formed the basis for this
proiect, the Second Accelerated Rural Electrification (ARE 2) Project, which
was appraised during February 12 to March 9, 1979. A follow-up appraisal to
update the findings of the earlier mission took place between December 1, to
21, 1979.  The second appraisal mission identified the following issues which
needed to be settled during loan negotiations:
(a)  The governm6nt should give formal approval to PEA's entire rural
electrification program (not just ARE 2);
(b) The project should include a load promotion program (in addition to
the one included in ARE 1, Loan 1527-TH);
(c) PEA's tariff schedule should include a fuel and power purchase
adjustment;
(d) The project should include provisions for a study of PEA's operations
development with the purpose of strengthening its planning and
financial management;
(e) The project should provide for the review of PEA's engineering
standards; and
(f) The existing rate of return earnings covenant in current Bank loan
agreements with PEA should be continued with this loari.
2.2      Another issue in the forefront at the time of project appraisal was a
sector coordination problem which had developed with the rapid growth of the
sector. The need for sector coordination resulted chiefly from the fact that
too many organizations 3/ had a part in the decision-making process affecting
the sector. Typically, important sector decisions were reached only after
differing and sometimes conflicting views of these organizations had been
resolved; the resulting compromises were not always in the best interest of
the sector _ Thailand as a whole. The cabinet level Committee for Power
Policy and Development was establishee in 1977 to correct this situation and
oversee the sector, but it did not immediately develop into a decision-making
body. At the government's request a power sector coordination study was added
to EGI. s Khao Laem Project (Loar. 1770-TH) which was being processed at the
same time as this project. Before undertaking the study, the Government and
the Bank agreed to wait for the results of the Energy Master Plan Study. The
study, when completed, did not recommend further power sector organization
studies. Subsequently, the Bank and EGAT agreed that organization and
coordination were no longer a significant problem and cancelled the study.
2.3      Loan negotiations took place in Washington from April 21 to 25, 1980.
The Bank's requirements were agreed to with the following modifications:
(a) The Bank and PEA ;iould endeavor to obtain a grant to fund the study
31  In addition to the ministries involved and the three electrical
utilities, eight government agencies had a voice in some aspect or
another of the electric power sector.

of PEA's operations; if successful, an amount of US$0.3 million of
the loen would be reallocated to another eligible categorv;
(b) The loan agreement would not include a design standard covenant; it
would be left to supervision missions to deal with this matter;
(c)  The loan agreement would not include a load promotion covenant.
Continuation of the load promotion program and its financing would be
taken up with the Bank on completion in December 1982 of the pilot
promotion program then being carried out under ARE I, Loan 1527-TH;
(d) The Bank would consider a sector loan for PEA to assist in financing
a time slice of its capital expenditure program; and
(e) The rate of return requirements of the sector would be the same as
those agreed to under EGAT's MAE Moh Lignite Project Loan 1852-TH.
Project Description
2.4      The project which was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on
June 12, 1980 formed a part of PEA's overall rural electrification program for
electrifying 34,800 villages during FY80-86. The project's share covered the
1980-85 period and had the objective of electrifying 7,878 villages in 27
provinces: 16 in the South, 5 in the North, 2 in the East, and 4 in the
Central Region of Thailand. The total number of households, connected under
the project was expected to be about one million covering an overall
population of about six million. The project included:
(a) construction of about 15,000 km of primary lines and about 16,600 km
of secondary lines;
(b) installation of about 10,750 distribution transformers, about one
million kWh meters and about 10,500 km of street lighting;
(c) supply of tools, implements, equipment and vehicles for construction,
installation and servicing;
(d) a feasibility study, detailed engineering and construction of two or
more mini-hydro pilot projects; and
(e)  consultancy services for a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand
and a study of PEA's operations development.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-tip
3.1      The loan was approved on June 12, 1980 and signed on November 14,
1980, but it did not become effective until August 20, 1981, because of cross-
effectiveness with the loan from the Saudi Fund for Development. Project
start-up was consequently delayed by nine months, from the October 1980 date
planned at project appraisal to Julv 1981 when work started in the first nine
provinces.



- 5 -
3.2      On December 30, 1980 the governments of Thailand and Norway signed an
agreement under which Norway would provide a grant to finance the foreign
exchange costs of the Mini-Hydro Pilot Project. In accordance with the
agreement the project was to identify two small hydropower schemes in the
northern part of Thailand suitable for immediate implementation. Norwegian
consultants were appointed to carry out all phases of the project. Funding of
the study of PEA's operations development was made available in May 1983 by a
grant from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. As agreed during
loan negotiations, the funds included in the project for this study were
reallocated to other disbursement categories of the Loan Agreement.
Changes in Project Scope
3.3      l)ut of the original list of 7878 villages to be electrified 2,026
were covered under the normal village electrification program. However, 800
villages were added to the list leaving a net total of 6,652 villages to be
electrified under the project. The Bank agreed to this change by telex on
June 20, 1986, and at that time loan closing was extended by a year to
June 30, 1987. Table 3.1 below summarizes the village electrification project
scope as originally planned, the actual accomplishment up to the end of FY1987
and the total target to be achieved on completion of the project in FY1989.
The "Job equivalent" item in the table refers to work which had to be carried
out under the project when PEA ran short of funds during 1982/83 and could not
finance all of its 70Z share of the normal contribution program (para.
1.2(a)).  This practice was continued and by the end of FY1987 the number of
such jobs carried out in the project area was calculated to be equivalent to
electrifying 438 villages.

Implementation Arrangements and Performances
3.4      Responsibility for construction was assigned to the regional offices



-6-
rather than the Office or Rural Electrification (ORE) as had been the case
with the ARE I project. PEA felt that this arrangement would ease some of its
internal management problems and at the same time keep ORE in the picture
since it was to retain overall responsibility for planning and logtstics.
3.5      The basic work unit for implementing village electrification projects
was the standard construction crew (SCC) which consists of a pole setting
gang, a line stringing gang and a meter connection (including transformer
installation) gang along with their respective foremen. The SCC is under the
overall direction of a field engineer who reports to the project engineer, or
as in this case, the regional engineer. Implementation in the first nine
project provinces got underway in July 1981 with the mobilization of 18
construction crews. A year later, an additional 18 crews were mobilized for
nine more project provinces, and in July 1983, 18 more crews were assigned to
the remaining nine project provinces. Some pole setting was assigned to
private contractors using local labor. This practice proved to be
satisfactory and cost effective.
3.6      Implementation during the entire five-year planned project duration
period was extremely slow. It can be seen from Annex 1 that during the
FY1981-85 period oaly 2,078 project villages were electrified compared to the
7,878 planned. During the same five years 15,785 villages were electrified
under other programs. This amount, however, also fell short of the slightly
more than 5,000 villages per year which were to be electrified from 1980-86
under the overall accelerated electrification program. The conclusion can be
drawn that the accelerated village electrification program was overly
ambitious considering PEA's resources and capabilities at that time and that
the ARE-2 project was assigned a relatively low priority. The main obstacles
to timely implementation, especially with respect to the ARE-2 project, appear
to have been:
(a) lack of a sufficiently large and well trained workforce at all
levels to man both the project and meet PEA's other electrification
commitments;
(b)  poor procurement planning and stores management causing long delays
because of shortages and diversion of material and equipment to
other programs considered to have a higher priority;
(c) inadequate construction equipment and vehicles for the reasons cited
under (b) above; and
(d) shunting of construction crews to other tasks considered to be of
greater importance.
3.7      At the end of FY1987 about US$46 million worth of material and
equipment purchased for the project had not been used. It was planned to use
these items and local funds still available to continue work on the project
and meet the targets shown in Table 3.1.
3.8      The Mini-Hydro Pilot Project comprised the following phases carried
out by Norwegian consultants and suppliers in cooperation with PEA's Office of
Rural Electrification:



- 7 -
(a) A reconnaissance study of a number of identified projects;
(b) Feasibility studies of two selected projects;
(c) Detailed design, preparation of bidding documents and award of
contracts for civil works; and
(d) Supply of equipment, construction and commissioning.
The two projects selected for construction were located at Mae Tian, a run-of-
river scheme capable of a firm power delivery of 400 kW and at Mae Chai also a
run-of-river scheme capable of providing 310 kW of firm power.  Construction
at Mae Tian starte'  in August 1983 and at Mae Chai in May 1984.  Both plants
were completed and commissioned in January 1985 and have operated
satisfactorily since then.
Environmental Effects
3.9      The pro4ect poses no significant threat to the environment.  Power
lines have been mostly strung along roads and highways in accordance with
accepted codes and practices. When cross-country runs have been necessary,
compensation was provided for any unavoidable crop damage. PEA reports that
the local people are eager to receive electric power, are cooperative in all
respects and have made no unreasonable demands for compensation. The min;-
hydro plants being of the run-of-river type do not incorporate a dam. and
consequently there is no basin flooding or other environmental and ecological
considerations normally associated with storage type hydroelectric power
installations.
Studies Conducted Under the Project
3.10     The following studies were included in the projects
(a)  The study of PEA's operations development was combined with the
similarly oriented study for strengthening PEA's operations included
in the Provincial Power Distribution Project partly financed by Loan
2312-TH. Merging of the two studies was arranged after the
Australian government through its agency, the Australian Development
Assistance Bureau (ADAB) agreed in December 1983 to provide a grant
to cover the foreign exchange costs. A team of Australian
consultants completed the inception phase of the study in March 1984
and began the evaluation and implementation phase during the
following month. The executive summary and six volumes of
specialists reports dealing with: (i) strategic planning;
(ii) project planning and implementation; (iii) materials management;
(iv) distribution system planning; (v) electronic data processing;
and (vi) training (manpower development) were issued during the
October-November 1984 period. ADAB subsequently granted additional
funding for consultants' implementation assistance. The
recommendations of the study implemented so far have produced a
marked improvement in PEA's operations. In line with the
recommendations of the study, PEA recently instituted a change in its
organizational structure (see para. 6.1) which should prove effective
in dealing with the changing nature of its operations.



(b) The study of prospective mini-hydro schemes has undergone a lengthy
delay in selecting the responsible agency. The National Economic and
Social Development Board (NESDB) finally authorized the National
Energy Administration (NEA) to produce a master plan for developing
mini-hydroelectric schemes throughout Thailand. When completed,
NESDB will review the plan and decide the implementation steps to be
taken jointly by NEA and PEA.
Load Promotior.
3.11     The pilot credit scheme included in the project was discontinued
after October 31, 1982; it was not found sufficiently encouraging to undertake
a full scale program. A total of 2.8 million baht was disbursed to 1,717
borrowers representing 13Z of the households in the 80 villages taking part in
the pilot scheme.
3.12     In 1983 the primary load promotion role was transferred from ORE to
the PEA provincial and regional offices. ORE retained responsibility for the
preparation of advertising, leaflets, audiovisual and other promotional
material. PEA provincial and regional staff worked with provincial officials
in bringing promotional material to villages being electrified and in
explaining and demonstrating the use and advantages of electricity in the
household and for agricultural and other applications. The promotion of
electricity to replace diesel powered equipment, especially rice mills, has
had only limited success; mainly because the villagers require time to decide
on making what to them is a sizeable  apital investment.  On the other hand,
no promotion is required for bringing electricity to the rapidly increasing
number of shrimp farms which by 1987 comprised over 2,200 with each having
monthly electricity bills in the 50,000 to 60,000 baht range.
Reporting
3.13     PEA forwarded to the Bank quarterly progress reports which were
useful in monitoring the progress of the project. PEA also forwarded a
project completion report which formed the basis for the preparation of this
report. Except for occasional delays for translation, audited accounts were
normally received on time.
Procurement
3.14     All equipment and material including concrete poles financed by the
Bank were procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. A preference of 15Z of the
c.i.f. price of imported items or the prevailing customs duty, whichever was
lower, was extended to local manufacturers. Procurement proceeded normally
except for four procurement disputes centering on the qualification of a
bidder or its bid. Resolution of these problems caused considerable time
loss. It illustrates the importance of preparing straightforward unambiguous
procurement documents which clearly state the qualifications needed by a
bidder to submit a bid and the technical specifications and bid evaluation
criteria to determine the lowest evaluated bid.

Proiect Cost
3.15     The following Table 3.2 gives a comparison of the actual costs
incurred on the project with the SAR estimate. Actual project expenditures
(and the estimated amount required to electrify the remaining project
villages) were approximately 96Z of the amount estimated. The actual project
installed was at some variance with the one envisaged during project
appraisal, and consequently an across-the-board comparison of costs is not
strictly valid. Nevertheless, except for the overestimate of taxes and
duties, it can be concluded that the SAR estimate is in satisfactory agreement
with the actual costs.  A more detailed cost comparison appears in Annex 2.

Disbursement
3.17     The actual financing shown in Table 3.3 above also represents the
actual disbursements from the respective loans and the Norway grant.  Annex 3
presents the estimated biannual disbursements of the Bank loan compared to the
actual disbursements. The comparison shows that disbursements started a full
year later than the appraisal forecast mainly due to the delayed effectiveness
of the Bank loan and other initial delays, previously cited (para. 3.1), which
slowed down procurement and other start-up activities. Once underway,
disbursements developed essentially at the rate which had been expected at
project appraisal except that it took a year to disburse the last one percent
or so of the loan. This was mainly due to rate of exchange fluctuations which
made available additional funds for disbursement against eligible
expenditures. Loan closing was extended once by one year to June 30, 1987.
The loan was fully disbursed on December 15, 1987. The loan reallocations are
shown in the following table.

Performance of Consultants, Suppliers, and Contractors
3.18     All consultants, contractors and suppliers participating in the
project performed their assignments satisfactorily. PEA's experiment of
hiring local contractors to set concrete poles was successful.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1      Allowing for the rapid expansion of its distribution network. it can
be concluded that PEA's customers in the project area are receiving adequate
service. Voltage at the end of distribution lines is reported to be generally
no lower than 210 volts, an 8.7Z drop from the nominal 230 supply volt. Since
appliance ratings are normally 220 volts, customers should not have low
voltage problems. Power outage statistics were not available for the project
villages, but PEA reckons that these outages are not too different from those
experienced by the whole distribution system. During 1987 the system power
outage rate was 52 minutes per circuit-km, 30Z higher than the previous year.
Tg,is highlights a problem area PEA will have to deal with soon, mainly by
assigning a high priority to the maintenance and reinforcement of its
distribution network.
4.2      Annex 7 gives PEA's annual operating statistics covering FY1980
through FY1987. The data shows that PEA's operations have been satisfactory
over this period. The number of consumers per employee has consistently
increased from 140 in FY1981 to 208 in FY1987. Over the same years annual
energy sales per employee increased at a slightly lower rate from 320 HWh to
449 HWh. Annual sales per consumer remained constant in the 2,000 to 2,100
kWh range indicating that the use of electricity by consumers in the villages
PEA has been supplying with electricity is on average fairly uniform and that
increased demand on the part of consumers already connected has not grown to
the extent that the sales per consumer rate is affected.

4.3      By the end of FY1987 the project had brought electricity to abo.t 0.5
million households, half of the 1.0 million households programmed to be
electrified two years earlier (by FY1985), when the project was appraised.
The difference is due to the fact that only 77Z of the 7,878 project villages
were connected by FY1987 (para. 3.3) and that only 67Z of the households were
electrified instead of the projected 84.4Z. The 1.0 million household target
is now expected to be reached during 1992 when the balance of the project
villages will have been electrified and additional households will have been
connected in the villages already supplied with electricity.
4.4      Table 4.1 below gives PEA's actual and estimated energy sales in the
project area during FY1981 through FY1987.

It can be seen that by the end of FY1987 actual energy sales in the project
villages had reached 346 GWh; peak power demand was 165 MW and the load factor
242. The corresponding SAR forecast called for sales of 420 GWh with a peak
power demand of 210 MW and a 22Z load factor. The shortfall in actual sales
is essentially in line with the protracted electrification of the project
villages. However, it is interesting to note that residential sales grew at a
significantly high rate than the SAR had projected and that the other sales
were well below projections. This fact would indicate that rather than
residential sales a greater effort is needed to promote the use of electricity
for power tools and to replace diesel-powered equipment with electrical units.
4.5      PEA projects that by the year 2015 (25 years after project
completion) energy demand in its area will rise to 2,332 GWh (gross) with a
peak power demand of 620 MW and a 432 load factor, based on an annual growth
rate of 7.3? and 52 for energy sales and power demand respectively. This is
substantially greater than the 1,284 GWh energy demand, 350 MW power demand



- 13 -
and 422 load factor for the 25th year after project completion projected by
the SAR. The PEA energy sales projections may not be overly optimistic in
view of the rapid economic upturn following FY1987 when demand growth rates in
the PEA system reached levels as high as 182.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.1      PEA's financial performance, comparing accual results with project
appraisal forecasts for the period FY1981 to FY19S7 is given in Annex 6 and
summarized in the following Table 5.1. For the last three years (FY 1985-87)
PEA's rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation ranged between
3.3Z to 6.42, normally not considered to be a particularly poor performance
for a utility like PEA which principally serves rural areas and secondary
towns. However, as a result of increasing interest payments and foreign
exchange losses, PEA experienced net operating losses and a growing
debt/equity ratio which for the first time exceeded the Bank's debt limit
covenant (1.5 times capital and surplus) in FY 1987. To reverse this trend
and provide PEA with financial flexibility for current operations and future
growth, the Government will have to help PEA reduce its debt/equity ratio by:
(i) direct infusion of capital, 'ii) provisions to enable PEA increase its net
income, or (iii) a combination of the two. Increased operating income could
be accomplished by either raising PEA's revenues through tariff level or
structural adjustments or reducing the electricity rate paid to EGAT.
5.2      PEA's energy sales increased from 4,696 GWh in FY1980 to 10,944 GWh
in FY1987 at an average annual rate of 12.9Z. The SAR forecast predicted that
sales would increase at a 15.62 rate to 14,054 GWh by FU1987. Tariff
increases in FY1980 and FY1981 (54Z and 112 respectively) undoubtedly
encouraged conservation and inhibited sales to some extent; however, the sales
shortfall would seem to have been due mainly to the overestimate of the number
of villages electrified. Revenues from operations increased from B 5.278
billion in FY1980 to B 18,806 million in FY1987. However, operating costs
increased in tandem, especially the cost of power purchased from EGAT which in
FY1987 accounted for 732 of total operating expenses including depreciation.
The result has been that PEA has incurred an operating loss every year since
FY1984. The rate of return on net revalued fixed assets in service from
FY1984 onward has been in the 3.52 to 4.62 range except for FY1987 when it
rose to 6.42 reflecting the sharp 17.62 increase in energy sales for that
year.  Debt increased every year during the FY1980 to FY1987 period caus!ng
the debt-equity ratio to rise from 36:64 to 61:39 (1.56).
Financial Covenants
5.3      The pertinent financial covenants of the Loan Agreement are discussed
below; compliance with loan covenants is reviewed fully in Annex 5.
(a) Section 5.04: requires PEA to earn on its net revalued fixed assets
annual rates of return consistent with the government's obligation
set forth in Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement, namely a rate



- 14 -
of return for t"e sector of not less than 2Z in FYl9O1 and not less
than 82 in FY1982 and every fiscal year thereafter. These covenants
have been complied with fullv for the sector as a whole.
(b) Section 5.05: requires PEA not incur any further debt if after
incurring such debt its debt then outstanding is greater than 1.5
times its capital and surplus.  For FY1987 PEA's debt to total
capitalization ratio reached 1.56.  It currently continues to exceed
the stipulated 1.5 maximum and further borrowing by PEA must now be
reviewed iy the Bank.
(c)  Section 5.06:  requires that PEA not incur short or medium-term debt
if such debt exceeds 1OZ of all debt.  This type of debt represented
only 2.92 of total indebtedness in FY1987 which was typical of its
short and medium-term borrowing so far.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.1      The new organizational alignment shown in PEA's latest organization
chart (Annex 4) was approved by the Board of Directors on September 1, 1987.
It can be noted immediately that the executive title "General Manager" has
been replaced by 'Governor'. However, the more significant change is the
addition of two new lines of command, Planning and Development and Economics
and Finance, to the original three 4/ which remain in place except for the
transfer of departments incorporated in the two new lines. ORE, which is
responsible for the Accelerated Rural Electrification Program and the mini-
hydro projects and has had the status of a department since 1979 now reports
to the Deputy Governor of Planning and Development instead of Technique, as it
did before the reorganization.
6.2      The FY1980-86 period saw PEA's activities expand more rapidly than at
any time in its existence since 1960. Despite severe initial implementation
problems, PEA coped effectively with these challenging times and in the
process developed into a well managed competent electric utility. A total of
26,313 villages were electrified during the seven years, almost twice the
number in the previous 20 years (Annex 1). To keep pace with this rapid
expansion which added 5,576 electrified villages in FY1987 alone, PEA added
408 offices (from 927 to 1,335) and increased the number of employees by
10,093 (from 14,310 to 24,403) over the seven years period. Although this
addition to the size of the work force appears large it can be seen from Annex
5 that PEA is nevertheless making satisfactory progress in improving its
productivity.
6.3      In FY1985 PEA adopted corporate strategic planning as a management
tool to enhance performance in the management and administration of its
corporate activities and in carrying out its electrification mandate. The
Bank views this development, along with the reorganization discussed above, as
an important step by PEA in preparing to deal effectively with the transition
from a construction to an essentially service oriented organization. The
4/ Administration, Operations and Technique.

corporate strategic plans set by PEA comprise specific goals for nine
functional areas (such as operations and maintenance, finance and accounts,
personnel management, etc). In essence these plans reflect PEA's long-term
goals and strategies in the framework of government policies and priorities
and sector objectives. Some noteable results have been achieved in recent
yearss
(a) Improved billing and collection procedures have reduced the unpaid
bills problem except for unpaid bills amounting to B960 million still
owed by various government agencies and enterprises, an inssue which
needs to be addressed in the future;
(b) The training program is providing the skills and expertise needed for
PEA's operations;
(c)  The implementation of materials handling and inventory control has
alleviated shortages which are no longer a major cause of long
construction delays; and
(d) The information and electronic data processing systems being
developed have produced tangible benefits through increased
productivity and improved budget and cost control.
6.4      PEA has made satisfactory progress with its training effort which has
greatly increased in scope and importance over the past seven years. In
FY1987, 6,476 employees (over twice the number in FY1980) received training to
develop skills, ranging from the crafts to engineering and financial
disciplines, essential for the effective functioning of an electric utility.
Seminars and special courses at home and abroad are made available to seninr
level employees to enhance their managerial end technical skills and keep
abreast of developments related to the electric utility industry.  A program
of student sponsorship for study in foreign universities has given this
opportunity to an average of 44 students per year since FY1980. The program
is an important element in bringing new talents and ideas into the PEA
organization.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Village Monitoring System
7.1      As part of the project, ORE established a monitoring syatem to
evaluate the effect and impact of electrification in the project villages.
Customer and energy consumption data were collected from billing center
records. Pertinent socioeconomic data were obtained from each village by four
surveys covering (i) the villages, (ii) the households, (iii) the private
establishments (businesses), and (iv) the public buildings. All data were
collected on special monitoring cards for future collation and evaluation.
The economic reevaluation of the project is based on updated assumptions and
criteria derived from these data.



1 26 -
Internal Economic Rate of Return from Village Electrification
7.2      In round numbers the re-evaluated internal economic rate of return
(IERR) was 132 slightly lower than the 152 value calculated in the SAR.
7.3      The SAR evaluated the IERR as the discount rate which makes the
present economic costs equal to the present worth of the direct and indirect
benefits attributable to the project over its 30 years life span. Capital
*        costs included estimated project investments during the project implementation
period and the future investments required for additional primary and
secondary lines, transformers and services to new customers during the ensuing
years to 2010 AD. Annex 15 in the SAR gives the criteria and assumptions used
for the appraisal IERR calculation.
7.4      A similar approach was used in calculating the present IERR except
that cost and benefit data were revised to reflect the findings of the village
monitoring program as well as recent case studies of the different categories
of customers. Annex 8 compares the indirect benefits assumed in the staff
appraisal report with the present updated values. The basic criteria and the
derivation of costs and benefits now used in computing the IERR are presented
in Annex 9. Annex 10 shows the cost and benefit streams in constant FY1986
bahts.
7.5      The lower IERR presently calculated is mainly due to the fact that
the quantifiable indirect benefits are only about 74Z of the value which tiad
been estimated at project appraisal. The magnitude of the smaller then
estimated number of actual customers in FY1987 is illustrated in Table 7.1
below. This shortfall not only directly affected the value of the accrued
benefits for tne FY1980-87 period, but also the projected values which started
from the smaller FY1987 base. Direct benefits were higher than the appraisal
estimate because of higher energy consumption and tariff rates and partly
offset the effect of the reduced indirect benefits.

ACTUAL CUSTOMERS IN FY1987

Internal Economic Rate of Return from Mini-Hydro Plants
7.6      The IERR for the Mae Tian mini-hydro plant is 0.1? and for the Mae
Chai plant 5.3Z.



- 17 -
7.7      The cost and benefit streams used in calculating these IERR's appear
in Annexes 11 and 12. Capital cosas net of taxes and duties were converted to
constant 1986 bahts using Thailand's fixed capital formation deflation
factors. Both mini-hydro plants are connected to EGAT's grid and serve to
substitute electricity which would otherwise be purchased from EGAT. The
benefits of the mini-hydro projects are calculated as the difference in the
cost of electricity with and without the respective mini-hydro plant.
VIII. PERFORMANCE AND ROLE OF THE BANK
8.1      For some years the Bank's lending policy in Thailand has emphasized
assisting the Government's effort to reach the poorer segment of its
population. The role of the Bank in Thailand's rural electrification program
has been an important part in support of government endeavors to benefit the
rural poor.
8.2      The Bank's association with PEA goes back to the preparation of the
first accelerated rural electrification project (Loan 1527-TH). Since then
PEA has developed into a full-fledged electric power distribution utility.
Throughout this period, the Bank played an important supportive role including
the supply of funds, advice and assistance e-ential to the technical and
institutional development of PEA.  The Pro>_ .ial Power Distribution Project
(Loan 2312-TH) continues to aupport further electrification and instituttonal
development.
8.3      A major aim of the Bark's lending program in the electric power
sector has been the establishment of a rationalized tariff structure which
would generate sufficient revenues to enable EGAT, MEA and PEA to finance a
reasonable portion of their construction expenditure. This effort has been
successful to the extent that tariff adjustments have produced for the sector
as a whole the rate of return on revalued fixed assets required by financial
covenants in Bank Loan agreements. PEA's finances have not yet benefitted as
much as desired from past tariff adjustments, but the Government's awarness of
this issue should lead to a more equitable tariff arrangement.
8.4      A cooperative working relationship was maintained by Bank staff with
PEA and Government officials throughout the project cycle. PEA confirmed that
complying with Bank procedures and requirements created no problems of any
serious consequence in carrying out the project. Bank staff undertook eight
supervision missions between February 1981 and December 1987. These missions
along with the progress reports submitted by NPC were adequate for the
effective supervision of the project.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1      The accelerated rural electrification program set for the 1980-86
time span included the project villages and aimed at tripling the previous
rate of village electrificatio-i. This was clearly a much too ambitious
undertaking for PEA's limited human and physical resources at the time.

Nevertheless, PEA must be given credit for overcoming the ensuing project
implementation difficulties, although with some loss of efficiency, and
completing 762 of the program (over 26,000 villages) in the specified time
period. Taking these points into consid3ration, it can be concluded that the
Bank's objectives in participating in the project were largely mets
(a)  The project produces revenues for the electric power sector and
quantifiable indirect benefits to villages in the form of fuel cost
savings, increased productivity of cottage industries and generally
through the use of power tools, and savings in operating costs of all
types of motive power.
(c) In line with its lending policy, Bank funds contributed to a program
which brought electricity and the accompanying social and economic
benefits to a large number of the rural poor;
(d) Operational studies included in this and the follow-up Bank project
(Ln. 2312-TI) have been instrumental in PEA's improved operating
performance and overall institutional development; and
(e) Financial covenants associated with Bank lending to the power sector
have produced power tariffs which bring satisfactory financial rates
of return to the sector.
9.2      To restore PEA to a sound financial position, the Government will
have to help reduce its debt/equity ratio by direct infusion of capital, by
enabling an increase in its net income or by a combination of the two.
Increased operating income can be accomplished by either raising PEA's
revenues through tariff level or structural adjustments or reducing the
electricity rate paid to EGAT.
9.3      PEA encountered some lengthy construction delays because of
procurement problems with Bank financed goods and because of contracts being
awarded to suppliers who could not meet delivery and quality commitments.
These problems are typical of those experienced by other borrowers and
illustrate the importance of taking extra special care in the preparation of
bidding documents, particularly with regard to:
(a) unambiguous bidding instructions and criteria for evaluating bids;
(b) clear comprehensive qualification standards for selecting suppliers
eligible to submit bids; and
(c) strict technical specifications to ensure that technical and quality
requirements will be met.
9.4      Careful evaluation of the economical viability of mini-hydro plants
is required before embarking on such ventures. The two included in the
project and financed by a grant from Norway are not justified 5/ based on the
value of electricity which is generated and does not have to be purchased from
5/ IERR for the Mae Chai plant = 5.32 and the Mae Tian plant - 0.12

EGAT. The Borrower notes in this regard that the economic evaluation of the
mini-hdro project is quite low because it was a pilot operation and the
capital cost covered training, survey, design, construction supervision and
installation.
9.5 The main lessons learned from the project can be briefly summarized as
fol.lows:
(a) A useful role for the Bank would be to help inexperienced borrowers
(or beneficiaries) plan and prepare large-scale undertakings such as
PEA's accelerated rural electrification program;
(b) The Bank should help minimize costly time losses caused by
procurement disputes by insisting on the preparation of comprehensive
and unambiguous procurement documents, especially with respect to the
bidders' required qualification and the technical and operating
requirements of the goods and services being procured; and
(c) Before embarking on a mini-hydro project, the economic costs and
benefits involved should be carefully annlyzed.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Quantifiable Indirect Benefits
1.        For the economic reevaluation quantifiable indirect benefits
attributable to the project were derived by using the methodology in the SAR
along with appropriately updated cost and benefit data.  The principal sources
of these benefits -re:
(a)  Residential households:  cost savings compared to lighting and
cooking fuels, increased productivity and handicraft activity;
(b) Commercial shops: cost savings compared to lighting fuel; increased
profits due to refrigeration and other electrical appliances;
(c) Rice mills: cost savings from diesel engines replaced by electric
motors, Annual maintenance, capital recovery costs and improved rice
recovery;
(d)  Power tools:  cost savings in labor and increased productivity;
(e) Potable water pumps: cost savings compared to manually hauling
water buckets; and
(f) Agricultural pumps: Cost saving from the use of electric motors
compared to diesel engines.
2.        The quantifiable indirect benefits determined in the SAR compare to

Benefits and Costs
Benefits
2.        Direct benefits were calculated by multiplying average tariffs
(excluding taxes) by energy sales in the residential, commercial and
agricultural sectors adjusted for connection charges. For fiscal years 1981
to 1987 average tariffs were computed based on the actual prices charged to
each of PEA's customer groups.  The nominal tariffs were converted to 1986
prices by applying the CDP deflator. Residential rates were applied to
residences, commercial shops, power tools and portable water pumps; small
business rates were applied to rice mills and agricultural pumps. The average
future rates were assumed to remain constant at the FY 1987 level.
Connection Fee (Baht per customer)
Residential                     450
Shops                           700
Rice mill                     8,850
Agricultural pumps           10,500
CDP Deflator
1981                         0.8908

1987                          1.000
Tax deduction was applied at the rate of 0.00025 Baht per kWH to direct energy
sales.
3.        Indirect benefits were derived from case studies by PEA as follows:
Residential                       349 Baht/household/year
Shops                           1,514 Baht/shop/year
Rice mills                     17,643 Baht/unit/year
Power tools                     3,710 Baht/unit/year
Potable pumps                     931 Baht/unit/year

Costs
4.        For the fiscal years 1981-1987 actual costs were used after
converting them to 1986 prices for applying the fixed capital inflation factor
to public investments.
Capital Costs (million Baht)
1980                               -
1981                              4.277
1982                            362.934
1983                            814.919
1984                          1,736.126
1985                          1,356.802
1986                          1,211.274

1983                              0.8650
1984                              0.8663
1985                              0.9362
1986                              1.000
1987                              1.0679
5.        For the fiscal years 1988-2014 the investment costs are assumed to
be the same as those estimated at appraisal. The operating costs (other than
energy purchased and energy generated) are assumed to be 0.751 of the current
value of the distribution system. The maintenance costs are based on the
following schedule:
Kaintenance costs as a
percentage of the current
Year                 value of the distribution system
1 - 10                           0.50
11 - 15                           0.625
16 - 19                           0.75
20                             0.875
21 - 30                           1.000
6.        General administration and customer accounting costs are assumed to
average Baht 20 per customer.

7.        Energy costs for the fiscal year 1981-1987 were calculated based on
the actual rate paid to ECAT for net energy (adjusted for transmission losses)
as follows:
Year                           Rate (Baht per kWH)
1981                               1.1529
1982                               1.2745
1983                               1.2437
1984                               1.2230
1985                               1.2195
1986                               1.2:93
1987                               1.1545
These rates were converted to 1986 prices by applying the CDP deflator factor
(para. 2). For the remaining life of the project, the average cost of
purchased energy is estimated to be Baht 1.0399 per kWH.
8.        The following tax deductions were applied to the individual items of
the cost stream:
Cost stream                       Sub-item                      Tax deduction (Z)
