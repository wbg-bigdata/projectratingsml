SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal indigenous sources of energy in Thailand are hydro-
power, limited petroleum, lignite, large but as yet uneconomic oil shale
deposits, wood fuel, charcoal, paddy husk and bagasse. No geothermal energy
exists in the country.
Hydro Potential
1.02      Hydro potential (excluding that of two international rivers, the
Mekong and the Salween) is estimated at about 9,300 MW of which 910 MW are
now in operation; 2,200 MW in nine projects are under construction or
programmed for implementation before 1990; 870 MW in 15 projects are in the
prefeasibility or feasibility study stage and about 1,900 MW in 12 projects
have been selected by EGAT for conceptual studies. Ninety-three major
sites with a potential of about 3,420 MW have been preliminarily assessed by
the National Energy Administration (NEA); NEA has also identified about
500 mini-hydro sites.
1.03      The Mekong river, which forms the border between Thailand and Laos
and then flows through Kampuchea and Viet Nam, and the Salween river in
Burma, together have a total hydro potential in nine projects of about
24,000 MW with an annual energy output of 144,000 GWh. This would be equal
to 11 times Thailand's electricity consumption in 1979 and 3.5 times the
consumption forecast for 1990. The Mekong's development is governed jointly
by Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand and Viet Nam and construction cannot begin
until the current political problems in the region have been resolved.
Substantial resettlement problems will arise from the development of the
first major hydro site at Pa Mong on the Mekong, about 60 km west of
Vietianne where the river forms the border between Laos and Thailand. Apart
from the immense energy benefits from the project, very substantial flood
protection and irrigation benefits will accrue particularly in Kampuchea and
Viet Nam.
1.04      The Salween's development is dependent on Burmese cooperation and
Thailand has approached the Burmese Government several times without success.



-2-
Oil
1.05      Thailand's proven petroleum reserves total about 1.1 million
barrels in the Fang province of Northern Thailand. Production at present is
less than 100,000 barrels a year, less than 0.2% of total domestic
consumption. Intensive exploration is currently being undertaken in the
northeast region of the country and offshore in the Gulf of Thailand where
natural gas has already been found (see para. 1.08). There are extensive
oil shale reserves (about 2,500 million mt), mainly in the remote areas of
Tak province but oil production from shale is still uneconomic.
1.06      Thailand has large areas of sugar plantations and has initiated
studies of the feasibility of making gasohol by using the alcohol that can
be produced from sugar cane. The studies are at an early stage but will be
followed with interest by the Bank.
Coal
1.07      Lignite (low-grade coal) reserves are currently estimated at around
770 million mt located at Mae Moh (650 million mt), Krabi (100 million mt),
and Li (20 million mt). Of these, 175 million mt are proven reserves that can
be economically exploited, and the remainder require further investigation.
The quantity that is economically exploitable is a variable dependent on
alternative fuel prices but it is expected that a total generating capacity of
about 1,500 ]lW would ^e developed at Mae Moh in northern Thailand during the
1980s. EGAT is constvucting units 4 and 5 of 150 MW each at Mae Moh (150 MW
are currently installed) which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is helping
finance and the Bank is processing a loan of US$72 million for the
complementary lignite development.
Natural Gas
1.08      Two promising gas fields have been discovered in the Gulf:
structure "A", about 425 km offshore, has been delineated by the Union
Group; and structure "B", about 595 km offshore is being delineated by the
Texas Pacific Group. The proven reserves of these two fields are 1.6
trillion cubic feet (tcf) of good quality gas and 1.3 tcf of lower quality
gas. Probable gas reserves are estimated at an additional 4.7 tcf.
The concessionnaires will undertake the development of these reserves, and
the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) will take delivery at the off-
shore production platforms. In the initial years much of the gas output
will be contracted to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT), while a small portion will be available to industries along the
onshore pipeline route. The Bank made a loan of US$107 million (Loan
1773-TH) to PTT in February 1980 for the first phase of development of the
pipeline which by 1982 will carry the natural gas to the Bang Pakong power
station, currently under construction about 60 km southeast of Bangkok, and
to the Bangkok metropolitan area. The substitution of natural gas for
imported oil would reduce the demand of fuel oil for power generation.



- 3 -
1.09      Sponge iron smelting and petro-chemical plants are in the
feasibility study stage with a view to using the natural gas more economically
than for power generation. However, it is anticipated that substantial quan-
tities of gas will always be available for power plants. A gas utilization
study is being undertaken to determine the extent of industrial usage of
natural gas.
Energy Consumption
1.10      Total energy consumption in the FY70-78 period increased from about
7.4 million tons of oil equivalent (77.2 trillion kcal) to 14.4 million tons
(150.2 trillion kcal), an average annual growth rate of 9.0%.
1.11      Energy consumption by types in FY78 /1 is shown below:
Energy consumption (in trillion kcal) Percent
Petroleum products                         106.1                        70.6

/1 Data for FY79 are not yet available.
1.12      An energy study is being undertaken by NEA, financed by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), with ADB as the executing agency. The
objectives of the study are to define a program to meet Thailand's energy
requirements up to the year 2000. The study is expected to be concluded by
end 1981.
Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.13      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1.4% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 21.3% and 1.6% of GDP respectively.
1.14      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Thailand's
economic development. Between FY75 and 78, when GDP grew at an average
rate of about 6.4% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an
average rate of about 13.8%.



-4-
1.15      Electricity would be the cheapest method of providing lighting and
motive power in rural areas after 1982 when natural gas becomes available
and Thailand has embarked on a program to provide all villages in the
country with electricity by the late 1980s (see para. 1.42).
Sector Organization
General
1.16      The power sector consists of eight government agencies, three
state utilities, the ministries to which they report, and five private
franchises which are so small as to be insignificant (para. 1.22). The
three state utilities supply nearly all of the electricity consumed in the
country, the private franchises and self-generating industries comprised
about 13% of the installed capacity in FY78 (para. 1.36).
1.17      The state-owned utilities are the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Highlights of the EGAT, MEA and PEA
operations are shown in Annex 1.
The Provincial Electricity Authority
1.18      PEA, the proposed borrower, was established in September 1960 as a
wholly-owned Government corporation under the Ministry of Interior with
responsibility for providing and distributing electricity in all provinces
of the country except in the areas served by MEA. PEA purchases most of its
energy in bulk from EGAT but also generates small quantities in areas not
yet connected to the grid. In FY79, PEA purchased 4678 GWh and generated 82
GWh; 4,243 GWh were sold to 1,570,000 consumers. Compared with FY78, GWh
sold and the number of consumers connected increased by 16.2% and 16.3%,
respectively. System losses were about 10.9% in FY79.
1.19      PEA is the Government agency responsible for implementing the accel-
erated rural electrification program (paras. 1.15 and 1.42). The program
only substantially began with Loan 1527-TH made by the Bank to PEA in 1978
for the first major phase which will provide electricity to about 4,560
villages by the end of 1982.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority
1.20      MEA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government corporation
under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for supplying electricity
to the Bangkok Metropolitan area covering the provinces of Bangkok, Thon
Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY79, 7,606 GWh were sold to 678,000
consumers. Compared with FY78, energy sales and number of consumers
increased by 11.7%. All of MEA's power is purchased from EGAT. The Bank
has never been asked to assist MEA, as foreign fund requirements have been
provided by ADB.

The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
1.21      EGAT, which is responsible to the Prime Minister's office, was
established in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government corporation for the purpose
of increasing the efficiency of electricity supply throughout the country and
coordinating the generation and transmission systems. EGAT generated 95% of
all electric energy in Thailand in FY79; the balance was generated by PEA,
NEA, private franchises and self-generating industries.
Private Franchises
1.22      Following the fuel crisis and Government's policy of restricting
tariff increases, most of the franchises asked to be taken over by PEA.
Since FY76, 52 franchises have been purchased leaving four in private hands at
the end of FY79; two of them purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA;
one directly from EGAT; the remaining franchise had an installed capacity of
only 22 kW and generated 17 MWh in FY79.
Government Agencies
1.23      The eight Government agencies which have a direct interest in the
power sector (para. 1.16) are as under:
- Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD);
- Budget Bureau;
- Tariff Rate Committee (TRC);
- National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB);
- Ministry of Finance (MOF);
- National Energy Administration (NEA);
- Foreign Loan Committee (FLC); and
- Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
These agencies review: tariff recommendations, capital project proposals and
budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual financial perform-
ance; and requests for Government equity and loans. None of them has overall
policy responsibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after all the
agencies including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system is
designed to ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly controlled,
but the fiscal emphasis of the approval process has constrained sector deve-
lopment in the past. The interest of PTT in the sector arises from the fact
that EGAT, as the utility responsible for generation, will be the predominant
customer for natural gas and is PTT's largest customer for fuel oil.
Sector Constraints
Power and Energy Sector Coordination
1.24      A sector review in 1976 (Report No. 1794-TH) highlighted the need
for sector coordination. Concern arose from the fact that too many agencies



6
had a part in sector decision-making (the situation still exists) causing
decisions to be reached as a compromise of views (para. 1.23) rather than the
best decision in the interests of the sector and Thailand as a whole.  In
1977, the CPPD was formed at cabinet level to oversee the functioning and
development of the power sector and provide overall control. However, CPPD
has not developed into an operating entity to coordinate planning activities,
review the utilities' development programs and projects, review the adequacy
and structure of tariffs and allocate sector funds among EGAT, MEA and PEA in
an equitable manner, by adjusting MEA and PEA's power purchase price from
EGAT for this purpose. The situation has been exacerbated by Thailand
embarking on the accelerated rural electrification program in 1978 requiring
closer coordination among the utilities.
1.25      A Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology was established in
1979 to assume responsibility for the development of nonconventional energy
and new uses of existing energy sources, but so far, it has played a minor
role in the larger sector issues. It was agreed that a study of power
sector coordination will be carried out by consultants. The consultants will
study the present methods of coordinating and controlling the sector, make
recommendations as to the form of organization required to control and
coordinate the sector in the future, the level of staffing for such a body
and the content of any legislation necessary to establish the controlling
body. Finance for the study is included in the loan for the Khao Laem
hydroelectric project (to be signed shortly). The recommendations arising
from the study would be implemented during 1980/81.
Energy Sector
1.26      The energy study (para. 1.12) being undertaken by NEA is expected to
review the existing institutional framework and organizational arrangements
in the energy sector and recommend any changes as necessary. The Bank will
continue its dialogue on energy sector matters based on these recommendations.
1.27      A brief energy sector review has also been carried out by Bank staff
(Report No. 2813-TH) and will be discussed with RTG during the second half
of 1980.
Tariff Levels and Oil Subsidies
1.28      Tariff levels proved adequate throughout the late 1960s and the
early 1970s, and the financial position of the sector remained strong.
During the sixties and early seventies, the electricity sector enjoyed
substantial economies of scale, shifts to hydro and large steam generation
coupled with rapid increases in demand and numbers of consumers. Tariffs
were reduced from time to time during these years. The fuel crisis and



- 7 -
economic slowdown of 1973/74 necessitated large increases in tariffs but the
political changes in Thailand, which coincided with those developments, left
the country ill-prepared for fully implementing such increases. Tariff
increases took place in 1974 (50%) and 1977 (29%) but were not sufficient
to ensure the financial viability of the sector.
1.29      During the last 15 months there has been a steady decline in the
overall financial position of the sector. Severe droughts in 1977 and 1978
adversely affected the thermal/hydro generation mix; fuel oil prices
increased some 116%. In an attempt to cushion the impact of accelerating
inflation, the Government chose to delay passing through the rising costs of
electricity to consumers. In 1978, prices of petroleum products were
adjusted so that a greater proportion of the oil price increases were borne
by gasoline consumers to the benefit of fuel oil. However, by mid-1979 this
subsidy proved inadequate to cover the increasing costs of fuel oil to EGAT,
and the Government, faced by mounting criticism of its handling of the
economy, introduced direct budgetary subsidies. The Government's attempts
to raise tariffs in November, 1979 by about 56% were thwarted by strong
political opposition and widespread public demonstrations. These tariff
adjustments were required as a condition of effectiveness of the Bang Pakong
thermal power loan (1690-TH), approved in April 1979, and as a condition of
signing the Khao Laem hydropower loan approved in November 1979.
1.30      In an effort to gain political support for the necessary tariff
adjustments, the Government set up a committee in November 1979 in the
National Assembly to study the matter. The committee met through January
1980 but failed to reach a consensus. Nonetheless, the Government decided
that a further postponement of tariff action was unacceptable and raised
tariffs 38% at the retail level on February 1, 1980. About the same time, the
Government announced increases in the prices of gasoline, diesel, kerosene
and cooking gas ranging from 24-51%. These increases were met with
overwhelming opposition in the National Assembly and by the public and the
Government, threatened with a vote of no-confidence, resigned on February
29, 1980.
1.31      The petroleum product prices in effect in February 1980 had
increased the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products to an extent
that would have allowed PTT to put about 20% of its revenues into the oil
compensation fund which was to be used to cross-subsidize the power sector's
fuel and diesel oil consumption. The cross-subsidy was about B 142 million
(US$7 million) per month on average; and about B 182 million (US$9 million)
per month would have been provided to PTT from the national budget to cover
the balance of subsidies required for the power sector's oil costs. Govern-
ment reduced the retail prices of kerosene, diesel and bottled gas in mid-
March 1980 by an average of about 15% reducing in turn the amount available
for the oil compensation fund.



- 8 -
1.32      Government is aware of the need for tariff increases to eliminate
the oil and other subsidies to the sector as soon as possible and to enable
the investment program to continue unhindered by financial constraint. A
plan of action was agreed with Government during negotiations of the Mae Moh
Lignite Project to remove subsidies and restore the sector's financial
viability. The plan provides for budgetary oil subsidies to be removed by
January 1, 1981 (64% increase at the EGAT level) with an additional increase
about April 1, 1981 of about 19%, to yield rates of return of a minimum of
2% and 8% for FY81 and thereafter, respectively for EGAT and the sector as a
whole. PEA and MEA would earn rates of return consistent with the sector
rates of return.
1.33      Funds are transferred from EGAT and MEA to PEA by EGAT charging
PEA a lower price for power than MEA. However, the division of available
sector funds in this manner has proved inequitable as the three utilities
follow separate financial policies, particularly regarding borrowing and
working-capital levels. The proportions of cash generation to capital
expenditure differ substantially. The Government is currently causing CPPD
to review the electricity tariffs charged to consumers at levels sufficient
to produce the agreed annual rate of return and fix the price of bulk supply
that EGAT will charge PEA and MEA to ensure an equitable division of sector
resources to meet the needs of the expansion program of each of the three
utilities.
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.34      The Bank has made one loan of US$25 million to PEA to finance the
first phase of PEA's Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (ARE I). Nine
loans have been made to EGAT and its predecessor totalling $362 million to
help finance power plants and transmission facilities. ARE I is about six
months behind schedule due to delays in the early stages of implementation
but the delay is expected to be temporary and the project should be
completed more or less on time. The first six projects of EGAT have been
completed and are all operating satisfactorily. The Seventh Power Project,
Srinagarind (Ban Chao Nen) Hydroelectric Project, was virtually completed at
the end of February 1980. The implementation of the Eighth Power Project
(Pattani Hydroelectric Project) is on schedule. A loan of US$80 million for
the Ninth Power Project (Loan 1690-TH, Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project)
was signed on August 9, 1979 and is expected to become effective by the
end of May 1980 (as measures for improving the financial position of the
power sector have been agreed under the proposed Mae Moh Lignite Project
scheduled for Board presentation on May 22, 1980).   A loan of US$80
million for the Tenth Power Project (Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project)
was approved by the Board on November 27, 1979, and is expected to be
signed shortly.

1.35      The most recent project performance audit report, made in March
1978 for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH),
indicated that the main objectives of the project had been met and that the
project was completed on time and within the original cost estimate.

Rural Electrification
1.41      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Since 1968 the number of consumers
increased at an annual average rate of 13.5% and the energy sales rose by
21.5% p.a. The proportion of population electrified increased from 9.5% in
1968 to 23% in 1978. PEA expects the rapid growth rate to continue for some
time due to its large village electrification program (para. 1.42) and the
acceleration in conversion of diesel engines to electric power brought about
by increases in fuel prices and shortages of diesel fuel.
1.42      RTG directed PEA to plan an Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program in 1973 and to give priority to the more backward areas. The annual
rate of villages connected rose from 940 in 1974 to 2,980 in 1979. In
accordance with the directive, PEA originally planned to electrify all the
villages (about 49,000) in Thailand in about 25 years but now plans to do so
by the late 1980s. It is expected that by 1982/83 PEA's peak demand will
exceed that of MEA, reflecting the progress made in the provincial areas in
general and in rural electrification in particular.
2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be PEA, a state enterprise.  PEA, which is
organized as a modern public utility and functions with considerable degree
of autonomy, is charged with the distribution of electricity throughout all
the provinces of the country except in the Metropolitan Bangkok area which is
served by MEA. PEA was established in September 1960 under the Provincial
Electricity Act (BE 2503) and reports to the Ministry of Interior. The Act
empowered PEA to generate, purchase and sell electricity in provinces outside
the area of MEA's operations.
2.02      PEA's Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers
and consists of a Chairman (currently the Under-Secretary of State of the
Ministry of Interior) and nine other members who are senior officials of the
Government agencies and departments concerned with power distribution. The
General Manager is also an ex-officio member of the Board as well as the
authority's chief executive (see Annex 2 for the list of Board Members).
2.03      Since its establishment in 1960, PEA has grown rapidly to become
a large, well-operated utility. Due to rapid expansion in recent years
organizational readjustments appear necessary and a review of the
organization structure and delineation of departmental responsibilities is
contemplated (para. 2.05). By the end of FY79, PEA had 12,274 employees and
1,570,556 consumers. The management and staff are able and well-qualified:
869 are university graduates; 1,636 are graduates of technical institutes;
and 4,169 from vocational schools (see Annex 3 for the Organization Chart).



- 12 -
2.04      PEA purchased 95.4% of its power from EGAT in FY79, about 2.9% from
MEA and NEA and generated the balance of 1.7% from 200 diesel plants installed
in areas beyond the reach of EGAT's transmission grid. The number of diesel
plants is falling as PEA follows a deliberate policy of connereing diesel-
supplied distribution systems to the grid to conserve fuel and reduce costs.
Organization and Management
2.05      PEA operates efficiently and its staff is competent.  In recent
years and particularly since embarking on the greatly expanded rural
electrification program, some difficulties have arisen in the areas of
financial policy and planning, system planning, procurement and inventory and
coordination of planning among departments. Given PEA's overall competence,
the surfacing of the problems indicates that an overall review of policies and
the organization structure may be desirable to strengthen and enhance PEA's
ability to meet the challenges of the eighties. Provision is included in the
project (paras. 4.06 and 4.15) for consultants to carry out a study of PEA's
operations development (see Annex 4 for draft terms of reference). The
opportunity would be taken to build an in-house capability to enable PEA to
continually review organization and policies in future to meet changing
circumstances, by attaching counterpart staff to the consultants as they carry
out the work. They would form the basic staff of the PEA unit which would
perform such work in future. The strengthening of PEA's organizational
structure together with its continuing efficiency in operations should lead to
sector type lending in subsequent Bank operations with PEA.
2.06      PEA wishes to obtain a grant to finance this study, if a grant
cannot be obtained, the loan provision (para. 4.15) will be used for this
purpose and the study will begin when the financing decision is made. PEA
and the Banks will exchange views regarding the recommendations of the study
and their implementation.
Training
2.07      PEA operates a training school for lower level staff; higher level
staff have been sent overseas both on academic scholarships and for shorter-
term training with utilities in foreign countries. The training programs
are adequate to cater for all PEA's manpower needs.
Engineering Consultants
2.08      PEA's staff is able to undertake all its normal design and engin-
eering and will carry out the project without the assistance of consultants.
Consultants have been used in the past for supervising and advising on pro-
jects financed by KFW and OECF./1
/1 Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KFW); Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF).



- 13 -
Accounting and Audit
2.09      The accounting system is good and the staff are competent.  Account-
ing, including consumers billing, is carried out at 12 regional accounting
centers in a highly efficient manner. However, PEA's accounting system
differs from those of MEA and EGAT. In order to achieve comparability within
the power sector, the feasibility of standardizing the utilities accounting
systems will be considered under the coordination study (para. 1.25).
2.10      The annual audit of PEA's accounts is performed by the National
Audit Council (NAC) of Thailand, the Government institution responsible for
auditing all state enterprises in the country. The Director of Internal Audit
of the Bank carried out a review of the auditing standards of the Audit
Council of Thailand as applied to PEA. The main recommendation in his
report (June 1979) was to await the FY79 audit report before a judgment on
the adequacy of the audit, would be made; that report has not yet been
received (due by March 31, 1980).
Tariffs
2.11      The PEA Act provides that the Board of Directors has the power and
duty to fix rates for electric energy. In effect, the Cabinet decides on
the tariff adjustments that may be required based on the recommendations of
the Tariff Rate Committee (see para. 1.23).
2.12      The TRC and CPPD (para. 1.23) fix the level of PEA's and MEA's
tariffs when deciding on the tariff structure and level for the sector.
Domestic tariffs are identical for both utilities but industrial and
commercial tariffs will take some time to standardize as differentials are
reduced at each succeeding tariff increase. PEA is compensated for its
higher provincial operating costs by being charged a lower price for power
than MEA.
2.13      Under Loan 1527-TH the Government agreed to include a fuel/power
purchase adjustment clause in PEA's tariff schedules. Such clauses have now
been incorporated in the schedules of MEA and PEA.
2.14      RTG agreed on a study of tariff structures based on long-run
marginal costs for the power sector (Loan 1485-TH). Conclusion of the study
has been delayed because of the time taken to derive demand forecasts in the
inter-agency working group and the latter half of 1979 has been occupied
by the dialogue on the increase in tariff levels - the same working group
was involved as for the tariff study. The next step is for a consulting
commercial engineer to visit Thailand to review the draft report and advise
the tariff working group. Such a visit is expected to take place in the near
future. The study is therefore expected to be completed before December 31,
1980.



- 14
Insurance
2.15      PEA has adequate insurance against fire and other risks for
buildings and their contents, marine and stores.
Taxation
2.16      PEA pays customs and excise duties on purchases of imported
materials and equipment. Its Act also provides that any surplus funds be
remitted to Government in lieu of corporate tax. Due to the size of PEA's
expansion program and its need for funds, PEA has not made any remittance
and is not expected to do so in the near future.
Existing Facilities
2.17      The energy sold to PEA from EGAT's 81 substations is distributed by
PEA in 69 provinces by radial type distribution systems of 11, 22 and 33 kV
design.  PEA steps the high tension voltage down to low tension at 400/230
volt, 3 - phase, 4-wire; 230 volt, 1 - phase, 2-wire or 460/230 volt, 1 -
phase, 3-wire (including one neutral) for supplying the energy to customers.
Medium sized business and industrial loads are supplied at the voltage
levels of 11, 22 or 33 kV.
2.18      At the end of FY79, the electric distribution systems in PEA ser-
vice areas totaled 21,576 circuit-km. of primary distribution lines and
2,302 MVA of transformer capacity. PEA had 874 offices throughout the
country.
2.19      In the light of the present energy prices and Government's policy
on energy conservation, PEA's design standards should be reviewed to ensure
that they are optimum in distribution loss levels. During negotiations the
Bank was informed that this kind of study is being carried out within PEA on
a continuing basis. It was agreed that such review will be followed up in
the future by supervision missions.

3.02      The power market has had a long history of rapid growth, the
average annual increase in peak demand and energy sales being 17% and 21.5%,
respectively, over the period FY70-79. Growth was stimulated by a favorable
world rice market and an expanding economy. Growth rates in energy sales

PEA's Load Forecast
3.03      PEA's load forecast was derived from a study of trend analysis of
sales to different categories of consumers and through market surveys of new
industries and the rural electrification program.

and 949 MW in FY79 to 14,220 GWh and 3,316 MW in FY88 at average annual
growth rate of 14.0% and 15.0%, respectively. This forecast has been
reviewed and accepted by a Load Forecast Working Group in December 1978
consisting of representatives from NESDB, NEA and the three utilities. A
review by EGAT in November 1979 based on the actual load growth in FY79 and
a review of new industrial loads indicated that the 1978 load forecast
still holds good requiring only minor adjustments and is being used in
formulating the generation and transmission development program.
Demand and Supply of the Project Villages
3.06      The load forecast for project villages under ARE II was based on
estimated energy requirements for households, commercial shops, rice
mills, power tools, potable water pumps, irrigation pumps and social
facilities as follows (details are given in Annex 6):

/a Including NEA's proposed pumping
irrigation project.
3.07      Energy requirements in project villages are expected to increase
from about 66 GWh in FY 1981 to 1,387 GWh in FY 2010, an average annual
growth rate of 11%; and peak demand from about 38 INW in FY 1981 to about 377
MW in FY 2010, an average annual growth rate of 8.2%. Growth is expected
to be rapid in the early years and would then taper off as connection of
the majority of premises (about 95% of households) is achieved by FY88.
3.08      To meet the power demands of ARE II project, nine 115 Kv trans-
mission lines and substations would be constructed. This construction has
already been planned under EGAT's Transmission System Expansion Project
No. 5, to be undertaken in parallel with ARE II.
4. THE PROGRAMI AND THE PROJECT
Development Strategy
4.01      PEA's policy is to provide electricity to all provincial capitals,
followed by all district centers, TAMBON /1 centers, and villages.
Currently, all provincial and district centers have access to electricity;
about 14,000 (29%) out of a total of 49,000 villages had electricity at
end-1979.
/1 Thailand's lowest administrative unit consisting of a group of villages.



- 18 -
4.02      PEA's overall program for rural electrification is currently being
carried out under three separate programs or projects: Accelerated Rural
Electrification, the TAMBON project and normal village electrification. The
differences between the three projects are that: (a) the Accelerated Rural
Electrification project confines itself to a specific region for each time
slice of the program and the project is coordinated by PEA's Office of
Accelerated Rural Electrification (ORE); (b) the TAMBON project is intended
to give power to all TAMBON headquarters and surrounding villages that can
be connected at a reasonable cost; and (c) the normal village electrifica-
tion program is carried out by the regional offices connecting villages
which are required to make a capital contribution of about 30% of initial
cost.
The Program
4.03      PEA originally planned to electrify all villages in Thailand in
about 25 years (National Plan for Total Electrification of Thailand, ap-
proved by the Council of Ministers on August 28, 1973) but has now embarked
on a greatly accelerated program which plans to reach all villages by the
late 1980s. The overall program from 1980-86 is as follows:
Project                 1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   Total

4.04      While the normal electrification project and the TAMBON project
cover all regions of Thailand, the ARE projects are geographically oriented.
ARE I primarily covers the 16 provinces in the Northeast and four other
sample provinces; ARE II would include the 16 provinces in the South, 5
provinces in the North, and 6 provinces in the Central and Eastern Regions;
and ARE III, the remaining unelectrified villages. While ARE II has already
been approved by the Government, the Village Electrification Project (4,000
villages) is still being reviewed.

Description of the Project
4.05      The proposed project will comprise the second stage of PEA's
Accelerated Rural Electrification Program (ARE II) involving the electri-
fication of 7,878 villages in 27 provinces and will finance a time slice of
PEA's rural electrification program. The total number of households
connected on completion of the project in 1985 would be about 1,037,400
covering a population of about 6.0 million. The project will also include
a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand and an operations development
study for PEA. The total number of project villages and households by
provinces are shown in Annex 7 and summarized below:

- 22 -
4.08       Physical contingencies were assumed to be 3.5% for all items based
on PEA's past experiences in distribution projects. Price contingencies
for foreign costs were derived by applying the following annual rates of
escalation: 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982, and 7% for 1983 and
thereafter. The price contingencies for local costs were assumed to be 14%
for 1980, 13% for 1981, and 12% for 1982 and thereafter. Price contingencies
represent about 31% of basic cost, including physical contingencies.
Financing Arrangements
4.09       The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) and the OPEC/1 Special Fund
have agreed to make loans of about US$20 million and US$8 million equivalent
respectively to assist in the financing of the project. The proposed Bank
loan of US$75.0 million would finance on a parallel basis the foreign
exchange costs of equipment and materials and the consultancy services for a
study on minihydro schemes in Thailand and an operations development study.
The Government of Norway expressed interest in cofinancing up to US$1.5
million equivalent for the feasibility study, detailed design, construction
supervision and equipment for two or more mini-hydro pilot schemes as part
of the proposed project. Local costs of about US$165.5 million equivalent
would be financed by PEA through internal cash generation and local
borrowings. The Government will be asked to make available to PEA any funds
required to complete the project, should these sources prove inadequate.

Procurement
4.11      All equipment and materials to be financed under the proposed Bank
loan would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines. A preference of 15% of the c.i.f.
price of imported goods, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers. Local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank would be applied to concrete poles (as
shipping charges would not warrant concrete poles being procured internation-
ally) and other minor items costing less than $100,000 each and up to an
aggregate amount of $2.5 million.
Disbursement
4.12      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made against (i) 100%
of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment and materials;
(ii) 100% of ex-factory cost for equipment and material manufactured locally;
(iii) 65% of total expenditures for imported equipment and materials procured
locally; and (iv) 47% of total expenditures ex-factory for concrete poles.



- 24 -
For consultancy services, disbursements would be 100% of the total expendi-
tures. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1986. A
disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8.
Implementation
4.13      The engineering and construction of the project will be coordinated
by PEA's Office of Accelerated Rural Electrification (ORE). There will be 44
construction crews. Each crew will consist of 56 men including a foreman,
linesmen, skilled laborers, drivers and unskilled laborers. Each crew is
estimated to be capable of constructing the facilities for about 50 villages
per year. Part of the work such as pole erection will be done by subcontrac-
tors. Work will be started first in the 11 Eastern, Central and Northern
provinces by mobilizing 18 construction crews. After end-FY82 construction
work will be reinforced by the addition of 26 crews on completion of ARE I
and work will start in the Southern provinces. The total construction
period will be about five years from 1981 through 1985 (see Annex 9 for
implementation schedule).
4.14      Most of the distribution lines would follow main or village roads.
For lines which cross private land no compensation is paid although provided
for in PEA's Act, as the villagers welcome the provision of electric services.
PEA has experienced little difficulty in obtaining easements over farmland.
Consultancy Services
4.15      The mini-hydro study will require about 70 man-months of services
with an estimated total cost of US$0.7 million. The average man-month cost,
including salary, costs, fees, international travel and subsistence, is
expected to be about US$10,000. PEA's operations development study estimated
to cost about US$0.3 million will require about 30 man-months, including
all costs.
4.16      During negotiations it was agreed between PEA and the Norwegian
Government that the grant of $1.5 million for cofinancing the project would
be confined to the implementation of two or more mini-hydro plants (yet to
be identified) from feasibility through commissioning. The study of mini-
hydro potential previously included in the Norwegian subproject will be
covered by the provision of US$0.7 million in the loan amount to cover such
a study with the objectives of identifying potential sites based on available
data, carrying out additional surveys and site investigations, preparing
prefeasibility studies of these sites and selecting a list of schemes for
future implementation.
Environmental Effects
4.17      The rural electrification project would not cause any significant
environmental problems.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Results and Financial Position
Sector
5.01       PEA has been cross-funded by EGAT and MEA since FY74 in order to
accelerate PEA's expansion program in general and its rural electrification
program in particular. The method adopted to provide the necessary funds to
PEA is for EGAT to charge MEA a higher price for bulk power than to PEA
(see para. 1.31).
5.02      The sector's financial position on this basis has been sound and it
has largely provided all the funds required for expansion from a mixture of
borrowing and self-generation. Government has only provided small amounts
of equity for the share of downstream benefits in multi-purpose hydroprojects,
for refunding EGAT's customs duties and for some of PEA's ongoing projects
for which equity subsidies were agreed some time ago, B 219 million - US$11
million, out of a total investment of B 5,442 - US$269 million, over the
past nine years. However, Government may need to provide some additional
equity to EGAT to cover cash shortages FY81-83 (B 2,000 million - US$98 mil-
lion)(para. 5.05).
PEA
5.03      The provisions of the Act governing PEA's activities and the
policies followed by management have enabled a sound financial position to
be maintained. Over the past nine years, rates of return on average next
fixed assets in operation /1 varied from a minimum of 8.7% in FY71 to a
maximum of 20.9% in FY78. Debt service coverage on an annual basis was
better than 2.0 times each year; self financing averaged 57% over the period
FY71-79 and for FY79 it was 25%; the debt equity ratio at end-FY79 was 52/48
having increased from 26/74 in FY71. Long-term debt has increased six times
since FY75 as PEA increased its borrowings to finance village electrification
and other rapidly expanding development programs. PEA's financial position
was sound at the end of FY79. Income, Funds Flow Statements and Balance
Sheets for FY71-79 are shown in Annex 10.
Financing Plan
Sector
5.04      PEA will continue to be cross-funded from EGAT and MEA as long as
necessary with CPPD fixing annually the price of bulk power from EGAT to each
of the other utilities in the sector (para. 1.33). PEA's financial position
is accordingly dependent on that of the sector which is discussed below.
/1 At historic cost and after deducting average consumers contributions.



- 26 -
5.05      Sector capital expenditure to meet increased demand, particularly
for the rural villages, is estimated at B 232 billion (US$11.3 billion)
during the nine years ending in FY88, causing the FY80 asset base to increase
four times in the nine-year period. The finance required would be borrowed
abroad to about B 128 billion (US$6.2 billion) or 55%; B 49 billion (US$2.4
billion or 21% would be borrowed locally; B 6 billion or 3% would come from
Government equity; and B 49 billion or 21% would come from internal cash
generation. The foregoing assumes that the sector as a whole would earn
rates of return (ROR) of 0.5% for FY80, 4% for FY81, 12% for FY82 and 8% for
FY83 and thereafter, as against covenanted RORs of 2% for FY81 and 8% for
FY82 and thereafter. The higher than covenanted RORs for FY81 and FY82 are
due to MEA and PEA currently earning more than the covenanted RORs and
the average tariff level for FY81 required to earn the covenanted ROR of 2%
for EGAT, being greater than that necessary to earn the ROR of 8% for FY82 -
real cost savings in fuel occur in that year due to conversion to natural gas
for some generation plants and the Government does not intend to pass the
savings to consumers. Any tariff reduction would shortly be followed by
future increases. Corresponding contributions to construction expenditures
from internal cash generation average 24% over the nine-year period through
FY88, a satisfactory position. The sector's financing plan based on these
assumptions is as follows:
Sector Financing Plan: FY80-88
(Billions of Baht and US $)
B          US$        %
Internal cash generation                        134          6.5      58
Less:  Debt service and working                  78          3.8      34

Equity                                            6          0.3       3
Cash increase                                    -7         -0.3     _-3
Capital investment                              232         11.3     100
The financing plan assumes provision of equity from Government to cover
cash shortages (in EGAT) FY81 through FY83 amounting in total to about
B 2,000 million (US$98 million).
PEA
5.06      PEA's expansion program for FY80 through FY88 is much larger than
what has been accomplished in the past. Under the rural electrification



- 27 -
program 34,800 villages are scheduled to be supplied with electricity by the
mid-1980s (para. 4.03). As a result of this and other expansion projects,
the FY80 asset base would multiply three times by FY88. Capital
expenditures to meet the required construction program are estimated to
amount to about B 27,031 million (US$1,321 million); B 6,003 million (US$293
million) or 22% would be borrowed abroad; B 13,261 million (US$648 million)
or 49% would be borrowed locally; B 489 million (US$24 million) or 2.0%
would come from Government equity; and B 7,278 million (US$356 million) or
27.0% would be financed from internal cash generation. It is also assumed
that sector tariffs will be fixed at a level to help finance the EGAT, PEA
and MEA construction programs on a rationalized tariff structure for all of
Thailand; and that surplus funds generated in Metropolitan Bangkok (MEA's
area) will be transferred to PEA by EGAT charging PEA a lower price for
purchased power than MEA. Based on these assumptions, the financing plan is
as follows:
Financing Plan: FY 1980-88
(Millions of baht and US$)
B        US$        %
Internal cash generation                       18,852       921      70
Less: Debt service and working capital
requirements                           11,087       542       41
Internal funds available for investment         7,765       379      29
Borrowings                                     19,264       941      71
Equity                                            489        24       2
Cash increase                                   -,487       -23      -2
Capital investment                             27,031    1,321      100
5.07      PEA has always paid customs and excise duties which amount
on average to about 40% of materials and equipment costs. The financial
forecasts therefore assume that customs duties will continue to be levied.
Continued exemption from corporate taxes as presently provided in PEA's
charter is also assumed. The consequences of a decision to make the sector
liable to corporate tax will be assessed as part of the tariff study, the
recommendations of which will be discussed by the Bank and the Government for
implementation by December 31, 1980 (para. 2.14).
5.08      It was agreed to continue the existing rate of return covenants
agreed for the Mae Moh Lignite Project which provide for the sector (exclud-
ing EGAT's mining operations and assets) to earn 2% for FY81 and 8% for FY82
and thereafter and for PEA to earn rates of return consistent with sector
requirements.



-28 -
5.09       The cross-funding of PEA from MEA and the dependence of both these
utilities on EGAT for the provision of power, makes it necessary that the
sector as a whole earns a rate of return that will ensure consumers are
charged a reasonable price for power and at the same time generate sufficient
funds from internal resources to enable the sector development program
to continue unhindered. To this end it was agreed that PEA will review on
the basis of realistic forecasts, not later than April 30 in each of its
Fiscal Years, the adequacy of its tariffs to produce for the current and
next following Fiscal Years the annual rates of return and furnish to the
Bank a copy of such review promptly upon its completion. A provision has
been included in the draft Guarantee Agreement for the Government to take
all such measures as required including adjustments of the tariff structure
or levels of the utilities to achieve the covenanted rates of return for the
sector as a whole.
Level of Self-Financing
5.10       Based on the foregoing assumptions PEA is estimated to self-
generate the following percentages of construction expenditures:
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987    1988
(%)
Annual Con-
tribution    4.3   18.0   25.5   25.3   20.6   22.6  39.9   59.9    90.9
Three-year
Average /a   6.1   19.0   19.0   28.1   24.2   18.0  33.6   85.4    70.2
/a Past, test and following year.
The corresponding rates of return on a revalued rate base/i vary between
a minimum of 1% for FY81 to a maximum of 8% for FY87 and are consistent
with the covenanted rates of return for the sector as a whole.
Future Operating Results
5.11       PEA's energy sales are estimated to increase from 4,243 GWh in FY79
to 15,288 GWh in FY88, an average annual growth rate of 15%. Based on the
RORs detailed in paragraph 5.10, energy revenues are forecast to increase from
/1 Revalued average net fixed assets in operation less average consumers
contributions.



- 29 -
B 3,598 million (US$176 million) in FY79 to B 39,763 million (US$1,943 mil-
lion) in FY88, an average growth rate of 31% per year; operating expenses,
assuming escalation as detailed in Annex 12, are also expected to grow from
B 3,469 million (US$169 million) to B 40,575 million (US$1,983 million), or
about 31% on average annually.
5.12      The operating ratio varies between 94% and 99% through the period
of the forecast.
5.13      PEA's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt/equity ratio rises to 67/33 in FY83 but reduces
below 60/40 (para. 5.15) by the end of the forecast period.
5.14    The current ratio has varied in the past from a minimum of 1.0 to a
maximum of 1.4; it was 1.3 for FY79. Consumers receivables at end-FY79 were
about 34 days billing and they have been forecast at this level through the
forecast period. Inventories were about 49%/1 of gross plant at end-FY79, a
very high level; they are expected to fall to about 3.5% of gross plant by
the end of the forecast period; payables are forecast to maintain the FY79
ratio relationships with construction and expenses; year-end cash balances
are adequate for most years throughout the period of the forecast. The
current ratio is estimated to vary from 1.4 (FY80) to 2.9 (FY88), a satis-
factory position. Estimated Income, Funds Flow Statements and Balance
Sheets, FY80-88 together with those of MEA, EGAT and Consolidated Statements
are shown in Annex 11. Annex 12 shows the assumptions used in the financial
forecasts.
Debt Control
5.15    Debt service coverage on an annual basis is expected to vary between
a minimum of 0.9 times (FY81) and 1.9 times (FY87)./2 PEA is a well-operated
utility whose management follows conservative financial policies. A debt-
limitation covenant is therefore required that will give adequate freedom to
PEA to manage its debt without undue consultation with the Bank while
providing for Bank review of borrowings when debt reaches a level that could
affect the future financial position of the Authority. It was therefore
agreed to continue the existing test under which PEA will only incur debt
to an aggregate amount that will maintain the debt/equity ratio at 60/40 or
below without the agreement of the Bank. Medium-term debt which matures
within five years, will be limited to 10% of total debt.
/1 PEA has been booking 100% of the value of materials and equipment con-
tracts on signing. The practice has now been stopped.
/2 As a result of the assumption of cross-funding among utilities.

6.01      The economic profile of project villages is shown in Annex 13.  The
following table gives the average features of a project village which indicate
a relatively fair size of farm and a moderate cash income per household.
Unit per village

/a  1 ha = 6.25 rai.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.02      The internal economic rate of return of the project (IERR) is the
discount rate that equalizes the economic costs and the direct and indirect
benefits attributable to the project over its life. The IERR thus achieved
is 15% (see Annex 14 for derivation of indirect benefits and Annex 15 for IERR
calculation). If the costs of additional 3-phase lines, direct and indirect
benefits of NEA's pumping irrigation project were included, the IERR would
improve to 17%.
6.03      Sensitivity tests for variations in capital costs and indirect bene-
fits give the following results:



- 31 -
Equalizing discount rate
(a)  On basic assumption                       15.3%
(b) Project cost increased by:
10%                                     14.0%
20%                                     13.1%
(c)  Indirect benfits reduced by
10%                                     13.6%
20%                                     12.0%
Load Promotion
6.04      PEA has prepared a load promotion program as stipulated in the
ARE I. The program as envisaged is to provide credit for small industrial
and commercial consumers to convert their motive power from diesel units to
electric motors; and to provide credit to assist those households without
the estimated B 2,000 (US$98) for initial housewiring and other connection
costs, to pay the amount over time. The program is generally designed to
spread the indirect benefits of rural electrification as quickly as possible
and cover the lower category of domestic consumers with adequate threshold
income to make monthly payments for electricity.
6.05      As PEA had been conservative in its approach to the program
during negotiations it was agreed to implemnent a pilot program for domestic
consumers covering 80 villages in the north-east with a view to gathering
information on its effectiveness and the possible dimensions of the
financial and physical requirements of a full scale program. Details of the
program are shown in Annex 16 and the agreement covenanted in Loan 1527-TH
has been continued in a side letter to the proposed Loan Agreement.
6.06      The need for assistance to industrial and commercial consumers has
receded due to shortages of diesel fuel in 1979 and price increases. Larger
numbers of householders than originally estimated are converting to electri-
city (66% v 50%) but less than 10% of the villages under the ARE I project
have connection as yet, a total picture has therefore not yet emerged.
7.   AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:



- 32 -
(a) With the Government
(i)  Government will make available to PEA any funds required for
completion of the project (para. 4.09); and
(ii) the sector to earn rates of return of not less than
- 2% for FY81;
- 8% for FY82 and thereafter (paras. 1.32 and 5.08);
(b)  With PEA
(i)  the carrying out by consultants of an operations development
study and a study on mini-hydro schemes in Thailand (paras.
2.05 and 4.06);
(ii) PEA and the Bank will exchange views regarding
recommendations of the operations development study and their
implementation (para. 2.06);
(iii) PEA to earn rates of return consistent with sector require-
ments (para. 5.08);
(iv) the existing debt control covenant will be continued
and medium-term debt will be limited to 10% of total debt
(para. 5.15); and
(v)  PEA to implement a pilot load promotion program (para. 6.05).
Recommendations
7.02      Subject to agreement being reached on the above, the project forms
a suitable basis for a loan to PEA of US$75 million for a period of 20 years
including 5 years grace, with the guarantee of the Royal Thai Government.

OPERATIONS DEVELOPMENT STUDY
Draft Terms of Reference
Objectives
1.        The objectives of the study are:  to review the objectives of the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) with regard to its current and future
responsibility for providing and distributing power in Thailand and to define
and codify these objectives in consultation with PEA; to review PEA's organ-
ization structure to ensure that these objectives are achieved; and to
recommend any changes in the organization structure and the responsibilities
that may arise from the review.
Scope of Works
2.        The consultants selected will consult with the Government and PEA
and thereafter will define and codify PEA's objectives to enable it to
discharge its responsibilities in the operation and development of the power
sector.
3.        Goals, problems and areas to be addressed by PEA as a public power
utility will be defined including long-term effectiveness of the electricity
supply at an acceptable level of service for the community at the minimum
economic cost to the consumer.
4.        An organization structure should be suggested after reviewing the
existing structure down to division level, to ensure that the objectives,
goals, problems and areas to be addressed are covered by the organization
units incorporated in the structure recommended including consideration of a
corporate planning department.
5.        The responsibility and authority of each organization unit will be
defined and recommendations made on the reports to be received from lower
levels and sent to higher levels to enable the responsibilities to be
discharged and monitored.
6.        The consultants in consultation with PEA will determine whether any
additional work is required below division level.

THAILAND
PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT (ARE II)
Power Demands of the Project
1.        For ARE II Project, seven groups of consumers were categorized for
load forecast as follows:
(a) residential household;
(b) commercial shop;
(c) rice mill;
(d) power tool;
(e) potable water pump;
(f) agricultural pump; and
(g) social facilities.
Residential Households
2.        To determine the energy requirement for residential households,
the demand level, connection rate and demand growth rate were assessed. The
demand level was determined based on the results of socio-economic surveys of
annual energy consumption for electrified villages and a correlation of
annual household cash income for electrified and unelectrified villages as
shown in Table 1.
3.        The initial connection rate was estimated at about 65% based on a
recent survey for villages electrified under the ARE I Project. It will then
increase on an average of 12% a year until reaching 95Z.
4.        The growth rates of energy consumption per household were derived
as follows:

Year after village        annual growth
electrification         rate (% p.a.)
1st- 5th years          No increase
6th-15th years               5.0
16th-20th years               3.5
21st-30th years               1.5
5.        Population growth was assumed to be 2.5% p.a., decreasing to 2.35%
by the 5th year of project implementation, 2.18% p.a. by the 15th year and
2% p.a. by the 25th year.
Commercial Shops
6.        The same method as for residential households was used in arriving
at the demand level for commercial shops. The average number of households
per commercial shop, the initial connection rate and projected annual energy
consumption per shop by provinces are shown in Table 2.
7.        The growth rates of energy consumption per shop were derived as
follows:
Period after village       Annual growth
electrification         rate (% p.a.)
1st- 5th years          No increase
6th-20th years               3.5
21st-30th years               1.5
Rice Mills
8.        The total number of rice mills in the 7,878 project villages is
about 10,248 with a total capacity of 94,981 hp. The average number of rice
mills per village is 1.3 and average size of engine is 9.3 hp. The conver-
sion of rice mills from diesel to electricity depends on the remaining life
of the existing diesel engines, the availability of 3-phase supply in the
system and the relative economy of operation of diesel engines with respect to
electric motors. Based on a recent survey of villages electrified under ARE
I, 50% of the rice mill owners interviewed are willing to convert to



ANNEX 6
-  41-                               Page 3
electric motors at their own expense due to the high cost and scarcity of
diesel fuel. It was assumed that about 35% of the rice mills would be
converted by the fifth year of the project.
9.        The average rice mill was assumed to have a 7.5 hp motor operating
at 869 hours per year (75% of the number of hours of operation of the
average unelectrified rice mill). Each rice mill was assumed to consume
4,860 kWh per year (7.5 hp x 0.746 x 869).
Power Tools
10.       It was assumed that 1.5% of electrified rural households would own
a portable power tool. This assumption is roughly equivalent to about one
portable power tool for each electrified blacksmith or repair shop.
11.       The connection rate was assumed to be as follows:
Year after village    Connection rate
electrification             (%)
1                     25
2                     40
3                     50
4                     60
5                     75
6                     85
7                     95
8                    100
12.       The average electrified portable power tool was assumed to have
1 hp operating for 180 hours per year. Thus, each power tool was assumed to
consume 130 kWh per year (1.0 x 0.746 x 180).
Potable Water Pumps
13.       Electric potable water pumps are normally driven by small one-
phase motors of less than 1 hp. This category of pumps includes those used
in private households, shops, schools and temples. Average number of
households per electric potable pump for each province was derived from
PEA's survey of villages already electrified as shown in Table 3.
14.       The figures given in Table 3 are the average number of electrified
households per electric potable pump expected to be reached by the fifth
year of village electrification. After that it was assumed to reduce one



ANNEX 6
-42 -                              Page 4
electrified household per year until reaching one electric potable pump per
ten electrified households and remaining constant thereafter.
15.       The electric potable water pump was assumed to have 0.5 hp in
capacity operating at 365 hours a year. Each electric potable water pump will
therefore consume about 136 kWh a year (0.5 x 0.746 x 365).
Agricultural Pumps
16.       The majority of rural agricultural water pumps are portable and
are used to pump water for irrigation. Most of these pumps are presently
powered by small benzine engines in the 2-3 hp range. The average numbers
of households per agricultural pump for each province are given in Table 4.
17.       The conversion rates used to estimate the number of agricultural
pumps to be electrified were assumed as follows:
Year after          Conversion rate
electrification             (%)
5                    3.0
6                    4.2
7                    4.8
8                    6.0

18.       The average electrified agricultural pumps were assumed to have
2.5 hp and to operate 2 hours per day for 120 days per year during the dry
season. Thus each electrified agricultural pump was assumed to use 447 kWh
per year (2.5 x 0.746 x 2 x 120).
19.       Energy consumption for NEA's pumping irrigation project (500 pumps
at 150 hp) was estimated to be 136,200 kWh per year per pump (150 x 0.746 x
1,217).

Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts
A. Revenues
(a)  Fiscal Year 1980
EGAT revenues assume no further fuel adjustment for FY80 and that
the current average tariff level will apply through September 30,
1980 (B 0.8401-US4.1). Similar assumptions apply for MEA and
PEA, the average levels respectively being B 1.1052 (US5.4) and
B 1.1517 (US45.6). These average tariff levels are after the 38%
increase on February 1, 1980.
(b)  Fiscal Year 1981
Revenues were first based on the following assumptions for fuel
adjustments and tariff increases which are passed through MEA
and PEA:
New gross tariff level and Percentage
Increase on Previous Level
1980                                  EGAT    %       MEA    %      PEA    %
October 1  Fuel adjustment           1.1001   31   1.3732   24   1.4323  24
1981
January 1  Fuel adjustment           1.3801   25   1.6622   21   1.7345  21
April 1    Tariff increase to
produce ROR of 2% for   1.6361   19   1.9262   16   2.0108  16
EGAT for FY81
EGAT revenues and MEA/PEA bulk power purchases were then adjusted
to transfer surplus funds from MEA/PEA to EGAT to reduce overall
sector borrowing and therefore debt service.
(c) Fiscal Year 1982
The average tariff levels required for FY82for the sector to earn
the covenanted 8% rate of return for that year, are lower than
those needed to earn the covenanted 2% for FY81.



71 _
ANNEX 12
Page 2
The reduction is due to real cost savings accruing from diversi-
fying from oil as fuel, to gas and an improved hydro thermal mix in
FY82. FY81 tariff levels including the cost adjustments are
assumed to apply for FY82; EGAT revenues and MEA/PEA bulk power
costs have again been adjusted to transfer surplus funds to EGAT.
(d) Fiscal Year 1983 and After
Revenues are those required to produce an 8% rate of return subject
to the fact that for FY83, EGAT and MEA average tariff levels
required for an 8% rate of return were slightly lower than the
FY81-82 average tariff levels. These levels were assumed to apply
for FY83. For FY83-88, adjustments have again been made to
transfer surplus funds from MEA/PEA to EGAT.
Assumptions
B. Fuel Costs
(a) Oil. Fuel oil and diesel prices to EGAT have been assumed to apply
at the dates of the fuel oil adjustments detailed above to eliminate oil
subsidies by January 1, 1981. Price levels assumed include increases in the
OPEC average price of $8/bbl above existing levels to bring the price to
US$32/bbl crude equivtlent for FY81; thereafter costs have been increased at
3% p.a. in real terms. The assumed price levels are in accordance with Bank
predictions.
(b)  Lignite.  Lignite prices have been assumed at cost through FY83 and
at the Australian steam coal equivalent of US$15.20/ton (1979 price level)
escalated at 1% p.a. in real terms in accordance with Bank estimates.
(c) Gas. Gas prices have been assumed at 90% of the fuel oil
equivalent each year.
C. Operating Costs
Operating costs have been estimated based on FY79 unit costs and
escalated at 12.25%, 11%, 10%, 9.5% and 8.5% for FY80, FY81, FY82,
FY83-85 and FY86-88, respectively. The rates are the latest Bank
estimates assuming 50/50 foreign and local expenditure.
D. Capital Investment
Construction costs are those estimated to provide the additional
plant and equipment required to meet the demand forecast escalated in
accordance with the latest Bank estimates.

E. Equity
Equity to be received is that agreed to be provided PEA and EGAT
for ongoing projects for contributions for the irrigation share of hydro-
electric projects and import duty; for future projects (Post FY79) it has
been assumed that about B 2,000 million (US$98 million) will be received
from Government as equity to cover cash shortages (in EGAT) through FY83;
thereafter the only other equity receivable will be to cover the irrigation
share of multi-purpose projects.
F. Borrowings
8.        Borrowings for the sector have been assumed at B 128 billion
(US$6.2 billion) for foreign borrowings, and B 49 billion (US$2.4 billion)
for local borrowings. Foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest
rates varying from 2% to 15%, and for terms varying from 30 years including 10
years grace to 10 years including 3 years grace. Local borrowings have been
assumed at annual interest rates varying from 10% to 15% and terms varying
from 10 years including 5 years grace, to 20 years including 5 years grace on
the assumption that the longer term debts will be rolled over.

PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Assessment of Indirect Benefits of Rural Electrification
1. Tangible Indirect Benefits
The tangible indirect benefits are derived from:
- Residential households: cost savings compared to lighting and
cooking fuels; increased productivity and handicraft activities.
- Commercial shops: cost savings compared to lighting fuel;
increased profits due to refrigeration and other electrical
facilities.
- Rice mills: Cost savings compared to diesel engines with
electric motors in annual maintenance, capital recovery cost,
and improved rice recovery.
- Power tools: cost savings in labor and increase in productivity.
- Potable water pumps: cost savings compared to manual bucketing.
- Agricultural pumps: cost savings compared to diesel engines
with electric motors.
2. Parameters Used in the Assessment
A. Cost of fuel is based on the projected fuel costs less taxes in 1985,
but adjusted to February 1980 price level.
B. Cost of electricity is based on the forecast tariff levels in 1985
(cost to the consumers) adjusted to February 1980 price level.
3. Surplus Benefits from Rural Household Electrification
A. Household's lighting benefits are due to cost savings in fuel
(kerosene). A synthesized case study of representative households
with and without electricity is shown in Table 1.

(1)  Assuming 3 fluorescent tubes that use 40 W each and burn 3 hours a day
for 365 days per year at 1.15 per kWh.
(2) Using a 12% opportunity cost of capital and a 30-year life.
Average annual savings in lighting cost are estimated at B 138 per
electrified household without taking into consideration benefits due to the
superior quality of electric lighting.
B. Household's agricultural labor saving benefits from electricity lighting
are attributable to additional working hours available during the peak
agricultural season as evaluated below:

Annual benefits per household                =   B   58
(1) Case 1: Basket Making (Village of Tachamung, Province of Songkhla)
Without electrification: 2 families engaged together in a rattan
basket cottage industry work until 19.00 or 20.00 hours making
baskets.
With electrification: The same 2 families now work until 22.00 hours
because of high quality electric lighting. Given 2 productive workers
per family, each family now makes 2 extra baskets per day. The
families sell the baskets for B 8 each and each family makes a profit
of B 3 per basket.
Annual benefits = (B 6 per day x 120 days) = B 720.
(2) Case 2: Silk Weaving (Village of Phumriang, Province of Surat Thani)
Without electrification: a farm family engaged in silk weaving part-
time does not work in the evening hours.
With electrification: The same farm family can now productively
work an extra 2 hours each night because of high quality electric
lighting. The family is able to make 1.6 extra meters of silk per
day. The family sells the silk for B 40 per meter and makes a
profit of B 2.5 per meter.
Annual benefits = (B 4 per day x 120 days) = B 480.
(3) Case 3: Mat Making and Pillow Making (Village of Bantum, Province of
Kalasin)
Without electrification: No cottage industry activities.
With electrification: The same farm family makes straw mats and
stuffed pillows at night because of high quality electric lighting.
The family makes a profit of B 20 per month with these cottage
industry activites.
Annual benefits = (B 20/month) (4 months/year) = B 80.

D. Household's cooking benefits are due to cost savings for not having to
buy or gather fuel for cooking. Average annual cooking benefits are
estimated at B 146 per household as below:

Total annual cooking costs           487            428
Average savings in annual cooking costs   =  B  59
per electrified household
(1) Average household expenditures for charcoal and
firewood.
(2) Assuming a 750 W rice cooker used 0.5 hours per day for
365 days per year at B 1.15 per kWh and a supplemental
fuel cost of B 100 per year for other cooking purposes.
(3)  Using a 12% opportunity cost of capital and an 8
years life.
E.  In summary, total average indirect surplus benefits per electrified
household are estimated at B 343 per year.  Of this total, 40% (B 138)
is due to lighting savings, 26% (B 88) due to agricultural season
labor savings; 17% (B 58) due to handicraft activities; and 17%
(B 59) due to cooking savings.
4. Surplus Benefits from Rural Shop Electrification
Indirect benefits from rural shop electrification include cost
saving benefits and increased productivity benefits. Three different types
of shops were analyzed with the following results:

SECOND ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Internal Rate of Return Calculation
1.        Capital Costs.  The capital costs include all the capital
investment during the project implementation period and for the investment
required for subsequent years for additional primary and secondary lines,
transformers and services to new consumers up to year 2010. Only 70% of the
capital costs for equipment and vehicles were allocated to the project, as
part of these equipment would be transferred to other uses upon completion
of the project. All costs are at February 1980 price levels. Efficiency
prices were applied:
(a) taxes and duties were excluded;
(b) foreign exchange costs were adjusted by a standard conversion
factor of 0.91; and
(c) a shadow wage rate of 0.5 was applied to unskilled labor.
2.        O&M Costs.  Operating costs were calculated on the basis of 0.75%
of the average cumulative investment of the system in service at the
beginning and ending of each year. Maintenance expenses were also related
to the average cumulative investment of each year but increasing from 0.5%
to 1.0% over the 30-year period. Consumer billing and collection costs were
calculated at the current level of B 50 per customer per year but decreasing
to B 32 at the end of 2010 resulting from economy of scale of operation.
Administration and general expenses were treated in the same manner as the
consumer costs.
3.        Energy Costs.  Energy costs were calculated at B 0.968 per kWh,
the long-run marginal costs of EGAT on a bulk supply basis excluding taxes
(see Table 1 for details).
4.        Direct Benefits.  The direct benefits were derived from sales of
electric energy based on 1985 consolidated tariff rates of MEA and PEA
required to earn 8% ROR on revalued net fixed assets basis but adjusted to
February 1980 price level and the connection charges which PEA charged to
consumers.
5.        Indirect Benefits.  The derivation of indirect benefits is shown
in Annex 14 with the results summarized below:

6.        Internal Economic Rate of Return.  The internal economic rate
of return is 15% with calculation given in Table 2. Sensitivity
tests for variations in capital costs and indirect benefits give the
following results:
Equalizing Discount Rate
(a) On basic assumption                 15.3%
(b) Project cost increased by:
10%                         14.0%
20%                          13.1%
(c) Indirect benefits reduced by:
10%                         13.6%
20%                          12.0%

THAILAND
PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
Accelerated Rural Electrification Program: Load Promotion
Preamble
1.        Thailand has embarked on an accelerated rural electrification pro-
gram that is expected to provide access to electricity for all villages (say
95Z) in the country by the late eighties. While it is desirable that all
industrial and commercial premises in the villages be supplied with electric
power, connection of these loads and the domestic consumers does not justify
the program, using PEA's and the Bank's normal criteria (direct benefits) for
measuring power projects.
2.        The major benefits of the program are indirect (increased agricul-
tural productivity and cost savings) that accrue to domestic consumers from
house connections. The program is social in nature and is aimed at benefit-
ting the rural poor, improving the quality of life in the villages and the
political attitude of the people. In addition, substantial benefits accrue to
Thailand by diversifying to electricity from kerosene and diesel oil for
lighting and motive power, respectively, grid electricity being currently
generated from a mix of hydro, lignite and oil. These benefits will
increase substantially from 1982 onwards when natural gas begins to be used
for electric power generation and again from 1985, when lignite use for
power generation increases substantially.
3.        It follows that industrial, commercial and domestic use should not
be constrained otherwise the economic and social benefits of the program may
not be captured quickly enough. PEA must, therefore, embark on a program to
ensure that all possible consumers are connected as soon as feasible and that
they are not constrained in doing so by lack of the initial cash for
connection.
Industrial and Commercial Consumers
4.        Price increases for fuel oil, diesel oil and kerosene have improved
the competitive position of electric power vis-a-vis oil products. Shortages
of fuel and diesel oil during 1979 have also caused numbers of consumers
to convert rapidly to electricity. Consequently, it is considerd that there
is no need at present to provide any incentive to industrial and commercial
consumers to apply for connection. In addition, EGAT is constrained by lack
of capacity through 1982, in supplying energy until the new 500 MW units at
Bang Pakong are commissioned. Additional energy loads from conversion should

not be encouraged until then as it would only mean conversion of generation
from diesel-fueled piston units to diesel-powered gas turbine units. Any new
energy loads should be powered by electricity, however.
5.        After 1982, incentives for conversion of industrial and commercial
loads may be necessary to encourage all potential industrial and commercial
consumers to convert to electricity, if the cost and shortage of diesel oil
have not driven them to do so by then. The incentives required may take the
form of allowing prospective consumers to pay connection charges over a period
of time and providing credit for the purchase of motors and switchgear.
Domestic Consumers
6.        A pilot scheme has been agreed for the provision of credit
arrangements to meet the initial capital costs of domestic connections to
electricity, as follows:
(a) credit will be provided to cover the initial cost of domestic
connection presently estimated at B 2,000 (US$98) per house;
(b) the scheme will begin after the affected village has been
connected to PEA's grid for one year;
(c) a maximum of two lighting and one power point will be financed
per house;
(d) the credit will be certified by the village headman and guaran-
teed by two other persons;
(e) an interest rate of 1% above PEA's latest local borrowing rates
will be applicable; and
(f) repayments shall be by equal monthly installments of interest
and capital together for a period that will cause the
installments and the electricity bill to be within the households
ability to pay.
7.        The pilot scheme will cover 80 villages spread over the provinces
in the north eastern area of the country, the area of the ARE I project.
8.        PEA and the Banks will review the information derived from the
pilot scheme by December 31, 1982 with a view to a decision on the necessity
for it to continue, expand or discontinue.
