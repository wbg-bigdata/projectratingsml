MEMORANDUM AND PECOMMENDATION OF THE PRES IDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$350.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The loan would help finance a highway sector project and would be
for a term of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  While the transport sector has been able to meet the
rapidly growing transport needs of the economy, its performance could be much
better. Not only is there scope for improvement in the quality of infrastruc-
ture and in the efficiency of individual entities--transport operators, state
enterprises, goverment agencies--but also in the way the modal and intermodal
systems function as a whole. Furthermore, the quality of services and the
responsiveness of the industry can be much improved. Most of these short-
comings can be traced to GOI's sector policies which have focussed excessively
on regulation and control and until recently emphasized infrastructure
development while neglecting maintenance. In addition to the need to address
these problems, the sector is facing new challenges deriving from several
developments. Total transport demand continues to expand in line with
E        economic growth while budgetary resources for the expansion and upkeep of the
infrastructure remain constrained; and the rapid growth of exports of manu-
factured products is giving rise to new transport tasks. If transport is to
continue to facilitate economic growth and not pose a constraint, further
increase in overall efficiency will be needed.
3.        GOI has been aware of many of the sectoral shortcomings and has
taken important measures in several areas in recent years including, in
particular, much increased budgetary allocations to road maintenance and the
deregulation of the shipping industry. However, measures in key policy areas
affecting the efficiency of the sector have been rather piecemeal and were
neither guided by clear principles nor well coordinated. This is explained in
part by the fragmentation of decision centers involved in policy-making in the
sector. In the medium term the potential for significant efficiency improve-
ments is the greatest in the road subsector because problems have been clearly
identified and corrective measures have been formulated and in some cases
already initiated. Firot, several steps have been taken to achieve higher
benefits from road expenditures, mainly through more appropriate road designs,
improved standards of execution, a better balance in the allocation of
resources as between categories of roads and types of activities (e.g. greater
emphasis on maintenance) and, more generally, continued development of the
agencies involved in formulating and implementing road programs. Second, more
appropriate road use policies, in particular those concerning the weight and
dimension regulations and the taxation of heavy vehicles, are being developed;
road safety which had been neglected is also being given more attention.
Third, a start has been made with the strengthening of the Ministry of
Communications which is responsible for policies on road use. Finally, during
the last year, in recognition of the need for better and adequately coordi-



a 2 -
nated policies and drawing upon recommendations of studies carried out in
recent years, 01 has prepared a statement of policies and associated action
plan (PSMP) for the road subsector and developed a comprehensive three-year
road expenditure plan for inter-urban national and provincial roads.
4.        Road 8ubsector Policies and ExDenditure Plan.  The PS&AP is sound
and has been carefully stagedl it outlines new policy directions and specifies
measures and actions for the medium term to bring about improvement ins ti)
the planning, programming and execution of road works, including monitoring
and control systems, and as appropriate, the central-local government rela-
tionship i1 these areas; (Ci) the legal and regulatory framework for road
transport; (III) intermodal planning and policy formulation; Civ) the taxation
regime of heavy vehiclesl (v) vehicle weight and dimension limits and their
enforcementt (vi) road safetyt and (vii) the capability of central and provin-
cial institutions in charge of these matters.
S.        The three-year expenditure plan for inter-urban national and provin-
cial roads covers the first three years of Indonesia's fifth national plan
(FYs 1989/90 to 1991/92). it establishes clear expenditure priorities,
including an appropriate balance between categories of roads and types of
expenditures, ensures consistency between available internal and external
funds and human and physical resources, and provides for coordination between
road use policies and expenditures on roads. In addition to annual target
expenditures per activity, it includes a detailed first year work program and
budget and economical and financial criteria for the establishment of the
second and third-year work programs and budgets. The annual programs will
also be based on firm indications of external financing by other agencies.
The Directorate General of Highways (DOH) has organized donor meetings to
ensure that the major donors are working within the same overall plan. As
civil works in the expenditure plan are mostly for the maintenance/improvement
of existing roads, the Plan's impact on the environment is expected to be
minimum.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been heavily involved
in Indonesia's transport sector and in roads in particular and has helped in
bringing about significant improvements in planning, programming and execution
of road works and in the budgetary allocations to road maintenance. GOI's
achievements in terms of transport policy and in overall sectoral efficiency
have been limited, however. To help GOI in these areas, the strategy is to
address the key issues of allocation and use of budgetary resources, regula-
tory and pricing policies, and strengthening of institutions on a subsectoral
basis. GOI's new orientations in policies on road transport and the new
procedures for programming, budgeting and implementation of road works
represent a major effort towards increased overall efficiency of the subsec-
tor. It is also an undertaking which will require strong commitment if it is
to succeed. The Bank's involvement will be important to help overcome inevi-
table inertia vis-a-vis the new approaches and ensure their satisfactory
implementation over a realistic time frame.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project's objective is to improve the over-
all efficiency of the road subsector by supporting GOI's statement of poli-
cies and the comprehensive expenditure plan with the particular aims oft (i)
consolidating the recent improvements in the formulation and implementation of
road works programs, (ii) instituting better and adequately coordinated poli-



- 3 -
cies on road infrastructure and on road use, (iii) further strengthening of
subsector agencies; and (iv) improving the quality of the road network by
focussing on maintenance and rehabilitation works.
8.        Proiect Description.  The project is designed to support GOI's
Policy Statement and Action Plan and the three year expenditure plan for
inter-urban national and provincial roads and includes: (i) technical assis-
tance, studies and training to assist implementation of the PS&AP and the
espenditure plan; and (ii) specific subprojects of the expenditure plan
selected annually on the basis of agreed procedures and economic and technical
criteria. Major components for which loan proceeds (US$350.0 million) would
be used are road and bridge improvement and maintenance programs. Other com-
ponents would include road safety, technical assistance and training. The
total cost of these components is US$580.0 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$324.4 million. GOI has requested retroactive financing of
US$35.0 million to help finance cost of works for the timeslice from the
beginning of the current fiscal year. A breakdown of the overall highway
expenditure plan and its financing are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements as well as the disbursement schedule
for the Bank financed components are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events is shown in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. Maps Nos. 21746, 27147,
21748, 21749 and 21750 showing the national and provincial road network are
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8005-IND, dated October --,
1989 is being distributed separately.
9.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreement was reached with GOl:
Xi) on the PS&AP; (ii, that material changes to the PS&AP, if necessary, will
be made in consultation with the Bank; (iii) on annual implementation reviews
of the PS&AP and the previous year's budget; (iv) that the three-year expendi-
ture plan will be rolled over annually on the basis of a methodology accep-
table to the Bank; (v) that the annual work programs and budgets will satisfy
economic and technical criteria acceptable to the Bank; (vi) that Bank
financed subprojects will have a minimum rate of return of 15Z; and (vii) on
the preparation of an adequate feasibility study before implementing any toll
road project.
10.       Benefits and Risks.  The project's main direct benefits would be to
reduce considerably road transport system costs. These benefits would over
time translate into lower agricultural and industrial production costs. Fur-
thermore, lower transport costs and a more responsive transport industry would
contribute to a better integration of the Indonesian economy. The economic
rate of return on most civil works subprojects to be financed by the Bank
(representing about 88? of the Bank financed parts of the expenditure plan)
will be well above 15Z. Main risks are: (i) delays in implementation of the
action plan; and (ii) unsatisfactory implementation of the expenditure plan
because of insufficient financing or execution capability. These risks are
limited. First, the action plan was formulated with the participation of all
parties involved and essentially comprises specific and already well prepared
actions. Second, implementation of works is expected to proceed satisfac-
torily because (i) foreign funding is firm and only moderate growth of local
funding is assumed, and (ii) DGH's implementation capacity has increased
rapidly in recent years and will receive continued support under the project.

11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
