               PUNJABEDUCATIONSECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT

                           Credit and ProgramSummary
Borrower:      Islamic Republic of Pakistan

Implementing   Government of Punjab
Agency:

Beneficiary:   Province ofPunjab

Amount:        SDR 69.5 million (US$lOO million equivalent)

Terms:         Standard IDAterms; 35-year maturity with 10-year graceperiod

Description:   The purpose of this sector adjustment credit is to provide financing for the Province
               o f Punjab, which has embarked on a wide-ranging reform agenda to improve fiscal
              management, promote devolution and improve service delivery starting with
               education. The credit would be the first of a series of three adjustment credits to
               support the Government of Punjab's medium-term sector-wide reform program to
               enhance access and quality of education.
              Punjab i s reallocating public expenditures towards education and other pro-poor
              programs, and implementing national initiatives on decentralization and the
               accompanying public finance and management reforms, usingthe education sector as
               the leading sector. The Government has developed a Punjab Education Sector
              Reform Program (PESRP) Strategy that i s consistent with the National Education
               Sector Reform Program. The Punjab ESRP has three pillars: (A) public finance
              reforms to realign expenditures at the provincial and district level toward education
               and other pro-poor expenditures; (B) devolution and public sector management
              reforms; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and
               governance of the education system. These reforms will be fully implementedover a
              three-year period. The first two pillars of the reforms are also supported by the
              Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the Punjab Resource Management Program
              (PRMP). The Punjab Government has also developed a Provincial PRSP, which,
              inter alia, supports the devolution of decision making and finances to districts and
              provides the impetus for public finance and management reforms. These reforms are
              being undertaken concurrently. As earlier experience in Palustan shows, education
              sector reforms cannot be successful without reforms in public finance management
              and governance. While significant actions were taken prior to the first IDA Credit,
              this reformprogramenvisages completionoffuture actions byFY06.

Benefits:     The main benefits come from reversing the slide in education indicators, bringing
              more children (particularly poor children and girls) into school, up to grade 8 sooner
              than previously expected, and providing them with better quality education. The
              program would contribute to closing the "social gap" and helping the country
              achieve progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to
              poverty reduction and Education For All (EFA). Improvements in education
              outcomes in Punjab, the largest province in Pakistan, would have a country-wide
              impact and success could motivate other provinces to follow a similar path and

              undertake sector-wide reforms. Another indirect but important benefit i s that the
              program would help strengthen decentralization by increasing the role o f districts
              and promoting accountability between service users (parents and students) and
               service providers (schools and teachers).

Risks and     The major risk comes from Pakistan's history o f unfulfilled promises o f sustained
Mitigation     support to the education agenda. Factors that mitigate this risk include: (a) the fiscal
Strategy:      situation has improved and the federal government has agreed to provide Punjab the
               fiscal space necessary for this operation; (b) the Punjab Government i s driving the
              reform program and has the full backing o f the provincial Chief Executive; (c) the
              district governments, through the Nazims, have been consulted and support the
              program; (d) there i s an increasing realization inPakistan o f the strong links between
              education - particularly girls education - and economic growth; and (e) there i s a
              strong determination to reverse the slide inthe country's social indicators.

              Another major risk lies in the evolving roles and responsibilities o f the district
              governments relative to the provincial Government, as the new system o f devolved
              government i s gradually put inplace. Factors mitigating this risk are: (a) the Terms
              o f Partnership betweenprovincial and district governments which clearly define their
              roles and responsibilities for program implementation; (b) fiscal decentralization in
              Punjab i s more advanced than in other provinces; (c) compared to other provinces,
              Punjab has greater alignment between district governments and the provincial
              govemment.

              The potential lack o f fiscal sustainability o f the reform program, beyond the three
              year proposed period o f IDA assistance, i s also a risk. This i s mitigated by the fact
              that: (a) Pakistan i s on the path o f economic recovery with GDP growth and fiscal
              revenues greater than anticipated in FY2003; and (b) the provincial government
              expects to use ADB support to reduce its expensive debt-servicing, thereby fieeing
              space inthe budget for increasing education expenditures beyond the period o f donor
              assistance.

              Weak departmental capacity to implement and monitor the program i s another
              important risk.This i s being mitigated by: (a) the establishment, for the first time, o f
              a unit in the provincial education department that will deliver capacity building
              programs and monitor program implementation; (b) preparation o f detailed baseline
              information and advanced planning by district governments; (c) engagement o f
               School Councils in school monitoring; and (d) establishment o f external third party
              surveys to report progress on the ground.

              There i s a risk that School Councils will not be allowed to function as needed, or
              they may have weak capacity. This risk i s being mitigated by issuance of appropriate
              legal, financial and administrative guidelines to empower school councils, as well as
              bycontractingwith NGOsfor capacity development o f School Councils.

   IDA PROGRAMDOCUMENTFORA PROPOSED SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
                           TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
                 FORA PUNJABEDUCATIONSECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT

                                              I.OVERVIEW

1.       Education service delivery reforms are a priority for Punjab. Although Punjab has
slightly better education indicators than Pakistan as a whole, it fares poorly incomparison to other
low income South Asian countries. The rate o f participation in the education sector i s very low
(47% male, and 43% female primary net enrollment rate); and adult literacy rates (57% for males
and 36% for females) are also among the lowest inthe region. The quality of the education system
i s in question. The system has low intemal efficiency, with a high rate o f dropouts and repeaters.
There are substantial disparities across different regions of the province. Low family income, high
costs of school materials, poor quality of teaching and inadequate inii-astructure are the main
constraints to greater access. The service delivery of the education sector (like other social services
in the province) also suffers from poor governance, weak financial management, and an over-
centralized decision making process, which contribute to poor quality and low access. Fully
cognizant of the importance of human capital development for fostering economic development
and reducing poverty, the Government of Punjab has given high priority to improving service
delivery inthe education sector.

2.       Punjab is seizing the opportunity to improve education service delivery, taking
advantage of the recent decentralization and accompanying reforms to strengthen public
finance and management. The objective of these reforms, which are anchored in the national
decentralization program and are consistent with federal financial management and governance
initiatives, i s to strengthen public service delivery. The synchronization of education sector reform
with this broader reform to improve public service delivery is critical. As evident from earlier
experience, such as the Social Action Program (SAP), marked improvements in education service
delivery cannot be attained unless education sector specific reforms are accompanied by systemic
reforms inpublic service delivery that devolve finances and decision making to the local level and
strengthen financial management and governance.

3.       The Punjab education service delivery reformwhich this credit seeks to support has
three main pillars: (A) public finance reforms that realign (increase) public spending toward
education (and other pro-poor services) and ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that
strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and governance; and (C)
education sector reforms that improve quality, access, sector governance, and publidprivate
partnerships. The objective o f the reformprogram is to increase Pakistan's human capital inorder
to reduce poverty and spur sustained economic growth. In doing so, Punjab may come closer to
attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets related to universal elementary
education and gender parity. The specific measures ineachpillar are as follows:

4.       Public finance reforms. Under these reforms enacted under the Medium-TermBudget
Framework (MTBF), the Government i s realigning public expenditures toward pro-poor
services with a focus on education by: (1) increasing provincial public sector expenditures by
providing additional budget (as conditional grants) for district governments ifthey allocate more of
their own non-program resources to education and meet the performance targets defined in Terms
of Partnership (TOP) agreements(see paragraph 7); and (2) ensuringfiscal sustainabilityby freeing
fiscal resources through better revenue collection and reduced expenditures required to service
debt.

5.       Devolution will be strengthened, and the fiduciary environment and governance will
be improved by: (1) supporting fiscal decentralization by devolving decision malung on resource
allocation to the district level; (2) developing an implementation framework that clarifies the roles
o f key stakeholders and institutionalizes performance-based budgeting (see paragraph 7); and (3)
strengthening governance and the fiduciary environment through reforms in financial management
andprocurement.

6.       Education sector reforms. To improve education sector performance the Government i s
taking measures to:

         (1) strengthen education governance through: (a) the establishment of transparent
             criteria for teacher recruitment and deployment, as well as a major re-orientation inthe
             teaching cadre (with an increasing proportion of teachers -at least 20% - having
             facility-based contracts); (b) effective use of School Councils (SCs) to strengthen
             stakeholder participation in education; and (c) improvements in monitoring and
             evaluation of the education sector;

         (2) increase the quality of education sewices through: (a) the provision of higher quality
             and more relevant teacher training; (b) higher quality textbooks and learning materials;
             and (c) the institution o f student learning assessments; and

         (3) improve equity and access through: (a) free textbooks for primary school students; (b)
              free tuition up to matriculation (grade  lo); (c) stipends for female students; (d) greater
             access through partnerships with the private sector; and (e) increased financing for
             school improvements and provisiono f missingfacilities.

The Punjab Government i s working inpartnership with districts, NGOs and SCs to implement this
reformprogram.

7.       An integral part of the reform is the clarification of government roles under the
decentralization program and the introduction of incentives to improve service delivery.
These reforms are embodied inthe Terms of Partnership (TOP) agreements between the district
and provincial governments, initiated for the first time in Pakistan. The TOP improves the
transparency and efficiency in the financing and management of the education sector by clearly
definingthe responsibilitiesand obligations of districts and the province inplanning, implementing
and monitoring the education system and use o f funds. The TOP also provides financial and
performance based incentives for districts to improve their education service delivery. Duringthe
first year, districts receive earmarked grants for education upon signature o f the Terms of
Partnership (TOP).      The size o f the second and outer year grants will be determined by the
attainment of education performance outcomes and the increase in district expenditures on
education agreed under the TOP. Finally, the TOP agreements increase client participation in
service delivery by requiring district and provincial governments to take all necessary
administrative and financial actions to assure that the SCs are effective partners o f the education
system. This innovative mechanism shouldplay an important role inimproving the performance of
the public education systeminPakistan.

8.       Government commitment to reform is evident in its early implementation of several
first phase reforms. The Government quickly enacted the first phase of the reforms including,
inter alia, a 20% nominal increase (16% real increase) in education expenditures inthe 2003-2004




                                                                                                       2

budget approved in June 2003. The Chief Minister announced the education reform program in
January 2003 soon after taking office.

9.        The success of the program will be measured by its ability to meet Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs related to universal elementary education and gender
parity are the main indicators that will be used to measure the success of the reform. These
outcome indicators, which are the same as those used for monitoring the PRSP, include male and
female gross enrolment rates for primary and middle level schools, as well as completion rates at
the primary level. To achieve these outcomes, intermediate output indicators will be monitored,
including: the number of functioning schools, the proportion of schools with basic facilities, the
number of trained teachers, as well as the reduction in teacher absenteeism. As noted above,
accordingto the TOPS, if certain districts cannot achieve these outcomes, there will be a reduction
inthe province's financing for educationprovidedto these districts.

10.        The reform program in Punjab is closely linked to three major national level
initiatives: (1) The national Education Sector Reform (ESR) spearheaded by the Federal
Ministry of Education. The strategy is intendedto improve the quality of education and improve
access across regions, gender and income level. The objective of the ESR i s to establish the
foundation for an Education For All program and is closely linked to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and other macro-level government initiatives such as the Devolution Plan;
(2) The nationalPRSP' which specifies that: (a) measures taken in the education sector are an
integral part o f the Government's reform program; (b) the responsibility for implementation rests
with districts led by elected local governments; and (c) education sector reforms complement the
broader governance and economic management reforms undertaken by the provincial government,
with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB); and (3) The national devolution plan
which, through the Local Government Ordinance (LGO) 2001, has devolved decision malung and
finances to districts.      Under Pakistan's Constitution, education i s a provincial subject.          The
devolution plan further devolved education financing and service delivery responsibilities to the
newly-formed district governments. Punjab i s leading the other provinces in its effort to fully
implement the national decentralization initiative, usingeducation as the leading sector.

11.       The focus of the reform is consistent with the findings and recommendations of the
PakistanPoverty Assessment and the World Development Report 2004 (WDR). The Poverty
Assessment identified access and equity as fundamental problems that need to be addressed to
improve education outcomes. The analytical framework o f the WDR, "Service Delivery for the
Poor" stresses that public service delivery i s strengthened when the long route o f accountability -
through voice and social compact        -  works in conjunction with the short-route o f accountability2 -
client power. The relationship of accountability among policy makers, service providers and
clients i s key to assuring quality services. Inthe case of education, the client is the student and/or
parent, the service provider i s the school, and the policy maker i s the government authority
responsible for that sector. The needs of the client are complex and are better addressedby placing
responsibilities at the level o f the district government or lower, than at the provincial or federal


  The I-PRSP was presented at the Bank and IMFBoards on December 4 and 6, 2001. The Government o f
Pakistan completed the full PRSP on December 31, 2003. The 111 PRSP titled "Accelerating Economic
Growth and Reducing Poverty: The Road Ahead" has been placed on the web for public dissemination at
www.finance.gov.pWpover@lprsp 03.pdf.
* According to the WDR the long route o f accountability between service providers and the clients exists
when the service provider (e.g. schools) responds to the Government, and the Government then responds to
citizens i.e. the relationship is indirect, The short route occurs when service users interact directly with
service providers, i.e. through school councils.



                                                                                                          3

level.   School Councils (SCs) that represent client interests are the best way to ensure the
accountability betweenthe client and service provider.

                                   11.THENATIONAL         CONTEXT

12.      Pakistan has been able to reverse a very tenuous macroeconomic situation, with
growth reaching 5.1 percent in 2003. The turnaround was attributable to good economic
management which increased confidence inthe country's economic future. The country's exports
rose sharply to US$10.9 billion, and foreign exchange reserves climbed to US$10 billion3.
Revenues improved due to better collection o f the General Sales Tax (GST). At the same time,
expenditure constraints were relieved in part by better debt management, made possible by greater
access to concessionary financing. The Government profited from these developments, including a
drop in real interest rates, by re-profiling its debt and reducing debt servicing expenditures. The
fiscal resources released as a result permitted an expansion o f expenditure in areas o f great need,
such as the social sectors. (See Table 1below).


13.      Economic growth has not generated major improvement in income poverty. Growth
has reduced poverty slightly from the early 199Os, but the poverty headcount remains high: one in
three Pakistanis live below the poverty line. Table 3 shows the link between income, education
and literacy, and shows that the linkage i s very strong both in urban and rural areas; a child from a
family in the highest quintile is almost twice as likely to attend school as a child from the lowest
quintile.


14.      Growth has not translated into adequate improvements in non-income dimensions of
poverty. Pakistan's human development indicators, e.g. education, lag far behind other countries
inSouthAsia. The primary participation rate is 20% below the average for countries with similar
levels o f income, with 40% fewer girls inthe relevant age bracket attending primary classes. Infant
mortality rate i s higher and contraceptive use i s lower. (See Table 2 below).


15.      The Federal Government has embarked on education reforms. Conscious o f its weak
performance in education, and cognizant o f the adverse impact o f poor education performance on
sustained economic growth and poverty, the Government has embarked on a reform of the
education system. The reform has two main elements: a fundamental overhaul of the education
system, based on the national Education Sector Reform (ESR) Strategy, and a comprehensive
reform o f public finance and governance reforms, including a major devolution o f power to the
districts.




 Currently the foreign exchange reserves exceed US$12billion.

 16.      The national sector-wide Education Sector Reform (ESR) Strategy is designed to
 address poor performanceof the educationsector and the factors that led to exclusion based
 on gender, regional and income differentials. The ESR establishes the foundation for an
 Education for All program and i s linked closely to the PRSP and other macro-level government
 initiatives, such as the Devolution Plan. The key elements of the ESR Strategy include: (i)
 improving access and equity for Quality Universal Primary Education through improving school
 infrastructure; (ii)increasing literacy through adult literacy programs; (iii)supporting technical
 education in secondary schools; (iv) improving quality of secondary education; (v) quality
 improvements through revision o f national curriculum and textbooks, strengthening teacher
 training, and establishment of a National Education Assessment System (NEAS); (vi) increasing
 access through public-private partnerships; and (vii) mainstreaming madrassah4education through
 introductionof general education subjects.

 17.      Public service delivery is being strengthened through decentralization and
 accompanying public finance and management reforms. The Government realizes that
 improving public service delivery requires comprehensive reforms to improve governance and
 financial management and accountability. The Government has therefore embarked on a major
 decentralization effort and accompanying nation-wide public financing and management reforms.
 Some reform measures are already being implemented, in line with the comprehensive reform
 agenda under the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). These reforms include

               111.EDUCATION     SECTOR PERFORMANCEINTHE PUNJAB: KEY ISSUES

18.      With apopulationof 83.7 million(56% ofthe country's population) and anominal GDP of
about $60 billion (purchasing power parity GDP o f about $250 billion), Punjab occupies a pivotal
role in Pakistan's economic and political life.         Its economy i s well balanced, with strong
agriculture, and urban-based activity driven by the 26.5 million people living inurban areas (53 %
o f the country's total urban population). A rapidly growing population - which has quadrupled in
the last fifty years has, however, created a multitude of problems and challenges that are almost
                      -
all poverty related. These challenges need to be addressedurgently.

19.      In many ways, Punjab determines the direction of national policies. As Punjab is the
largest province, improving the living conditions in Punjab implies improvement in quality of life
for the majority of people in the country. More important, however, is the leadership role that
Punjab has acquired inpolicy issues, which gives the province a central role inthe national reform
agenda. Any action that i s not adopted by the largest province i s considered that much more
difficult to adopt by other provinces. On the other hand, any policy decision taken by Punjab,
opens the way for other provinces to adopt a similar policy stance. This critical role of Punjab in
shaping national policies has to be kept in view when supporting sectoral policies and structural
reforms.

20.      Punjab has slightly better human development indicators than Pakistan as a whole
(see Table 2); however it fares poorly relative to other South Asian countries. A very large
proportion o f the adult population (40%) i s illiterate and less than two thirds o f the province's
school-age population i s enrolled in public primary schools. The Net Enrolment Rate (NER)
stagnated in the 1990s even declining slightly until 1998, before improving slightly to 45%
(compared to 42% nationally) in 2001-025. O f those enrolled in the first year of primary school,
only half complete four or more years of education. The dropout rate from the public school
system (43% ) i s also very high. The internal efficiency o f the education system remains weak:
retention rates are low and there i s a high proportion o f repeaters in primary and elementary
classes. There are also substantial regional disparities inaccess to education. The population's low
education level i s a major contributor to poverty in Punjab and poses significant constraints to the
realization o f sustained economic growth.

21.      Likethe nation as a whole, the main issues affectingeducationsector service delivery
in Punjab are (i)insufficient resources allocated to education; (ii)systemic weakness in
public sector delivery, including over-centralization and inadequate management; and (iii)the
poor performance of the education system (interms of quality, access and governance). These
are discussedbelow.




 The 2001-2002 PIHS data cited in this report are based on the original estimates provided by the Federal
Bureau of Statistics (FBS). These estimates have been reviewed by a technical committee establishedby the
Federal Government to review definitional issues.


                                                                                                       7

A. Public Finance-Insufficient and unpredictablepublicspendingon education

22.      The overall financial situation of Punjab is very constrained, and the province has a
large debt burden. Punjab receives about 80% of its revenues as transfers fkom the Federal
Government and, despite recent positive developments, the amount o f federal transfers has been
limited. The Province's own revenue efforts have not made up for financial shortages and the
revenue potential of the broad-based and buoyant taxes assigned to the province have yet to be
realized. Provincial expenditures are also burdenedwith structural rigidities. Nearly two thirds of
the budget i s earmarked for an excessively large provincial establishment and large debt servicing
obligation, primarily to the federal government.       Rapidly growing salary, pensions and debt
servicing obligations further constrain resources for development, operation and maintenance
(O&M) ofprovincial infrastructure andpublic services.

23.      Insufficientfinancing of educationhas adverselyaffectedquality and access. Over the
past 5 years, spending on education as a proportion of total recurrent expenditures declined from
around 29% in 1997/98 (inwhich the share of elementary education was a little more than half) to
just over 25% in 2000/01. In addition, the share of education in development expenditures has
declined, falling sharply from around 9% in 1997-98 to a mere 2% in 1999-2000. Overall, the
Province's public education expenditure representsonly 1% of provincial GDP and nearly all of it
i s pre-empted by personnel cost.

24.      The problem of insufficient spending has beencompounded by unpredictability,with
resources per student fluctuating widely from year to year. From 1991 to 2001, per capita
expenditures on elementary education (primary and middle) fluctuated inreal terms. The average
annual increase inreal expenditures per elementary student over the period was 0.8%   - the standard
deviation in the rate of increase was 11.5%, making year-to-year planning impossible. Low and
uncertain financing has hampered the ability o f the education system to adequately plan and utilize
its resources, compromising service delivery.

B. GovernanceandPublic Sector Management

25.      The over-centralized management of the system by the Provincial Education
Department and weak fiduciary management hamper public service delivery. The province
has traditionally maintainedcontrol over financing and decision making, with little role for districts
and local authorities. Until the recent devolution, the provincial Department of Education was
responsible for service delivery in over 50,000 schools with over 500,000 employees. Decisions
including, inter alia, recruitment o f teachers, procurement of school furniture, and signing small
contracts for school improvements were centralized at the provincial level.            Even minor
disciplinary problems were referred to the provincial authorities. Over-centralizationcompromised
the quality of service delivery by weakening the relationships of accountability between policy
maker, service provider and clients.

26.      Weak provincial financial management and procurement practices further
undermine service delivery. Inadequate mechanisms to track and monitor expenditures, the lack
of accurate reporting, and weak local procurement capacity plague the provincial financial
management system. The provincial government's control over financial management and
procurement has made district-level capacity for managing resources even weaker and less
effective than that found at the provincial level. Similar problems in financial management and
procurement hindered effective implementation of the Social Action Program in the 1990s and,
unless addressed, would continue underminingreforms o f the education system.



                                                                                                    8

C. Poor Performance of the Education Sector

             (1) Education Sector Governance

27.     The province has ineffective mechanisms for ensuring staff accountability.              The
Punjab Education Department i s one of the largest employers in the country (over 500,000 staff),
yet it has limited capacity to monitor staff performance. Teacher absenteeism has emerged as a
central service delivery issue, with rates as high as 30 percent in some areas. High teacher
absenteeism emanates fi-om political interference in postings and transfers, weak monitoring and
supervision, and lack o f accountability inthe system. Especially problematic are the guidelines of
the outdated Civil Servants Act, which make it virtually impossible to fire staff when necessaryby
preventingactionagainst poor performers.

28.     There is limited stakeholder participation at the local level. The education sector in all
provinces o f Pakistan has experimented with the formation o f School Councils (SCs) or School
Management Committees (SMCs) for monitoring school performance, disbursing maintenance
funds, hiringtemporary teachers, and motivating parents and community members to meet school
needs. Although School Councils have intermittently had control over school maintenance funds,
they were not empowered to take administrative decisions, making them largely ineffective. The
recent decentralization effort requires a clarification o f SC roles relative to other actors so that



                                                                                                   9

these institutions can become the main instruments in promoting client participation in school
management, thereby strengthening service delivery.

29.      The existing system for monitoring education outputs and outcomes requires
strengthening. The current system depends almost exclusively on two main instruments: the
Education Management Information System (EMIS); and the Pakistan Integrated Household
Survey (PIHS). The EMIS i s a school-based systemthat has the status of an annual school census;
its main objective i s to measure both outputs and outcomes. The EMIS i s generally regarded as a
system that presents dated information, and i s not an independent data source given its reliance on
departmental staff for data gathering. The PMS reports on key education sector outcomes and
reports on gross and net enrolment and dropout rates by province, area and gender. The PMS does
not provide data disaggregated by district. The Federal Government has raised questions on the
PMS questionnaire and the quality o f data collection and analysis. A technical committee was
established which has provided recommendations for improvements. The CWIQ (Core Welfare
Indicators Questionnaire) survey under the PRSP umbrella i s designed to develop a district level
baseline on PRSPrelated indicators.

             (2) Education Quality

30.      The quality of education deliveredthrough the government managed school system is poor
due to: (i)low levels o f teacher competence with many untrained teachers; (ii)        high teacher
absenteeism (see paragraph 27 above); (iii)inappropriate curricula and textbooks that include
outdated and inappropriate material; (iv) outdated pedagogical methods; and (v) inadequate
teaching materials and aids. The institutional infrastructure for in-service training exists, but the
content o ftraining i s weak and hasnot had an appreciable impact on skill levels. The curriculum i s
not adjusted regularly and i s increasingly unsuitable for modernneeds. Pedagogic methods rely on
rote learning and high stakes examination. Most textbooks do not have accompanying teacher
guides, nor do they possess adequate teaching materials. Finally, there is no system for carrying
out periodic assessments of teachers or student learning outcomes.

              (3) Equity andAccess

 3 1.     Poverty, low levels of parents' educationand lack of access to facilities are important
 factors explaininglow school attendancein Pakistan. (See Poverty Assessment 2002 and Table
 3 above). The cost o f education is one of the main reasons cited by poor families for not sending
 children to school. This cost includes school fees, expenditures on textbooks anduniforms, and the
 opportunity cost of children's time. Low parents' education level, which i s strongly associatedwith
low family income, also negatively impacts the likelihood that a child will attend school. Access
difficulties and distances to schools-particularly        for girls-in isolated and rural areas also deter
attendance. In addition, poor quality school infrastructure (i.e. schools do not meet minimum
quality standards), such as boundary walls, toilets, drinking water, and electricity lowers
participation (Figure 1). Indeed, absenteeism among enrolled children is higher in schools with
missingfacilities.

              (4) Private Sector Role

32.      Access to education services (both quality and, particularly access) would have been
worse without the rapid expansion of the private sector. The Census of Private Schools (2000)
showed that Pakistan has as many as 36,000 private schools, of which almost 24,000 are inPunjab.
Among these private schools, nearly two thirds (65 percent) are in urban areas, and the vast
majority (80 percent) are primary and middle schools6. Table 4 shows that private schools have
provided schooling to children from low income households. However, given their ability to pay,
the majority of private schools benefit those in the middle and upper income quintiles.                    The
majority of poorer andrural households still remain dependent on low quality public education'.

range from 700,000 to 1 million. A large number o f the Madaris offer free education, and free room and

33.      The Government has realized the need to harness the private sector in improving
education access for the rural and urban poor. The Government established the Punjab
Education Foundation (PEF) to promote private sector education. This entity provides loans and
grants from its endowment income and donated public funds. However, the PEFhas two problems
inreachingthe poor: (a) resources are mostly concentratedinthe urbanareas andinschools for the
better-off; and (b) the PEF charter allows for too little independence from Government. These
factors have inhibited the PEF from facilitating low cost private sector growth in rural and poor
urban areas.

                Iv. PUNJAB'S EDUCATION         SERVICE DELIVERYREFORM PROGRAM

34.      Punjab is the first province to significantly reallocate public expenditures toward
education and other pro-poor programs, and to implement national initiatives for
decentralization and accompanying public finance and management reforms, using the
education sector as the leading sector. The Government has developed the Punjab Education
Sector ReformProgram (PESRP) Strategy, which i s consistent with the National Education Sector
Reform Program.        The Punjab ESRP has three pillars: (A) public finance reforms to realign
expenditures at the provincial and district level toward education and other pro-poor expenditures;
(B) devolution and public sector management reforms; and (C) reforms to improve quality, access
and governance o f the education system. These reforms will be fully implemented over a three
year period. The first two pillars of the reforms are supported by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) under the Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP). The Punjab Government has
also developed a Provincial PRSP, which, inter alia, supports the devolution o f decision making
and finances to districts and provides the impetus for public finance and management reforms.
These reforms are being undertaken concurrently.           As earlier experience in Pakistan shows,
education sector reforms cannot be successful without reforms in public finance management and



board. The Federal Government has recently approved a Madrassah Reform Program which will be
implemented throughout Pakistan, and would bring the Madaris into mainstream education through provision
of textbooks, teacher training, equipment, and grants etc.


                                                                                                     12

governance. While significant actions were taken prior to the first IDA Credit, the reformprogram
envisages completion o f future actions by FY06.

A. Public FinanceReformsto Increasethe Leveland Share of EducationExpendituresand
     ReduceUncertainty

35.      Punjab i s increasing provincial and district expenditures on education based on the
MediumTerm Budget Framework ina fiscally sustainable manner.
         (1) Increase Public Expenditure on Education
36.      The medium term budgeting framework increases the provincial expenditures on
education (and other pro-poor services) and ensures fiscal sustainabilityby creating fiscal space
throughreducing the debt servicingburden. This framework also provides additionalfundingfor
district education programs if the districts allocate more o f their unrestricted (non-program)
resources to education and meet performance targets set out inthe TOP agreements (see paragraph
7).

37.      Action Taken. The Government has adopted a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF)
that:

          (1) increases provincial expenditures on education by more than 50% over a three year
              period (at least 35% inreal terms), mostly for primary and middle schools. The overall
              pro-poor share' o f provincial expenditures will increase from 53% in 2002 to 70% in
              2005. Since the current Government took office in 2002 it has increased real per
              student expenditures on elementary education by 38%, with an overall education
              budget increase of 20% innominal terms; and

          (2) ensures the fiscal sustainability o f increased education expenditures by reducing debt
              servicing expenditures through retiring expensive Federal Government debt and
              mobilizing concessional donor assistance (ADB and IDA).

38.      Future Actions. The Government will continue to: (i)     increase provincial expenditures for
education according to the Medium Term Budget Framework; (ii)            allocate conditional grants to
districts based on TOP agreements and achievement o f agreed targets; (iii)use the normal
mechanism for resource transfers (outside the reform program) from province to districts (PFC
grant formulag), and from year 2 onward, include a matching grant element for those districts that
increase their own resource contribution to education; and (iv) replace expensive borrowing from
the Federal Government with cheaper debt, including borrowing from the IDA and ADB, thus
creating fiscal space to finance the program even when donor support is not available.

          (2) Reduce Uncertainty in ResourceAllocation toEducation

39.      This reform helps to decrease the uncertainty inpublic expenditures in education both at
the provincial and district level.

40.      Actions Taken. The uncertain resource availability will be improved by the Medium
Term Budget Framework described above. This will give managers and planners a better idea o f
resources available, and allow better planning. The uncertainty at the district level i s being reduced
bythe introduction o f a formula set upbythe Provincial Finance Commission (PFC). This formula,
based on objective data and applied in a transparent way, i s used to calculate the amount o f fiscal
resources to be transferred to the districts.

41.      Future Actions. Future general budget transfers (outside the program) will continue to be
based on the transparent PFC formula. The conditional grants financed under the program will be
divided into two parts inyears 2 and 3. One part will be linked to performanceinachieving specific
targets defined and agreed to in the TOPS. The other part o f the grant will be distributed using the
PFC formula. It i s expected that, from year 2 onward, the PFC formula will no longer be
predominately based on population data, but will be revised to give greater weight to poverty
indicators.


' According to the PRSP, pro-poor expenditures include mainly spending on social sectors, basic
infrastructure and rural development. If Punjab borrows IDA finds for social sectors, the Federal
Government absorbs the exchange rate risk making IDA even more concessional to the province than to the
Federal Government.
9 The Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) formula has beenset up as a transparent and predictable way to
transfer general resources from the Province to the Districts.  Its current formula i s heavily based on
population data.


                                                                                                     14

B. Devolutionand Public Sector Management Reforms

          (1)SupportDevolution

42.      The reform supports devolution through measures that (i)decentralize financing and
decision making to the district level; (ii)       increase accountability o f districts for resource use; (iii)
clarify the roles o f all government levels; and (iv) strengthen the capacity o f districts to assume
their newresponsibilitiesunder decentralization.

43.      Actions Taken. Devolutioni s beingsupported by: (i)            transferringgeneral budgetresources
as a single line budget transfer to the district governments' accounts (Account 41) in accordance
with the interim resource allocation formula developed by the Provincial Finance Commission
(PFC). These transfers include provisions for new teacher positions. Teacher recruitment i s taking
place at the district level based on the recruitment policy and merit criteria developed by the
Provincial Government; (ii) transferring to Districts' Account 4 additional allocations (over
                                  fully
and above the single line transfer) as outcome-based conditional grants in accordance with the
TOPs signed through the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) (see paragraph 7).
To date, thirty TOPs have been signed out o f the thirty four Punjab districts, with the expectation
that all thirty four will be signed duringFY2004; (iii)        within the framework of the TOP, clarifying
the roles o f the provincial and district government inplanning, implementingand monitoring the
education system and use of funds; and (iv) supporting district departments' financial management
capacity development through the ADB-financed Devolution Support Program (DSP), and funding
for district education departments' capacity development programs through the newly established
ProgramMonitoringand ImplementationUnit (PMIU) inthe Department of Education.




10Provincial Government funds move through different accounts . Account 1 is for resources managed by
the province, and Account 4 is for resources managedby the district. The funds transferred to Account 4 are
transferred as a single line (non-earmarked) transfer. The districts prepare their annual budgets (development
and recurring costs) on the basis o f this single line budgettransfer. Inaddition to this transfer, the conditional
grants provided under the PESRP are earmarked for the educationsector.


                                                                                                                15

44.      Future Actions. The Government will: (i)           implementperformance linked budgetingat the
district level starting inthe secondyear of the reform. Part of the PESRP funds will be transferred
to districts that meet performance targets and increase their own expenditures on education. Other
PESRP funds will be transferred to districts according to arevisedPFC formula (see paragraph41);
(ii) thePFCformulatotakegreateraccountofneedsandpovertyatthedistrictlevel,and
    revise
provide incentives for district governments to increase their own resource contributions to
education;    (iii)strengthenthe capacity of districtsto assume increasedresponsibilitiesunder
decentralization by implementing a capacity building program that: (a) provides financial
management and accounting training to district officials; (b) supports district efforts to build
School Council capacity, including the use of NGOs; (c) provides support for streamlining
monitoring arrangements; and (d) strengthens the district offices of the Education Management
Information Systems (EMIS).

         (2) Strengthen Governanceand the Fiduciay Environment

45,      The reform supports an improved governance and fiduciary environment through measures
that strengthen financial management and procurement capacity at both the provincial and
district levels. These reforms are also supported through the ADB-supported Provincial Resource
Management Program.

46.      Actions Taken.           Financial management reforms (see paras. 89-91) include: (i)
establishment of the Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) in the Department of
Education, which i s responsible for expenditure reporting; (ii)development of accounting
procedures to track program expenditures; and (iii)           authorization, by the Finance Department, of
the recruitment of 250 qualified finance and accounting personnel in district and provincial
govemment departments.            Procurement reforms (see paragraph 92) include: (i)removal of
requirements for pre-registration of contractors; (ii)development of standard procurement
guidelines for the purchase o f goods; (iii)     increasing the threshold for community contracting up to
Rs. 200,000"; and (iv) greater authority for School Councils to manage and implement these
contracts.

47.      Future Actions. The Government will continue to strengthen its financialmanagement
capacity, both inreporting and accountability, through: (i)         development of a new chart of accounts
under the PIFRA (see paragraph 17) project; (ii)computerization of financial management
processes; (iii) training accounting staff and auditors; (iv) hiringan additional 250 qualified finance
and accounting personnel; (v) regular quarterly reporting of financial flows by the newly
established PMIU inthe Department of Education, including expenditures, outputs and outcomes at
the provincial level; and (vi) ensuring timely audits, and the clearance of audit backlogs by Year 3
to assure that expenditures are being used for their intendedpurposes. Inthe area of procurement,
future actions include regularly updating the Composite Schedule of Rates (CSR) for civil works
procurement to reasonably reflect prevailing market prices. By Year 3,                  the CSR would be
replaced by independent surveys o f market rates. Starting in FY04, annual third party ex-post


''Thisamount   i s sufficient for school boundaries, toilets and repair and maintenance.


                                                                                                       16

procurement audits will be contracted by the Education Department, and programs and schedules
for regular training o fprocurement staff will be developed.

C. EducationSector Reforms

48.      There are two core areas addressed in Punjab's Education Sector Reform Program:
(i)improvements insector governance; and (ii)improvement inaccess and quality. The
Provincial Government recognizes that implementing far-reaching, sector-wide reforms i s a
formidable exercise. The Government has therefore adopted a phased approach for the program.
Under this approach, the Provincial Government i s implementing an ambitious reform agenda up to
the elementary level during the first phase, and will move up to the secondary and high school
levels by the thirdyear o f the program.

        (1) StrengthenEducation Sector Governance

49.     The reform supports improvements in education sector governance through the
implementation o f measures to: (a) improve teacher management; (b) strengthen School
Councils; and (c) strengthen monitoring and evaluation.

        (a) Improve Teacher Management

50.     The reforms will improve teacher management by increasing transparency in
recruitment, reducing teacher absenteeism, and achieving greater local involvement in teacher
selection through changes inrecruitment policy.

51.     Actions Taken. The problems o fteacher accountability andhighrates o f absenteeism are
being addressed by: (i)changing the terms o f contracts with new teachers from standard civil
service recruitment to site-specific, fixed-term contracts, with almost 20% o f the teaching staff
already recruited through such contracts; and (ii)introducing district monitoring mechanisms to
curb absenteeism and monitor local schools. Transparency in teacher recruitment, postings and
transfers i s being enhanced through: (i)  new merit-based recruitment criteria, based on a point
system, which favors recruiting women and local candidates; and (ii)temporarily freezing
transfers o f education management staff, duringthe first year, to provide continuity.

52.     Future Actions       The Government will (i) that at least 30% o f all elementary
                                                        ensure
teaching staff have site-specific, fixed-term contracts rather than the standard civil service
recruitment arrangement; (ii)   complete a study on the existing constraints faced by the teaching
cadre and recommend possible structural changes that could improve the quality o f teachers; (iii)
implement specific teacher management reforms, including possible separation o f administrative
and teaching cadres based on the recommendations o f this study12;(iv) establish criteria to measure
teachers' performance and develop measures that reward good performance; and (v) take additional
measures to improve accountability and reduce absenteeism, such as using third party surveys to
evaluate changes inteacher absenteeism.




l2DFIDwill also provide technical assistance inassessing the viability o f separating the teaching
and management cadres.


                                                                                                 17

             (b) Revitalize School Councils

53.      The reform program revitalizes School Councils (SCs) in order to strengthen the link
between stakeholders (clients) and providers (schools), and improve service delivery.

54.      Actions Taken. The provincial government and district governments have taken several
actions to strengthen School Councils, including: (i)  an agreement on the role of SCs, included in
the TOPs; (ii) issuance o f guidelinesby the provincial government clarifying the role of SCs,
                the
including their authority to undertake small procurement of works; and (iii)   contracting NGOs for
provision o f capacity support to SCs insix districts duringthe first year.

55.      Future Actions. Future measures to strengthen School Councils include: (i)     the issuance
o f guidelinesby the Finance Department to the Accountant General's office indicatingthat SCs can
spend government funds allocated to them; (ii)   specifying inthe TOP that district governments will
take requisite actions to ensure that SCs receive future funding; (iii)    selection of NGOs in six
selected districts to provide capacity support to the SCs to implement their new functions during
the first year, and expansion to all districts in subsequent years; (iv) a phased plan to spread this
capacity buildingacross additional districts in future years; and (v) the issuance of guidelines to
clarify the powers and responsibilities of SCs inmonitoringteacher absenteeism.

             (c) Strengthen Monitoring & Evaluation

56.      The education reform program strengthens monitoring and evaluation to inform
education policy and allow performance-based financing of education services.

57.      Actions Taken. The Government has taken the following steps to improve monitoring and
evaluation. It has: (a) developed district education profiles and established baseline indicators of
education performance for the reform program; (b) agreed on monitoring targets with the districts
and included them in the TOPs; (c) established a Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit
(PMIU) in the Provincial Education Department; and (c) approved an education awareness
campaign for disseminating information about the reform program.

58.      Future Actions. The Government will take several actions to strengthen monitoring and
evaluation. These measures include: (i)  commissioning independent third party surveys, by external
agencies, in order to ensure that the program i s on track. The first such survey will be initiated in
FY04; (ii) the results o f the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey to
            using
monitor PRSP indicator^'^; (iii) strengtheningEMISto make it more responsive to education sector
monitoring and evaluation needs; (iv) strengthening district EMIS offices; (v) engaging SCs for
monitoring school performance, starting with 6 districts in FY04; (vi) making information on the
reform program available to the public through the media and the Department o f Education's
website; (vii) making performance indicators fkom the M&E system publicly available, starting in
FY04; and (viii) launching a province-wide education awareness campaign duringthe first year o f
the reformprogram.




l3
 Many o fthe PRSP indicators are also Punjab EducationReformindicators.


                                                                                                  18

          (2) Improve Education Quality andAccess

59.       The reform will enhance the performance of the education sector (e.g. achieving universal
primary enrollment, improving student learning outcomes, and achieving gender parity) through
removal of constraints to access and improvements inthe quality o f education services.

              (a) ImproveAccess to PublicEducation

60.       Actions Taken The Government has addressed the problem o f access and equity by: (i)
introducing free schooling up to the matriculation level (tenthgrade); (ii)    providing free textbooks
for primary school students; (iii)   implementingthe Universal Primary Education (UPE) programin
eight districts with support from UNICEF, and with the collaboration o f NGOs. Through this
program, focused assistance i s provided to districts to help enroll primary school age children who
are not attending school, and retain those already attending; and (iv) introducing a special
~cholarship'~program for all girls in grades 6-8 (the age group where dropouts start to increase),
initially targeting 15 disadvantaged districts with low literacy levels. This scholarship i s conditional
on monthly attendance and school certification and, to ensure transparency, monthly posting of the
list of eligible girls at the scho01'~.

61.       Future Actions. The Government will take further actions to improve access including: (i)
an expansion of the girls' scholarship program based on its evaluation after the first year of
implementation; (ii)expansion o f UPE program to 10 additional districts; (iii)provision of
infrastructure and staff to non-functional schools16; (iv) closure o f non-viable schools"; (v) based
on EMIS data and its validation, consolidation o f public schools serving the same purpose in a
locality into coeducation schools at the lowest grades; and (vi) improving existing school
infrastructure (see Table 6 for baseline and targets) through the provision of basic facilities such as
boundary walls for girls' schools, toilets and other infrastructure improvements, thereby reducing
the backlog o f missing facilities to ensure that at least 60% of schools are provided missing
facilities inthe three year period.

              (b) Improve Quality of Education

62.      Actions Taken The Government has taken the following actions to improve the quality o f
teaching and textbooks. Teaching quality will be improved by: (i)establishing a system o f
continuous training with the objective o f providing on-going training to every teacher every three
years; (ii) undertaking an independent evaluation (with DFID support) to improve the content of
the training program and make it more relevant for classroom practices; (iii)        establishing teacher
resource centers in the districts; (iv) establishing a University o f Education for managing all in-
service teacher training programs; (v) establishing a system o f ongoing student assessments. Based
on a recently concluded evaluation of this system, the Government has started promotion exams
from Grade IV onwards. The Government strives to improve the quality of teaching materials by,
(i) theScienceandMathematicscurriculum,withtheapprovaloftheFederalGovernment;
   revising



l4   Tuition has been made free up to grade 10 and the term scholarship refers to stipends. Scholarship is
    the common term inPakistan.
l5  The scholarships will be transferred to each girl directly by postal money order and funds will be
    transferred about four times per year.
l6  Non-functional schools are those in which either infrastructure or teachers are missing, but there are
    existing or potential students.
l7  Nonviable schools have no potential students intheir catchment area.


                                                                                                       19

and (ii)developingnew textbooks consistent with the new curriculum -to this end the Government
has already announced its intention to open up textbook development to competition.

63.     Future Actions The Government will take the following actions to improve the quality of
teaching and textbooks.     Teaching quality will be improved by: (i)using the results of the
evaluation of the teacher training program to design subsequent teacher training programs; (ii)
developing teacher manuals for specific textbooks and making them available to all teachers
starting from the program's third year; (iii)  developing teacher support systems such as teacher
guides to accompany textbooks; (iv) implementing pilot testingo f student learningachievements in
grade 4, beginning in FY04, as a part of the National Education Assessment System (NEAS)
program; and (v) developing a more extensive province-specific student learning assessment based
on the World Bank study of learning achievements in public and private schools. The quality o f
textbooks will be improved by: (i)  awarding textbook development contracts through a transparent
and competitive process, with authors external to the Textbook Board selected by an independent
selection committee established for this purpose; and (ii)
                                                         opening textbook printing and publishing
to competition.

             (c) ImproveAccess by StrengtheningPublicPrivatePartnerships

64.     The reform program will facilitate greater private sector participation ineducation service
delivery in order to improve quality and access. The program will strengthen public-private
partnership through a restructured Punjab Education Foundation(PEF).

65.     Actions Taken.       The Government has taken the following actions to strengthen
private/public partnerships: (i)Cabinet approval o f a draft law, for restructuring the Punjab
Education Foundation (PEF) to include an independent Board and Chief Executive with financial
autonomy, which will enable it to function independently as the financial and technical support
mechanism for the low cost private and NGO sector; (ii)       provision of budget support to the
Foundation for FY04 to enable it to begin its work after it i s restructured; (iii)initiation of a
public-private partnership program under which almost 7,000 government school buildings have
been leased to the private sector for running afternoon schools; and (iv) an "Adopt A School
Program" under which private and public institutions and philanthropists finance improvements in
public schools.

66.     Future Actions. The Government will take the following actions to strengthen public/
private partnerships: (i)implement the proposed legislation to restructure the PEF; (ii) expand the
scope o f PEF functions from urban to rural areas and make it the main mechanism for financing
private and NGO service delivery inthe education sector; (iii)undertake a review of the policy and
legal environment as it affects private schoolinginthe province and develop policies to facilitate its
expansion; (iv) support innovative publidprivate partnership programs, based on the results of the
World Bank assisted study on student learning achievements inpublic and private schools; and (v)
expand existing successful public-private partnerships to increase coverage in the education
system.

                                    V. THEPROPOSEDCREDIT

Country Assistance Strategy

67.     The Bank Group's program priorities in the Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) are to: (i)strengthen macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (ii)



                                                                                                  20

improve the business environment for growth; and (iii)improve equity through support for
pro-poor and pro-gender equity policies. The CAS was presentedto the Bank's Board in June
200218. In the education sector, the Bank's support focuses on interventions that would help the
goal o f achieving universal primary education, with particular focus on improving the quality o f
education provided, and giving priority to the poor and disadvantaged, particularly girls and
children in rural areas. Accordingly, CAS includes an adjustment credit for an education sector
reform. The proposed sector adjustment operation is consistent with the CAS as it promotes policy
reforms to improve the cost-effectiveness of government programs and to reduce inequities. It also
promotes investments required to increase the educational attainment of the population of Punjab,
particularly the poor and women, which i s crucial for the country's ability to grow economically
and alleviate poverty. The proposed operation i s expected to help Pakistan come closer to the
MillenniumDevelopment Goal of Universal Primary Educationby 2015.

68.     The Bank Group's strategy supports the need for concessionary financing to re-
profile debt. The sharp economic slowdown since the early 1990s and the corresponding increase
in the incidence of poverty is mainly an outcome of Pakistan's debt problem. Debt servicing
(along with highlevels of defense spending) preempted a large proportion of budgetary resources,
leaving inadequate funds for poverty reduction and social and economic development (for details
see Pakistan: Public Expenditure Review, 2003). Despite significant improvements in Pakistan's
debt situation in the last three years through the use o f concessional donor assistance that helped
convert expensive debt into less expensive debt, the burden o f external debt i s still very high. The
need for reducing dependence on market loans and expanding access to concessionary facilities
remains strong. Thus, besides helping the Punjab government to finance its ambitious education
reform program, the Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC) will also help the
National Government inits debt management efforts.

69.      The Bank has been working closely with the IMF and has been instrumental in
encouraging donors to build stronger partnerships in support of the Government's reform program
and its PRSP. The IMFprogram i s ahead o f targets, and the proposed Bank support will be within
the fiscal space limits agreed with the IMF. DFID i s working inparallel with the Bank to provide
technical assistance to Punjab for strengthening capacity and monitoring and evaluation. The
program i s well-coordinated with the ADB-supported Punjab Resource Management Program
(PRMP), and i s usingthe MTBFdeveloped underthe PRMP.

Finances andFinancialManagement Systems

In order to improve its public finances, the Punjab Government is undertaking a comprehensive
program for fiscal and financial management reform. This program i s being supported by the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), under a US$450 million, three-year Punjab Resource
Management Program(PRMP). The keyelements o f the Programare:
    Strengthening provincial revenues through: (i)    rationalization and restructuring o f provincial
    taxes with a broader tax base, especially agricultural income tax and General Sales Tax (GST)
    on services; (ii)  enhancing non-tax revenues and user chargers by rationalizing rates and
    strengthening collection of abiana (water charges) and user charges on urban services; and (iii)
    improving tax and revenue administration.
    Rationalizing provincial expenditure through (i)   re-profiling     reducing provincial debt by
    moving from more expensive to less expensive loans; (ii) ing and reducing contingent
                                                                  co
    liabilities; (iii)
                    phasing-out untargeted subsidies; and (iv) rationalizing and improving public
    accountability o f public spending.
    Improving effectiveness, predictability and accountability of provincial financial management
    through: (i) preparation of transparent, user-friendly budgets within a MTBF; (ii)  establishment
    and implementationo ftransparent, formula-based systems o f inter-government financial flows;
    (iii)transparent and efficient procurement of goods and services; and (iv) timely, reliable and
   publicly accessibleaccounts.
    Improving strategic programming o f public investments through development of: (i)a
    medium-term, poverty-focused investment strategy; (ii)      effective systems and procedures to
    operationalize provincial goals and priorities (with initial focus on health, education and
   municipal services); and (iii) improved monitoring, feedback and evaluation systems.
   Restructuring and strengthening the Government's administration and human resource
    development through: (i)    reforming, restructuring and enhancing the capacity o f provincial
    agencies responsible for policy, planning, and fiscal and financial management; (ii)
   rationalization o f provincial staffing and enhanced skill levels; (iii) merit-based, transparent
   and institutionalized system for recruitment, promotions and transfers; and (iv) mainstreaming
    commitments to gender equity.
   Fostering private sector development through: (i)restructuring public regulatory and
   administrative agencies and promoting public-private partnerships; (ii)      ensuring transparent
   security of property rights and improved utilization o f land assets through an effective land
   registration and management system; (iii)providing effective support mechanisms for
   facilitation of investment, public-private partnerships and employment generation; and (iv)
   reducing direct public sector involvement ineconomic and/or commercial operations.

Objectives andDesignofthe PunjabEducationSector Adjustment Credit

70.      The objective of the proposed credit is to provide financing to progress toward the
MDG targets relatedto primary education and gender parity. This operation would be the
first part of a medium-term programto support sector-wide development through a series of single-
tranche adjustment programs linkedto achieving specific qualitative and quantitative targets inthe
education sector. By targeting Pakistan's largest province (with 56% of the country's population),
the credit covers a major part of the challenge to meetingMDGgoals inPakistan.

71.      This sector adjustment credit occurs inthe backdrop of decentralization, which has brought
executive authority to a level closer to beneficiaries.    This credit would help prioritize the
education sector, and would create incentives for improving performance as subsequent funding
would be based on both implementation progress and overall performance. Furthermore, it would
promote policy reforms at a time when improvement in the macroeconomic situation allows
increased fiscal space for support to education. Finally, the credit would support a provincial
reformprogramthat i s focused on improving education outcomes.

72.      The Government's reform programis proposedto be supported through a Sectoral
Adjustment Loan (SECAL) instrument. Punjab is implementing system-wide reforms, such as
new teacher recruitment policies, revitalization of School Councils, restructuring the Punjab
Education Foundation to support low cost private education, and establishing conditional grants
under Terms of Partnership agreements. The reformprogram is backedby a significant increase in
the education budget. Such reforms are better supported through a SECAL, as it i s a suitable
instrumentto finance a reformprogramthat seeks to bring significant policy changes. A SECAL i s
also a more appropriate instrumentto support cross sectoral areas linkedto the education reform
program such as the fiscal decentralization process and governance reforms. Further,lessons from
Bank experience with investment projects and with the Social Action Program Project inPakistan
show that policy reforms require support beyond sector line ministries. A SECAL can provide such
support as this instrument has greater visibility than investment projects and facilitates policy
dialogue at the highest government level, while sustaining the attention o f the political leadership
and senior government officials. According to the provincial Medium Term Budget Framework,
the three-year reform program requires significant financing; a SECAL can provide this financing
inatimelymanner.

                  received.

Sustainability of Sector Financingafter the Reform Program Period

76.      Sustainability o f PESRP targets would require continued, strong commitment of the
Provincial Government to education in terms o f deepening the Program and translating this
commitment into budgetary allocations that are consistent with the PESRP objectives. The PESRP,
as designed, i s likely to generate a stream o f recurrent expenditure needs in the post-program
period. These expenditure requirements, which are over and above the normal growth in sector
spending, are required to meet the operation and maintenance costs for the civil works and
institutions developed under the Program, and for continuation o f Program initiatives. These
factors will lead to a 12.5% p.a. increase in education sector recurrent expenditure in the post-
PESRP period. Regarding the development expenditure, additional funds would be required to
meet the needs for growing enrollments at the primary level and to mitigate its fallout impact on
the middle and secondary school systems. However, as almost all missing facilities in primary
schools are expected to be provided under the PESRP, large allocations for the missing facilities
will no longer be required,thereby reducing the effect on the development budget. The net effect
o f these factors will lead to only a 2.5% increase inthe development budget o f the education sector
in 2006/07-2009/10. Overall, expenditures inthe education sector areprojectedto increaseat 11%
per annum inthe post-PESRP period.

77.      Based on the Program's assumptions, the overall revenue of the Punjab Government i s
expected to increase at a rate o f over 10%per annum during2006/07-2009/10. On the other hand,
overall provincial expenditure i s projected to grow by only 9% per annum, although much higher
increases are projected for expenditures in high-priority sectors, e.g. education and health. This i s
partly an outcome o f eliminating untargeted provincial subsidies, lower interest expenditures due
to early retirement o f federal loans and lower expenditure increases in other sectors. This implies
that after allowing for the increase in education and other high-priority expenditures, the fiscal
position o f the Punjab Government will continue to improve and the large fiscal deficit of 2003/04
i s projected to reduce and eventually turn into surplus by 2008/09. Therefore, if the Punjab
Government implements its overall reform program as designed, the fiscal sustainability o f PESRP
will be guaranteed, even under the scenario o f mild fiscal shocks (e.g. some moderate increase in
public sector salaries, or shortfalls infederal revenue collections).

 Poverty, Gender and SocialImpact Analysis

 78.      Policies andprograms supportedby this credit arepro-poor and aim at reducing gender
 inequities. The program seeks to provide access to schooling for poor and underserved areas.
 Incidence analysis of public education expenditures in Pakistan shows that these expenditures are
 clearly pro-poor and thus, even without the full impact of reforms, the increased spending on public
 education will benefit the poor. The operation also aims at reducing gender disparities by focusing
 on increasing girls' access to education, while reducing inequities by emphasizing increased access
 to schooling for vulnerable urban andrural poor.

 79.      Theprogram has been designedon the basis of extensiveconsultationswith stakeholders
 and benejiciaries, including in-depth meetings and discussions with local government ofjicials,
 district education teams, and NGOs. These consultations have built ownership of the program
 among the stakeholders. The emphasis on revitalizing School Councils i s a key element o f the
program, which aims to enhance community and parental involvement ineducation, particularly to
 improve teacher and school management and enhance enrollments. NGO participation i s a major
 aspect of the program. The Government i s engaging NGOs for mobilization and capacity building
 o f School Councils, as well as for increasing access in underserved areas. Other publidprivate
partnership efforts will be supported through a restructured Punjab Education Foundation, which
 will provide financial support to low-cost private sector institutions and NGOs to help increase
 access to schooling among the urban and rural poor. Through supporting increased private
participation in education service delivery, the Punjab Government aims to ensure equity by
 focusing on districts withthe lowest education indicators, and emphasizing reductions inthe urban-
rural disparities by encouraging private sector provision inunderservedrural areas.

 80.     An overarching objective of the PESRP is to reduce gender inequities in the province.
To this end, the Government has launched a female scholarship program targeting girls in middle
 school (in the districts that have the lowest literacy rates in the first year) to help increase girls'
`enrollment and retention. Other efforts to address the gender issue include the Punjab
Government's policy to recruit female teachers, and the provision o f missing facilities such as
boundary walls and toilets for girls' schools.

 Safeguards and EnvironmentalIssues

 81.     The program will finance minor rehabilitation o f existing schools to provide essential
missing facilities that will enable increased girls' enrollment and retention.             The Punjab
Government's policy confirms that no substantive large-scale construction that i s likely to have
irreversible environmental impacts i s planned. According to Punjab Government policy and
guidelines regarding school rehabilitation, should a need for construction o f new facilities arise,
land will be acquired through voluntary donation, will be free of encumbrance, identified by the
community and the location will be feasible. The title of any such land will be vested with the
Government, and in case o f loss o f livelihood o f vulnerable people, the community mitigation
planswill be acceptable to the affectedpersons.

82.      The Punjab Government's environment policy also ensures that environmental safeguards
and specifications (such as toilets to be constructed at a reasonable distance from classrooms to
ensure good hygiene, drinkingwater for schools to be o f the same quality as that available to the
local community, and minimal loss of plantation ensured during any minor constructionwork) are
inplace against any possible adverse impacts associatedwith any rehabilitation work, andthese are
includedinthe TOPSwith the district governments.

Monitoring and Evaluation System

 83.     A ProgramMonitoring& ImplementationUnit(PMIU) hasbeenestablished for the overall
coordination and facilitation of the reform program and i s responsible for consolidating
information on expenditures, outputs and outcomes at the provincial level. The PMIUwill issue an
annual monitoring report and benchmarks for a set of key indicators, which would be key triggers
for possible further financing of the reform program by the IDA. These indicators have been
established with the participation of the district govemments. The PMIUi s also establishing a plan
for streamlining and strengthening the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in
collaboration with district governments.        The UK Department for International Development
(DFID) has agreed to support this initiative; it has conducted a study to assess the M&E
requirements o f the education program, and expects to provide focused technical assistancesupport
to the PMIU to enable it to perform its M&E functions. The Govemment also recognizes that
administrative data provided through EMIS could be subject to potential conflict of interest. In
view o f this, independent third party surveys will be conducted to provide an extemal assessment
o fperformance. The Govemment will also use feedbackreceived from the proposed CWIQ survey
under PRSP, whichis expected to commence during the latter part of FY04.

84.      ThirdParty Surveys. The Govemment will commission independent third party surveys to
ensure that the program i s on back. External agencieswill be contracted to assessprogress inareas
such as reduction in teacher absenteeism, timely availability of books, transparent disbursement of
scholarships, improvements in school facilities, and the role o f school councils, etc. The first such
survey will be initiated inFY04.

85.      Output Indicators. The proposed monitoring matrix developed by the Govemment o f
Pakistan for the education sector in the PRSP emphasizes three main output or intermediate
indicators for the sector: (i)number of functioning schools, (ii) oftrainedteachers and, (iii)
                                                                    number
reduction in teacher absenteeism. These indicators are also core intermediate indicators for the
PESRP (see Table 6 -OutputIndicators).

86.      Outcome Indicators. The outcome indicators that are included in the PRSP monitoring
framework will be used, including enrolment rates for primary and middle school levels, and
completion rates at the primary level (see Table 6).

The TOPSbetweenthe Province andthe district governments include agreeduponbenchmarks and
targets for eachof the key input, output and outcome indicators identified above, which will be
usedfor monitoringperformance.

Capacity Building

87.      The Government has undertaken areview o f capacity buildingneeds for implementation o f
the reformprogram, particularly regarding some of the key initiatives such as the identification and
implementation of missingschool facilities, the awarenesscampaign, distribution o f girls' stipends,
free textbook distribution, establishment of SCs, teacher training and monitoring and evaluation.
Inmostcases, systemsareinplacetoundertake theseactivitiesefficiently andinatimelymanner.
However, in some cases there i s a need to motivate staff to revive and rejuvenate procedures that
have become sluggish. Inother cases there i s a need to institute new mechanisms and procedures.
The PMIUhas developed a plan to ensure that the requisite measures are inplace, and that there i s
an appropriate capacity buildingplan. The three broad areas inwhich there are significant needs for
capacity building are monitoring and evaluation, strengtheningof school councils and enhancing
teacher training programs.

88.      A comprehensive programfor strengtheningthe existing monitoring and evaluationsystem
i s being developed collaboratively among the PMIU and EMIS.Adequate financial resources have
been allocated for this purpose in the budget. NGOs will be contracted for developing a training
program for strengthening school councils.       The PMIU has initiated discussions with several
potential NGOs for this purpose in selected districts.       While the University o f Education i s
responsible for teacher training, it requires considerable strengthening to improve the quality and
relevance of its training program. The Government o f Punjab i s evaluating the program, and
intends to restructure the existing training program during FY04. DFID is expected to provide
technical assistance for M&E and capacity building over a six year period starting in FY05. In
FY04, the Government has also allocated program budget for capacity building activities. The




                                                                                                  30

combination o f Government financing and DFID support should cover the financing needs for the
capacity buildingnecessary to implement the program.

FinancialManagement

89.      The key issue i s the Government's ability to ensure that h d s are used inthe manner and
for the purposes for which they were intended. From the financial management perspective, the
CFAA revealed several weaknesses in data reliability, particularly below the federal level.
However, a number o f initiatives and actions are currently being implemented to remedy a
significant number o f lapses, in order to further strengthen the accountability process. Among
these initiatives i s the PIFRA at the federal, provincial and district levels (see paragraph 17).

90.     The Provincial Finance Department has responded to the need to improve financial
management at the district level and in all provincial departments by initiating the recruitment o f
qualified finance and accounting staff, many o f whom will be located in the districts. This
department i s also developing intemal audit and control functions through the already established
Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) in the Department o f Education which, in
addition to monitoring and program evaluation, i s responsible for developing and implementing
need-based capacity programs at the district level. Recruitment o f intemal audit staff at the district
level will commence inFY04.

91.     To ensure proper tracking o f education sector expenditures under the reform program the
following specific measures are being implemented:


         0    Education expenditures are being reported in greater detail through the introduction o f
              specific heads o f accounting;
              The District Accounts Office will prepare and send consolidated reports o f
              expenditures to the Education Department (PMKJ), as well as              to the provincial
              Finance Department.        This information will be cross-checked with information
              available from the Executive District Officer (EDO-Finance);
         0    Information on utilization o f funds will be tied to physicalprogress and targets for each
              district.   This will enable the Finance Department to justify additional financing
              requests for each district, when necessary; and
         0    The PMKJ has been staffed with qualified accountants who will develop and
              implement focused development programs to build district education departments'
              financial management capacities.

ProcurementIssues

92.     The Government o f Punjab i s undertaking broad procurement reforms to improve
economy, transparency and accountability inthe procurement process, and to eliminate procedures
and practices that impede competition.         Under the ADB, the Punjab Resource Management
Program (PRMP) i s developing streamlined and simplified rules and procedures for use by the
procuring agencies at the provincial and local government level. The Government i s also taking
steps to develop capacity. The Finance Departmenthas developed a timeframe to implement these
improvements in procurement processes. The education sector program i s likely to benefit from
reforms at the provincial level, including :
    >   Contracts above Rs. 50 million will be based on pure market competition and the
        Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) will no longer be used for these contracts. Contracts



                                                                                                     31

        under Rs. 50 millionwill continue to use the CSR. The CSR hasbeenrevised, and will be
        revised every six months usingmarket price data. The CSR will be fully phasedout over a
        two to three year period.

        All procurement for civil works will no longer require pre registration of firms. This will
        open the biddingprocessto all firms. Contractor qualification requirements and evaluation
        criteria will be specified inthe biddingdocuments, and evaluation of bids will be according
        to the specified criteria.
        Adequate time will be allowed to bidders for preparation and submission of bids, and the
        practice of Gallop tendering will be restricted to emergencies in exceptional cases with
        prior approval of the Headof the implementing agency.
        Standard specifications for furniture procurement will be defined and, based on this,
        district govemments will procure furniture fkom local contractors through open bidding.
        School Councils (SCs) will be authorized to undertake works up to Rs. 200,000. For those
        schools in selected districts o f Punjab where School Councils have been established and
        their capacities developed with the assistance of NGOs, the SCs will be progressively
        responsible for procurement and supervision of civil works pertaining to rehabilitation of
        their existing school building and development of missing facilities (such as boundary
        walls, toilets etc.) through community-based construction.
        Capacity development and training programs for procurement staff will be implemented,
        and capacity o fprocurement staff at the provincial and district level will be strengthened.
        Sample ex post procurement audits will be included inthe independent third party surveys
        beinginstitutedfor the PESRP.

CreditAdministration

93.     Borrower and Credit Agreement. The proposed credit would be made to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The credit proceeds would
be transferred by the Federal Govemment to the Government of Punjab under agreed terms. The
credit would bereleased ina single tranche.

94.     Disbursements. The proceeds of the credit would be transferred to the Government o f
Punjabupon effectiveness of the credit.

BenefitsandRisks

95.     This is a high-bene$t, high-riskprogram. The mainbenefits come from reversingthe slide
ineducation indicators, bringingmore childreninto school upto grade 8 (particularly poor children
and girls) sooner than previously expected, and providing them with better quality education. The
program would contribute to closing the social gap and helping the Country progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty reduction and Education For All
(EFA). Improvements in education outcomes in Punjab, the largest province of Palustan, would
have a country-wide impact, and success could motivate other provinces to follow a similar path
and undertake sector-wide reforms. Another indirect, but important, benefit i s that the program
would help strengthen decentralization by increasing the role o f districts and promoting
accountability between service users (parents and students) and service providers (schools and
teachers).




                                                                                                   32

96.      The major risk comes from Pakistan's history of unfulfilledpromises of sustained support
to the education agenda. The factors mitigating this risk are: (a) the Punjab Government i s driving
the reform program and has the full backing of the provincial Chief Executive; (b) the district
governments, through the Nazims, have been consulted and support the program; (c) there i s an
increasing realization in Palustan of the strong links between education - particularly girls'
education -and economic growth; and (d) there i s a strong determination to reverse the slide inthe
Province's social indicators.

97.      Another major risk lies in the evolving roles and responsibilities of the district
governments relative to the Provincial Government, as the new system of devolved government i s
gradually taking shape. Factors mitigating this risk are: (a) the Terms of Partnership agreements
clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the provincial and district governments for program
implementation; (b) fiscal decentralization inPunjab i s more advanced than inother provinces; (c)
compared to other provinces, Punjab has greater alignment between district governments and the
province.

98.      There is also a risk from weak financial management capacity at the provincial and district
level that could hamper implementation of the reform program and its activities. This risk i s
mitigated by a series o f factors, including a special unit at the provincial level that will help build
district education departments' financial management capacity. At the same time, the ADB
Devolution Support Program (DSP) i s supporting capacity development o f provincial and district
finance and accounting departments. The capacity of accounts and audit staff will also be
strengthened throughPIFRA.

99.      The potential lack of fiscal sustainability o f the reform program, beyond the three year
proposed period of IDA assistance, i s also a risk. This i s mitigatedby the fact that: (a) Palustan i s
on the path of economic recovery with GDP growth and fiscal revenues greater than anticipated in
FY2003; and (b) the provincial government expects to use ADB support to reduce its expensive
debt-servicing, thereby freeing space in the budget for increasing education expenditures beyond
the period of donor assistance.

100.     Weak departmental capacity to implement and monitor the program i s another important
risk. This is beingmitigatedby: (a) establishing a unit inthe provincial education department that
will deliver capacity-building programs and monitor program implementation; (b) preparation of
detailed baseline information and advanced planning by district governments; (c) engagement o f
school councils in school monitoring; (d) strengthening local governments in monitoring schools;

district govemments; and (0commencement of an education awarenesscampaign.
(e) establishment o f external third party surveys to report progress on the ground, with support o f


101.     There i s a risk that School Councils (SCs) will not be allowed to function as needed, or
they may have weak capacity.        This risk is being mitigated by issuing appropriate financial and
administrative guidelines to empower SCs, as well as by contracting with NGOs for capacity
development of School Councils.

102.     There is an inherent riskwith single tranche adjustment operations that once resources are
disbursed, there will be little incentive to follow through on the reform agenda. This is mitigated
by the fact that: (a) all key actions are upfront; (b) a three-year reformprogram and an attendant
MTBF has been developed with strong ownership of the Provincial Government and wide
dissemination of results; and (c) reversals would jeopardize future operations. This operation
would be the first in a series of single-tranche operations with strong M&E systems focused on



                                                                                                    33

triggers for following-year adjustment operations. The M&E systemi s fully financed inthe FY04

       SUBJECT: U T T EROFSECTOR DEYELOPMENTPOLICY
                      t                                        P              RAMm      .



                      The Punjab Govemment is strongly committed to putting in place deep-
       seeded reforms that can bring about visible improvements in the education sector.
       Education is the core and foremost priority of the of the Punjab Government, and this
       commitment has been demorytrated by the Punjab Govenunat's first policy action on
       taking charge which was to make education free till Grade 10. This was followed by
       developing a comprehensive medium-term education reform program for which World
       Bank assistance was sought. A clear indicatorof our commitmentcan be seen inproviding
       unprecedented increase in the budget for the education sector, a first for Punjab. The
       Provincial Government has also appointed a strong team to oversee the reform program.
       Benefiting f" the national reform program which has devolved m i c e delivery to
       district governments, Punjab is the first program to develop agreements with the district
       governments to implement this education reform program


                      Owing to decades of neglect, Pakistan's education indicators compare
       poorly with those of other countries inthe region, and even with those at similar stages of
       economic development. The performance of the education sector in Punjab has been
     * equally disappointing.It has been besethistoricallywith a hostof issues that have impeded
       the provisionofquality educationinpublic schools. These issues haverangedfrom uneven
       political commitment to improvements in access to, and quality of education, insufficient
       allocations, lack of expenditure prioritization resultingin the lop-sided mix of salarylnon-
       salary componencs, frequent policy changes, high m o v e r of personnel in leadership
       positions and poor governance pncticcs. All these have contributed to low participation
       and retentionrates.


                      Monovcr, spending on education as a proportionof ncurrtnt expenditures
       has also declined, from around 30.9% (in which the share of elementary education is
       between 55% to 58%) in 1997-98 to just over 26% in 2000-01. Similarly, the share of
.      education in development expenditures fell sharply from around 9% in 1997-98 to
       approximately 5%     in 2002-03. Combined with the frequent fluctuations in msource

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 1I
availability per student in real terms these developments have contributed to uncertainty,
particularly with respect to the provisionof criticalnon-salaryinputs.


                Punjab's primary Gross Enrollment Rate(GER) of 76% and Net Enrollment
Rate of 45%, (though marginally higher than the national averages of 72% and 42%              .-.
respectively) illustrate the problcm of limited access to education, which is more severe in
the case of females and rural inhabitants. The provincial GER for boys (84%) is. 15
percentage points higher than that for girls at 69%, while the urban-ml differential is,
even starker (the urbanGER is 94% while the rural enrollment rate stands at only 70%).


                The internal efficiency of the education system remains weak with low
retention rates and a high proportion of repeaters in primary and elementary classes. Over
the years, enrollment ratios at the primary level first increasedand then stagnated,but with
little improvement in the drop out rate. The Punjab EMIS estimates the dropout rate at
primary level in government schools to be 55%, while that at the elementary level to be
almost 80%, signalingpoor eff;ciencyofthe public educationsystem.


                 The low participation rates at the higher levels of education further signify
the public system's inability to retain students. The Punjab GER at the middle level of
educationwas 45% in2001-02 with an urban GER of65% and a ruralrate of 36%'. At the
secondary level, the urban and rural GERs for Punjab were 66% and 33% rerpcctively,
giving an overall participation rate of 42%. GERs at the secondary level exhibited a wide
gender differential, with the GER for males being 55% compared with the GER for
females of34%.


                 While the disappointing levels of enrollment arc partly owing to household
poverty, other factors that have affected participationrate to date include a sex-segregated
system of schooling, poor selection of school sites, the imbalanced provision of
 infrastructure and non-salary inputs-with a large number of institutions lacking h i c
 facilities, the non-availability and maldistribution of teachers, and their casual attitude
 towards duty. Non merit-based recruitment of teachers coupled with poor supmirion,
 weak accountability mechanisms and inadequatetraining of staff has resulted in rampant
 teacher absenteeism and a workforce that is ill-equipped to ftltlll its teaching
 responsibilities, thereby adversely affecting the quality of instruction in govemmcnt
 schools.


                 Presently close to 4,600 schools are closdnon-functional due La the
 inappropriate location of schools and long periods of recruitment bans. Moreover, 3,615
 (8.2Y0)primaryschools are shelter-less and anotha 1.7% of middle and secondaryschools
          .. . .
 require buildings. Around 15.3% of primary schools and 16.5% of elementary and
 'Themoleand    fenulc G@Rain elenienury grp& were fairly similar at 46% urd43% respectively,

                                                                                             Page 4 of II
secondaiy school buildings are in need of major repairs. The lack of basic facilities in
governmentschools is pervasive.Boundarywallsare requiredin 84% of primary and 36%
of elementary and secondary schools, while toilets are missing in 39% of primary and
close to 29% of elementary and secondaryschools. More than 85% ofprimary schoolsand
30% of elementary and secondary schools require firmitun and around 11,600 primary
schools needadditional classrooms. Finally, 3,500 primary schools needto be upgradedto-"
middle level and 1,862 (30%) of middle schools await upgrading to the level of a
secondary institution.


              The inferior quality of schooling delivered by the public school system is
forcing even the less privileged householdsto seek private education for their children in
privateschools that cater to all income ranges.


              The privatesector is taking on a more prominent role not only in the main
urban centers (where 65% of the private schools are located) but also in rural areas of the
relativelyamuent districts of the province. We, therefore, find that of the 36,000 private
schools in the country, 24,000 arc located in Punjab, of which 78%, 15% and 5% a n
involved in delivering primary, middle and higher education respectively, with 94%
providingmixedschooling.


ProposedEducationReform Program


               Recognizingthe importance of education for economic growth and social
hannony, the Government of Punjab has decided to initiate far-reaching reforms in the
education sector. These reforms form an integral part of the a) the govemance reforms
under the national devolution program aimed at improvements in efficiency, equity,
efktivcness and sustainability of public service delivery through the creation of local
ownership, responsivenessto local needsand accountabilityto the public; and b) the wide-
rangingeconomic reform program launchedby the Government of the Punjab (Go@ witb
the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the Punjab Resource
Management Prognm (PRMP). Under the PRMP the key reform mensures include the
creationo f fiscal space for financing priority expenditures through the rationalization and
restnrcturingofprovincialrevenue sources, the broadeningofthe tax baseandreductionin
provincial debt The complementary reforms being punued cover the enhancement of
capacity in financial management, upgrading of the reliability and timeliness and
transparency of financial accounting and reponing systems and the governance and
institutional reforms critical for improving the delivery of basic social scwica. The
proposed education sector reforms arc also consistent with national priorities, as
appropnatcfy reflected in the national Education Sector Reforms, Poverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (PUP) and the goalsofthe provincial PRSP.

                          The education reform program aims to improve access and quality of
          education and reduce gender and regional disparities by addressing the endemic
          weaknesses plaguing the dclivery of quality education. The decision to make schooling
          free up to the secondary level clearly reflects the strongcommitmentof government to the
          enhancementof educationindicators.                                                      .-.-

                         The primary objective is to bring about an increase in enrollment in
                                                                 0
          govemment schools, so as to enhance the gross enrollment rates at the primary and middle
          level and improve the quality of service delivery. Since the program was launched aAn
          the commcncement of the academic session in 2003-2004 in April 2004, the positive
          results expected from these reforms are likely to become visible by the end of the second
          year, the phasing would involve a 2% increase inenrollmentntes inFY 05, followed by a
          growth of 3% in FY 06. Ambitious targets have been set for improving retention rate8
          from 45% to 55% increaseincompletionratesin governmentprimary schoolsby FY 06.


                          Since educaiion up to college level has been mandated to district
          governments, ownership of the broadcontourh of the reform strategy has beendeveloped at
          the local level through extensive dialogue with representatives of district governments,
          Nazims, Naib-Nazims, DCOs and Ems,interactions with community representativesin
          School Councils and NGOs.Their concm.and recommendationshave been appropriately
          reflected inthe design ofthe reformprogramdetailed below.

                          The govcmment's priorities for the education sector hinge on three con
          areas of focus: (a) creating a better environment for learning (through an infiastructwe
          improvement plan and increased provision of non-salary inpuls to existing schools); @)
        * enhancing teacher capabilities and ensuring their presence in schools; and (c) increasing
          enrollment and retention rates through the provision of incentivesfor parents to send their
          children to schools, all contributing to improvements in access to, and quality of,
          education. The multi-pronged refonn agenda to acliieve these objectives will focus on
          raising enrollment levels at rates that would vary for different parts of the Punjab, by
          selecting an appropriate composition of interventions. The core elements of the strategy
           include distribution of free textbooks, awareness campaigns on the importance of
           education, fuading for infrastructural improvements. teacher training, enhancing the
           participation of communities in managing public schools through the reactivation of
           School Councils and stipends for girls in grades 6-8 for improving enrollment rates in
           districts characterized by low literacy and female participation rates.

                          The government is committed to increasing the reso'urces available for
         -education.   Real per student expenditures in elementary education rose by as much as 38%
           in real tcnw.. More importantly, the government's priorities on education have been
           reflected in the allocations for the proposedinitistivts/rcfam in the provincial budget for
           FY 2003-04, cven before the program had been appraised by the World Bank. Overall,

                                                                                                       Annex A

     expenditure on education has been budgetedto increascby20% in nominal terms in 2003-
     04. Of the additional budgetary allocationof Rs. 7.2 billion, Rs. 5 billion is beingset aside
     for infrastnrctural improvementsto be distributedequally between the districts in the first
     year of the program, while Rs. 2.2 billion has been allocated for the other interventions
     under this program (Rs. 500 million for School Councils, Rs. 420 million for providing
     free textbooks to all childreninprimary grades, Rs. 300 million for stipends for girls at the'""
     middle school level and an adequate allocation for teacher training and awareness
     campaigns, and a block ollocation for othcr arcas include capacity support to district
     education departments). From these resources, those earmarked for district governments
     would be additional to the normal shares o f respective districts in the provincial allocable
     amount and,will be passed on to them by crediting it to Account No. IV for spending on
     these specificactivities.

                      Additional funds for education have also beenprojectedinthe government's
     Medium-Term Budgetary Framework attached as an appendix to the provincial budget for
     FY 2004, indicatingthe government's resolve to bring about improvements in education
     indicators. Spendingoneducationwasjust under 24% oftotal expenditures in2002-03 and
     is expected to grow at 18% per annum, resultingin its share of overall expenditures rising
     to 28% in2005-06.

                      To improve both the transparency and the efficiency in the financing and
     management of the education sector and to ensure that the funds providedarc utilized for
     the purposes intended, conaactual agmments through appropriately designed terms of
     partnership agreements (that set out the responsibilities of tbc provincial and district
     g0Vm"mnts with respect to program implementation,monitoringand utilizationof funds)
     being signed with respective district governments interested in implementing the
     interventions being designed under the program. So far, 29 TOPShave been signed.
     DuMg the first year, the available ltsourcc5 will be distributed equally among districts
     entering into partnership agreements with the provincial govemmmf whereas iq later
     years, bnding will be distributed among districts based on a combination of neeh and
     perfonnancecriteria.

                      After the determined initial push in the first two years of the reform
     program, efforts in subsequentyears will focus on the consolidationof the resultinggains
     and ita expansion at the elementary and secondary levels to accommodate the growing
     number enrolling, or continuing to stay, in mainstream education by pduating from the
     lower levels.

                          Whereas all future recruitment of teachers will be on fixed-term and
          institution specific contracts, objective, transparent and merit-based criteria have been
          developed that allocate appropriate weighWpoints to local residents, science degrees and
          gender (with preferenceto female teachers for primary classes). This mechanism for hiring
          teaching staff that rewards those with relevant academic and professional qualifications
          (with a distinct bias for graduates) and experience, will also introduce accountability in
          staffrecruitment,it is hopedthat local recruitmentwill also help reduce the social distance
          betweenthe teachers and the students.


                          Inview of the importanceof effective training program to enhance teacher
          capabilities and skills, the training program presently being conducted for elementary
          leachers is under examination. The effectiven&s of this programwill be enhancedand the
          modified version will be mn for the duration of the education sector reform program to
          ensure in-service training of all teachers at least once in 3-4 years. The first phase of
          training under a nstntctured training program of an adequate number of master trainers
          will be launched on war footing. A Third Party Review of teacher competency will be
          conductedaftereach trainingprogramto assess itsefficacy.


                          Data generated by the EMIS and that available from the district

        I governments will be utilized for deploying teachers to rationalize pupil-teacher ratios.
          Shortages in teachingstaff after the completionof this redeployment exercise will be met
          throughcontractbasedfacility-specific contracts.


          Community Involvement


                          The Govemment of Punjab realizes the need to encourage greater
          community participation in the monitoringand management of education related services
          a d hns decided to promote the institution of School Councils (SCs) and significantly
          augmenttheir effectiveness.To this end, it plans to reconstitutetheir membership, narient
          their funCtiON, strengthen their capacityto enable them to satisfy government'sprocedural
          requirementsthrough training, ensure wider disseminationamongst the communhy about
          its membmhip and levels of funding andempower them to play a moremeaningfulrole in
          improving the learning environment,District governments will be encouraged to adopt

        '      The government has, therefore, initiated a three-year program aimed at
enhancing the capacity of SCs to cany out their diverse functions, Recognizing the
difiiculty of generating community involvement in the management and supervision of
public services, for the first year, focused support through the services of partner
RSPdNGOs will be provided to schools in a few tehsils of six districts that have been---              !

selected for this purpose. The SCs would be trained in accounting and financial
management to improve their comfort level with government procedures. Furthermore,
they will be allowed to implement civil works for missing facilities (for example,
additional classrooms, boundary walls, toilets and drinking water), for schemes costing up
to k.200,000.


               Awareness campaigns will be launchedon the roles and functions of these
councils including training on accounting and auditing requirements. The hnding to SCs
will be increased from the .present level and linked to enrollment. To ensure maximum
flexibility over the use of &rids, the provincial govemment will only prescribe a short
negative list of arcas on which SCs may not spend resources provided by the
ProvinciaVDistrict Government. The SCs will, therefore, have greater autonomy in
utilizing these funds for purposes such as repairs of existing infrastnrcture, provision of
missing facilities (boundary walls, toilets, etc.), hiring teachers on contract to fill
temporary vacancies (with contract periods not exceeding one year) and the distributionof
bonuses to reward better performing teachers, etc. The proposedallocation for FYMis Rs.
500 million, on the basis of Rs. 110 pcr child enrolledin all schools up to elementary level.

Stipends for Girb In Elementary Grades

               The scholarship program, at Rs. 200 per month per child, for girls emllcd
inelementarygrad- will be implemented initiallyin 15 target distriaS with literacyratios
below 40%. In these districts, stipends of Rs, 200 per month will be distributed b all
enrolled girls in grades 6 to 8 (totaling 175,525 according to recent estimates) maintaining
a minhwm of 80% attendance inschool. The instrument o fmoney orders will serve as the
 mode ofdistriiution.

                To d   e the distribution of stipends transparent, the list of all eligible girls
 will be posted in the school. Based on the effectiveness of the stipends in improving
 enrollment and retention of girls in middle grades during the first year. the scholarship
 programwould be expanded to cover other districtsinlater years.

 Improvements in Infrastructure 'and Functionrlfiatloa of Viable ClosedlPlon-

                As mentioned above, a fundfor financing school upgradation,rehabilitation
 and provision of missing facilities to schools has been established to address the huge

                                                                                                         Annex A

    infrastructural needs of the sector. To ensure the efficient utilization of these resources,
    district governments have prepared a complete inventory of their stock of physical
    infrastructurein schools. Raultantly, development works (provision of missing facilities,
    rehabilitation, etc) will now be carried out on the basis of the identifiedncedsof the sector,
    as reflected inthese district profiles.
                                                                                                  .I*..

                    Districtgovernmentswill utilize the funds for infrastructural improvements
    in schools by adhering to explicitly-stated transparentdrittria for the selection of schemes
    to be cxccuted under this program. The prioritization of schema is being carried out on
    completion of school basis so as to ensure that each school taken up under the program to
    provide missing facilities can function as an effective institution with all basic, critical
    infrastructure (boundary walls, toilets, drinking water supply, the requisite number of
    classrooms, litmitun, etc.).


                    Consistent with the objective of usingavailableresourcesmore eficiently, a
    study will be carried out to .evaluate the viability of non-functional/closed schools and
    wherever the feasibility of knctionalizing them has been established, the necessary
    complementary inputs (for example teachers) will be provided.

    Role of the PrivateSector

                    Recognizing the important role being played by the private sector in the
    provisionof education, the Government of Punjab advocates a broader role for the private
    sector and plans to facilitate its activitiesthrough a number ofmeasures,includingpublic
    private partnership schemes in wbich private schools may help to operationdizc non-
    hnctional schools and through leasing government school buildings to the private sector
, . for conducting afternoon classes.         The Punjab Government aims to build upon the
    experiences of the Community PartnershipProgram (CPP) under which over 7000 schools
    have been allotted for private sector management. The regulatory framework governing
    the private sector will be modified to offer support in such a way as to promote and
    enhance the provisionof quality education by these institutions, while addressingthe issue
     of access for the U&M    and rural poor. Duringthe tint year the government will assist the
     private sector through Punjab Education Foundation, which will be the forum to support
     public-private partnenhips. A comprehensive policy for the private sector will form an
     integralpart ofthe reforms during L e later phases of the p m w .


                     Therefore, reforms in the aforementioned anas will be supplemented by
     institutionalizing and actively promotingpublic-privatepartnerships through nstruchhg
     the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) and enhancing its autonomy and effectiveness.
     The restructuring ofPEF has been approved by the Cabinet, and the law has been tabled to
                              . .-._ -     .

                     The restructuringof the PEF involves the recruitmentof professionalstaff
     to manage its affairs, establishment of efficient appraisal, processing and accounting
     procedurcs and the introduction of transparent eligibility criteria for the distribution of
     funding to schools. The PEF is being mandated to support private schools that S C N ~
     disadvantagedchildrenand this will allow childrenof the poor to attend private schools in      ......
     larger numbers.

                     The rcstmctured PEF will also develop guidelines on bat practices and
     examples of 'model' agreementsbetweenthe public andprivatesectors for such initiatives

                     To facilitate a more accurateandtimely compilation of educationstatistics,
     Punjab EMIS, along with its field offices, will be equipped with rquisite capacity to
     enhance its effectiveness for accurate and timely data collection.            EMIS will be

                 The Government of Punjab is confident of the sustainability of the reform
  program because: (a) similar policies are being pursued nationally; @) the fiscal situation
  has improvedsubstantially (with GDP and fiscal revenuesgrowing at higherthan expected---
  rates) and there is adequate fiscal space for continuing with program interventions in the
  future fium the savings on debt smicing arising from the acceleratedrepayments of debt
  with ADB's support under the PRMP; (c) the strategy has been derived aner extensive
  consultations with district governments that articulated local priorities and needs,
  strengthened by the channeling of the funds for the bulk of the interventio?s through
  Account no. IV maintained by the district governments; (d) the district governmentg are
  entering into partnershipagreementswith the provincial g o v m e n t that clearly set out the
  roles and responsibilities of both parties in the implementation o f the program; (e) a
  number of major steps have been taken as prior actions makingreversibiliv difficult; and
  (4 the institutional changes in the education sector will forman integralcomponent ofthe
  reform agenda (far example, the implementation of transparent criteria to ensure ment-
  based recruitments, the re-structuring of the PEF to support public-private partnerships,
  and strengthening and reactivation of School Councils) that will be reinforced wherever
  necwsary by legislative changes.


                  The Punjab Government, through EconomicAffairs Division, has quested
  the World Bank to provide financing for its three-year reformprogram. A total ofUSS300
  million is required as IDA assistance over a three-year period commencing in FY2004,
  with 3100millionrequested for the fintCredit. The dialogue with the World Bank on this
 . reform programand the associated first credit started inearly 2003. The reform agendaand
.  the instruments and institutional arrangements for its effective implementation have been
   designed inconsultation with the World Bank, Satisfied with the scope, contenf;phasing
   and execution arrangements of the program, the World Bank appraised it in November
   2003, and Negotiations were held in December 2003. Based on the program, we have
   developed a three-year policy matrix (attached) which has been agreed with the World
   Bank.

                           PUNJABMEDIUM-TERM BUDGETFRAMEWORK

Introduction

 1.      Despite some significant improvement during the last three years, Punjab's fiscal
situation has remained weak. This i s mainly a result of the changes in revenue sharing formula
brought about inthe 1997 NFC Award'. The 1997 NFC Award reduced the share o f provinces in
more buoyant federal taxes (income tax and GST), while at the same time allowing them a share
incustomduties, which, becauseof tariffreforms, have been fast losing their revenue potential.
As a result, federal revenue transfers to Punjab in 1997i98 were 15% below those in 1996/97 in
nominal terms. Moreover, the average growth in federal tax transfers during the last 5 years has
only been about 7% per annum, showing a marked deceleration from the 25% per annum growth
duringthe term of the 1991NFC Award. This also compares unfavorably with the growth trend
o f 10% per annum in provincial expenditure during the five years immediately before the NFC
Award.

2.       Notwithstanding the deceleration in federal revenue transfers and the limitednumber o f
buoyant tax bases in the provincial domain, the province has made insufficient efforts to utilize
the full potential o f the relatively more buoyant taxes assignedto it (e.g. Agricultural Income Tax
and Urban Immovable Property Tax, etc.). This contributed towards the absolute dependence of
provincial finances on federal revenue transfers. Nevertheless, over the last few years, the
province has made some efforts to improve, or at least prevent, deterioration in its financial
situation.

3.       The province has made some attempts to rationalize provincial taxes by eliminating
irrelevant small taxes, improving tax compliance through lowering the rate of Urban Immovable
Property Tax (UIE'T) and standardizing and improving the structure o f Stamp Duties.             The
province's own revenues increased by 13% during 1998i99.                However, lack of additional
measures and tax administration problems led to a relative stagnation in provincial revenues
during the last three years. Because of the low growth in fiscal transfers from the federal
government and in province's own revenue, the province has continued to run significant fiscal
deficits since implementation o f the 1997 NFC Award (see Table 1). This was despite provincial
efforts to keep its expenditure within the resource envelope through strict expenditure controls.
As a result, the growth rate of provincial expenditure at present is only one half of its level of
early-1990s. While this has helped the province to keep its budget deficits from getting out o f
hand, over the years it has caused major gaps in provincial infrastructure and delivery o f social
services. Viewed only interms of province's cash balance position, however, Punjab's financial
condition i s somewhat better than those of other provinces, primarily because the population-
basedrevenue sharing formula favors Punjab.

Structural weaknesses inprovincialfinances

4.       Notwithstanding its relatively better fiscal situation, the aggregate finances o f the
province present some disturbing features.        Firstly, despite being the largest province with
significant opportunities for resource mobilization, Punjab remains heavily dependent on fiscal
transfers from the federal government. Moreover, fiscal dependence on the federal government

 assignment o f taxes, which allocates all the major buoyant taxes to the federal government. It i s
 also partly a result o f lack o f political will and weak tax administration at the provincial level
 which prohibits the govemment from mobilizing additional fiscal resources from provincial tax
 and non-tax bases.

5.             This excessive dependence on federal revenue transfers has several negative implications:
(i)makestheprovincialfinancesdependentonfederalrevenuecollection,aslargeshortfallsin
      it
federal revenue have a devastating impact on the provincial fiscal situation and makes it
impossible for the provincial govemment to execute its budget and pursue its development
objectives according to its own wishes; (ii)                         fiscal adjustment becomes more difficult as the
province has little control over its aggregate revenue; provincial fiscal and development policies
become more susceptible to pressures from the federal govemment; and (iv) accountability o f
provincial expenditure decisions gets compromised, especially to the tax payers. The provincial
government, which does not have to raise taxes (or user charges) to provide public services andor
infrastructure to its citizens, i s likely to be less prudent about the quality o f its expenditure
decisions.

6.             In addition, provincial expenditure is marred with acute structural rigidities.                                                   An
excessively large provincial establishment and provincial debt (mainly to the federal government)
makes personnel expenditures (salaries, allowances and pensions) and debt servicing dominate
the provincial budget, allowing it to allocate only meager amounts for essential non-salary non-

interest expenditure heads.          This imbalance between wage and non-wage operation and
maintenance (O&M) expenditures has compromised the effectiveness o f public expenditures.
The problem i s exacerbated by deteriorating fiscal conditions, a strong government bias for
creation, rather than maintenance, o f public infrastructure, and at source deduction o f the unpaid
utilitybillsbythe federal government fromthe revenue share o fthe province.

7.       As is obvious from the above discussion, low levels o f fiscal deficits' do not inany sense
reflect the soundness o f provincial finances. According to the provision o f the Constitution, the
provinces cannot borrow except from, or with the consent of, the federal govemment. This
limited access to the capital market forces the provinces to curtail their expenditures in times o f
adverse fiscal situations. Inother words, fiscal adversity i s not reflected as much infiscal deficits
as it i s in the decline in production and quality o f provincially provided public services and
infrastructure.

8.       The low and stagnant social and economic indicators point to a long term fiscal crisis in
the province, not inthe sense o frunninghighfiscal deficits, but ina deeper sense o f runninghigh

education, and high "irrigation deficit&            because o f inadequate drainage, operations and
maintenance on irrigation canals. These deficits lead to erosion in the stocks of infrasmcture,
human capital, and irrigation infrastructure, impacting the productive capacity o f the provincial
economy. This, intum, leads to erosion inthe potential tax base, and therefore, perpetuation and
worsening o f a vicious cycle o f low fiscal resources - low levels o f public expenditures - low
augmentation o f physical and human capital - low productivity low fiscal capacity - low fiscal
                                                                        -
resources. In addition, people are less willing to pay taxes as they see less payoff to their tax
rupees. This aggravates the problem o f low revenue, which, in turn, makes even less money
available for public services.


 The fiscal deficit o fthe province has generally remained inthe range o f 5%-7.5% of aggregateprovincial
expenditure (signifying the proportion o f provincial expenditure met through borrowing).

9.      A sustained increase inexpenditure onpublic services can help the province break out of
this vicious circle. However, under the given adverse fiscal situation this appears unlikely
because, (i)  while Punjab's finances are sustainable at current levels o f spending, there i s not
much fiscal space for a major expansion o f spending; and (ii)   the existing level o fpublic spending
does not translate effectively into the quantity and quality o f services which are demanded by the
public.

10.     Inflow o f additional fiscal resources (fi-om the federal government or donors) to the
province, can therefore help the province to overcome some o f its fiscal constraints, and by
relaxing some o f the structural rigidities inthe budget, can improve the levels and productivity o f
public expenditure.

11,     In addition, increased effectiveness of public expenditure can contribute significantly
towards breaking the vicious cycle, which has been limited by the poor incentives for service
delivery, poor governance and, at least in the past, an extremely centralized system o f public
spending. Improving the effectiveness o f public expenditure requires a significant improvement
inallocative efficiency of expenditures, through carefbl evaluation of expenditure priorities, and
correcting the balance between development and recurrent and wage and non-wage O&M
expenditures. Moreover, there i s ample scope for improving overall governance and management
o f key sectors and departments to reduce waste and enhance efficiency. This however requires
fundamental changes in government process and procedures, especially those governing
provincialbudgets and finances.

12.     Similarly, there i s a need to revise the incentives regimes for civil servants and to change
the delivery o f public services from a centralized, top-down, supply-driven, unaccountable system
to a decentralized, bottom-up, demand-driven, accountable system.

13.     More specifically, there are substantial reasons for the government and the donor
community to support the devolved system o f service delivery. While decentralization i s no
panacea for the problems plaguing the effectiveness o f public expenditures, and is subject to
many pitfalls, it provides the best opportunity for improving the structure o f governance and the
effectiveness o f public services. The system needs considerable fine-tuning to achieve these
objectives.

14.     This requires providing the local (especially the district) governments with adequate
fiscal and human resources to fulfill their duties appropriately and efficiently.        Considerable
efforts needto go into developing the managerial and technical capacity o f the local governments
and providing them with adequate office technology. Nevertheless, without a significant increase
in fiscal resources of local and provincial govemments, there is little hope for any major
improvement in public services through the devolved delivery system.            At present, the sub-
national governments are facing a severe fiscal squeeze.            Whereas the National Finance
Commission (NFC) has been seriously considering an increase in the share o f provinces in the
federal divisible pool from 37.5 percent to 40 percent, a much greater flow o f funds would be
required to achieve the I-PRSP targets. Mechanisms need to be developed to allow a large
portion o f fiscal space that may be created at the federal or provincial level (due to better debt
and/or expenditure management) to be passed down to the local level. This shift will require the
NFC and Provincial Finance Commissions (PFCs) to not only assign much greater formula-based
transfers to the lower-level governments, but in addition put in place a system o f financial
incentives for the local governments to internalize national priorities within their own policies
and plans.

Budgetary andfiscal reforms

 15.     The Medium-Term Budget Framework: Whde the Punjab govemment has taken some
important steps for improving its budgetary and financial procedures and towards fiscal
decentralization, considerable progress would be requiredincoming years to provide a sound fiscal
and financial footing to the local governments. The provincial government over the last four years
has been preparing a basic performance budget for the key sectors. Although the exercise i s not yet
fully establishedwithin the government's budget-making process, it has provided a base for further
improvements in budget processes. From 2003/04, as part of preparation o f the provincial Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Punjab govemment i s embarlung on Mid-Term Budget
Framework (MTBF), mainly focusing onpro-poor expenditures.

16.      The projected expenditure pattem of the province reveals a strong shift from an asset
creation bias to maintaining provincial assets and infrastructure. With development expenditure
projectedto increaseby only 5% per annum the province seems to be opting for consolidation, rather
than expansion, ofprovincial expenditure.

17.      Over the next three years (2003/04-2005/06) provincial expenditures, recurrent and
development, are projected to grow at about 11% (Table 2). The MTBF makes a strong attempt to
refocus provincial priorities and divert provincial resources towards pro-poor and social
expenditures. Duringthe next three years, the overall pro-poor expenditure, whichwas estimatedat
Rs. 66 billion inthe 2002/03, is projected to grow by 23% per annum (see Table 3), with current
expenditure (including additional resources to be provided from the budget) to increaseby 20% per
annum and developmentexpenditure growingby a sizeable45% per annum.6

18.      The education sector expenditure, which comprised a little less than 24% of overall
expenditure in 2002/03, i s expected to grow at 18% per annum. As a result, the share of the
educationsectorintotal will increaseto over 28% in2005/06. While significant increasei s projected
in all sub-sectors of education (see Table 4), owing to the past neglect of the sector, the largest
increase (of about 15% per annum) is allocated for General Universities and Colleges. This,
however, by no means reflect a wholesale shift in sub-sectoral priorities, as significant increases of
about 12% and 10%per annumhave also beenprojected for expenditureson primary and secondary
education, respectively.




 These expenditures exclude the impact o n recent salary increase. For this reason only, these numbers are
somewhat different from the expenditure figures of Table 2, which include the estimated impact o f increase
insalaries andpensions.

    Source: Figures for 2002/03 and 2003/04 are takenfrom the provincial 2003/04 budget. Rguresfor 2003/04- 2005/06 have

           been adjusted to incorporate the efects of salary andpension increase, reduction in subsidies andfall in interest payment

           due toproposed retirement offederal government debt.

    Note: Thefinancing gap (before disbursementsfrom IDA credit) is based on government statements on retiring of

          federal government debt. The gap could be narrowed to IDA disbursement by reducing/increasing these repayments.


19.       As a large portion o f the pro-poor expenditure i s to be incurred at the district level, the
district governments need to be provided with enough resources in order to facilitate these
expenditures.        Table 5 shows a significant increase (12% per annum) in the projected revenue
transfers to the district governments over the next three-year period.

20.      To meet the vast unmet needs o f the province, however, further injection of large-scale
public resources in social sectors will be required. The success o f provincial government efforts to
reduce poverty in the province would depend critically on the success o f the federal and provincial
governments to mobilize additional resources and create significant fiscal space through better debt
and expenditure management, and to devise mechanisms to channel these additional resources to the
district govemments, which have to incur bulk of the pro-poor expenditures. Moreover, strong
efforts will also be needed to enhance the effectiveness o f public expenditure through improved
governance, andby adoptingbetter budgetary procedures and financial management practices.

21.         Resourcemobilizatiole:Overall, the MTBF indicates a significant improvement inmedium-
term fiscal outlook o fPunjab. A bulk of t h s improvement is to come from an expected increase in
transfers from the federal government.                             As per the federal govemment medium-term fiscal

divisible pool will improve from 37.5% to 40%.'               Federal revenue transfer to Punjab i s thus
projected to increase by about 50% (i.e., 14.5%per annum) over the projection p e r i ~ d . ~

22.       The provincial government remains determined to reverse the trend of reduction in
provincial revenue effort with every large-scale increase in federal revenue transfers. Despite the
significant increase expected infederal revenue transfers, the provincial government i s projecting an
increase of 13% per annum (i.e. Rs. 9 billion over the three years) in provincial tax and non-tax
revenue. This is based on additional revenue o f Rs.4 billion expected in2004/05 andRs 3.5 billion
in2005/06 onaccount ofadditional measures onAgncultural Income Tax (AIT),UrbanImmovable
Property Tax (UIPT), replacement o f Motor Vehicle Tax with a fuel-based levy, converting specific
Stamp Dutiesto ad valorem bases, levyingo fwater charges (abiana) on irrigationas a flat rate," and
rationalizing o f other user charges. In addition, a significant increase is also anticipated from the
taxes and user charges inthe domainofthe local govemments.




'Thenew    NFC is expected to be announced in2003104 andwould apply fromthe 2004105budget. To date
there has been serious considerationwithin the NFC to increase the share o fprovinces fiom 37.5% to 40%.
Furthermore, revenue from additional 2.5% o f GST will be transferred (as per the present practice) to the
provinces as straight transfers (for onwards transfer to the local governments), making the provincial share
inoverall federal taxes close to 44%.
  Almost the same rate o f growth is projected for boththe province's ownrevenue and federal revenue
transfers.
"Despite some equity issues inlevying o f water charges, this measure i s expected to yield significant
additional revenue by making evasion and avoidance more difficult andby reducingthe collection costs.

23.          Provincial-localfiscal relations: Realizingthat local governments have a key role inits
poverty reduction strategy, the provincial government is making serious efforts to improve the
finances o f the local governments. Fiscal transfers to the district governments are budgeted to be
25% higher than last year's budget (but only 7% higher than the revised estimates). Inaddition,
allocation for local governments' development program (inthe Annual Development Program) is
kept at Rs 9 billion -- the same as last year's budget, but 23% lower than the revised estimates.
These transfers, however, exclude the transfers under the PESRP. Nevertheless, with a large
portion o f this increase likely to be preempted by salary increases, the non-salary allocations by
the district governments, even for the key sectors like education, may not be adequate.

Provincialdebt managementstrategy

24.       The debt problem:Coupled with the weak revenue position, the Punjab government
faces a large debt overhang. As per the Constitution, the provincial government can only borrow
from, or with the permission of, the federal government. The federal government, until the last
three years, has been providing the provincial government with Cash Development Loans (CDLs)
to finance a part o f its development program.            Another significant part o f the provincial
development program i s financed by donor assistance, the grant component o f which has been
declining over the years. As a result, the debt burden o f Punjab government has been increasing
quite rapidly (see Table 7).

25.      While a large portion o f these loans went to finance social and community services, the
CDLs carried a significant interest rate. In addition, the Punjab government has accumulated a
large amount in "deferred liabilities" by utilizing employees' contributions towards their General
Provident Fund (G.P. Fund) for financing current payments made from the G.P. Fund and for
other budgetary expenditures. The unfunded nature o f G.P Fund, the liabilities o f which carry a
very highinterest rate adds to the overall indebtedness o f the provinces.

26.      Despite the decline in market and administered interest rates, the interest on provincial
debt averages about 11% (see Table 8). As a result, debt servicing, especially that o f CDLs,
places a major burden on provincial budget by taking significant resources away from other high-
priority areas, and leaving little for spending on developmental activities and on critical social
sectors. Inshort, the ability o f the provincial government to perform its core functions effectively
and provide the bare minimumservices has been adversely affectedby the debt burden.

27.       The debt management strategy       -- Enhancing the sustainability of high-priority
programs:The Punjab government realizes that inorder to enhance budgetary allocations for key
social services on a sustainable basis, provincial debt burden has to be reduced to more
sustainable levels. The government has formulated a debt management strategy having three
important components:

        i)    Swapping High Cost Loans With Low Cost Loans: Taking advantage of the
recent decline in market interest rates, the Punjab government intends to borrow funds from the
domestic financial sector for early retirement of more expensive CDLs. However, it i s unlikely
that the government would be able to borrow amounts large enough to make a significant impact
on province's budgetary position. The other alternative i s for the government to raise loans
through floating its own securities. Inthis case, the provincial government will have to offer its
securities for open subscription on terms and conditions more attractive to the public than
instrumentspresently available inthe market. Hence borrowing from the international donors at
concessional rates remains the most viable option for the provincial government to retire its most
expensive debt and create some fiscal space for enhancing high-priority expenditure. To this end,
the Punjab Government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Asian
Development Bank for Punjab Public Resource ManagementProgram (PMP) Loan of US $450
million for the period 2003/04to 2007/08.


       ii)    Privatizing Public Sector Enterprises and other Properties: At present, fifty
public properties, with an assessed value of about Rs 3 billion are with the Punjab Privatization
Board, and are expected to be sold during 2003/04. Inaddition, another 510 properties are with
the District Privatization Committees, with a total assessed value of Rs 1.2 billion. Thus the
provincial government expects about Rs 4.2 billion in proceeds from privatization of these
properties. Moreover, the Punjab government anticipates generation o f substantial amounts
through sale of government land under illegal occupation. The amount so generated, along with
proceeds from policy-based International Financial Institution (IFI) loans would help the Punjab
government to retire Rs 15 billion o f its more expensive CDLs in FY04. This would bring a
saving of Rs 1.7 billion during 2003/04. This fiscal space would be utilized for spendingon pro-
poor sectors.

       iii)   Professional Management of Provident Fund Schemes: As mentioned above
Rs.15 billion debt o f the provincial government is in the form o f G.P. Fund accumulations,
bearing an average compound interest rate of 19.915%per annum. In2003/04, the estimated cost
o f interest payment on G.P. Fundliability alone i s Rs 3.6 billion. The rate o f interest on the G.P.
Fund is exceedingly high and is financially unsustainable. The high rate of interest and the
unfundednature of the G.P. Fundare likely to create a major financial problem for the provincial
government. The Punjab government has constituted a committee to examine the financial
viability of the G.P. Fund and pension schemes and to suggest ways to convert them into
professionally managed funds, so that the budgetary implications of the G.P Fund and pensions
can gradually be phased out, thus enhancing the future sustainability o f high priority provincial
expenditures.

                          FINANCIAL    MANAGEMENT       ASSESSMENT
Summary

 1.        The Punjab Government has developed a well-defined reformprogram, and there is implied
readiness in the area of Financial Management to implement the program. Notwithstanding the
ongoing improvements in the system of accounting, reporting and auditing, and subject to the
policy actionrequisites on budgeting and financial management agreedwith the Punjab government
and defined in the attached policy matrix, the program has otherwise adequate in-built mitigating
fiduciary measures to allow for further processing o f the Credit.

2.         In addition, with the special characteristic of this reform program and the in-built
Monitoringand Evaluation(M&E) measuresbeingput inplace as well as the core role of the newly
established PMIU staffed with a Finance Manager for the Education Department, the risk rating of
the programi s set at `Medium'.

Introduction

3.         The purpose of this sector adjustment operation, the Punjab Education Sector Adjustment
Credit (PESAC), i s to provide financing for the attainment o f the MDG targets inbasic education.
PESAC would be the first of a series of three adjustment credits to support the reformprogram of
the Government of Punjab, under the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP), to
enhance access to and quality o f education inPakistan's largest province.

4.         Financial Management (FM) aspects of PESAC were reviewed by IDA. The underlying
FM assessment report identifies the salient features of the current financial management
arrangements and reforms at the national, provincial and district levels and any additional control
measures that would need to be in place to consolidate the fiduciary safeguards already set in
motion for this adjustment operation.


Country Issues

5,         The existing institutional and regulatory framework in Pakistan offers enormous potential
to enhance the country's financial management and accountability arrangements. Some measures
for improvement have already been undertaken, in line with the comprehensive reform agenda
under the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) currently under finalization.
These include initiation of a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) and the setup o f a Debt
Policy Coordination Office to expand budgeting capabilities; introduction of institutional
mechanisms under the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) for better monitoring
and evaluation of poverty reduction expenditures with respect to corresponding outcome indicators;
reforming the Central Board o f Revenue (CBR) by engaging professional staff; development of an
integrated financial management system under the Bank-funded Project to Improve Financial
Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA); strengthening the Controller General o f Accounts (CGA)
organization under Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) I1resulting inimproved data reliability; and
a legislation that requires all levels o f Government to undertake audit of annual accounts, with the
Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) introducingnew methodology to improve auditing quality.

6.        Notwithstanding the above national level initiatives targeted towards sustained financial
management system and enhanced accountability process, the effectiveness of public expenditures
i s still uneven. There are inherent risks includingaccounting and financial management difficulties
at all levels of government, certain weaknesses inthe governance arena and inadequate monitoring
and evaluation provisions.

                                                                                             Annex D
                                                                                            Page 2 of 9


7.       Risk mitigating measures suggested in the CFAA report include standardizing budget
procedures, formalizing the role of Fiscal Monitoring Committees (FMCs), capacity building of
line department staff, moving towards adopting International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(PSASs), computerization of financial management system, establishing internal audit units in the
ministries, capacity building of audit staff and adoption of the New Accounting Model.

8.       After a very slow start, the progress achieved to-date in the implementation of the
government-wide accounting, reporting and reporting project, `PIFRA', is satisfactory. Fifty two of
the 127 accounting sites have been slated for computerization under PIFRA-I using SAP and the
New Accounting Model (NAM). Accounting and audit staff will be trained in the modem
accounting and auditing standards and techniques and the financial rules are also being revised to
bring these in line with the NAM. A follow-up project, PIFRA-11, has been prepared by the
Government o f Pakistan and i s beingprocessedby the Bank whereby the remaining 75 sites would
be computerized, internal audit arrangements instituted, and capacity of the accounting and audit
staff strengthened.

Provincial Financial Management Issues -Punjab

9.       As with all other provinces in Pakistan, there are inherent financial management
weaknesses in Punjab. Overall reconciliation o f receipts and expenditure of Provincial Account I
for FY03 (11 months to May 31, 2003) stand at 94% and 77% respectively against 97% and 85%
for FY02. This i s certainly not a measure of goodperformance due principally to the inadequacy of
the accounting andreporting process.

10.      Under the PIFRA project, however, the Financial Accounting and Budgeting System
(FABS) based on NAMis being implemented at the provincial government level. InPunjab, the
implementation will cover 22 o f the 34 sites including3 pilot sites and 19roll-out sites inPIFRA I,
and 14 sites in PIFRA 11. At present, none of the pilot and roll-out sites are on live-mode. The
three pilot sites under PIFRA Iinclude Finance Department, Punjab, AG Punjab, and District
Accounts Office (DAO) Faisalabad, with the expected completion date of December 31, 2003.
Training will be provided to 460 staff members at DAO offices and 10,000 Drawing and
DisbursingOfficers (DDOs) in Punjab. The devolved functionality under the Local Government
Ordinance 2001 will also be implemented at the DAOs. In effect, Punjab i s positioning itself in
fully embracing PIFRA and hence its positive outcomes in the accountability fiamework.
However, with the very slow pace of the project's implementation, it cannot be inferred that the
project will achieve any meaningful results before 2005. This means therefore that reliance on the
existing system for financial accounting and reporting will continue, till then, to form the basis of
the accountability system inPunjab.

11.      To allow for the budget for FY2004/05 to be prepared on the basis of the new Chart of
Accounts (COA), DDO training i s currently being programmed to start, under the auspices of
PIFRA, duringNovember 2003, with completiondate set at not later than February 28, 2004.

12.      The Government of Punjab has clear plans, for which approvalhas already been secured, to
recruit 250 accounting and finance staff to support the provincial accounting unitsas well as service
the districts and support the accounting processes thereat.        The current standard of uneven
accounting skills and capacity at the provincial and district levels will be improved upon with
adequate personnel to support the Provincial and District Accounting Officers as well as the
Executive District Officers (EDOs) (Finance). Out o f the total recruit of 250 staff, 34 will be
trained and assigned to the internal audit function to service the needs of each district, particularly
in the education sector. This move is in itself a fundamental good step forward to meeting the

human resources requirement inthe accounting, finance and internal audit areas, within the context
o f the devolutionprogram.

13.       While Punjab is committed to implementingthe national reforms through PIFRA, it is also
undertaking reforms for improving provincial finances through Fiscal Restructuring and Financial
Management, which i s one of the three sub-programs under Punjab Resource Management Program
(PRMP). PRMP aims at creation of additional fiscal space through increasing provincial revenues,
rationalizing expenditures and improving accountability in financial management. The program i s
quite comprehensive and is beingsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)to supplement
and complement the Bank's assistance. This support is included in ADB's Country Strategy for
Pakistan and the approach adopted by Punjab under the Programi s to implement structural/medium
term change strategy for sustained growth. Expected outcomes are to: (a) strengthen provincial
revenues; (b) rationalize provincial expenditures; and (c) improve effectiveness, predictability, and
accountability infinancial management. ADB support for the first year was approved inDecember
2003.     A Technical Assistance (TA) arrangement between the ADB and the Government of
Pakistan for `enhancing capacity and resource management and poverty reduction in Punjab'
provides, inter alia, for the provision o f consultancy services inFiscal and Financial Management in
Punjab, with a view to strengthening the reliability and accuracy of provincial accounts and the
reporting systems involving timely reconciliation of accounts, enhancing transparency and
accountability, capacity building at the provincial and local levels for the Punjab Government's
eventual take-over o f accounting functions. The TA i s expected to begin during2004. DFIDi s also
currently supporting the Controller General of Accounts (CGA's) office at the federal level in the
area of financial management with a view to enabling the provinces take over the accounting
functions by year 2006.

14.       The Finance Department has proposed an expanded Chart o f Accounts for the DAOs that
would incorporate various heads o f accounts to report expenditures vis-&vis program components
after AG's approval. It i s understood that this matter i s under resolution at the Controller General
of Accounts' office. This will, once implemented, enhance the quality of statements submitted by
DAOsand support the consolidationprocessat the center.

15.       The Legislative Assembly of the Government o f Punjab has established two Public
Account Committees (PACs). The Committees are in the process of appointing their respective
Chairmen to become functional. As o f November 2003, reports for the years 1998-99 to 2002-03
as well as Accounts for the years 1987-88 to 1995-96, and 1998-99 to 2002-03 have not been
reviewed by the PAC. These backlogs would need to be cleared to complete the requisite actions
underthe accountability chain.

16.      Based on the proactive stance of Punjab in this respect as only one of two provinces that
have made progress in the formation of PACs, it may be concluded that the concerned executive
authority will most likely begin the implementation o f the Committees' recommendations as and
when delivered.

District FinancialManagement Issues -Punjab

17.      External Auditing: As part o f strengthening the continuing entity audit function at the
district level, 7 Directorates of Audit will be established in Punjab to conduct the external audit of
district governments. The office o f the Auditor General of Palustan has already secured approval to
appoint yet another 844 new audit staff to meet the specific requirements o f staffing the district
audit infrastructure inPakistan. The timetable for completion of recruitment of this staff earlier set
by the AG's office for September 30, 2003 has beenrevisedto December 31, 2003. However, the
AGP, inassociation with the CGA and the NRB have yet to fully develop, and secure approval for,

                                                                                            Annex D
                                                                                          Page4 of 9

the Local Government Accounting Manual under the Local Government Ordinance of 2001 to
serve as a proper basis to structure and thus appropriately audit the local government accounts
underthe devolution strategy.

 18.     Devolution Support Program (DSP): This is one initiative which has been taken at the
federal level to support institutional capacity building with a focus on local government
performance, accountability and service delivery. DSP had been included in ADB's Country
Strategy and Program for Pakistan in 2002. It aims at implementingfiscal decentralization to fully
articulate the government's commitment to a people-centered system o f local governance based on
internationally established norms and principles. Against this background, the ADB i s currently
working, in consultation with the Bank, and with the Punjab Government to prepare a program to
support the capacity building o f auditors at the local government level with a view to reinforcing
the accountability framework at the lowest levels of government.

19.      Expenditure Reporting: At the district level, it was suggested and agreed that a detailed
expenditure reporting format is required for the purpose o f proper tracking of education sector
expenditures under the reform program. DAOs need to report structured information to both the
Finance and Education Departments and prepare detailed expenditure reports showing expenditure
at the detailed object levels. Although sector-wise expenditure is maintained at the district level,
currently the data i s not reported to AG office. There i s a need to maintain records at the district
level and those records reflected inthe reporting to AG office.

20.      Another matter of concern has been the quality o f statements submitted by DAOs.
Financial reporting statements are often found to be illegible due to overwriting. This i s
symptomatic of lack of adequately trained personnel and a consequent need for enhanced quality
assuranceinpreparation and verification ofreports to be submittedby the districts.

21.     Accounting and Internal Auditing: To remedy this situation, the Finance Department in
Punjabhas approved the appointment of a fresh batch o f 250 experienced and qualified accounting,
finance, and internal audit staff to be stationed in different parts of the province and districts as
explained inparagraph 10. Although, the existing system provides for pre-audit of all transactions
pertaining to payments, internal audit has a much larger scope as an integral part o f an effective
internal control mechanism whereby a continuous post-audit i s conducted throughout the year. The
internal audit staff will, among other things, review the signed TOPSand ensure that expenditures
made conform in all material respects with the specific terms, and are made to bonafide
beneficiaries. This actionrequisitehas been agreedas part o f the FMtime-bound action matrix.


Sectoral Issues-PunjabEducation

22.     Lessons learnt from Social Action Program           (SAP) - The accountability problems
experienced in the implementation of the education component, among others, of SAP provide
good grounds for instilling better and more appropriate control mechanisms inthe execution of this
reform program. The significant control weaknesses and mismanagement issues identified and
highlighted in the SAP audit reports for the education sector, including over-payments o f
entitlements to teachers, payment o f salaries to non-existent employees, wastage o f funds by
maintaining schools with little or no enrolment, have been remedied through exercise of
administrative and punitive measuresput inplace by the Education Department. Notwithstanding,
a continuous reappraisal of the general control environment i s required in order to mitigate the
inherent risks associatedwith the management o f public finances. It is against this backgroundthat
FM action plans have been devised and agreed for timely implementation of the requisite control
processes for this reform program. In future, the interventions supported by the ADB through its

                                                                                            Annex D
                                                                                          Page 5 o f 9

Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) would equally provide additional impetus to
managingthe control risks that would otherwise be associatedwithprogram implementation.

23.     While national and provincial reforms are seeking to improve and buildcapacities for audit
and accounts functions, and FD functions, specific capacity building initiatives and reforms for
implementingat the line department level have been missing. This gap for the education sector is
being addressed under the PESRP as well as by the recent appointment of qualified personnel as
Finance Manager for the Education Department. The Finance Manager will serve as a core
member o f the Program Implementation and MonitoringUnit (PMIU) already set up to monitor the
Education Reform Program. During program implementation, the performance of the Finance
Manager interms o f timely delivery of properly reconciled financial information on the department,
includingprogram-specific financial reports will be closely monitored.

24.     The Government of Punjab has shown commitment towards this Program and has taken
further additional steps to address issues related to the coordination and monitoring of this Reform
Program. The PMIU, under the auspices of the Education Department, will be responsible for the
monitoring and evaluation o f this reform program initiative. The unit i s already staffed with the
ProgramDirector and two other officials including a Finance Manager inthe Finance Wing. Inthe
specific area of financial management, the finance manager (the defacto financial controller) shall
be responsible, inter alia, for overall reconciliation o f accounts o f the Education Department
(including the reform program), intemal purchases in relation to the program managed at the
provincial level, capacity buildingactivities, financial awareness campaign, thirdparty surveys and
NGO contracts, coordination of district reporting and consolidation o f district accounts, and for
monitoring the flow of funds between the Finance Department and the district and with the AG
office.

25.     The Monitoring & EvaluationWing (M&E) is envisaged to be responsible for monitoring
indicators and comparing benchmark output and financial data with actual financial disbursements.
The PMIU has also obtained approval from the Finance Department for the positions in the wing
with their correspondingbudget costs to staffthe unitadequately.

26.     Reconciliationfigures o f the Education Department for FY03 (11months only) for receipts
were at 100%; corresponding reconciled data for payments were reported at 85% for non-
development and 84.5% for development expenditure (including an achievement o f 100% for
development expenditure component related to secondary education). Figures for FYOl-FY02 (full
year) were reported at 100% for receipts, 64% for non-development (recurring) expenditure and
100% for development expenditure. Considering the need for improvement in the reconciliation
process, AG Punjab i s closely coordinating with Executive District Officers, Education in this
respect. As part o f the improvement strategy inthis area, reconciliation of EducationDepartment's
accounts has become one o f the core responsibilities o f the newly recruited Finance Manager.
Once the PIFRA project i s fully implemented, however, the issue of reconciliation o f differences
shouldnot arise.

27.     Significant progress towards clearing the back-log o f reviews of audit reports at the
Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) level for Education Department in respect o f Audit
Reports for the years 1998-99 to 2002-03 as well as Audited Accounts for the years 1987-88 to
1995-96; 1998-99 to 2001-02 shall constitute a trigger for PESAC I1and complete clearing of the
back-log shall constitute a trigger for PESAC 111.

                                                                                            Page 6 o f 9

28.     Other Financial ManagementIssues

e      Budgetdevelopment and execution -the budgetis prepared bythe EDO, Finance basedon
        the requests of district line departments, and i s approved by the Zila (District) Council and
        communicated to each department, including the Education Department. The District
       Nazim authenticates the budget approved by Zila Council and allocates expenditure budget
       to each department. The DAOs exercise budgetary control while passing any payments and
        submit monthly expenditure statements for monitoring purposes to the EDO, and also to
       Communications & Works incase of expenditure on civil works.

e      Accounting and reporting - the financial management processes at districts are basic, and
        financial information i s fragmented at best. DAOs provide information by grant, major and
       minor heads to the AG andthe district governments. The District Accounts Officer verifies
       transactions to the extent of only about 10% o f total expenditures. The AG submits
       monthly, consolidated expenditure statements to the Finance Department for reconciliation.
       The Finance Department sends a copy of the statement to the Education Department to be
       discussed in the Fiscal Monitoring Committee (FMC) meeting. As a consequence of the
       appointment of a Finance Manager, specific reporting formats for monitoring the
       disbursement of financial resources of the Education department, including the reform
       program, have already beendesignedfor use at eachdistrict and for consolidationpurposes.
       This demonstrates the Punjab Government's commitment to reinforce and enhance
       accountability and reporting on the different components of the Program.

e      Since PESAC i s an adjustment operation, no special requirement for an entity audit is
       required. However, an audit opinion on the movement of the deposit account shall be
       required by the Bank. In addition, the Bank shall require further assurances, during
       supervision and through the program monitoring and evaluation arrangements, that the
       funds that have already been allocated in the current year's budget have indeed been used
       for the purposes for which they were intended. This would be achieved through the M&E
       reports as well as through the reconciled quarterly consolidated reports on budget
       execution maintainedby the Finance Manager for EducationDepartment.

Fundsflow uponcredit effectiveness:

29.    Under the devolved arrangements, the normal procedure for the flow of funds for
the conditional grants under the Education Sector Adjustment Credit and for the district
budgets is as follows:

       (i)     The IDA Credit will be released as a single tranche, and the amount of the Credit will
               be transferred to the Government of Pakistan Account with the SBP. Since, for this
               year, the Punjab Government has already provided the incremental budget
               appropriation o f the equivalent of $100 million to the province's Education sector no
               further transfer to the province's EducationDepartment account will be required for
               this current fiscal year.

       (ii)    Based on the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) award, and as per budget
               appropriation, each district receives one line budget transferred into Account No. IV
               from the Govemment o f Punjab's Consolidated FundAccount No. I.

       (iii)The conditional grants being provided by the provincial govemment under the
               Education Sector Reform Program to the districts are earmarked item-wise for
               utilization based on signed TOP agreement with each district. This i s conveyed by

                                                                              Annex D
                                                                            Page 7 o f 9

     the line department to the Planning & Development Department to authorize the
     Finance Departmentfor release o f development funds.

(iv) DAO is responsible for pre-auditing o f payment requests, the accounting o f the
     receipts and expenditures o f the district, and authorizing the National Bank o f
     Pahstan (NE3P) for payment. The institution of an internal audit function at the
     district level will reinforce the internal control mechanism.

(v)  Payments are made to the Drawing and Disbursement Officer's (DDO) Account,
     which he maintains for expenditures on education. Limits have been sanctioned to
     authorize DDO, DAO, and ED0 Education to approve payments from DDO's
     Account as per the Delegation o f Financial Power Rules 1990, Government of
     Punjab.

(vi) Upon payment request, the DDO checks the outstanding budget allocation before
     making the payment.

       The responsibility o f the District Government shall be to ensure the timely
       distribution of textbooks to students.          The Executive District Officer
       (Education) shall arrange for the delivery of these books to the schools for

Partnershipin Pakistan's developmentstrategy

1.      The government o fPakistan's development strategy is set forth inits InterimPoverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The I-PRSP focuses on: (a) strengthening governance
and the integrity o f the civil service; (b) creating opportunities through accelerating growth
o f agriculture, small and medium-scale industries, information technology, andoil and gas
sectors; and (c) reducingpoverty through revival o f growth andre-orienting public
expenditure towards humandevelopment andpoverty reduction. A Joint Staff Assessment
(JSA) on the I-PRSP was discussedbythe Boards o f the World Bank andthe Fundon
December 4 and 6,2001, respectively. The fillPRSP is expected to be completed this year.

2.       The Fundis supportingPakistan's poverty reduction efforts inthe context o fthe
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The
Fund's program supports the continued pursuit o f sound macroeconomic policies, in
particular sustained fiscal adjustment, while increasingthe share o fpoverty reduction-related
public spending; strengthening governance; tax policy and administration reform; public
enterprise restructuring andprivatization; and financial sector and foreign exchange market
reforms. The Fundtakes the leadinthe policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies including
overall fiscal andmonetarypolicy. Inaddition to macroeconomic targets, the Fundhas
established structuralperformance criteria relating to reforms inthe areas o f tax policy and
administration, power sector reform, foreign exchange market liberalization, andpublic
expenditure management. As outlined more filly below, the World Bank has complemented
the Fund's work through support to structural reforms inthe social sectors and support of the
growth agenda through deregulationo fkey sectors, such as power, oil and gas, andbanking
reforms whose performance have a strongbearing on growth andpublic finances.

BankGroup Strategy

3.       The objective o fthe World Bank Group's assistance strategy i s to help Pakistan
reduce poverty through support o f the government's implementation o f its Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy. The World Bank Group's program priorities are focused on the reforms
to (a) strengthen macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (b) improve the
business environment for growth; and (c) improve equity throughsupport for pro-poor and
pro-gender equity policies. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was presented to
the World Bank's Board o f Executive Directors on June 11,2002, sets out a strategy in
support o fthese objectives for the period FY 2003-05.'

4.     The World Bank works closely with the Fundandthe government on structural
reforms underpinningmacroeconomic stability, particularly inareaswith an impact on the
balance o fpayments andpublic finances. Inthis context, the Bank's lending program has
featured structural adjustment lendingto support the government's actions inthe areas of
improving public expenditure management and supporting reforms o f tax administration,
safe and soundbanking, efficient public utilities, andstructural fiscal and governance
reforms. The World Bank has also approved structural adjustment credits for two provinces
(Sindh andNorthWest Frontier Province (NWFP)) totaling $190 million supporting
provincial reform strategies to improve resource management and strengthenprovision o f
public services by local governments andcommunities. Further structuraladjustment
lending i s planned, including follow-on provincial adjustment credits and a possiblePoverty
Reduction Support Credit to be prepared once the government has completed the full PRSP.

5.     The World Bank Group's support to strengtheningthe investment climate includes a
combination o f analytical work and financial assistancetargeted to reforms inkey sectors.
The World Bank Group continues to encourage the federal andprovincial governments to
pursue further the ongoing liberalization andmodernization o f trade, industrial, business, and
labor regulations. To buildthe knowledge base to underpinthe policy dialogue onprivate
sector development, the World Bank Group is carrying out a significant program o f
analytical work. Inaddition to a Development Policy Review (completed inFY 2002), an
Investment Climate Assessment and a Petroleum Sector Review were completed inFY 2003.
Furtherwork inthe areao frural factor marketsis plannedfor FY04. Inaddition to the
governance reforms which have a direct bearingon the investment climate, the World Bank
Group continues to support financially andthrough policy advice reforms o f the governance
and regulatory environment for power, gas, oil, financial sector, pricing and tariffs reforms,
andprivatization. The Bank is also working with the government to explore potential
lending operations targeted toward addressing critical infrastructure gaps inwater andpower.

6.      Inthe social sectors, the World Bank Group's assistanceis gearedtoward support to
the implementationo fthe Education Sector Reform(ESR) Strategy andthe government's
priority o f strengthening public healthprograms and maternal and child health and family
planning.Accordingly the World Bankis focusing on: (a) programmatic support to the
National EducationSector Reform Strategy; (b) support to the National Education
Assessment System; (c) a program o f analytical work to underpin the policy dialogue during
the implementation o fthe ESR; and(d) province-based support to implementing the ESR

BankGroup assistanceto health sector reforms also includedthe HIV/AIDS Prevention
Project and Partnership for Polio EradicationProject, as well as analytical work, technical
assistance, and policy dialogue.

7.      Supporting the rural sector through community-based infrastructure projects
(particularlyfor water supply andsanitationservices) andthe increasedavailability of
micro-credit havebeenpart o f the World Bank Group's strategy to reduce andmitigate risks
for Pakistan's poor. The World Bankwill continue to pilot new approaches, and also help
scale up those which have proven effective such as the Community Infrastructure and

Bank-Fund collaboration inspecific areas

9.       As part of its overall assistanceto Pakistan-through          lending, country analytic work
andtechnical assistance-the         World Bank supports policy reforms inthe following areas in
collaboration with the Fund:

a.       Financial sector reforms. Pakistanhas been engaged infar-reaching reforms ofthe
financial sector for five years. Considerable progress has beenmade, particularly with respect
to reform o f the bankingsector. Regulations have been strengthened, loan recoveries
increased, andthe quality o f management improved. Privatization o f the three nationalized
commercial banks-the           core ofthe government's reform strategy-is        well advanced. The
vision for the sector is for a market-oriented, predominantly private system that operates
under a strong regulatory framework supported by an effective bankingcourt system. The
World Bank andthe Fundhave worked closely together to support needed policy reforms.
The Fund's PRGFarrangement has featured a structuralbenchmarks relatedto privatization

                                                                                        Annex G
                                                                                       Page 4 of 5




o f a nationalized bank as well as other measures to liberalize the financial system and
strengthen centralbank autonomy. The World Bank has maintained close dialogue with the
government on banking sector reform since approval o f the BankingSector Adjustment Loan
inDecember 1997.WorldBanksupport is also beingprovidedthroughimplementationof
two ongoing projects: the BankingSector Restructuring andPrivatizationProject andthe
BankingSector Technical Assistance Project as well as ongoingdialogue onhousing finance.
Ajoint World Bank/Fund Financial Sector Assessment Programis plannedfor FY2004.

b.       Power sector reforms.Losses inthe power sector havebeenanongoing source o f
macroeconomic instability inPakistan, threatening achievement o f fiscal deficit targets and
preventingreorientation ofpublic expenditure toward poverty reductionprograms. The Fund
PRGFarrangement includes conditionality relatedto energy tariff adjustments andother
power sector reforms with the aim o freducing the sector's fiscal burden. The Bank's
program supports this objective, with a focus on enhancing market structures andimproving
operationalperformance. Inthe context o fthe structural adjustment operations approved in
FY2001 andFY2002, the World Bank has taken the leadinworking with the government o f
Pakistan to unbundle andprivatize the state-owned Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA).Duringthe transitiontoward privatization, the government o fPakistanaims to
restore WAPDA's financial viability through implementationo fmedium-term financial
improvement plans (FIPs) developed inconsultation with the World Bank, which aim to
sharply reduce the level o fbudget support to WAPDA through a combination o f measures.
Given the importance o f this initiative to ensuring achievement o f Pakistan's macroeconomic
targets, progress inimplementing the FIPs is being monitored closely byboth the
World Bank and Fund. The Bank is also beginning to work with the Government o fPakistan
prepare a comprehensive medium-term adjustment program to improve the electric services
to Pakistan's industry andhouseholds at lower cost andhigher reliability.

c.       Publicexpendituremanagement.The quality o fPakistan'spublic expenditures has
longbeen compromisedbypoor financial management practices. The government has made
one o f its top priorities to accelerate reforms towards achieving a modernpublic accounting
andintegrated financial management system. The World Bank,the Fund, andthe
government have been working closely inthis area for more thanthree years. Under a policy
fiamework agreedwith the government andthe Fund, the World Bank is taking the leadin
supporting implementationofthe reform program while the Fundis providing related
technical assistance. World Bank support i s being provided inthe context o f the ongoing
PakistanImprovement o fFinancialReporting and Accounting (PIFRA) project through
which the national accounting and audit systems are being modernized. A follow-on
PIFRAI1project will further these efforts, to improve the accuracy, completeness, reliability,
andtimeliness o fintra-year and year-end government financial reports inPakistanat the
national, provincial, and district levels. Analytical and diagnostic support is being provided
inthe form ofa CountryFinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) whichwas completed
inFY03 as well asprovincialfinancial accountability assessments, as appropriate. Policy
measures relating to financial management have been included as prior actions for
World Bank structural adjustment lending at both the national andprovincial level. The
World Bank i s also taking the lead inthe dialogue with the government on measures to

                                                                                       Annex G
                                                                                     Page 5 of 5




improve the efficiency and effectiveness o fpublic spending inthe form o f a Public
Expenditure Review which was completedinFY03.

d.      Tax policyandadministrationreforms.Tax administration hasbeenamong the
most severe weaknesses inPakistan's economic management. The Fundhas taken the leadin
supportingtax policyreforms, providing technical assistanceleading, inter alia, to the
formulation o f an income tax reformpackage which became effective July 1,2002. In
consultation with the Fundandthe World Bank, Pakistanhas also launched a program for the
fundamentalrestructuring o fthe Central Board o f Revenues (CBR) inorder to improve the
efficiency o f tax administration. The CBR reform effort is being supported byboth the
World Bank and the Fund.The Fundhas stressedthe importance o f improved revenue
collection performanceby CBR as key element inensuring the sustainability o fPakistan's
considerable achievements infiscal consolidation. The structuralperformance criteria o fthe
PRGFinclude adoption o ftax policy changes andimplementationof CBRreform. Through
the Project PreparationFacility, the World Bank is supportingpreparation o f a Tax
Administration Reform Project which is scheduled for approval inFY 2004. This support
includes financing o f consultants to develop a detailedreform strategy for restructuring o f
CBRinthe areaso fhumanresourcemanagement, informationtechnology, businessprocess
re-engineering, and tax payer facilitation.

e.      Social impactanalysis.As part o f the preparationo fthe World Bank structural
adjustment lending andthe FundPRGFprogram, the World Bankand the Fundhave agreed
to review closely the social impact ofreforms ina pilot program o f collaboration. Work is
beingledbythe World Bank's Social Development Unit.Two areas o freform will receive
close scrutiny duringimplementation: (a) devolution andits impact on the quality o f service
delivery, especially to the poor, and(b) tariffandpolicyreforms inthe gas andpower
sectors. This work is now underway.
