INTEINATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIvENT
REPORT AND RECO1MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO PANAiIA FOR A FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomnendation on a
proposed loan to the Banco Nacional de Panama with the guarantee
of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$3.4 million to
help finance a project for fisheries designed to provide credit to
fishermen to replace old wooden vessels with modern steel shrimp
trawlers, to provide technical assistance, and for a fishing port
feasibility study. The loan would have a term of 12 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMPY
2.        Reference is made to "PART II - THE ECONOIfY," paragraphs
5-11, of the President's Report on a proposed loan to Panama for the
Tocumen International Airport Project, dated July 27, 1971; and to
"Panama, H4emorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects"
(CA-lla), dated July 9, 1971, and distributed to the Executive Directors
on July 15, 1971. A country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART II - THE PROJECT
3.        This project was identified and prepared by an FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program mission in August 1969 using the results of an
investigation of fisheries resources in Central America financed by
the UNDP. The project was appraised by the Bank in January 1971 and
negotiations took place in July. The Borrower was represented by
Messrs.Franklyn Almillategui, Sub-Hanager, Banco Nacional de Panama;
Jose B. Sokol, Sub-Director General; and Francisco A. Rodriguez,
Chief of Programming, of the Ministry of Planning.
4.        The project is designed to provide assistance to Panama's
shrimp fishing industry by upgrading a substantial part of the existing
fleet and thereby preventing a deterioration in the catch of the fleet
and increasing the efficiency of the industry. New grounds are being
investigated by Panama and UNDP/FAO and the project is designed as the
first of a series to support the Panamanian fishing industry. A second
project is being prepared by the Government which would involve the
construction of a fishing port and a third would provide additional
fishing vessels on terms similar to those of the project now proposed.

constructed in Panama. The value of shrimp exports grew at an annual
average rate of 10 percent from 1960 to 1966, but since then has growcn at
an average rate of only 3 percent. The volume of shrimp exports declined
during 1968 and 1969, before rising again in 1970.   The value of shrimp
exports fell from 8.7 percent of total goods exports in 1966 to 7.5
percent in 1969 and 1970. Deterioration in the shrimp catch is likely if
the present fleet, which consists largely of obsolete vessels, is not
upgraded.
6.           Shrimp fishing is profitable but its profitability is
sharply dependent upon the use of newer, more efficient vessels. The size
of the present fleet in Panama is fixed ty licensing and consists of 229
vessels. Half of these are ten years or older. The older wooden-hulled
vessels require higher maintenance, are less efficient than the newer
steel-hulled trawlers, and are becoming uneconomical to operate.   Most of
the older vessels are owned by individual owner-operators. Credit for
replacing vessels is scarce and is usually limited to larger companies on
stringent terms. In addition, most individual operators originally
acquired their vessels second-hand and, because of higher operating costs
resulting in lower earnings of these vessels, they have not been able to
accumulate sufficient profits to finance independently the cost of
replacements. As a result, there has been a marked recent trend of
individual owner-operators selling their licenses to large companies,
usually operators of shrimp-processing plants. Ownership by individuals
declined from 62 percent to 55 percent over the two-year period 1968-70.
The Panamanian Government wishes both to improve the efficiency of its
marine production up to its exploitable limit and to ensure that
individual vessel owners are not forced to sell out because they have not
had the cash or credit to enable them to replace their old trawJlers. The
proposed loan is intended to provide credit primarily to small trawler
owners to allow them to replace their old trawlers by new and more
efficient ones. A detailed report entitled 'Tanama - Fisheries Project"
(PA-94a) is being distributed separately. A summary of the project is in
Annex III; a map of Panama's main fishing, grounds is in Annex IV.
7.           Over a five-year period, the project would provide (a) credit
to fishermen to replace about 40 old wooden vessels with modern steel
shrimp trawlers equipped with up-to-date fishing gear; (b) technical
assistance in the cleign, procurement, and supervi3ion of construction
of the traw^rlers and trainirng in basic navigation and the use of modern
fishing gear; and (c) consultant services for the preparation of a
feasibility study for a fishing port. The term of the loan is 12 years to
coincide with the repayment schedules of subborrowers. Disbursement is
expected over a five-year period. The proposed loan of $3.4 million would
finance all of the foreign cost of thae project. Local costs of $2.0
million wJould be financed by the subborrowers ($0.9 million), by the
Government-owned Banco Nacional de Panama ($0.9 million), and by the
Government of Panama ($0.2 million). Included in these local costs are
h440,000 for permanent working capital needs of subborrowers in order to
reflect realistically the total financial resources required for a shri-mo
fishing operation. The Government's share will meet the local co,sts o:,
the port feasibility study and training.



-3-
8.           Of the $3.4 million Bank loan, approximately $3.0 million is
to be on-lent to fishermen by the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP), and
$0.4 million would be on-lent to the Go-vernment to cover the foreign costs
of the port feasibility study and training. BNP is the most appropriate
lending channel for on-lending to trawler owners since commercial banks
have evidenced no interest in this business. BNP provides full commercial
banking services, performs various fiscal functions, and provides
development financing. It is being encouraged by Government to become
more active as a development finance institution and to assist sectors of
the economy that previously have not had credit available on appropriate
terms.  Although BNP's performance has been of mixed quality in recent
years, the Inter-American Development Bank, which has made three loans to
BNP mainly for industrial credit, is providing assistance for improvement
in BNP's organization and for the establishment of a better management
information system, using Peat, Marwick and Mitchell as consultants. A new
and qualified management team has been named. BNP has agreed to improve
the staffing, organization, and procedures of the Department of Industrial
Credit, which would administer the Bank loan, and to improve the overall
organization and operation of BNP.
9.           BIP's operations and financial position suffered from
political events in 1968 and its liquidity was seriously affected by large-
scale withdrawals and heavy borrowings by Government. The greater part of
these had been repaid by 1971 which, with curtailed credit expansion, has
considerably improved BNPIs liquidity. Promotional efforts are underway
to attract new deposits, which should make possible an expansion of credit.
The Government Auditor is presently making a complete review of BNP's loan
portfolio. Since 1957, BNP's yearly surpluses have been added to capital
and reserve, resulting in an improvement of debt-equity ratio from 6.6:1
at the end of 1966, to 5.8:1 at the end of 1970.
10.          The replacement trawlers would catch annually about 1.8
million lbs. of shrimp more than the old vessels would if they were left
to fish until the end of their economic life. The value of the resulting
increase in export earnings (after debt service of the proposed Bank loall)
would be at least $1.7 million a year over the expected life (15 years)
of the newi trawlers. At present prices the economic return on the prouect
would be 15 percent and on the basis of conservative price assumptions for
the future could rise above 20 percent. The project would also have a
desirable social effect by arresting a trend of individual vessel owners
selling their licenses to larger owners. Both the Government and manage-
ment of BNP have undertaken to give priority to small vessel owners.
11.          The trawlers included in the project would be procured under
international competitive bidding. At present there are no import duties
on trawlers but there are regulations which prohibit importation of
vessels to shrimp in Panamanian waters. As a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan, these regulations would be amended so as to permit
the importation of the trawlers to be financed under the proposed project.
Local bidders would be given a preference margin of 15 percent of the
c.i.f. bid price.  There would be a minimum bid package of th-ee -re,seos
and bidders would be in-rited to roniote for more than th-ee as iTe' 1  Lf

compete as effectively as possible with larger shipyards, and (b) to
perivt the lowest possible price consistent with quality and timely
deliveiy. Bids are expected from one or more local shipyards as well as
from shipyards in Colombia and Mexico and possibly elsewhere.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AIND ATJTHORITY
12.          The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco
Nacional de Panama, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Panama and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article EEI, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resoluvion approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans
for fisheries projects.
13.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOPEIIENDATION
1h.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

equipped with modern fishing gear; provision of
technical assistance for design, procurement, and
construction supervision of trawlers and for training
to shrimp fishermen; and for a fishing port feasibility
study.
Special Project     Both the Government and management of BNP have expressed
Features:           their intention to ensure that individual vessel owners
be given a first chance over the larger fishing companies
to receive the funds of the proposed project and this
policy is reflected in the Loan Agreement. In view of
this policy, no specific measures to limit the granting
of subloans according to size of fishing company are
proposed as part of the project.

Consultants:        Livesey, Henderson and Partners (U.K.) were recently
contracted by the Panamanian Government to carry out a
fishing port feasibility study. The consultants and
the terms of reference for the study were approved by
the Bank.
Rate of Return:     Economic rate of return to shrimp fishing sector estimated
at 15% if prices and costs remain constant and 22% if
prices and costs increase as projected. If increased
earnings to shrimp processing sector are combined, the
estimated rate of return increases to about 17% for the
constant prices case and to about 23% for the increased
prices and costs case.
