Project Performance Audit Report
PANAMA (FIRST) FISHERIES PROJECT
(Loan 784-PAN)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the Fisheries Project in Panama,
the first of two fisheries projects, for which Loan 784-PAN was approved
in July 1971 in the sum of US$3.4 million.     The loan accounts were closed
in October 1977 after cancellation of an undisbursed balance of US$0.03
million.
The audit report consists of an audit memorandum prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department and a Project Completion Report (PCR)
dated February 14, 1978.     The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in August
1976. The audit memorandum is based on a review of the President's Report
(No. P-980) and the Appraisal Report (No. PA-94A), both of July 15, 1971,
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements dated August 2, 1971 and the PCR;
correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda on project
issues as contained in the Bank files have also been consulted and Bank
staff associated with the project have been interviewed.
An OED mission visited Panama in December 1978.        The mission
held discussions with staff of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries,
National Planning Office, the National Bank of Panama (BNP; the executing
agency) and project participants.     The information obtained during that
mission was used to test the validity of some of the conclusions of the
PCR and permitted discussion of some aspects not covered by the PCR.
Particularly, detailed information on fishing effort and shrimp catches
were obtained, analyzed and discussed.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on April 24,
1979.   The comments received (see Annex 5 to the PPAM) have been taken
into account while preparing this final version.       The suggested correc-
tions and changes of the PPAM have been incorporated.       In two instances
the audit mission could not fully agree with Government comments and the
difference in views has been footnoted.
The audit finds the PCR comprehensive and accurate with respect
to the project's principal achievements and shortcomings.      The memorandum
further analyzes some issues where the audit mission did not fully agree
with the PCR; particularly, on the project's appraisal analysis and rates
of return calculation.      Since this is one of the first Bank-assisted
fisheries project to be completed and evaluated, some methodological
comments have been incorporated, including some suggested by CPS.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Panama,
BNP and their staff met during preparation of this report is gratefully
acknowledged.

Project Performance Audit Report
PANAMA (FIRST) FISHERIES PROJECT
(Loan 784-PAN)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Fisheries Project was the first fisheries project financed
by the World. Bank Group in Panama.      It provided funds for building 40
vessels (shrimp trawlers) to replace obsolete crafts, for captain training
and for preparing a feasibility study for a new fishing port.
Complex technical specifications and the limited number of
shipbuilders  with   experience  in  shrimp  trawler  construction   resulted
in a two-year delay in having the first contract signed.        Due to their
delay inflation, permitted the construction of only 26 vessels, at a unit
cost double as high as anticipated.     As a consequence of high costs and
low shrimp prices the anticipated replacement of old boats did not take
place. The Government decided to add the project vessels to the existing
fleet. This implied a substantial change in project concept, but without
project reappraisal. After some delays, captain training was successfully
carried out.   The feasibility/ study was completed on time and permitted
the Bank to finance port loan- .
The project has contributed to redistributing the currently
substantial benefits of the shrimp sector among a larger number of in-
dividuals and has succeeded in checking the trend towards concentration
of shrimp trawling in the hands of large companies and processors.       As a
result of inadequate appraisal analysis (a problem also reflected in the
appraisal of the follow-on project), the project vessels have not incresed
total shrimp catches but have contributed to a decrease in the average
catch per vessel.     The audit estimates the project's economic rate of
return at zero, a rate which would only be achieved if at least 6 boats
are taken out of operation by 1980.
The following points may be of special interest:
-    Inadequate Bank supervision of tendering procedures (PPAM,
paras. 23 to 26) and of vessel allocation to non-shipowners
(PCR, para. 8.04);
-    Factors to be considered when analyzing boat replacement and
effects of fisheries projets on income distribution (PPAM,
paras. 22 and 31-32, respectively);
-    No serious delays in vessel construction occurred (PCR, para.
3.08); and
# - Questions of profitability for investors in a case when fleet
has already exceeded its optimum size (PCR, paras. 6.07 -
6.09).

Project Performance Audit Memorandum
PANAMA FIRST FISHERIES PROJECT
(Loan 784-PAN)
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
1.          The possibility of promoting a fisheries project was suggested
by a reconnaissance mission (FAO/IBRD C.P.)      in November 1968.    In July
1969 the project was identified, and the final version of the preparation
report was completed in July 1970.    The project was appraised in February
1971, and approved   in July of the same year.       The Loan Agreement was
signed in August and became effective in December 1971.
2.          The project was designed to assist the Panamanian shrimp
fishing industry by preventing a decline in the catch through the replace-
ment of 40 obsolete vessels. Captains to operate project vessels were to
be trained in basic navigation and the use of modern fishing gear.        The
project also provided funds for a consulting firm to study the feasibility
of a new fishing port outside Panama City.
3.           In March 1974, 27 months after the loan became effective, a
contract for the building of ten vessels was signed.       In 1975 ten addi-
tional units were built, and in 1976 the last six were completed, for a
total of 26.
4.           Delays in procurement resulted in fishing vessels being con-
structed during a period of exceptional international inflation.         Unit
costs of the project vessels averaged US$165,000 instead of US$81,000
estimated at appraisal, so that only 26 boats could be constructed out of
the proceeds of the Loan,     instead of the 40 units initially planned.
All vessels were built by Construcciones Navales de Panama (CONAPAN), a
local shipyard.
5.            The oil crisis which caused inflationary increases in both
construction and operating costs, also resulted in a world-wide economic
recession that caused international demand for shrimps to drop and prices
to fall in 1974. It became preferable for boat owners to continue oper-
ating old boats which were still marginally profitable, or, for those
small owners who had financial resources, to rehabilitate them, rather
than to invest in a new expensive boat which at that time would have been
unable to finance the debt service out of its operations.        In order to
prevent further concentration of fleet ownership in the hands of pr-
ocessors and large companies, project management suggested reserving 26
boats for captains who had never owned a boat, but who were willing to
take this opportunity to become self employed. The total number of shrimp
fishing licenses has been limited to 238 since 1968, in order to avoid
fleet overcapacity, but the Government issued another decree creating the
additional 26 licenses under a special regime set up to enable individual
captains to benefit from the project.



- 2 -
6.           Prices of shrimps increased again in 1975, when most project
boats started operating. The project boats have therefore been in opera-
tion for only about three years but so far appear to meet appraisal
expectations both technically and financially.       On the basis of actual
initial results and of projections of future returns, their financial rate
of return would be around 15%, within the range of initial estimates (14%
to 20%).
7.            After some delay,   training in boat operations was provided
to the project captains by an FAO shipmaster and was completed satisfac-
torily on September 30, 1976.
8.           The feasibility study for a new fishing port was started in
June 1971 by a consulting firm, Livesey and Henderson from the UK, and
completed in March 1974.     On the basis of its findings, a fishing port
project was appraised by the Bank and a port loan (Loan 1114-PAN) of US$24
million was approved by the Bank in April 1975.
9.         Technically and financially, Banco Nacional de Panama (National
Bank of Panama, BNP) has managed the project well and provided sub-
borrowers with adequate support services. The Bank helped BNP to set up a
routine preventive maintenance program for the project boats by financing
an initial stock of spare parts out of the loan proceeds.        None of the
subloans is in arrears and BNP is keeping sub-borrowers under close
financial supervision.
10.        The economic impact of the project on the shrimp fishing indus-
try is, at this stage, difficult to assess because of uncertainties about
future changes in shrimp prices, in the total catch and in the size of the
national fleet.   Moreover, all project boats have been operating for too
short a time for accurate estimates to be made of their operating effici-
ency. However, the economic rate of return is likely to be quite substant-
ially lower than the 15% to 22% range expected at appraisal.          This is
because the obsolete vessels which the project boats were supposed to
replace remained in operation.    Therefore, so far, averted losses may not
be counted as a benefit.     At appraisal the total catch capacity of the
fleet was assumed to be around the maximum yield of the traditional shrimp
grounds, so that the project boats were not expected to raise the national
catch; and no overfishing would occur.     In 1976, the construction of new
trawlers was prohibited until 1980, when it is expected that natural
retirement of old boats will have brought the shrimp fleet capacity back
to the estimated maximum catch.      Only then, by averting losses to the
sector, would the project boats start yielding substantial economic
benefits. On the basis of past trends and of the information available so
far, the economic rate of return has been recalculated to be zero.



-3-
11.         The follow up loan (Loan 1398-PAN, Second Fisheries Project)
that was signed in April 1977 and became effective in November 1977
addresses the whole fisheries sector and its scope is therefore broader.
It does include, however, a line of credit for the replacement of five old
shrimp trawlers by five new vessels and the rehabilitation of 10 old
wooden trawlers.   Issuing of the above-mentioned 1976 decree freezing the
construction of new trawlers until 1980 was a condition of negotiations
and assurances were obtained that, from 1980 to 1985, construction or
rehabilitation of shrimp trawlers would be limited to a maximum of 3,260
effective horsepower annually and according to regulations that would
have to be acceptable to the Bank.
12.          To summarize, this project has certainly checked the trend
of concentration of the shrimp trawler fleet in the hands of large
companies and processors and has contributed to redistributing the
currently substantial benefits of the shrimp sector among a larger
number of individuals.    It has also successfully contributed to building
up project management capabilities within BNP and training ship captains.
II. MAIN ISSUES
A. Inadequate Appraisal Analysis
13.   1/     The appraisal report stated that an increase in the fishing
effort- for shrimp would not result in a significant increase in the
total catch.   This means that the appraisal mission considered that with
the number of licenses limited to 238 in 1969/by the Government of
Panama, and with 229 vesse 1s operating in 1970,-      a point close to the
maximum sustainable yield -     had been reached for the species of shrimp
trawled for in the traditional grounds.       In order not to increase the
effort,  and thus prevent a drop in the total catch, the project would
replace 40 old vessels with new ones to be built during the project
period.  There are two flaws in this reasoning:
(a)  replacing old units would increase the fishing effort, since the new
craft would have a larger fishing capacity due to better equipment and
more days of fishing per year due to less breakdowns and repairs; and
(b) at the time of the appraisal no complete statistical data were
available for all species. There were some figures regarding the catch of
white shrimp,   the main species in the fishery.      Figures clearly showed
I/  Fishing effort:   estimated in vessels operating per year, or effective
fishing days per year, or total HP of main engines operating per year,
or HP per fishing day per year, all applied to the same fishery.
2/   This is the figure in the appraisal report.      More recent Government
figures put the number of operating vessels at 237 in 1970. See Annex
1.
3/   Maximum sustainable yield:    catch level beyond which the total catch
decreases.



-4-
the daily catch per vessel had dropped from 178 lb to 105 lb withl162 and
233 vessels licensed to operate, respectively (see Annex 1). - These
figures should have encouraged the appraisal to use the catch vs. fishing
effort curve for analysis, similar to the one shown in Annex 4. This curve
would have indicated that the number of craft or total fishing effort had
already exceeded that needed for attaining maximum sustainable yields and
that the point of declining total catch had been reached between 1960 and
1969. As a consequence the vessels financed under the project expanded an
already overextended fleet and resulted in no additionality to the total
shrimp cat, and     in a decrease   in the average catch per boat (cf. PCR,
para. 6.05)-/.
14.          When the second project was appraised in mid-1976 some infor-
mation was already    available.    The appraisal    report  supports  the point
raised above.    It explicitly stated that "the total catching capacity of
the operating shrimp fleet [was] in excess of available shrimp resources"
that "the shrimp fleet [was then] operating beyond the level of maximum
sustainable yields", and that "annual catch per vessel [had] dropped from
64,138 lbs. in 1970 to 42,951 lbs. in 1975". As a consequence, "most
shrimp operations     [were] marginally profitable or improfitable... as
catches  [were]  low, while costs...    [had]  risen".   The appraisal mission
concluded that "the resumption of profitab b      operations [would] require a
reduction in the number of boats operating".- .
15.       Despite evidence that retirement of obsolete boats was practically
nil during the implementation period of the first project, the appraisal
report recommends financing of 5 new shrimp trawlers under the project.
Further-more, it states that "replacing obsolete vessels with new boats w4h
equivalent  horsepower" would    result   in "a zero    [fleet]  growth rate"'
1/ At present 287 vessels are licensed to operate, and in 1977 the average
catch amounted to 80 lb per fishing day.
2/  BNP has indicated its disagreement with this conclusion.      BPN's analysis,
however, is based on a number of vessels different from that obtained
by the audit mission from official sources and reproduced in Annex 1.
3/ Quotations are from the Appraisal of Panama Second Fisheries Project,
Report No. 1383-PAN, March 23, 1977, paras. 2.14 and 2.15, and Annex
1, para. 3. Emphasis added.
4/ Ibid. Also see para. 17 below. The Region notes that the appraisal
assumed that the effective horsepower of the fleet would be reduced
from 60,000 to 50,000 and that there would be zero growth from then
on. In the audits view this would have entailed retirement of almost
20% of the fleet within a four year period. With the benefit of hindsight,
three years later, it is evident that the fleet reduction has not
taken place to the exent anticipated.



- 5--
These recommendations as well as the conclusion are inconsistent with the
facts discussed abovel/ In addition, the funds allocated for repairs (or
partial rebuilding) of 10 old wooden vessels would also increase the
fishing effort.
16.         Laws presently in force (Decree No. 58, of November 23, 1976)
have frozen the number of licenses in Panama; the granting of permits to
build new shrimp fishing vessels has been deferred to 1980 (Decree No. 13,
of March   1, 1977).    The 5 fishing crafts mentioned above would be in
excess of the limits set by both decrees and could, therefore, not be
granted a building permit unless a new decree is issued.
17.         These constraints seem to have been properly acknowledged now.
The PCR states that the construction of new trawlers should not be under-
taken until the fleet capacity has been brought back to the level of the
maximum sustainable yield of shrimp resources (para. 7.02).       And BNP has
indicated that the 5 shrimp trawlers will not be built and that only 4
vessels have been rebuilt; no additional rebuilding is anticipated.
B. Change in Project Design
18.           The appraisal mission concluded that independent shrimpers
owning 1 or 2 vessels had a pressing need for credit to replace their old
and worn wooden crafts.     Furthermore,  there were no alternative sources
of long-term credit, and the interest rates of the available short-term
loans were substantially higher than the 9-10% annual rates charged by
BNP. The appraisal report also stated that 35 of the 115 vessels operating
in 1970 with 10 or more working years belonged to large shrimp companies
and 80 had independent owners. Fifty percent of the latter, or 40, would
want and could afford to become sub-borrowers under the fisheries project.
19.         Between August 1971, when the loan became effective, and March
1974, when the first contract to build 10 vessels was signed, 22 appli-
cants  filed loan applications with BNP (PCR, para. 3.09).         Sixteen of
these owned from 1 to 6 vessels.     Due to, among other reasons, a decline
in the price of shrimp in 1974, an increase in operating costs (specially
oil price) and a rise in the price of fishing craft, these owners aban-
doned their   idea of participating    in the program.     They preferred to
continue operating their old craft, which meant running a lesser risk to
get about the same earnings.
1/ The Region disagrees and stresses their prudence in setting conditions
for allowing new vessel construction.      They note that the appraisal
mission convinced Government to enact legislation prohibiting
construction of new vessels and prohibiting issue of new licenses,
until 1980, and regulating growth of the shrimp fleet thereafter.
Moreover, the decision on actual new construction and replacement
will only be taken in 1980.



- 6 -
20.        Since the only interested potential sub-borrowers were captains
who owned no vessels, BNP decided to accept their applications.        Sixty-
seven captains applied for the 26 craft which could be built under the
project.    Since these applicants were not replacing       any vessels,  the
Government  granted  them 26 new    special  licenses.  This meant   that  the
project's original aim of replacing old units, in itself questionable, was
not achieved, aggravating the shrimp fleet's overcapacity (para. 13).     The
project should have been fully reappraised when the proposed beneficiaries
failed to come forward and it became evident that the project design had
been implicitly amended, but it was not'/.
21.         To assume that 50% of the independent owners with vessels
more than 10 years old would be interested in replacing their craft proved
to be unrealistic even with the high and rising shrimp prices after
19742/.   The appraisal mission does not seem to have properly analyzed
the economic rationale for vessel replacement.       Most captain-owners are
unwilling to replace their vessels when the amount they can get for the
sale of their craft is trivial, or when the incomes are small and un-
certain if old boats are used in other fishing activities or in coastal
sailing, for which the craft was not originally designed.       This resulted
in a replacement rate significantly lower than the one envisaged at
appraisal.
22.        The economic life of a boat - and thus boat replacement - plays
a major role in determining the optimal size of the fishing effort and the
number of new boats required each year. Most Bank-assisted fishery
projects include the replacement of old boats. CPS has suggested that the
following variables ought to be taken into consideration when analyzing
boat replacement requirements:    (a)  maintenance costs--there is evidence
to suggest that a positive correlation exists between replacement rate and
maintenance cost (the lower the maintenance cost, the lower the boat
replacement rate); (b) down payment for new boats--there is evidence from
this project to suggest that a negative correlation exists between the
required amount for down payment and the replacement rate (the higher the
down payment required to purchase the new boats, the lower the replacement
rate of old boats); (c) complexity of new vessel operations--there is also
evidence from this Project to suggest that the replacement rate is affect-
ed by the complexities in adopting the new technology (the more complex
the technology is, the more reluctant the boat owners will be to adopt it,
and, therefore, the owners will be willing to keep their old boats in
operation); (d) licensing requirements for old and new boats favor
old boats for which little or no restrictions are imposed; and (e)
the vertical integration of catch with landing and processing (improve-
ments in shrimp processing may create enough incentive for these process-
ing plants to acquire new boats; this factor is relatively independent of
the efficiency of new boats).
1/ There is no evidence that the Bank supported the idea, but it accepted
it.
2/   BNP disagrees with this conclusion.     It states that such assumption
was indeed realistic at appraisal time, and that it was the 1974
price drop which made it unrealistic.

C. Procurement Problems
23.        Project execution was delayed.     As a consequence, only 26 units
of the 40 anticipated at appraisal could be financed, and each of these at
a much higher cost than anticipated (PCR, para. 3.03).        One of the main
causes of this delay was inadequate Bank supervision of tendering pro-
cedures.    The bidding for building the first      10 vessels was closed on
January  31,   1973  (twelve  months  after  effectiveness),     as originally
planned.   Only 3 firms (from Colombia, Austria and Mexico) out of the 15
firms (11 countries) which had been prequalified entered the bidding. The
Austrian and Mexican firms were disqualified for not complying with the
national regulations   for bidding.     Since only one firm remained,     these
regulations required that the bidding be declared void (PCR, para. 3.05).
24.         The factors leading to such limited interest in bidding are a
matter of controversy.     The Bank thinks the technical specifications for
the first bidding were extremely detailed and complex, which discouraged
prospectives shipbuilders from participating in the bidding (cf. PCR, para
3.06). In the Bank's view, shared by Panamanian shipbuilders interviewed
by the mission, the technical specifications for the second bid were far
simpler, but this view is challenged by BNP, which stated that only
minor amendments were introduced to the bid documents.        This is probably
correct, because only 3 firms (from Brazil, MexicD and Panama (submitted
tenders  in December   1973.    CONAPAN  (Construcciones Navales de Panama,
S.A.) submitted the lowest bid, at US$148,375 per vessel, and was awarded
the contract for the 10 first units.
25.         The audit mission wants to raise another factor which may
explain the little interest shown by shipbuilders.         The proposed ships
were rather small and specialized.       Due to poor expertise, shipbuilding
companies not duly qualified to build the type of vessel required were
nevertheless pre-qualified.     Actually, only 4 of the 11 shipbuilders who
requested tender documents came from countries engaged in shrimp fishing,
and were thus familiar with this special type of craft and, likewise, duly
qualified to draw up technical specifications on short notice and at
competitive prices.     The three firms which finally participated in the
bidding are located in countries where important shrimp fisheries are
under exploitation.    Two shipbuilders from Peru who participated success-
fully in the bidding for purse seiners under in the second         project did
not submit bids; their insufficient experience in shrimp fishing in
shallow waters, together with previous commitments which kept them fully
occupied at the time, contributed to their lack of interest.
26.         To avoid delays in future fishing projects due to insufficient
or overly detailed specifications and unsatisfactory prequalification
procedures, the Bank should acquire expertise in the naval architecture
field to assist the borrowers in drafting and revising technical data and
specifications, in the prequalification of shipbuilders experienced in the
construction of specialized vessels and in evaluating bids.l/.
1/   Due to the Bank's limited involvement in fisheries projects a full
time employment of a naval architect seems not justified, but employ-
ment of a consultant appears warranted whenever construction of new
boats is considered under a project.



-8-
D. Project Justification
27.          According to the appraisal report the project was meant to
"provide critical assistance to Panama's shrimp fishing industry by
preventing a decline in the catch of a substantial part of the existing
fleet  and by   increasing  the  industry's  efficiency."  In reaching this
objective the project had a rather limited success. The captain's train-
ing program and the port feasibility study indeed contributed to a more
efficient fishing industry.     But the main component, i.e. rehabilitation
of part of the shrimp fishing fleet to prevent a reduction in output
failed (para. 13).
28.          The project's economic rate of return as recalculated by the
audit mission is at best zero without shadow pricing labor.          However,
this rate would only be achieved if at least 6 boats are taken out of
operation by 1980. Only then the fleet's capacity will be brought back to
the level when fishing would not exceed the maximum sustainable yield.
Since boat owners undertake great efforts to keep their vessels afloat,
the reduction of the fleet by six crafts will depend on accidental losses,
a rather speculative view.     In view of the project's doubtful economic
returns and the fleet's overcapacity, the financing of additional boats
under the follow-on project seems unwarranted.
29.         The audit has reservations about the financial rate of return
(FRR) calculated in the PCR.     This is based on a 183 lb catch of shrimp
tails per fishing day (in terms of total shrimp species) over the 16-year
life of the project beginning in 1976.     The average catch reached 192 lb
per fishing day in 1976, and 173 lb in 1977 with 229 and 215 fishing days
per boat for the two years (see Annex 2).     These revised figures increase
the average catch per vessel for 1977, from 33,880 lb as shown in the PCR
to 37,222 lb.    For 1978 and subsequent years the PCR assumes that the
vessels will reduce fishing by four days every year, starting with 216
days in 1977,1/ but maintaining the quantity of shrimp caught per fishing
day.   However, daily catches per day show a marked downward trend.      As a
consequence, the volume of 183 lbs. of daily catch per vessel assumed
in the PCR cannot    be maintained.      Considering the present    fisheries
management, it reflects the maximum possible level of expectable catch per
day,  and not a long term average.      The PCR's projection regarding the
number of fishing days per vessel per year is correct.
30.          Based on the revised data available,     it can be stated that
the FRR will be around 15% compared to the PCR's estimate of 17%.
E.         Income Distribution
31.          The PCR makes an interesting attempt to analyze this issue.
CPS has offered some comments on the analysis of income distribution
effects of fishery projects.     First,  the fact that licenses are better
1/ 204 days in 1980.



-9-
distributed--in a strict sense, that there are more boat owners "with"
the project than "without" the project--is not a sufficient condition for
better distribution of the existing rent from the resource. A license, in
most cases, only provides the right of access to existing rent but does
not determine appropriations of rent flows from the resource. The pattern
of rent appropriations will depend on the marginal efficiency of the
additional unit of fishing effort (again on the quality of the fishing
effort); the appropriations of rent by new units, compared with the set of
existing units, will vary accordingly with the marginal efficiency of each
unit of effort.    Therefore, the project might have contributed to a more
uneven distribution of benefits.       Second,  a distinction must    be made
between independent boat owners and factory-boat owners. On the one hand,
the boat is the only asset of the former but only part of the larger
assets of the latter. On the other hand, the independent owner gets only
the catch benefits - and these are valued at the price paid by the fac-
tories, if there is no other marketing channel -, while the factory gets
the full benefits of all throughput.      And third, after this distinction
has been made, one will have to assess how the efficiency of the last unit
of effort is distributed across existing vessels. In some cases, it will
not pay a fully vertically integrated company to increase its effort,
while it might be profitable for an independent boat owner to acquire an
extra unit of effort.
32.       Another comment may be added on this subject.     Since total catch
has not increased, the project has reduced the catch of each individual
boat. Therefore, many boat owners must have ended up with a post-project
income lower than the one they enjoyed before it.        Most certainly, the
oldest boats will be affected the most.      If these belonged to large boat
owners or to factories, income distribution may have been improved, but it
would have worsened if they belonged to captains owning only one or two
boats each.

ANNEX 5
National Bank of Panama
Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Kapur:
Thank you for your letter of April 24, 1979. Our comments
to various points of the report are listed below:
13.         (a)  If the country had not had a satisfactory fleet
replacement program, the shrimp industry would have been seriously
affected over five years in terms of catch (loss of vessels for various
reasons);
(b) The conclusion reached is not acceptable, since according
to Annex No. 2 to the Report, the number of vessels was reduced by a
total of 15 over a five-year period (1970-1975), so that when 17 vessels
entered into operation in 1975 those 15 were replaced.
14.        We have the following comment to make:     National Bank of
Paniama has so far rebuilt 4 shrimp boats, and we do not expect to
rehabilitate any more. The building of the 5 shrimp boats will not
take place.
15.         See comment to Point 14.
16.         See comment to Point 14.
17.         I believe this statement requires a much more careful and
thorough study than [was possible during] the time spent by the OED
mission in Panama. For vessels of this type the cost would be not
less than $300,000 per unit, and I do not really think that the fidel
and cabez6n resource carries a market price [high enough] to justify
the use of this type of vessel. Not to mention the difficulty in
managing this type of shrimp.
20.        We reaffirm that this project has at no time contributed
to the overfishing mentioned in this point; we shall simply quote the
following figures, based on Annex No. 2 of OED's report:

(+)       Assuming the loss of one vessel in 1976
From this table, we see that in 1975, 232 vessels were in
operation, including 17 provided under the Fisheries Project. In 1974,
215 vessels were in operation, and in 1976, with the 26 project
shrimp boats, a total of 240 vessels were operating in our Pacific
waters, which we may compare to the number of licenses issued for
1968. Looking at Point 13 of the report, we see that the number of
licenses increased by only two. In this way, the number of vessels
in our fishing fleet has gradually been increasing even though the
World Bank/Banco Central Program has not launched a single vessel into
operation since 1976. Thus the only conclusion we reach is that at
no time did Loan 784-PAN between the World Bank and National Bank
of Panama led to overfishing, but rather helped maintain average
daily catch at current levels (see Annex No. 2), which clearly reflects
the efficiency of the 26-vessel fleet as compared with the national
fleet.
21.        The "unrealistic conclusion" mentioned in this point seems
to relate to the situation in 1974 and not to the time of the study,
so I do not feel this was an "unrealistic conclusion".
22.        Before arriving at a conclusion, I would like to explain
the two most important parts of the documentation relating to tendering
for vessels. The first part contains all government regulations on
bidding, as established in our Financial Laws (C6digo Fiscal). These
regulations must be followed to the letter, i.e. there is no room for
personal interpretation. The second part includes the specifications
or characteristics of the vessels desired, e.g. length, breadth of
beam, depth of hold, engine, propeller, kind of hull, etc. We would
like to point out that Point 22 mentions that the Australian and
Mexican firms were disqualified for not complying with the specifications,
however, the fact is that they were disqualified for not complying
with government regulations and the bid that was not disqualified
was not accepted because one of the regulations states that bid proceedings
must be declared void when only one bid remains.
23.        Point 23 states that the technical specifications for the first
tender were extremely detailed and complex, which we do not accept, because
it implies that the second set of specifications was simpler. Actually,

ANNEX 5
Page 3
the changes were insignificant, in fact the same bid was used almost in
its entirety. I take this opportunity to inform you that the World Bank
sent a memorandum stating that the first set of specifications were
very complex. The bidding document was supported and explained to the
World Bank staff in Washington by our Naval Architect/Fisheries
Project Adviser, at which meeting minor changes were introduced to
the document.
24.        This point indicates that some carelessness and haste was
involved in issuing the call for bids, citing as an example the three
Peruvian firms which participated in the bidding for the 10 purse
seiners but did not, for the reasons mentioned above, take part in the
bidding for the shrimp boats. In our opinion this conclusion has been
arrived at too easily. I would like to let you know what happened in
the case of the Peruvian shipbuilders. It is necessary to know what
was going on in Peru at the time of our bid proceedings: all the
country's shipbuilders were committed to the Republic of Cuba on
different projects, and let me mention the three firms that submitted
bids under Loan 1398-PAN. Picsa was in process of building 20 tuna
boats (300-1,000 tons). Insa was involved in the construction of 20
shrimp boats with refrigerator tunnel, and Metal Empresa was also
building 20 vessels. As you will understand, none of these shipbuilders
was interested in participating in the bidding for the 26 shrimp boats
because none of them had the required capacity available.
25.        No comment.
26.        Our conclusion on this Point is the same as for Point 20,
namely that the Central Bank's Fisheries Project has not contributed
to overfishing in Panama.
27.        See Point 14.
The foregoing represents our comments on your Department's
report. Before closing we should like to suggest that the time
allowed for these evaluation missions be longer than the brief
period allowed in the case of Loan 784-PAN.
Thank you for your attention to these comments, we are
available for any further clarification.
Sincerely

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PANAMA FISHERIES PROJECT
(Loan 784-PAN)
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      Over the period 1969-76 the Panamanian fisheries sector accounted
for about 4% of GDP. The shrimp industry, which contributed about a third
of total fisheries output value, employed about 1,200 people and represented
about 11% of the value of exports, excluding petroleum products.
1.02      Over two decades, total recorded shrimp landings (para 5.04) have
been fluctuating between 5,000 and 7,000 m tons, estimated to be around the
maximum yield for the species caught in traditional grounds, close to the
shore. More than 80% of the catch is exported exclusively to the US, account-
ing for about 5% of total US shrimp imports. Prices received by fishermen are
therefore directly related to fluctuations on the US market.
1.03      Demand for shrimps in developed countries is growing rapidly but
the world supply has grown little since 1970 (Table 1). Real prices of
shrimps (Table 1) have been increasing by 3% to 4% per year since 1969 (3.3%
if deflated by the index of international inflation) and are expected to
continue to increase at the same rate.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      The first reference in Bank files to a possible project in the
Panamanian fisheries sector appears in a report dated January 1969 by a
November 1968 FAO/CP reconnaissance mission. This report identified the lack
of proper unloading and boat servicing facilities as the main bottleneck to
further development of the industry, and the main focus of early identifica-
tion and preparation efforts was essentially the feasibility of a new fishing
port project.
2.02      An FAO/CP identification/preparation mission was sent to Panama in
July 1969, which confirmed the possibility of a project which would include
financing of a feasibility study for a new fishing port and a credit scheme
limited to the replacement of obsolete fishing vessels. A follow-up project
would consist of the construction of the fishing port. The draft preparation
report was sent by FAO/CP to the Bank in February 1970, reviewed and commented
upon in' March/April. The final version was forwarded by FAO/CP to the Bank
and to the Government at the end of July 1970.
2.03      Most Bank correspondence during 1969 and 1970 relates to the draft-
ing of terms of reference for a consulting firm to carry out the feasibility
study for the new fishing port and, later, to the selection of the consulting
firm (paras 3.21 and 3.22).



- 18 -
Project Formulation
2.04      The project was appraised in January-February 1971.     Discussions
up to negotiations centered around three main points: (a) BNP's ability to
manage and finance the project, given its past frequent changes in management,
poor operating performance, loan recovery problems and tight liquidity position
following heavy lending to Government in 1968; (b) the need to exempt project
boats from a law prohibiting the import of vessels to fish in Panamanian
waters; and (c) the need to obtain an assurance from the Government that
individual vessel owners would be given a fair and first chance to receive
funds from the project in order to prevent further concentration of the fleet
in the hands of shrimp processors and large companies.
2.05       At a meeting on June 21, 1971, the Loan Committee agreed that the
Loan would be made to the Government but that BNP would manage it as a trust
fund. This position was changed during negotiations (July 1971) when it was
agreed that BNP would be the borrower, with Government guarantee, provided
that BNP would commit itself to improving staffing, organization and proce-
dures of its Industrial Credit Department and to taking steps to improve the
bank's overall organization and operations. Agreement was reached on procure-
ment of vessels (ICB, by lots of 10) and on the possibility of financing the
Captains' Training Program as part of a new UNDP/FAO Fisheries Development
Program.
2.06      The Board approved the Loan on July 27, 1971.    Some questions were
raised during the presentation regarding the extent of Panamanian control over
its territorial waters, the ecological impact of a possible new Panama canal,
and the necessity to standardize boat design and to hire a naval architect.
The matter of giving preference to small shipowners was emphasized by the
staff and one of the Executive Directors.
2.07      The Loan to BNP (US$3.4 million) was signed on August 2, 1971.     It
is repayable in 12 years, including five years' grace, and it carries an
interest of 7-1/4% and a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% on undisbursed
balances.
Targets and Goals
2.08      The project was to "provide critical assistance to Panama's shrimp
fishing industry by preventing a decline in the catch of a substantial part
of the existing fleet and by increasing the industry's efficiency." Over a
four-year investment period, the project would:
(a)  provide credit to fishermen to replace about 40 old wooden
vessels with modern steel shrimp trawlers equipped with modern
fishing gear;
(b) provide technical assistance services to design and assist in
procurement and construction supervision of the shrimp trawlers
and to train shrimp fishermen in basic navigation and in the
use of modern fishing gear; and



- 19 -
(c) finance the feasibility study for a new fishing port outside
Panama City.
2.09      The Loan was to finance the foreign exchange component (64% of total
project costs of US$5.4 million). BNP was responsible for carrying out
Part A of the project (design and construction of shrimp trawlers and provision
of credit to sub-borrowers) and the Government for carrying out the fishermen
training program and the port feasibility study through the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      There was little delay in making the loan effective (one month) but
time consuming prequalification procedures, the need to re-draw specifications
after the failure of the first bidding, and the difficulty of attrActing
qualified bidders delayed the award of the contract for the first 10 boats
until March 1974, i.e., more than two years after the loan had become effec-
tive. By that time, vessel construction costs had increased considerably
from US$81,000 per boat as estimated at appraisal (January-February 1971) to
US$146,000. They were to further increase to US$175,000 for the 10 following
boats and to US$180,000 for the last six, even though they were built accord-
ing to appraisal specifications.
Mid-Course Revisions
3.02      This cost escalation led to two changes in the Loan Agreement.     The
first change, dated January 31, 1974, permitted more lenient credit terms to
sub-borrowers who were "independent operators" (captains owning and operating
their trawlers). It extended the repayment period from eight years (Schedule
5, C of the Loan Agreement) to 10 years, including one year of grace, and
reduced the beneficiary's contribution from 10% to 5% of the construction
costs. The second change, dated April 17, 1975, reallocated US$650,000 from
Categories II and III (technical assistance services and unallocated) to
construction and equipment of shrimp trawlers (Category I).
3.03      Even then, only 26 out of the 40 boats initially envisaged could
be constructed out of the project funds. Although much delayed by UNDP's
inability to locate a training officer (para 3.16), the captains' training
program was satisfactorily completed in September 1976. The port feasibility
study was completed in March 1974 and led to a port Loan (1114-PAN), approved
by the Bank on April 22, 1975. The port is under construction and completion
is expected in 1979.

A. Construction of Shrimp Trawlers
Procurement
3.04      As stipulated in the Loan Agreement, the trawlers were procured
through International Competitive Bidding. Prequalification of shipyards was
initiated in March 1972. Twenty firms submitted prequalification documents
and 15 were prequalified from 11 countries, including a firm from Panama.
The list of prequalified contractors was finalized in August 1972.
3.05      Bids were invited in November 1972.    The 15 prequalified firms
bought bidding documents but only three were able to submit their offers on
time, by January 31, 1973: one firmn from Colombia, one from Austria and one
from Mexico. The latter two were disqualified, however, for not complying
with the conditions set up in the bidding documents. Since only the Colombian
shipyard complied, the bid was declared void for lack of competition. The
three offers ranged from US$135,000 to US$180,000 per boat.
3.06      After discussions with the Bank, BNP agreed that specifications
and bidding documents were too detailed and inflexible and tended to discourage
participation of shipyards. Simplified specifications were sent to the Bank in
July 1973 and new tenders were finally invited in September 1973. Eleven pre-
qualified firms bought documents, and, again, three submitted offers. At open-
ing on December 13, 1973, proposals were as follows:
(a)  Ferjaro, S.A. (Brazil) - up to 10 boats, at US$248,900 each;
(b)  Astilleros Imesa, S.A. (Mexico) - four lots of 10 boats at
US$169,985 to US$196,778 each boat; and
(c) Construcciones Navales de Panama, S.A. (Panama) (CONAPAN) -
10 boats at US$148,375 each.
The contract for the first 10 boats was thus awarded to CONAPAN in March 1974.
3.07      Bid envelopes for a second Lot of boats were opened on June 14, 1974.
However, only one proposal, from CONAPAN, had been received and the bidding
was declared void. Given the lack of interest from other shipyards, the Bank
allowed BNP to negotiate contracts directly with CONAPAN for the construction
of the remaining boats. BNP signed two successive contracts: the first on
October 14, 1974 for 10 boats at US$175,000 each and three boats at US$180,000
each; and the second in April 1975 for the remaining three boats, at US$180,000
each.  The unit cost to sub-borrowers was averaged out at US$165,000 per boat
(para 4.05).
3.08      There were no serious delays in boat conistructioni, which required
from seven to 12 months per boat.   The first boat was delivered in October
1974 and the last in May 1976 (Annex l).



- 21 -
Sub-borrowers
3.09      After the loan became effective, but before the first contract
was awarded in 1974, 22 boat owners expressed their interest in acquiring
a total of 55 boats. The distribution of applicants was as follows:
No. of Boats       No. of
Requested       Applicants
Shrimp Processing Plants                     26                3
Independent Owners:
Large owners /I                            10                3
Small owners /2                            19               16
Total                                   55               22
/I   With six boats or more.
/2   With less than six boats (none had four or five).
However, by the time the construction contracts were awarded, the cost of the
boats had more than doubled and operating costs, particularly fuel and labor,
had also increased considerably, due to the energy crisis and subsequent high
inflation rates. At the same time, the recession in the US caused a sharp
decrease in shrimp prices in 1974 relatively to their 1973 levels (Table 2).
As a result of this squeeze in profits and of uncertainty about future shrimp
prices, the small shipowners who had applied became unwilling to assume such
a large debt and, for those who could still afford immediately to put up a
cash contribution of 5% to 10% of the cost of a new boat, it appeared safer
and more advantageous in the short- and medium-term to keep on operating or
renovating their existing vessel. The following figures show that, in 1976,
the prices at which costs and earnings would break even were about the same
for old vessels as for new vessels, if depreciation of new vessels is not
taken into consideration, and substantially higher for new vessels if
depreciation or debt service are added to the costs:

These figures demonstrate a definite advantage for the retention of old
vessels, if the price of shrimps falls to levels which are about the same as
the shrimp prices were in 1974 if expressed in 1976 terms. This was true then
even if the owner had to spend some amount of money to renovate part of the
boat in order to keep it at sea. In 1976, for some US$15,000 to US$20,000,
a wooden hull could be rehabilitated and winches, tanks, mast and rigging
replaced, and for US$25,000 to US$30,000, a new 200 hp engine could be purchased
and installed. The inclusion of depreciation over 10 years of a new hull plus
tanks and fishing superstructure or a new engine would only have raised the
break-even price of shrimps for old boats to US$1.55 to US$1.60 per pound,
assuming that the annual catch would remain constant at 36,400 lb.
3.10      The change in the Loan Agreement, allowing independent operators to
contribute only 5% of investment costs (besides initial working capital) and
extending the loan maturity (para 3.02) was not sufficient to overcome their
reluctance. Instead, they preferred to continue operating the old vessels
or/and use their funds to overhaul and renovate them once more. Consequently,
in September 1974, very few small owners were still interested in purchasing a
project boat from Banco Nacional de Panama. On the other hand, two processing
plants persistently maintained their requests for 26 boats. However, to
allocate the project boats to them was somewhat in contradiction with the
declared project goal of giving priority to small independent owners. Further-
more, such action would not be consistent either with Panama's determaination
to prevent concentration of the fleet in the hands of a few. Besides, large
processors and companies did appear to have sufficient resources of their own
or other credit sources to replace their old vessels (para 5.02). As a matter
of fact, applying processors have been able to finance nine boats out of other
funds, as did the large independent owners for 10 boats. But among these
small owners who applied, only one did purchase a new boat (in 1973) with
non-project funds.
3.11       Since the only potential sub-borrowers who were still interested in
a new boat and who would be acceptable as small shipowners were captains
operating boats they did not own, the project unit decided to consider their
applications. A total of 67 captains applied for the 26 project boat.-



- 23 -
While the Bank was sympathetic to increasing the number of captain-owners, it
did not consciously support an increase in fleet capacity in the hands of
non-shipowners. Since they did not own fishing licenses already, the benefi-
ciaries selected were awarded special licenses under a special arrangement
established for that purpose. A major consequence of this decision was that
the 26 project boats were added to the existing fleet instead of replacing
old trawlers.
3.12      The first 16 boats were awarded to the most competent of the applying
captains. Then, as only 10 more boats could be financed out of project funds,
BNP encouraged the remaining applicants to form associations of captains. One
of them would operate the boat and receive appropriate remuneration for it,
while the others would continue to work for their current employers, and they
would all share the profits. One cooperative and nine companies were thus
awarded the 10 remaining boats. The type of company set up, however (Sociedad
Anonima, which is a form of limited responsibility company), is not entirely
satisfactory since there is no guarantee that control is or will remain in the
hands of captains. As a matter of fact, there are no captains among the
shareholders of three of the companies, only among members of the Board of
Directors. A closer look at these companies and a few restrictive conditions
to Bank acceptance of them as sub-borrowers is recommended during the super-
vision of the follow-up project (para 7.01) if this type of sub-borrower is
not ruled out entirely. A list of sub-borrowers is provided in Annex 1.
B. Captains' Training Program
3.13      The purpose of this component was to train the project trawler
captains in modern navigational equipment (echo sounder), operational safety
at sea, coastal navigation and preventive maintenance of the machinery. It
was designed, not only to increase the project captains' efficiency in tradi-
tional fishing grounds, but also to allow them to fish in less well-known
areas, farther out to sea, for deep sea species (Fidel, Cabezon). At the time,
UNDP/FAO had an ongoing research program to locate and evaluate these resources.
The inclusion of navigation and the use of echo sounders in the curriculum was
aimed at providing interested project captains with the opportunity of exploit-
ing such resources.
3.14      The training was to take place at least three months before the
boats were to be delivered to the sub-borrowers (the first three boats were
delivered in October 1974 and the last one in May 1976). UNDP agreed to make
the research boat "Canopus" and its captain available for training, using a
curriculum agreed upon by the Bank, and a contract between UNDP and the
Panamanian Government to that effect was signed in June 1972, to be initiated
when the boats would be ready for delivery. However, the requirements of the
FAO/UNDP research program constantly delayed implementation of the course and
witimately prevented it altogether.    In December 1975, a contract was signed
between UNDP and BNP for the provision of another expert for six months,



- 24 -
starting January 15, 1976. The training, under Captain J. Gueran, from FAO,
started in April 1976 and was completed at the end of September 1976. Captains
were trained on their own trawlers during a total of nine commercial fishing
trips and 60 hours of classroom instruction. Instruction was given to two
captains at the same time, with each trip averaging eight days. From dis-
cussions with the training officer and from his reports, it appears that:
(a) courses in navigation were well received by the captains
although they were of doubtful use in traditional fishing
grounds which are always in sight of the coast and well known
to fishermen. Project captains rarely go farther away as
deeper sea shrimp varieties, although abundant, are of much
lower commercial value; and
(b) priority should be given to teaching and enforcing safety
regulations and routine maintenance of the boats.
3.15      The training officer found that the captains were not familiar with
basic safety regulations on board and international procedures for avoiding
collisions. He also identified a need for an updated Spanish version of inter-
national regulations on these matters, which would enable the responsible
authorities to enforce those regulations. The Port Authority should distri-
bute specific instructions to captains who should be required to be familiar
with them in order to obtain captains licenses. There is also need for
inspectors to enforce regulations on navigation. For instance, in 1976, many
project boats did not show mandatory lights while they were trawling at night.
Besides being a danger to the many vessels that constantly go in and out of
Panamanian territorial waters, they were also probably not eligible to make
claims on the insurance they are required to carry, since the insurance
contract expressly states that no claim will be accepted for damages incurred
because of inadequate lights.
3.16      Consequently, there is a great need for a national program that
would define safety rules applicable in Panama, create an adequate inspection
service to enforce them, reform the conditions for obtaining a captain's
license, and provide instruction to captains and crews of the Panamanian fish-
ing fleet. Without this action, the provision of training to project boats
captains in safety rules and practices has a somewhat limited impact. Follcw-
ing receipt of the training officer's final report, however, the project
director made sure that all the project boats had all proper lights installed
or replaced.
3.17      The training expert also reported that captains were unconcerned
about routine maintenance practices. He therefore recommended that the subject
be emphasized in future training and that the ptoject unit carry out periodic
inspections to ensure that such practices are foll<,wed. He further suggested
that compliance with staff recommendations be made mandatory. The July 1976
Bank supervision mission made similar suggestions and BNP has since then made
arrangements for a private workshop to carry out these inspections and provide
maintenance and minor repair services (para 4.07). On the whole, the training



- 25 -
program has been a success in spite of lengthy delays and has been well in
line with what was envisaged at appraisal.
C. Fishing Port Feasibility Study
3.18       Before Loan 784-PAN was signed, the Bank had already assisted the
Government to prepare procedures for hiring and detailed terms of reference
for a consulting firm to carry out a feasibility study of a new fishing port.
The firm Livesey and Henderson, from the UK, was thus selected in accordance
with Bank Guidelines and was able to start the study in June 1971, about two
months before loan signature. A first phase of general studies was completed
in October 1971 with the recommendation that the port be located at Punta
Vacamonte, one of two sites thoroughly studied. The Government requested the
firm to carry out supplementary studies on a third site, which delayed the
detailed feasibility study. Finally, in August 1972 a Government-appointed
Evaluation Committee concurred with Livesey and Henderson on the proposed site
of Punta Vacamonte. The second phase of the study was completed at the end of
1973 and the final draft was presented to the Government in March 1974.
3.19      On this basis, a fishing port project was appraised by the Bank and
a port Loan (1114-PAN) of US$24 million was approved on April 22, 1975. Con-
struction is proceeding and completion is expected on schedule in 1979.

3.21      A considerable increase in construction costs took place between
1970 and 1975. Actual costs of the 26 vessels were: 10 trawlers at US$146,0O(i
each, 10 trawlers at US$175,000 each, and 6 trawlers at US$180,000 each, com-
pared with US$81,000 expected at appraisal. A breakdown in these costs is
presented in Table 3. The average unit cost of project trawlers more than
doubled (+122%) between 1970 and April 1975, the date on which the last



- 27 -
contract was signed with the shipyard. Between 1970 and 1975, the wholesale
price index in Panama increased from 100 to 202 and the index of international
inflation from 100 to 192. These considerable cost increases are therefore
mostly the consequences of world inflation and the impact of the oil crisis
on the cost of steel and steel products. Another important contributing
factor was the increase in labor costs. A revision of the labor code in 1972
reinforced the power of the unions and increased social charges and benefits
by about 80%. Moreover, base wages for qualified labor have increased by
about half between 1970 and 1976.
3.22      Costs of project administration to BNP are estimated at around
US$54,000 per year, including salaries (US$50,000) and other expenditures
(US$4,000).

Because of the cost increases and lack of resources of the beneficiaries
selected, BNP had to finance more than its original share of construction
costs and most requirements in initial working capital.     In addition, many
captains borrowed from BNP at commercial terms (short term, 12% interest) to
finance their own equity.
Disbursements
3.24      The actual and estimated schedules of disbursements are presented
in Annex 2, Table 1. A more detailed breakdown by categories is presented in
Annex 2, Table 2.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE
4.01      In 1970 BNP hired a firm of consultants (Peat, Marwick and Mitchell)
to advise on the reorganization of the Industrial Credit Department. Their
recommendations were implemented in 1971. In addition, prior to the promul-
gation of Law 20 of 1975, by whichi BNP became a fully autonomous state entity,
another firm (Arthur D. Little and Co.) was contracted to make recommendations
on top management structure.
4.02      Regarding BNP's financial position, in 1976 a vigorous action
reduced the proportion of the portfolio in arrears from previous levels of
12% to 8%. The debt/equity ratio, however, deteriorated between 1971 and 1975.
These matters were discussed at length during appraisal and negotiations of
the Second Livestock and Second Fisheries Development Projects (Loans 1397-PAN
and 1398-PAN) and will not therefore be repeated here.
4.03      The Project Unit was set up, as envisaged in the appraisal report,
as part of the Department of Industrial Credit. The project director was, at
the same time, Director of Municipalities under BNP's Division of Assistance
to Local Governments. He is assisted by a full-time deputy director. Other
full-time personnel include a fleet supervisor and an accounts clerk. Addi-
tional administrative functions appropriate to project activities are carried
out by other personnel of the Industrial Banking Division as and when required.



- 29 -
A naval architect was contracted to design and supervise the construction of
project trawlers. In addition, a Fisheries Project Committee, with represen-
tatives of BNP, the Directorate of Marine Resources, the Fishermen's Associa-
tion and independent fislhermen, provided advice on boat specifications and
evaluation of bids.
4.04      Generally, the executing agency had the power needed to implement
the project up to the point of financing the construction and initial opera-
tion of the new fleet. Tlhe Project Unit has implemented the technical
and financial aspects of the project well; it keeps sub-borrowers under
tight control and it is genuinely concertned with providing beneficiaries
witth adequate support services.
Credit
4.05      All sub-borrowers received-long-term loans from BNP to finance 90
to 95% of the construction cost of their vessels. Each subloan carries a 9.5%
annual interest and for "independent operators" (a captain owning the trawler
he operates), is repayable in 10 years, including one year of grace. For
other operators, the subloan is repayable in eight years, as originally stated
in the Loan Agreement. Although the unit price to sub-borrowers of the boats
initially varied according to the date of thie various construction contracts,
BNP proposed to average out the cost of the entire lot to US$165,000 per boat.
All sub-borrowers accepted a revision of their contracts accordingly.
4.06      In 1976, the debt service record of the sub-borrowers has been
excellent. However, only interest had to be paid since most still were within
the grace period in 1976 and early 1977. To this date, few data are available
on 1977 operations, but it appears that unfavorable ecological conditions in
1976 and 1977 have resulted in noticeable decreases in the 1977 average catch
per project boat (para 6.03). This might substantially tighten the sub-
borrowers' liquidity position. In addition, cash flow projections (Annex 3,
Table 2) show that their financial condition may become critical from years
three to 10, particularly if real prices of shrimps increase at less than 3%
per year or if costs increase by more than the inflation rate. BNP is very
aware of this and hias strongly encouraged the beneficiaries to establish
reserves in fixed term savings accounits out of the money earned in the first
two years. At the end of 1976, 10 owners had about US$10,700 eacih in such
accounts and two had about US$5,500. In addition, the project director
closely monitors their clheckinig accournt balances. If this action is not
pursued, it is likely that the repayment period will have to be extended once
more.
Boat Maintenance
4.07      The Project Unit does not have sufficienlt staff to supervise routine
preventive maintenance operations of the fleet, but the fleet supervisor sees
to tt that the boats are brought to the shipyard at least twice a year for
inspection and major maintenance works, as required [or insurance purposes.
Routine maintenance practices anid works, however, are neglected by the cap-
tains, and this could rapidly reduce the operating el.ficielncy of the fleet.
The Project Unit was made aware of this during supervision and a preventive
boat maintenance program was set up at the end of 1976 under which the boats



- 30 -
would be regularly inspected and minor repairs and maintenance services would
be performed. Its operation started in January 1977. BNP has selected a
private mechanic with nine years previous experience with the local Cater-
pillar representative. The workshop, located on the shrimp landing jetty,
belongs to him. His staff of seven includes, besides himself, three mechanics,
an electrician, a carpenter and an occasionally contracted refrigeration spe-
cialist. Participation in the program is voluntary since there is a charge of
about US$120 per month per boat, not including the cost of spare parts, and 16
captains have enrolled. Their boats are inspected after each trip and minor
repairs are performed immediately. A report is sent to BNP after each visit
and BNP sees to it that the boats do not leave the harbor before repairs are
made.
4.08      The Bank financed 67% of the cost of an initial stock of spare
parts (total cost: US$69,000), which belongs to BNP, to facilitate the work
of the maintenance workshop by ensuring their immediate availability. For
the enrolled boats, the system seems to work well. However, 10 captains
have chosen to keep their former meehanics and those boats are not inspected
regularly.  For BNP's own protection, the Bank suggested to the project direc-
tor that the private workshop be commissioned to perform compulsory inspection
and checks on all boats, even when it does not itself perform the repairs.
The matter should be followed up during supervision of the Second Fisheries
Project, since tthe shrimp trawlers to be built or rehabilitated under this
project will also have to receLve proper maintenance.
Accounting, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.09      The keeping of project boat accounts has been entrusted to a firm
of public accountants, barreto y Asociados, at a monthly fee to the boat
owners of US$80. Their work consists of keeping records for the captains,
helping them in certain legal procedures (social security, taxes, license
renewal, and the like), and producing financial statements every six months.
Consequently, they produced balanced sheets and profit and loss accounts for
each boat as of December 31, 1975, June 30, 1976 and December 31, 1976 in
addition to statistics on catches. Unfortunately, they were produced in the
conventional form, which is not adequate to reflect shrimp trawlers' oper-
ations and does not allow meaningful cost accounting.
4.10      The financial statements produced, although drawn up by this local
accounting firm, were not audited eithier by an independent firm of public
accountants or by the independent auditors of the Comptroller General's office.
The figures used for the missioni's cost calculations are therefore subject to
reservations.
4.11      The accounting firm was to collect US$31,200 iii total fees in 1977
for keeping the individual books of account for the 26 trawlers, a figure
judged to be high.   Accordingly, after a discussion on the matter between the
project director and trawler captains at a meeting of fishing captains, it
was agreed that meaningful management accounting was more important than book-
keeping and the suggestion that the BNP project administration unit could be



- 31 -
organized to keep such accounting records at less cost was favorably received.
Some fee would be charged to the captains, and the accounts could be audited
by BNP internal auditors. Properly stated, they would be of great help to
the captains to understand their financial situation and to BNP itself for
project monitoring and evaluation purposes. This transfer had not been made
yet by June 1977 but the mission was assured that it would take place in
early 1978 at BNP's new headquarters, when the accounting unit for the Second
Fisheries Project would be set up.
Insurance
4.12      There is a condition in each loan agreement that the sub-borrowers
should take an all-risk insurance policy to cover any contingency that might
occur in connection with the vessel to be insured. A local company (Compania
Internacional de Seguros S.A.) was selected on behalf of BNP by Asesora Tefi,
S.A., local brokers, who receive a 7% commission. The annual premium was
agreed at 4.75% of US$165,000 for each trawler, i.e., US$7,837 p.a., with the
insured assuming the first US$1,000 of loss. Although lower than current rates
for new steel trawlers (around 5.25% quoted by one company), it is higher than
the premium that could be obtained from pool marine insurance for the 26 boats.
During supervision, the Bank recommended that such a possibility be reviewed
or that BNP carry its own self-insurance pool for the whole fleet. The matter
was discussed by the project director with the broker, and the insurance
company proposed to concede the boat owners a 30% participation in annual
profits retroactively to January 1976. At the end of 1976, about US$12,000
was returned to the captains, reducing the actual premium from US$7,837 to
US$7,373, i.e., from 4.75% to 4.47%, but this is still probably substantially
higher than possible rates under pool marine insurance (estimated at 2.8% by
the appraisal team).
Progress Reporting
4.13       Quarterly progress reports were received up to June 1976 when the
Project was almost completed and more than 95% of the funds disbursed. Only
payments for 5% of the value of a few boats were still due to the shipyard
under the performance guarantee scheme and the spare parts for the maintenance
program still had to be purchased. Quarterly progress reports included tab-
ulated information on key procurement and construction dates, sector data on
shrimp landings and prices, and disbursements. Separate reports by the Min-
istry of Industry and Commerce on the port feasibility study and by the naval
architect on the status of construction of each vessel were attached to every
report. In addition, two annual reports on boat operating accounts for 1975
and 1976 were sent, the latter was received in early 1977. The training
officer submitted a final report at the end of September 1976. Technical
and financial reporting was adequate, but none of these reports included any
analysis of current economic conditions in the sector.



- 32 -
Auditing
4.14      The Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement required project
accounts of BNP and, for the captains' training program and the port feasibil-
ity study, the Miniistry of Industry and Commerce, to be audited every year.
Auditing of BNP's project accounts was carried out by the General Comptroller
of the Republic (Coutraloria General de la Republica) within the framework of
its general annuall auditing of BNP and reports were sent to the Bank regularly
and on schedule. Audit reports of project accounts of the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry for the port feasibility study, however, were never received and
the files do not show evidence that they were ever claimed.     Since Bank funds
for that purpose were channelled through BNP, they were subject to auditing of
BNP's accounts.   According to the Port Authority, however, the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry spent US$178,917 in local expenditures, in addition to
the Bank-financed consulting fees of US$398,387 (para. 3.23).
V. PRODUCTION AND SOCIAL IMPACT
Changes in the Shrimp Trawler Fleet
5.01      Out of the 229 shrimp trawlers in operation at the end of 1970,
about half (113) were wooden trawlers over 10 years old, kept in operation at
high cost (operating, maintenance, frequent replacement of hull, keel and
rudder pieces, frequent caulking of the hull planks; and replacement of the
main engine, brine tanks and auxiliary equipment) (Table 4). Since 1968, the
number of shrimp fishing licenses had been limited to 238 1/ but the appraisal
mission estimated that the total catch would decline if an estimated 40 boats
were not renewed. To that effect,ithe project made financing available,
particularly to small shipowners who were to receive preference (Schedule 5,B
of the Loan Agreement).
5.02      Since the beginning of 1971, 73 new boats have been constructed,
including 26 under this project (Table 5). The number of ordinary licenses
for shrimp vessels of more than 20 tons gross is still legally limited to 238.
However, additional special permits have been issued to 26 project beneficiaries
and to eight other fishermeni.  The 26 new boats financed through this project
have been granted special licenlses so that they were, in effect, added to the
existing fleet (para 3.11). The remaining 39 new boats therefore may be con-
sidered as replacements for obsolete boats 2/: nine belong to processing
plants, 13 to large companies, 16 to small companies and one to an indivi-
dual, which indicates that, except for individual boat owners, alternative
sources of financing were available. Many of the companies and some indivi-
duals are affiliated or in partnership with processing plants. Financing was
1/   For trawlers over 20 tons gross.
2/   Direct replacement or indirect whenever the owner had purchased a
license from another one who did not want to replace his boat.     In 1976,
ten ordinary licenses were not in use.



- 33 -
obtained from a few banks prior to 1975 (Banco Fiduciario, Banco Continental,
Chase Manhattan) on rather stringent terms (three-year repayment period, no
grace), mostly by processors and large companies. Smaller companies and
owners financed their vessels mostly out of their own funds. It must be
pointed out that many owners and most shareholders have other activities and
do not operate their boats themselves. I/
5.03      As a result, 78 of the 113 boats already considered obsolete at
appraisal were still operating in 1976. Most now are 18 to 20 years old.
Twenty-four belong to small owners (individuals or associations), and it can
be assumed that they were part of the initial target group of the project
(Table 6).
Impact of the Project on the Relation of Capacity of the Shrimp Trawler
Fleet to Shrimp Resources
5.04      Since 1960, total shrimp landings have fluctuated between 5,000
metric tons and 7,000 metric tons per year (Table 7) and both appraisal
reports of the first and second fisheries projects estimated that stocks in
the traditional fishing ground were being fully-exploited and that a further
increase in fishing intensity would not significantly increase the total
annual catch. These statistics are based on landings at processors' piers and
do not take into account landings elsewhere for unrecorded direct sales on the
domestic market, mostly to restaurants. In many countries where boats are not
operated by their owners and the crew is paid on a share-of-catch basis, as in
Panama, it may happen that some captains sell part of the catch while at sea
for their own benefits. These uncertainties cause the financial and economic
analysis of the project to be tentative although on the same basis as at
appraisal. However, there does not seem to exist any other important incentive
to directly sell on the domestic market or abroad. The currency is freely
convertible and pegged to the dollar, no indirect tax is levied on the catch,
and there is no official control of domestic or export prices. If a substan-
tial increase in the catclh of shrimps was possible from additional boats, this
should have become apparent from the national catch statistics shown on
Table 7, particularly between 1960 and 1975 when the total number of boats
increased from 162 to 254 and yet, total landings remained around the same
level throughout this period.
5.05       In the short term, the project as implemented has therefore contri-
buted to some extent to the present over-capacity of the fleet. Table 7 shows
that since the early 1960's, particularly since 1970, the average catch per
boat has decreased substantially. The total national catch of the more highly
priced species has been decreasing, which led the Government in 1977 to impose
a complete ban on fishing for all shrirnp species during the months of February
.and March of each year. However, over-capacity is also a result of non-
enforcement of regulations limiting, not only the number of licenses, but also
1/   Few data are available on the structure of boat ownership and its
links with other activities.



- 34
the engine horsepower to 260 hp on new trawlers (since July 1972). Project
boats have complied with horsepower regulations since they have 240 hp engines
but practically all the other new boats constructed since 1973 have well over
300 hp, which allows them to trawl larger nets faster (Table 8).
5.06      The 26 project boats (10% of total number of vessels and 9% of
total fleet horsepower) accounted for 8 to 10% of total national catch in
1976 and early 1977 (Table 9). They also seem to have performed better than
the average boat in catching the high priced white and pink shrimp species
(Table 10).
Social Benefits
5.07      Social benefits from the project are substantial since it gave to
motivated captains the opportunity to increase their incomes and become inde-
pendent entrepreneurs. A captain working as an employee on a trawler earns
about US$7,000 to US$7,500 per year, while as a project beneficiary, he may
earn as much as US$36,000 after his debt has been repaid. In the longer run,
when obsolete boats are retired and when the new licensing regulations have
been enforced, thus solving the present problems of fleet overcapacity, the
project may have actually been instrumental in bringing about a more fair,
more efficient structure of ownership of the shrimp trawler fleet. This
depends, however, on how many other independent operators will replace their
obsolete vessels after 1980.
5.08      In addition, the project created permanent employment for about
80 crewmen. Incremental employment in the shipyard attributed to the project
may be estimated at about 350 man-months from March 1974 to January 1976.
However, this does not include the additional employment created in the ship-
yards for the maintenance of an enlarged fleet.
VI. RATES OF RETURN
A. Financial Rate of Return
6.01      The appraisal report estimated the financial rate of return to be
about 14% if prices and labor costs remained constant and 22% if prices and
labor costs increased by 2% per year (the crew is paid on a share-of-catch
basis).
6.02      Accounts are available for one full year of operation for 20 project
trawlers (1976) and to some extent, for 1975 and 1977. Actual results and
appraisal estimates for the first year of operation are shown in Table 11.
Actual results have been drawn from unaudited financial statements prepared
from the legal books kept for each trawler by the accounting firm, Barreto y
Asociados.



- 35 -
6.03      Since beneficiaries did not own a trawler before, all financial
costs and benefits may be considered as incremental with the exception of the
captain's remuneration, which has been added to the operating costs. Real
prices of shrimps have increased by 3% to 4% per year on average between 1970
and 1975 and have been assumed to continue to increase by 3% per annum, with
concomitant increases in labor costs. The number of fishing days per year
in 1976 was the same as projected at appraisal (240), but will be lower in
the future (216) since shrimp fishing is now prohibited in February and March.
Calculations, assumptions and sensitivity to various hypotheses are detailed
in Annex 3. The most likely rate of return has been estimated at around 17%,
very close to appraisal estimates under the price and cost increase assumption.
It is clear that the immediate post construction operational experience has
been quite satisfactory since net income of the first year after debt service,
depreciation and tax is, in constant terms, 1.6 times the appraisal figure.
However, analysis of the main contributing factors reveal that:
(a) At appraisal, the average annual catch per trawler was estimated
at 69,600 lb, or 290 lb per fishing day. The average annual catch
based on results of 3,567 fishing days in 1975 and 5,950 in 1976
was only 183 lb (Table 12), or about 44,000 lb per year (Table
13), only 63% of the original estimate. This reflects the general
decrease in catch per boat in Panama, which, in turn, reflects
an 11% increase in the total number of trawlers and the higher
average horsepower of the new traw.lers' engines, while the total
national catch remained stable and even decreased. In 1977, the
average catch per boat decreased substantially, to about
33,900 lb. Although no data are available yet either on the
number of fishing days or on the total national catch in 1977,
the latter is reported to have decreased by more than 25% from
its 1976 level. This is believed to be because severe drought
in 1976 and rising waters In the Bayano river dam reservoir have
reduced fresh water flows to the brackish water areas where the
shrimps breed and grow.
(b) The shortfall in the catch was more than offset by an increase
in ex-vessel prices of shrimps, fromi US$0.77 per pound at
appraisal to US$1.77 in 1975 and to US$2.58 per lb in 1976
(Table 13). Exceptionally high prices since 1976 following
recovery from the recession in the US, early in the boats'
operating life, inflated the actual rate of return relatively
to what such return would have been in a more "normal"
situation (sensitivity tests show a 14% rate of return
if the 1976 price had been at US$2.05 per pound, in line
with 1970-75 trends). Prices remained high in 1977, although
they slightly decreased from their 1976 level to US$2.49 per
lb.
(c)  Actual gross earnings in 1970 constant terms are about 10%
higher than appraisal estimates, but operating costs appear
roughly similar. Trip expenses, however, account for a larger
proportion of total operatinig costs (40% instead of 36%),
because of large increases in fuel prices and labor costs.
Ship's fixed expenses, such as maintenance, appear lower but
they also should increase substantially during the coming
years.



- 36 -
and the cash flow position are quite sensitive to the time spent at sea, which
points up to the importance of a good preventive maintenance program that will
reduce the number of days a trawler is immobilized for repairs.
B. Economic Rate of Return
6.04      Because of uncertainties concerning the basic statistics on the
national catch (para 5.05) and the impossibility accurately to foresee future
changes in the total fleet, and because data on the operations of the project
boats are available only for a maximum of two years, it is still too early to
assess the economic return of the project. The calculations described in
Annex 4 and summarized below are based on the conservative assumptions that
future changes in shrimp prices, total fleet catch and in the number of boats
in operation will follow the same trends as recently recorded in official
statistics. In addition, it is assumed that had the 26 project boats not been
launched there would have been no reduction in the national catch up to and
including 1979.
6.05      At appraisal, it was considered that the principal economic benefit
of the project would be the incremental volume of shrimps which replacement
trawlers would catch over the amount the old vessels would catch if they were
kept in use for a longer period.    This averted loss to the shrimp sector
cannot now be accounted for as an incremental benefit since the project boats
were added to an existing fleet which was already able fully to exploit the
traditional fishing grounds. The same national catch has been redistributed
among a larger number of boats, thereby increasing total fishing costs.
Consequently, whereas all the project costs are incremental, there will be no
incremental benefits to claim, until the total fleet capacity has decreased
below the total maximum catch volume. According to a decree issued in 1976,
no new trawler may be constructed until 1980, when it is expected that the
natural retirement of old trawlers will have brought the fleet capacity back
to the level of maximum sustainable yield (for detailed analysis, reference
should be made to the appraisal report of the Second Fisheries Project). By
1980 the number of trawlers of over 15 years, and particularly over 20 years
old, will be considerably greater than in 1976, and it is likely that the
retirement rate will then increase substantially. However, given the very
limited amount of credit available for boat construction since 1975, other
than under the Second Fisheries Project, it is likely also that not all old
boats will be replaced. The 26 project boats will start yielding economic
benefits from the moment they avert a loss in the national total shrimp catch.
Assumptions used in the phasing of project benefits from 1980 are detailed and
justified in Annex 4.
6.06      On the basis of past trends in price increases and natural retirement
of old boats, but depending on the efficiency of the boat maintenance program
in keeping the project boats at sea for about 216 days per year, the economic
rate of return may be estimated to vary between 3% and 7% if shadow prices
are used.



- 37 -
However, if the real price of shrimps increases annually by more than 3%
and if the rate of retirement of old boats after 1980 is faster than assumed
earlier, the economic rate of return could be between 8% and 12%. Several
sensitivity tests have been carried out and are summarized in Annex 4, Table 2.
It is also conceivable that a sudden fall in shrimp prices, similar to that
which occurred in 1974 could lead to a more rapid retirement of old boats
between 1978 and the early 1980s. Finally, as pointed out previously (para
5.04), national statistics on catches are not accurate enough to state
with certainty that the addition of the 26 project boats did not result in
some additional catch since 1976. Any benefits which occur between 1976 and
1980 would considerably increase the economic return of the project. However,
the economic rate of return of the project is likely to be quite substantially
below the range of 15% to 22% expected at appraisal.
C. Other Economic Considerations
6.07      A special feature of the Panamanian shrimp industry appears to be
that there is a finite, yet renewable, resource which is now being fully
exploited by more boats than required. Since there is no economic return on
additional boats once the fleet has reached its optimum size, one may wonder
what rationale was used to justify the new entries. Unless a government issues
and enforces regulations limiting the number of licenses, or charges high fees
on their issuance, or collects substantial taxes on profits, newcomers will be
interested in joining the fleet as long as operations are financially profit-
able. Financial profitability of a boat depends on the economic efficiency of
the fleet as a whole and there will be new entries until the fleet becomes so
overcapitalized that its economic return drops below acceptable levels. In
the case of Panama, profits from the shrimp fishing industry are not substan-
tially taxed, only very small fees are charged on the issuance of licenses
and, although the number of licenses has been limited since 1968, only in 1976
did the Government revise them to allow better enforcement. It is therefore
interesting to estimate what the economic rate of return of the shrimp fleet
was at the end of 1976.
6.08      Even with the addition of the 26 project boats, the economic rate
of return of the shrimp fleet as a whole still appears to be fairly substan-
tial. With 263 trawlers in operation in 1976, the projected financial rate of
return of a project boat remains at about 17% (para 6.03). Therefore, if the
whole fleet were to be replaced today with trawlers similar to the project
boats, its economic rate of return would be 17%, or about 19% if transfer
payments were deducted from financial costs. In 1976, the average annual
catch of a project boat (44,500 lb) was'about equal to the national average
catch per boat, so that the economic benefits of the fleet (the total national
catch value) were about equal to 263 times the value of the annual catch of
a project trawler. On the other hand, project boat horsepower (240 hp), is
slightly lower than the fleet average (255 hp) which means lower investment
and operating costs. Also, to keep the national catch constant over the
years, the number of fishing days per boat would have to be maintained at 220
to 240 days per year, which would mean higher maintenance costs and more



- 38 -
frequent parts replacement. On the basis of these two considerations, the
economic rate of return of a new shrimp fleet of 263 vessels with character-
istics similar to the boats they would replace, would more likely be about 13%
to 16%, still an acceptable return.
6.09      Government policy until 1976 therefore appears to have derived from
a determination to allow as many persons as economically possible to benefit
from a profitable sector of the economy, even if the economic optimum was
sacrificed to considerations of equity, reduction of unemployment and under-
employment (paras 5.07 and 5.08) and to the desire to promote the local ship-
building industry. The project gave CONAPAN the opportunity to gain and test
improved technical methods so that it now can compete efficiently with foreign
shipyards for the construction of fishing boats. Since 1976, however, the
Government has become aware that the fleet could become only marginally effi-
cient if some measures were not taken to limit, or even reduce the total
number of trawlers in operation. Licensing regulations were therefore revised
to allow better enforcement, and the construction of new vessels has been pro-
hibited until 1980. One may also suggest that if natural attrition of old
vessels brings the fleet close to, or at its economic optimum, then a properly
designed tax on the high profits of the remaining vessels or/and high fees on
the issuance of licenses could provide the Government with a very efficient
means of deterring newcomers from attempting to acquire a vessel.
VII. CHANGES IN REPEATER PROJECTS
7.01      A Second Fisheries Project was appraised in July/August 1976.     The
new Loan (1398-PAN) was signed on April 28, 1977 and became effective on
November 14, 1977. The new project addresses the whole fisheries sector and
its scope is therefore much broader than just the shrimp industry. It will
provide credit for the replacement of five obsolete shrimp trawlers by five
new boats and for the rehabilitation of 10 old boats, and for the construc-
tion of 10 purse seiners. It will also provide financing to shrimp processors
to relocate their plants at the new fishing port at Punta Vacamonte (Loan
1114-PAN), where a shell structure is being constructed. The project also
includes pilot schemes on fresh water fish farming and oyster farming.
Control on Fleet Capacity and Licensing
7.02      In spite of thie shrimp fleet overcapacity at the time of appraisal
(August 1976), financing of the construction and rehabilitation of shrimp
trawlers was included under the second project because the analysis of the
fleet age structure shows that an important number of trawlers owned by small
fishermen will be soon over 20 years old and in need of urgent replacement
or rehabilitation (Annex 4, Section B). However, the construction of new
trawlers should not be undertaken until the fleet capacity has been brought
back to the level of the maximum yield of shrimp resources. The appraisal
mission estimated that if the construction of new vessels was prohibited in
1976, natural retirement of old vessels would cause the fleet capacity to
decrease to that level by 1980 (for detaiied calculations, reference should be
made to the appraisal report of the Second Fisheries Project).



- 39 -
7.03      Discussions were held between the Bank and the Government to prohibit
the construction of new trawlers until 1980 (para 4.04), and the issue of a
decree to that effect was made a condition of negotiations of the new loan
(Decree No. 13 of March 1, 1977). In addition, an assurance was obtained at
negotiations that construction of new shrimp trawlers and rehabilitation of
old wooden boats would not exceed a total of 3,260 effective horsepower
annually over the period 1980-85 and that a program outlining how this restric-
tion would be enforced and the industry regulated-would be sent to the Bank by
the end of 1980. Also, the Government enacted a new law (Law No. 58 of
November 23, 1976) regulating issuance of shrimp fishing licenses; such a
legislation was also a condition of negotiations. It applies to all vessels,
including those under 20 tons gross. Under its provision, licenses are no
longer transferable and are linked to a particular boat, not to an individual.
This allows tighter control, both on the size of the fleet in operation (since
holding "idle" licenses is no longer possible) and on its ownership.
Eligibility Criteria
7.04      Priority is to be given to small independent operators (Schedule 2
of the Loan Agreement). Eligibility criteria are the same as those for the
First Project (para 8.02). Since the Bank also has to review all applications,
it will be possible to closely supervise the choice of sub-borrowers and the
state of the boats to be replaced.
Cost and Size of New Vessels
7.05      An attempt has been made to further reduce the construction and
operating costs of the new trawlers by proposing a reduced length of 50 ft
instead of 67 ft and for a similar horsepower (about 220 hp). Total cost is
estimated at US$100,000 and their catch capacity is estimated at 50,600 lb for
216 fishing days per year, which is roughly the catch of the 26 trawlers built
from Loan 784-PAN. If successful, this would not only increase rates of
return on new trawlers and substantially improve the owners' cash flow posi-
tion, but also small owners of obsolete boats should be able to afford invest-
ing in a new boat. Since the project is also providing credit for the rehab-
ilitation of old vessels, a few other small shipowners will also be able to
continue operations at an even lower capital cost.
Captains' Training Program
7.06      The training of captains in fishing operations will be extended to
all fishing vessel captains. Also, more emphasis will be put on maintenance
and safety procedures. In addition, the training officer will be responsible
for the establishment of a system of skippers' licenses to be issued by the
port master after a short course in the fundamentals of coastal navigation,
modern navigational equipment, safety regulations and preventive maintenance
of vessels. However, no mention is made of the need for the creation of a
corps of inspectors to ensure that national and international fishing regula-
tions are observed in Panamanian waters.

VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Appraisal
8.02      The appraisal report properly identified all the main issues,
including the danger of fleet overcapacity. It states clearly that the
purpose of the project is to replace obsolete vessels and the Loan Agreement
provided the Bank with all the tools required to control and reject any appli-
cant for subloans. Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement listed among eligibility
criteria for applicants to prove their holding of a valid shrimp fishing
license and to report on "the age of the vessel to which the valid shrimp
fishing license applies and that is to be replaced" (criteria ii) The same
Schedule also provided that all subloan analyses would be reviewed by the Bank
prior to making any decision and that the terms and conditions of every
subloan would be subject to Bank approval.
8.03      The appraisal team must also be given credit for initiating a
reversal in the tendency at that time to build large size, high horsepower
vessels. At the time of appraisal, the most popular size of boat was 72 feet
long, with a 300-hp engine, with newer boats becoming even larger (Table 8).
The mission undertook an analysis of the most economical size and settled on
a 67-foot vessel with an engine of about 240 hp. This type of analysis had
not been previously undertaken by the Directorate of Marine Resources which,
according to the mission leader, found it most interesting. It probably
helped the Directorate later on to set up maximum horsepower for new boats
at 260 hp (para 5.05). The second fisheries project is following up on this
effort by proposing even smaller size vessels (para 7.04).
Supervision
8.04       It is impossible to find in the correspondence files and supervision
reports any clear statement indicating that the Bank was ever aware that the
vessels had been awarded to non-shipowners. However, verbal statements of
the project officer who supervised the project at that time indicate that the
Bank was aware of this situation but preferred it to a repetition of a case in
Ecuador where Bank-financed boats had ended up in the hands of large or
foreign companies. Also, all subloan analyses were reviewed and approved by
the Bank but none included any reference to name and age of boats to be
replaced, as required by the Loan Agreement, which indicates an implicit
agreement to waive criteria (ii) of Schedule 5,B of the Loan Agreement.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      This project has certainly checked the trend of concentration of
the shrimp trawlers fleet in the hands of large companies or processors and
has contributed to redistributing the currently substantial benefits of the
shrimp sector among a larger number of individuals. It has also successfullv
contributed to building up project management capabilities within BNP and



- 41 -
training ship captains. However, although it is difficult to predict the
evolution of the Panamanian shrimp fleet, the performance of project boats
and of shrimp prices, on the basis of the information available so far, it
appears probable that the economic rate of return of the project will prove
to have been considerably less than expected at appraisal.
9.02      Long delays in procurement, unexpected and especially unfavorable
economic circumstances combined to make it, by all standards, a very difficult
project to manage. The vessels unfortunately became ready for delivery at a
time when, because of the oil crisis, depressed world demand for shrimps
resulted in significant price decreases, while construction and operating
costs doubled over a short period of Aime. It would have been very costly,
if not impossible, given the lack o.- facilities in Panamanian shipyards, for
BNP to hold those boats in order to wait for better prospects. One possible
solution would have been to award them to large processors or companies for
replacement of their old trawlers. The project would thus have been economic-
ally more viable but at the risk of using Bank funds to assist sub-borrowers
who had sufficient resources of their own. On equity grounds, this would have
also been in contradiction with the declared philosophies of both the project
and the Government of favoring small shipowners and avoiding further concen-
tration of the fleet in the hands of a few.
9.03      In spite of the change in the Loan Agreement extending the repayment
period from eight to ten years and reducing beneficiaries' contribution from
10% to 5% for independent operators (para 3.02), interest from small boat
owners does seem to have fallen rather sharply around 1974. Perhaps even
more lenient terms regarding their financial contribution, grace and repayment
periods than were offered would have helped in that respect.
9.04      Technically and financially, however, the project has been fairly
successful so far. It has contributed to build within BNP's Industrial Credit
Department project management capabilities that will be useful in implementing
follow-up projects and it has given an important impetus to the local ship-
building industry.
9.05       Socially, with the exception of a few unclear sub-borrowing
"companies," it has given a few hard-working captains access to entrepreneur-
ship and created employment for some 80 crew members. Also, at least in the
short term, it could be argued that the project contributed to distributing
wealth within the fisheries sector among a larger number of fishermen. Even
with the present reduced average catch per boat, shipowners with the new
project boats may earn an income (before debt service) of some US$30,000,
while, according to appraisal estimates of the Second Fisheries Project,
owners of old unrehabilitated vessels would earn about US$20,000 per year.

PANAMA
FISHERIES PROJECT (LOAN 784-PAN)
Financial Rate of Return
The financial rate of return has been calculated on the following
basis:
A. Earnings
Except for 1977, when total actual catch per boat is 33,880 lb, the annual
catch has been calculated on the following basis:
1.   Catch per fishing day:    183 lb
2.   Number of fishing days:   240 days during year 1 (1976) 216 in year 2
(ban on all species during February and March
from 1977 on), decreasing by four days a year
afterwards.
3.   Ex-vessel prices in
1976 constant terms:      1976:  US$2.58 per lb (actual)
1977: US$2.30 per lb (actual 1977 price
deflated by 1977 inflation)
1978 onwards: 3% annual increase over a
"normal" 1976 level of US$2.05
per lb
Actual prices in 1976 were exceptionally high, following recovery of
demand after the 1974/75 recession. A "normal price" for 1976 has been
calculated on the following basis: Annual rate of increase 1970-75:
15%, applied to current 1975 price. (1975 appears to be a representative
year, wlhereas 1974 prices were exceptionally depressed and 1976 prices
were exceptionally high).
4.   Rate of increases in real prices:    From 1970 to 1975 unit prices of
shrimps have increased by about 15% per year on average, or 4% in real
terms (inflation as measured by the wholesale price index). Operating
costs for the same number of fishing days increased by about 12.5% per
year, as did the inflation rate, or very little in real terms. Costs
would have increased by about 14% if the catch per fishing day had not
decreased substantially, since labor costs are directly related to catch
value, even if 1976 shrimp prices had been more "normal." For future
projections, various estimates have been made at 2% (projected at
appraisal), 3% and 4% rates of increase in real shrimp ex-vessel prices
(and concurrent increase in crew costs). The median 3% has been taken as
the most likely.

C. Rate of Return and Sensitivity
The rate of return obtained under the above assumptions is 17%
(detailed calculations and projected cash flow are presented in Tables 1
and 2). To allow comparisons with the appraisal report, the same vessel life
of 16 years has been assumed. However, the rate of return is sensitive to
various other-assumptions regarding the number of fishing days per year and
the rate of increase in shrimp prices.

3.   Operating Costs
Year              Number of boats in operation
1974       Three boats for two months
1975       Three boats for one year and
14 boats for an average of six months
1976       17 boats for one year and
Nine boats for an average of 10 months
1977
onwards    26 boats
The following transfer payments have been deducted from operating
costs:
(i) taxes, license fees;
(ii) social charges and benefits (about 22% of labor costs);
(iii) deduction of 2% import duty on diesel oil.
B. Benefits
Benefits from the Boats
Under the assumption that the addition of the 26 project boats
led to neither any incremental catch nor to any averted losses, no benefits
should be expected before 1980, since the addition of the 26 boats would
only contribute to the fleet overcapacity, resulting in a decrease in the
national average catch per boat. The same total catch is obtained, but with
the additional costs of the 26 boats. In 1976, construction of new trawlers
was frozen until 1980, date at which it is expected that the natural retire-
ment of old boats (six to eight per year presently) will have.brought the
fleet capacity back to the level of maximum sustainable yield..
In 1980 and beyond, however, the age of the whole fleet will be
substantially higher than it was in 1970 and 1976.

ANNEX 4
Page 3
From 1980 on, one may therefore expect retirement rates to be substantially
higher than at present: around 100 trawlers will need to be replaced, but
if credit availability is as limited as in 1976 (practically none was
available), only owners with substantial resources of their own and the few
who will get financing from Loan 1398-PAN will be able to afford new
boats. Between 1970 and 1976, with some credit available, about 36 boats
between 15 and 20 years old were replaced, i.e., about six per year. If
one assumes that the rate of retirement will increase from eight to 16 per
year, and that only six will be replaced, the fleet size will be decreasing
by 10 boats a year. Taking into account that five new boats will be built
under the Second Fisheries Project, one could estimate that the 26 boats built
from Loan 754-PAN would start yielding some replacement benefits for:
6 boats in 1980 (boats retired but not replaced)
6 boats in 1981
6 boats in 1982
6 boats in 1983
2 boats in 1984
26 boats
since the fleet would decrease by 26 boats more if they had not been built.
Regarding prices of shrimps, the assumptions that have been made are
the same as those used for the financial rate of return, i.e.,
1976          : US$2.58/lb
1977          : US$2.30/lb
1978 onwards :+3% real increase over a "normal"
1976 level of US$2.05/lb (Annex 3)
Averted Losses to Processors
In order to be fully consistent with the methodology used at
appraisal, averted losses to processors have been calculated after 1980 on
the project boat catch (witth the same phasing as above) on the same basis of
US cents 4 per lb in 1970 terms. The economic rate of return so obtained,
with only a deduction for taxes, is minus 2%. No shadow pricing was used at
appraisal. With a further deduction of social charges and the 2% import duty
on diesel oil, the economic rate of return is 0%.

C. Shadow Pricing
The following adjustments can be made:
(a) Shadow pricing of labor:
Alternative I - Shadow pricing unskilled labor at the minimum
wage: the two deck hands each receive 3% of the catch value,
i.e., around US$2,500 to US$2,800 per year. If the opportunity
cost of unskilled labor is the minimum wage (US$1,300 per year),
about 50% of the cost of unskilled labor (33% of labor costs)
may be deducted.
Alternative 2 - All crew members and all shipyard labor would
have been unemployed without the project, or employed in the
marginal urban sectors. Labor could be shadow priced at 30%
of its financial value.
(b) Application of a Standard Conversion Factor of 0.83 to expen-
ditures in labor (at the above shadow wages), food, repairs and
maintenance, fishing gear, dinghy, overhead, insurance and
miscellaneous.
The resulting economic rate of return is 3% if labor is shadow
priced according to Alternative 1, or 5% if labor is shadow
priced according to Alternative 2.
D. Sensitivity
Sensitivity of the economic rate of return to various assumptions
regarding: (a) the number of fishing days, (b) the rate of real price
increase, and (c) the phasing of economic benefits, both with and without
shadow pricing.is presented in Table 2. It shows that the economic rate of
return of this project may be estimated to be within a 3% to 12% range although,
on the basis of past trends, it is likely to be no more than 7%. Excluded
from these calculations are unquantifiable social benefits from the creation
of employment and reduction of underemployment not only for the construction
and operation of the 26 additional boats but also for the maintenance of an
enlarged fleet. The project also gave the local shipbuilding industry an
opportunity to gain higher technological knowledge which now allows it to more
efficiently compete with foreign shipyards for the construction of fishing
boats.
