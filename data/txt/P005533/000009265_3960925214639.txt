PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

SECOND TELECOMMUNIZATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2513-OM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
BACKGOUND
1.   Public Telecommunications services in Oman are provided by the General
Telecommunications Organization (GTO), a government owned commercial enterprise under the
overall direction of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones.
2.   The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in Oman since 1977
through three telecom operations. The first operation was a Technical Assistance loan granted to
the Government. Through this TA, consultants were employed for preparing the development
program that formed the basis for the First Telecommunications Project. The First
Telecommun!cations Project, Loan 1884-OM for US$22.0 million was approved on June 24, 1980
and closed on March 25, 1985. The Second Telecommunications Project, Loan 2513-OM was a
follow up project, approved on April 11, 1985 and closed on June 30, 1991.
PROJECT OBJECMYE   AND PROJECT DESCRIPI ON
3.    In the Third National Development Plan (1985-1990), The Sultanate of Oman set the
following goals for the telecommunications sector: i) the provision of an effective
telecommunications service as a prerequisite of economic diversification; and ii) the continued
development of GTO as an efficient telecommunications organization with effective technical and
financial management. To achieve these objectives the project aimed at: (a) installing a total
65,000 additional exchange lines and expanding the international, long distance
and external line plant networks to match the additional lines; and (b) carrying out studies and
implementing technical and financial training programs.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATIQON
4.         To ensure timely implementation of the project, bid invitation for Bank financed
goods was made a condition of Loan effectiveness. This lead to start up delays of about one
year. The bids which, during negotiations in December 1984 were planned to be issued in April
1985, were not issued until April 1986. The main reason for the delay was a change by the
Government and GTO in the location of the physical components to be financed under the Bank
loan. In September 1985, the new locations were agreed upon between the Bank and GTO after
which GTO proceeded to prepare the bid documents. Even with the initial start up delay of one
year, the project was substantially completed by December 31, 1990, as had been originally
scheduled.
PROJECT COSIS
5.   At appraisal in July 1984, the estimated total project cost was RO 78.5 million (US$227.8
million equivalent). In 1985, the GTO completed preparation of its 3rd five-year (1986-1990)



- iii -
development program which was larger in scope than that appraised for Loan 2513-OM; the total
cost of the new program was RO 125.4 million. In 1987, due to depressed economic activity, the
program was reduced to RO 104.3 and spread over a longer implementation period to 1993. At
completion i.e. December 31, 1990, total investment costs were RO 60.9 million i.e. US$169
million equivalent.
PROJECT RESULTS
6.   Even with the reduced investments GTO achieved most of the physical objectives set at
appraisal. The project aimed at 129,900 lines of local exchange equipment. At the end of the
project, the achievement was 152,380 lines (17% above target). Subscriber connections were
planned to reach 110,500 lines by end of 1990 but the achievement was 97,730 lines i.e. 11%.
below appraisal estimate due to depressed economic activity. By the end of the project, the
telephone penetration was about 6.5% per 100 inhabitants compared to a target of 7.2. This was
satisfactory considering the adverse economic conditions. There was practically no registered
unmet demand at the end of the project.
7.         GTO's financial performance was generally satisfactory throughout the project. The
financial objectives set at appraisal assumed a favorable economic growth consistent with the
previous years. The oil glut slowed down the economy substantially, but due to prudent financial
management, the adverse impact on the financial performance of GTO was minimal.
8.   The internal rate of return for the 1985-1990 investments was 29%  compared to an
appraisal estimated of 16%. The Economic rate of return was 35% compared to 29% estimated
at appraisal.
9.   GTO's financial management was weak in the area of collection. The performance on
receivables was unsatisfactory throughout the project, reaching a figure of 100 days at the end of
1990 instead of the 60 days estimated at appraisal. The main debtor has been the Government,
accounting for 56% of the total debt although constituting only 22% of billing. Receivables from
non-government users were within the set target of two months of billing. GTO is now
discussing the receivables problem with the Government.
10.  In the billing area, GTO made tremendous improvement from quarterly billing at the
beginning of the project to monthly billing at the end of the project when bills are issued within 8
days of the month end.
ISiUTITUMNAL. PERFORMANCE
11.  ibe management of GTO has been sound and the successful implementation of the project
bears witness to this. At appraisal, it was noted that although the present management was
capable of efficiently administering the present organization, the decision-making structure was
highly centralized. The GTO has recently adopted a new organization structure. The structure
has been designed to meet GTO's present and future challenges of satisfying Oman's economic
and social requirements for telecommunications services. The structure is less centralized and it
is gratifying that most of the top positicnc (lst and 2nd level) have been filled by competent
Omanis.



- iv -
MANPOWER AND TRAINING
12.  The project set out to achieve two objectives in this area. Firstly, the staff ratio, i.e. the
number of staff per 1,000 connected lines would be reduced from a figure of 70 in 1983 to 26 in
1990 an efficiency improvement of 63%. Secondly, Omanization would be increased through
intensive training. The staff ratio achieved of 19 exceeded appraisal estimates by 27%.
Omanization, now at 80% compared to 68% at the beginning of the project, proceeded very
satisfactorily.
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
13.  The project was instrumental to the installation of an institutional system that will steer
GTO through to the future. The Management Information Systems that have been introduced in
GTO throigh the Computerization Program have put GTO on a level of financial management
operations equal to those in the industrialized world. The establishment of a Corporate Planning
Unit has created a process which is constantly reviewing tariffs in accordance with the varying
costs of providing service. The overall management of GTO ha5 been modernized and thanks to
intensive training, most of the systems established can be manag'id by Omanis. Thus, although
there are still many expatriates assisting in the management of these systems, the backbone Omani
staff is capable of sustaining their operation. However, more training :.eeds to be done before the
expatriates can be completely replaced.
14. Un the physical part, modern equipment has been installed and utilization is satisfactory
considering the adverse economic conditions. Revenues to De realized from this equipment will
enable GTO to reinvest in future expansion of the network. GTO is now completely self
sufficient financially generating sufficient revenues for its operational and developmental
requirements.
CONCLUSIONS
15.  There were no major problems encountered in this project. The objectives of the project
were substantially fulfilled as outlined above. Bank's main contributions were two fold: (a)
rendering assistance in the establishment of appropriate management systems which substantially
enhanced the efficiency of GTO; and (b) through international competitive bidding, enabling GTO
to obtain equipment at very competitive prices. The unit costs for the equipment procured under
Bank financing were more than 30% below equipment procured through direct contracting.
16.  There are two main lessons to be learnt from this project: (a) with disciplined
management, judicious use of consultants and execution of turnkey projects, project
implementation can be achieved economically and on time; and (b) building of manpower capacity
is a long and arduous process. For it to succeed it must be well planned and implemented over a
long time. Despite GTO's commendable intensive efforts to train Omanis it will still need
expatriates for a long time if it is to maintain its efficiency. The GTO has been very realistic as
far as this problem is concerned and has replaced expatriates where it was absolutely sure that
Omanis could perform the duties.

2.         BACKGROUND
2.01       Public Telecommunications services in Oman are provided by the General
Telecommunications Organization (GTO), a govermment owned commercial enterprise under the
overall direction of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (MPIT). It was established
on June 30, 1980 under Royal Decree 43/80. GTO is managed by a President who is the Chief
Executive and a member of the Board of Directors. He is responsible for carrying owt the
directives of the Board whose ex-officio chairman is the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and
Telephones.
2.02       The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in Oman since
1977 through three telecom operations (Annex 1I:
(a)   The first operation was a Technical Assists; ..e (TA) Project, Loan 985-OM, granted
to the Government of Oman. Through this TA, consultants were employed for
preparing the development program that formed the basis for the First
Telecommunications Project;
(b)   The First Telecommunications Project, Loan 1884-OM for US$22.0 million was

3.         PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01       Setor evelopment Obiectives
The early eighties witnessed a sharp increase in infrastructure investments fueled by
rising oil revenues. The Sultanate of Oman (SOO) having realized the importance of
telecommunications as an essential infrastructure increased its 1981-85 investment from a planned
US$160 million to US$287 million because of the rapid growth in the demand for
telecommunications services due to the rapidly expanding economy. In the Third Na- :onal
Development Plan (1985-1990), SOO set the following country sector goals:
i)   the provision of an effective telecommunications service as a prerequisite of
economic diversification; and
ii)   the continued development of GTO as an efficient telecommunications
organization with effective technical and financial management. Specifically,
over the development period 1985-1990, the total telephone exchange capacity
was planned to grow at an average rate of 28% per annum to 129,900 lines to
enable 95% of anticipated demand to be met by 1990; the percentage of total
population with access to telephone service was to be increased to about 65%
with the installation of exchanges and public call offices in additional rural
townships and village communities; the connected lines per 100 population
was to be increased from 1.7 (in 1983) to 7.2 in 1990; and GTO's efficiency
was to be increased through improvements in organization and management
and increased staff training.
3.02       Project Objectives
The project was designed to:
a)   further strengthen GTO as an institution to enable it to manage most work in the
sector by 1990 including support of:
i)    GTO's efforts to increase the number of trained, qualified Omanis; and
ii)   creating in-house capabi,..y for economic studies and demand forecasting, and
helping GTO to establish appropriate tariff structures in the light of the
foreseen expansion of services.
b)   through a balanced package of works, expand the local telephone faci.ities in existing
telephone switching centers, provide telephone service for the first time to about 37
rural communities and expand domestic long distance and international telephone
facilities to carry the additional traffic genezated by local network expansions.

3.03       preject Descriptlon
The main components of tde project were:
a)   provision and installation of:
i)   about 65,000 additional lines of local exchange equipment (36,000 in the.
Capital area, 10,000 in Salalah and 19,000 in the rest of Oman) with
associated cable and subscriber plant to provide about 62,000 subscriber
connections and about 460 local/long d.stance public call offices;
if)    a digital international exchange of about 600 lines;
iii)    equipment for upgrading one existing coaxial cable and four microwave
backbone links and for providing two new microwave links and eight spur
links;
iv)   satellite communication equipment for upgrading the earth station at Salalah,
expanding the Al Hajar earth station and establishing additional TV receive
only stations in rural areas;
v)   equipment for extension of the mobile telephone network;
vi)    a computer for telephone billing and other data processing applications;
vii)   training equipment; and
viii)   other equipment (primarily, equipment for maritime communications,
teleprinters and vehicles).
b)   construction of exchange buildings and staff accommodation; and
c)   carrying out of tariff studies, establishing of an economic studies unit,
computerization of accounting and other functions, and development and
Lnplemen'..on of technical and financial training programs.
4.         PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.01       The project was designed within the framework of the Government's
Telecommunications Development Program for the period 1985-90 which was under preparation
during appraisal. The project was prepared by GTO with the assistance of consultants. Appraisal
of the Project by the Bank took place in July 1984. The experience gained in the implementation
of the first project played a major role in designing the second project. The thrust of the second
project was directed towards continued institutional improvement of GTO in planning, project
implementation and strengthening its financial position in the light of GTO's desire to accelerate
network expansion. The Technical Assistance component of the project therefore included
carrying out tariff studies, establishment of a corporate planning unit, computerization of
accounting and other functions, aP4i uevelopment and implementation of technical and financial



-4 -
training programs. To underscore the importance of the T.A., the issuance of Letters of
Invitation for the consultants to carry out the studies was a condition of Board presentation.
4.02       The concept of the project was well understoou by GTO management as manifested
by its very effective and timely implementation of the project. The project was well prepared and
timely, serving as a critical bridging between dependency of GTO on external financing and
complete self financing from internally generated funds.
4.03       At the appraisal time the cost of components to be financed by the Bank was set at
US$10.0 million but at negotiations, with the request of the Oman Delegation, the amount was
increased to US$23.0 million to ensure a more significant impact of Bank participation in the
project.
5.         PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01       Loan Efeivenes a-up. To ensure timely implementation of the
project, bid invitation for Bank financed goods was made a condition of Loan effectiveness. This
resulted in start up delays; thus, although the loan was signed on September 20, 1985 and
scheduled to be effective on December 20, 1985, the loan was not effective until June 12, 1986
(Annex 2). The bids which, during negotiations in December 1984 were planned to be issued in
April 1985, were not issued until April 1986. The main reason for the delay was a change in the
location of the physical components to be procured under the Bank financed loan.
5.02       During negotiations it was agreed that the Bank loan of US$23.0 million would
finance, besides consultancy and training, the switching and external cable network of the rural
component of the development program. The rural component consisted of provision of modem
telephone facilities to about 37 rural areas scattered all over Oman. The rural component was
specifically chosen for Bank financing because of its economic impact and since the facil.ties to be
installed were new, this part of the program easily lent itself to procurement by international
competitive bidding. However, after Board approval, SOO decided that services to 36 of these
rural areas should be provided by the National day on November 18, 1986. To meet this date,
GTO directly contracted the supply and installation of the switching and external cable network
(from Main Distribution Frame to Distribution Point) to L.M. Ericssor of Sweden. The
Subscriber Service Leads (from Distribution Point to subscriber Premises) were not included in
the Ericsson contract. This part was included under Bank financing.
5.03       Following GTO's decision to contract the bulk of the rural portion to L.M. Ericsson.
new project components had to be identified for financing under the Bank. These included:
a)   Subscriber service leads for about 23,000 lines for the 36 rural areas contracted to
L.M. Ericsson (para 5.02); and
b)   transmission network, switching and local networks for six main towns in Batinah
Coast namely:
- Quriyat: 1,400 lines
- Suwaiq: 2,600 lines
- Rustaq:  1,500 lines
- Saham:  2,300 lines



- Barka:   3,368 lines
- Khaburah: 2,496 lines
and six other small towns namely:    Dhagmar, Mazara, Nakhal, Awabi, Huqain,
Bidaya
c)   Network expansion in Seeb, Masnah, Fanjah and Masirah by about 1,800 lines.
The new components were consistent with those originally contained in the Staff Appraisal Report
and GTO attached highest priority to the implementation of these components.
5.04       After agreement with the Bank on the project components in September 1985 GTO
prepare i the bid documents which were issued in April 1986. Since then the project proceeded
without any hitches.
Implementation Schedule
5.05       Procurement action by GTO was carried out expeditiously. There were no major
procurement issues experienced in this project due to the discipline of GTO management
(Governance) to observe laid down Bank rules and regulations. Even with the initial start-up
delay of about one year, the project was substantially completed by December 31, 1990 as had
been originally scheduled.
PEriec Costs
5.06       At appraisal, the estimated total project cost was RO 78.5 million (US$227.8 million
equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of US$154.8 million or 68 percent of total
project cost. In 1985, the GTO completed preparation of the 3rd five-year (1986-1990)
development program which was larger in scope than that appraised for Loan 2513-OM; the total
cost of the new program was RO 125.4 (US$363 million equivalent) i.e. 62% above appraisal
total costs. Due to a down-turn in economic activity arising from the oil glut, GTO decided to
reduce the investment program to RO 104.3 million (US$301.1 million equivalent) and extended
implementation period by three years to 1993. At compL!ticn of the project i.e. December 31,
1990, total investment costs were RO 60.9 million i.e. US$169 million equivalent. Amex 3 of
part III details the estimated original and final actuals. The reduced investment was due to a
down-turn in economic activity, and thus demand, arising from the oil glut. Equipment costs for
the Bank financed portion were very competitive due to International Competitive Bidding. It is
estimated that the unit costs were more than 30% below costs of equipment procured through
other means. GTO used this low unit cost as a reference to negotiate prices for all other
equipment in the program. As a result, the overall cost of the investment program was
substantially reduced.
Disbursements
5.07       Disbursements were lagging in the first two years because of implementation start up
delays (para 5.01), but after that they picked up and the Loan was closed as originally scheduled,
on June 30, 1991. The original and actual disbursements and allocation by categories are shown
in Annex 4. The last disbursement was made on July 17, 1991.

6.         PROJECT RESULTS
A. Oaerall Results
6.01       GTO implemented the project according to the revised plan (para 5.06) and the
results were satisfactory.
a)   The following installations were done:
i)   78,920 lines of local exchange equipment i.e. 21 % above planned target of
65,000 lines;
ii)    a 1,000 line international digital exchange (600 line planned);
iii)   one coaxial cable and four microwave links upgraded, two new microwave
and eight spur links provided as planned;
iv)   Salalah and Al Hajar earth stations upgraded as planned;
v)   limited expansion of mobile telephone network to cover all major towns
compared to Muscat and Salalah only at the beginning of the project;
vi)   a computer for telephone billing and other data processing applications was
bought from the Ministry of Finance at a reasonable cost; and
vii)   training equipment to upgrade the training school to a medium level training
school.
Items which were not implemented due to depressed economic conditions are: additional TV
receive only stations for rural areas, maritime communications and teleprinters.
b)   Construction of exchange buildings and staff accommodation.
B. Bank-Financed Components
6.02       Subscriber Buried Service Wire. This component provided complementary plant for
the switching equipment contract with L.M. Ericsson of Sweden. A total of 35 rural locations
(Armex 5) were covered and some 226 cabinets have beea installed. Customer response has been
so good that most of the original capacity of 26,000 lines has already been expanded under GTO
financing.
6.03       Batinah Coast Expansion. This component provided a total of 16,448 lines of
switching capacity in 12 towns served by 82 cabinets covering 101 communities. The list of
towns covered is attached as Annex 5. Subscriber response has also beeii so positive that
additional capacity of about 14,000 lines has been installed and another expansion of 2,200 lines
has already been contracted.

6.04       Network Expansion in Seeb. Masnah. Faniah and Masirah. The contract for
extending the external cable networks in these areas was completed at the end of 1988 leading to
an increase of 1,800 subscribers by the end of 1989.
Technical Assistance
6.05       Tariff and CorMorate Planning Studies. Consultants (Coopers and Lybrand of U.K.)
were employed to carry out studies on tariffs and to advise on appropriate organizational changes
that are necessary in GfO to strengthen corporate planning. These studies were completed at the
end of 1986 culminating in proposals for changes in tariff levels and structure and the creation of
a corporate planning unit. The first task of the unit was to review the tariff recommendations
made by the consultants and since then the GTO has implemented a number of changes in tariffs
including: reduction in telex tariffs; change of tariff levels and structure of local and long distance
telephone calls including the introduction of local call timing; and reduction of international
tariffs. GTO has now got a system for regular review of tariffs. The last tariff review in
October 1991 resulted in reduction of international rates.
6.06       ComDuterizatio. This component, which started with the formulation of a long
term strategy for computerizing practically all the activities of GTO, has gone a long way. Five
major systems have been implemented and are operating satisfactorily. These include: subscriber
billing; inter-administration accounting; network records; traffic analysis; payroll; and personnel.
The introduction of these systems has greatly enhanced the efficiency of GTO. The most
remarkable achievement is the issuance of bills within 8 days of month end compared to quarterly
billing at the beginning of the project.
Operating Performance
6.07       GTO maintained satisfactory technical and financial performance throughout the
project. GTO met most of the operational performance targets and exceeded in some of them.
This is commendable considering that the economy was in a depressed state for most of the
project period due to falling oil prices.
Technical Performance
6.08       The project achieved most of its operational objectives as indicated in the
performance indicators, Annex 6. Subscriber connections were planned to reach 110,500 lines by
end of 1990 but the achievement was 97,730 lines i.e. 11%  below estimated target due to
depressed economic activity. By the end of the project, the telephone penetration was about 6.5
per 100 inhabitants compared to a target of 7.2%. This was satisfactory considering the adverse
economic conditions.
6.09       Telex demand declined throughout the project due to increased use of facsimile,
which is a worldwide phenomenon. Thus the target of 2,600 lines was not achieved and instead
there was a decline from 1,470 lines in 1985 to 1,070 at the end of the project (27% decline).
Telex service is expected to continue declining at the rate of 13% in the next five years. GTO
has been urged to review the tariffs for these services to stimulate utilization.



Financial Performance
6.10       GTO's financial performance was generally satisfactory throughout the project
(Annex 7). The financial objectives set at appraisal assumed a favorable economic growth
consistent with the previous years. *The oil glut slowed down the economy substantially but due
to prudent financial management, the adverse impact on the financial performance of GTO was
minimal. Annual revenue per DEL declined from RIAL OMANI (RO) 872 in 1985 to RO 465 in
1989 and in 1990 it rose by 4% to RO 485. Appraisal estimates projected a decline from RO 872
in 1985 to RO 643 in 1990. The rise in 1990 was an indication that the economy was picking un
but it was also a reflection of tariff adjustments and the marketing efforts of GTO. Cash
operating cost per DEL was kept low at RO 213 compared to an appraisal estimate of RO 290.
Telex revenue per line dropped to RO 2,173 compared to RO 6,000 estimated at appraisal. The
profitability of GTO was sound throughout the project enabling it to pay an annual dividend of
RO 10.7 million to its shareholder, the SOO in 1989 and 1990. The target rate of return on
average net fixed assets of 19% could not be achieved at the end of the project but only 11 % was
achieved. The lower figure achieved was mainly due to less utilization of the network (66% fill
against an appraisal estimate of about 85%) and a revised depreciation policy which allows for a
much higher factor for obsolescence than estimated at appraisal. GTO's financial structure
remained sound throughout the project although the current ratio of 1.7 at the end of 1990 was
much lower than the estimated figure of 4. The major reason for the variance is the financing of
work in progress from GTO's internal cash generation. Debt service coverage was kept in
control with a coverage of 16 compared to 3 because of the funds which were intended to be
borrowed from the SOO (RO 22.4) were given as equity.
6.11       GTO's financial management was weak in the area of collection. The performance
on receivables was unsatisfactory throughout the project reaching a figure of 100 days at the end
of 1990 instead of the 60 days estimated at appraisal. The main debtor has been the SOO,
accounting for 56% of the total debt although constituting only 22% of billing. Receivables from
non-government users were within the set target of two months of billing. GTO is now
discussing the receivables problem with the Government.
6.12       In the billing area, GTO made tremendous improvement from quarterly billing at the
beginning of the project to monthly billing at the end of the project when bills are issued within 8
days of the month end.
Financial and Economic Rate of Return
6.13       The internal rate of return for the 1985-1990 reduced investment was 29% compared
to an appraisal estimate of 16%. The economic rate of return was 35% compared to 29%
estimated at appraisal.
Institutional Performance
6.14       The management of GTO has been sound and the successful implementation of the
project bears witness to this. At appraisal, it was noted that although the present management
was capable of efficiently administering the present organization, the decision-making structure



9 -
was highly centralized. The GTO has recently adopted a new organization structure. The
structure has been designed to meet GTO's present and future challenges of satisfying Oman's
economic and social requirements for telecommunications services. The structure is less
centralized and it is gratifying that most of the top positions (1st and 2nd level) have been filled
by competent Omanis.
Manpower and Training
6.15       The project set out to achieve two objectives in this area. Firstly, the staff ratio, i.e.
the number of staff per 1,000 DELs would be reduced from a figure of 70 in 1983 to 26 in 1990
an efficiency improvement of 63%. Secondly, Omanization would be increased through intensive
training. The staff ratio achieved of 19 exceeded appraisal estimates by 27%. Omanization, now
at 80% compared to 68% at the beginning of the project, proceeded very satisfactorily. Until
recently, Omanization was concentrated on the lower levels but GTO has now turned its attention
to the middle levels where Omanization is still less than 50%. GTO has placed Omanis in key
middle level management positions and the expatriates have been asked to take the back seats.
There is a need for GTO to prepare a comprehensive manpower plan to map out exacdy how and
when 100% Omanization is going to be realized at the middle level. Training is key to the
success of the whole plan and the need to develop individual tailored training for each of these
managers was emphasized during supervision missions.
Accounts and Audit
6.16       GTO accounts and audit were completed on time as covenanted in the Loan
Agreement that is 4 months to complete draft accounts and 6 months to complete the audit. The
audits were normally completed by end of April of the year following. The main reason for this
excellent performance was good management and the computerization of accounts that was done
as part of this project.
7.         PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
7.01       The project was instrumental to the installation of an institutional system that will
steer GTO through to the future. The Information Management Systems that have been
introduced in GTO through the Computerization Program has put GTO on a level of financial
management operations equal to that in the industrialized world. The establishment of a
Corporate Planning Unit has created a process which is constantly reviewing tariffs in accordance
with the varying costs of providing service. The overall management of GTO has been
modernized and thanks to intensive training, most of the systems established can be managed by
Omanis. Thus, although there are still many expatriates assisting in the management of these
systems, the backbone Omani staff is capable of sustaining their operation. However, more
training needs to be done before the expatriates can be completely replaced.
7.02       On the physical part, modern equipment has been installed and utilization is
satisfactory considering the adverse economic conditions. Revenues to be realized from this
equipment will enable GTO to reinvest in future expansion of the network. GTO is now



- 10-
completely self sufficient financially generating sufficient revenues for its operational and
developmental requirements.
8.         BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01       The overall Bank performance in this project has been good. The Bank identified
basic institutional weaknesses in the GTO in the areas of corporate planning, tariffs, and
computerization. The Bank assisted GTO to prepare the terms of reference for the consultants
and assisted in the review and implementation of their recommendations. As a result, a Corporate
Planning Unit was established and computerization was implemented in a number of activities in
the GTO (paras 6.04 and 6.05).
8.02       The Bank dealt with the processing of bid documents expeditiously. Some minor
delays were experienced at the beginning in the clearance of bidding documents but this was
quickly resolved after a team of GTO engineers visited Washington.
8.03       The Bank supervised the project once a year and a total of 7 missions were made
during the project (Annex 9 . The missions were adequate and very beneficial to both parties.
GTO prepared thoroughly for these missions and basically all issues were cleared during the
supervision missions.
9.         BORROWER PERFORMANCE
9.01             Borrower performance was excellent. The Borrower understood the
objectives of the project very clearly and employed all required resources to make it a success.
Anv shortcornings in meeting set objectives were normally outside the competence of GTO. For
instance, the problem of meeting the rate of return was mainly due to adverse economic
conditions and the accumulation of receivables could only be handled by the Government. The
greatest strength of GTO is management discipline which is exemplary. GTO management was
fully aware of what to expect from the consultants and this paid high dividends.
10.        COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS
10.01      The Borrower complied with covenants except those related to rate of return and
Accounts receivable (Annex 10). Accounts receivable were 100 days (para 6.09) at the end of
1990 compared to a covenanted target of 60 days. The S00 was the main debtor and discussions
are still going on regarding offsetting this debt against dividend payment. The rate of return on
fixed assets was 11% compared to a projected figure of 19 %. This could not be achieved because
of the depressed economy, which led to less utilization of the network, and much higher asset
depreciation figures adopted by GTO. GTO is trying to improve utilization through marketing,
including reduction of tariffs.
11.        PROJECI RELATIONSHIP
11.01      The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was maintained at an excellent
level. The main reason for this good relationship was the mutual understanding of their common



- 11 -
objectives to develop telecommunications in Oman. The Bank and GTO worked as a team during
project preparation and appraisal and all the project components (physical and T.A.) were decided
jointly which made GTO fully committed to them, especially the T.A. The role of the Bank as a
partner in development has been demonstrated by GTO's intention to maintain contacts with the
Bank in this sector even after the Project has been closed. Oman has now graduated from Bank
lending but GTO has indicated that it may finance Bank missions on reimbursable basis in future
to maintain the exchange of ideas that has prevailed in the last decade, when the Bank first got
involved in the sector.
12.        CONSULTING SERVICES
12.01      Consultants played a very important role in this project. The consultants were
retained to undertake three studies: establishment of a Corporate Planning Unit within GTO;
tariffs, and computerization. The consultants successfully carried out those studies and assisted
GTO in the implementation of their recommendations. A Corporate Planning Unit is now
established, tariffs are regularly reviewed by this Unit and many management systems have been
computerized. These achievements would have taken GTO a long time to achieve on its own.
12.02      The physical implementation of the project went on very smoothly mainly because
the contracts were awarded as supply and erection contracts thus reducing the coordination work
on the part of GTO. The contractors generally performed satisfactorily.
13.        PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
13.01      The Staff Appraisal Report and the Legal Agreements provided a good framework
for the Bank and the Borrower during project implementation. The targets set were generally
realistic and variances could be explained. The supervision mission have been well documented
and the data for this PCR was essentially obtained from the Supervision Reports.
14.        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
14.01      There were no major problems encountered in this project. The objectives of the
project were substantially fulfilled as outlined above. Bank's main contributions were two fold:
(a) renrdering assistance in the establishment of appropriate management systems which
substantially enhanced the efficiency of GTO; and (b) through international competitive bidding,
enabling GTO to obtain equipment at very reasonable prices. The unit costs for the equipment
procured under Bank financing were more than 30% below equipment procured through direct
contracting. GTO used the low unit costs as reference to negotiate prices for all other equipment
under the program.
14.02      There are two main lessons to be learnt from this project: (a) with disciplined
management, judicious use of consultants and execution of turnkey projects, project
implementation can be achieved economically and on time; and (b) building of manpower capacity
is a long and arduous process. For it to succeed, it must be well planned and implemented over a
long time. Despite GTO's commendable intensive efforts to train Omanis, it will still need
expatriates for a long time if it is to maintain its efficiency. The GTO has been very realistic as
far this problem is concerned and has replaced expatriates where it was absolutely sure that
Omanis could perform the duties.



- 12 -
14.03      Oman's telecommunications sector is a success story for the Bank. There is a lot
that can be learned from the GTO's performance by other Borrowers of the Bank. Through two
projects the Bank has assisted GTO to reach a level of performance commensurate to that
attainable in the industrialized countries.

1. THIRD FIVE YEAR PLAN
The Third Five Year Plan covered the period 1986-1990 and was initiallly set at RO.125.4
million. This five year development plan was based upon the telecomnvrnication Master
Plan which was finalised in April 1986.
The sharp fall in oil prices in 1986 seriously slowed the economy and led to the delay in
implementation of some telecommunication projects. The result was that at the end of 1990
a number of the planned projects were still in progress.
It was decided that those projects that had not commenced would be deffered to the Fourth
Five Year Plan from 1991-1995 and hence the Third Five Year Plan was reduced to
RO.104.3 million. The Fourth Five Year Plan amounts to RO.93.3 million.

2. ACHIEVEM_ENTS DURING THID FIVE YEAR PLAN
At the commencement of the third five year plan GTO had an exchange capacity of 73,436
and 36,654 fixed telephone subscribers.
By the end of the plan in 1990 capacity had increased by 96% to reach 143,580 with 97,735
working subscribers. As at the end of 1991 capacity was 159,600 of which 113415 were
working, an exchange capacity of 71%.
GTO introduced a mobile telephone system in November 1985 with an exchange capacity of
4500 lines. By the end of 1990 working subscribers had reached 2591 with a further
substantial increase in 1991 to 3542.

During the period of the plan GTO conducted trials with card operated payphones. The
prefered payphones were introduced in 1988 with 178 working by the end of 1990, and 930
by the end of 1991. A further 2000 are due for delivery in 1992.
Revenue from card sales continues to outstripe forcasts and is still increasing. GTOs
experience is that cardphones meet a market demand allowing people who previously did not
have easy access to a telephone to now make calls. Cardphones are relatively easy to
maintain and provide good cashflow with no credit risk for a minimal commision to card
agents. GTO would recomend that other clients of the bank consider installing cardphones as
a priority to new and existing networks.

3. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,
GTO has been profitable since its inception in 1980 with an increasing profit trend upto 1986.
Lower economic activity following the oil price collapse of 1986 led to a reduction of profits
in 1987. However, strict management control of operating costs and manning levels ensured
that GTO still generated a respectable level of profit despite adverse economnic conditions.
Since the decline in 1987 profits have resumed their upward climb reaching nearly RO 20
million in 1991.

(3TO suffered a considerable loss on exchange in 1985,19076 and 1987 due to the devaluation
of the Omani Rial following the oil price fall of 1986 and the general weakening of the US
Dollar to which the Sultanates currency is linked.

During 1987 GTOs outstanding loans to the governmer,t were converted to equity bringing
total shareholders funds to RO 50 million. At the same time GTO agreed to commence
divedend payments which by the end of 1991 have totalled RO 52.7 million.
Hence in the relatively short period of only      CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS
eleven years GTO has built an extremly modem  60K
telecommunications network covering the vast  SOK
majority of the country at what is effectively  40K

The World Bank target of a return on average assets of 19% by 1991 would now seem to be a
little unrealistic. Such a high return was possible when relatively high levels of traffic where
generated by a much smaller network. The considerable increase in fixed assets over the
period obviously make such a target now difficult to achieve. However, if revenue continues
to increase in line with recent trends then a return on assets approaching 19% may be possible
in the near future.

4. pEBTICQLLECTION
In 1987 GTO appointed a collection agent for its private bills. GTO still produces the bills
and therefore retains essential control of the billing system but with the agent responsible for
delivery of bills and subsequent collection. The agent pays GTO the full billing amount less
commission after the month end irrespective of the amount collected and assumes
responsibility for all bad debts.
The arrangement has been highly beneficial to GTO resulting in assured and improved
cashflow. The commission payment is less than the bad debt percentage that GTO
historically suffered when responsible for its own private bill collection.
GTO is still responsible for the collection of bills due from Government subscribers.
However, despite strenuous efforts and an improvement by some Govemnment Ministries and
agencies, the amount due from Government has continued to increase.
Discussions are continuing with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and GTO is hopeful
that the matter can be resolved especially considering the substantial dividend that OTO is
now paying.
S. IER-ADMIN ISTRAIIO
It is GTO's policy to attempt to balance payments to and from other telecommunication
administrations and hence be in a neutral payment position.
To date outpayments have been between on average 10-15% above inpayments despite a vast
increase in international traffic from Oman. GTO has been able to achieve this by continually
negotiating accounting rate reductions with other administrations resulting in substantial cost
savings.

6. ESTABLISHMENT OF CORPORATE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND
EVSION OF TARIFFS
The work and subsequent report by the consultants Coopers and Lybrand laid the foundation
for the tariff structure adopted by GTO. It was crucial to the success of our tariff revisions
that the structure was agreed prior to effecting any changes.
Tariffs send strong messages to our customers and greatly affect the demand level for our
various services. If incorrectly planned tariff revisions can have an adverse impact not only
on profitability and cashflow but also may cause customer dissatisfaction when increased
demand cannot be serviced or lead to unnecessary increases in capital expenditure.
As a consequence of our planned approach GTO has been able to successfully implement
tariff revisions to all services resulting in increased traffic volumes and revenue but without
the need for unplanned expenditure on capital equipment.
There have been reductions in telex call fees, a change in tariff levels and structure of local
and long distance telephone calls including the introduction of local call timing, reductions in
leased circuit and modem rentals and the introduction of off-peak national and international
telephone call rates. This was subsequently followed by significant reductions in
international telephone call tariffs themselves.
GTO is now fortunate to have in place an established Corporate Planning Department and
tariff structure which will allow an ongoing regular review of tariffs.
Besides tariffs, the Corporate Planning Department has been instrumental in GTO's policy of
liberalising terminal equipment. To date this has included telephone instruments, facsimile,
and private switchboards.

7. COMPUIERISATIOl
At the commencement of the Third Five Year Plan in 1985 GTO's financial and
administrative systems were entirely manual with customer billing being processed on our
behalf by the computer department of the Ministry of Finance.
Following the appointment of Consultants P.E. Computer Services in 1985 a long term
strategy for the computerisation of GTO activities was completed.
GTO purchased the computer from the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and assumed
responsibility for bill processing. Monthly billing was introduced and the billing date brought
back to within eight days of the month end resulting in substantial cashflow benefils. Despite
a four-fold increase in numbers of subscribers the billing date has never been missed.
Four other major systems have also been computerised, inter-administration accounting,
network records, traffic analysis, and payroll and personnel. The financial accounting and
budgetary control systems have also been computerised using a departmental computer
network. Corporate Planning Department has also made extensive use of financial modelling
software.
Contracts have recently been signed for the purchase of a Hewlett Packard Mainframe
computer to replace the aging IBM, plus approximately 150 personal computers for
departmental networks. GTO is in the process of identifying a Customer Service System
which will run under the Unix operating system and with Oracle database.
8. PROJECTS FINANCED BY WORLD BANK
(i)   Provision of telecommunication facilities in the Northern Coastal Region - Batinah
Coast.
(ii)  Installation of Btuied Service Wires to complete the portion not executed under the
Rural contract.
The aim of the projects were to install 16,450 exchange lines in the Batinah Coast
(Appendix I) and provide 35 villages in the Rural Areas with Buried Service Wire and
Subscriber Service Leads (Appendix II). The projects were completed as scheduled.
The Batinah Coast project proved extremely successful, that in 1989 the average exchange
loading stood at 69% having 11.329 working subscribers generating RO.360/- per line.
Subsequently GTO has undertaken a project for Phase II of Batinah Coast covering a wider
geographical area and installing fwuther exchange capacity of 16.470 including the expansion
of some Phase I exchanges.
Favouable rates obtained during negotiations meant that the total loan was not required to
meet the cost of these two projects. Therefore, GTO suggested and the Bank agreed that the
surplus funds be used to finance the material portion of outside plant works in a further 4 sites
(Appendix III).

9. RELATIONSHIP WITH WORLD BANK
The projects financed by the World Bank were successfully implemented as planned. The
establishment of the Corporate Planning Unit, tariff revisions, and computerisation have all
proved to be extremely beneficial to the administration of GTO.
GTO would like to thank the World Bank for its most valued advice and assistance during the
period of the project and hopes that the experience it has gained from our success at GTO will
be useful in its relations with other clients of the Bank.

1.13 Planned Project
Thirteen (13) sites with a total capacity of 16,680 lines was
contracted of which six (6) were Main Switching Units and seven (7)
Remote Switching units. One site (Al Hawasina) was deleted during
implementation. 99 Cabinets were planned under External Plant with a
direct feed cabling to serve Hawasina. The total number of
communities to be served was 86.
1.14 Implemented Project
The total installed capacity of Switching lines was 16,448 served by
82 cabinets covering 101 communities. The Outside Plant extended to
cover 3 additional communities namely, Hail Al Ghaf, Misfah, Abayah
and more important cabinet areas resulting in some 30 cabinets
being deferred. However, thirteen (13) of these cabinets were
installed. Subscriber connection was much greater than anticipated
and therefore additional subscriber connections have been included in
Phase II of the Batinah Coast Project.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2513-OM)
RETUaN ON INVESTMENT
1.          investments on which the rate of return in calculated are those new works
contained in the second telecommunications project 1985-90.
2.          The benefit period extended from 1986 to 2005, when on average tho
equipment provided under the project is expected to have substantially
completed its useful life.
3.          Capital expenditure is as actually made over the period 1985-90 project.
No residual asset values are taken into account as by the year 2005 their discounted
real value will be negligible. Incremental revenues are based on the expected
additional telephone subscribers and the traffic increase they are expected to bring
about. No provision has been made for incremental telex revenues as no new correspond-
ing investment is envisaged. Incremental operating costs excluding depreciation
and in'erest are actual for the period 1985-90 and estimated for the period 1991-2005.
All revenues and operating costs have been deflated by S Per annum, the expected rate
of inflation to bring them to the 1986 level to be comparable with capital expenditure.
4.          A summary of pro3ect cost and benefit streams at 1985 prices is given (in
Ro million) below as follows:
CAPITAL         OPERATING                     NET
YEAR          EXPENDITURE         COST        REVENUES      BENEFITS

1986           4,15S.0                                       (4,155.0)
1987          17,396.0             -              -         (17,396.0)
1988           8,762.0         1,162.0        5,569.0        (4,356.0)
1989          14,0850         1,826.0       10,105.0        (5,806.0)
1990         1l,559.0          2,364.0       14,398.0        (4,526 0)
1991                           4,635.0       18,818.0       (14,182.0)
1992                           5,487.0       23,197.0       (17,710 0)
1993                           6,490.0      27,438.0        (20,948.0)
1994-2005          -           7,573.0      32,016.0            (24. 0)
S.          The internal financial rate of return for the above net benefit stream
is 29%. Considering consumer surplus, the economic rate of return with constant
real tariffs is expected to be higher than 35%. No shadow pricing is necessary
because of the openness of the Oman e-onomy, and the fact that market prices reflect
opportunity costs for most goods and services.
6.          A sensitivity analysis was performed on the financial rate of return to
reflect the possible changes in revenue and costs forecasted for the period beyond
1990. The following results were obtained:
Rate of Return
______________
a)  10% increase in operating costs               27
b)  10% decreaso in revenues                      26
c)  Combination of all factors                    24
