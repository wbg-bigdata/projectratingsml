MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEtIT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO COMPANHIA DE GAS DE SAO PAULO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SAO PAULO NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo (COMGAS), with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of Brazil for US$94 million equivalent, is submitted
for approval.  The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years, including 5
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and help finance
the expansion of Sao Paulo's gas distribution network and its conversion
from manufactured to natural gas.
2.       Background.  A substantial volume of gas associated with crude oil
is produced in Brazil (some 16 million m3lday). Although the country
imports crude oil and oil products, a large portion of the gas produced is
flared or reinjected and only 8.1 million m3/day is actually consumed (less
than 2? of final energy consumption). Present consumption is confined to
the northeastern region of Brazil (60X) and Rio de Janeiro (40Z) and is
used primarily to replace fuel oil (572). Other uses are in petrochemicals
(72), fertilizers (26Z) and in the production of town gas (10Z). There is
no consumption of natural gas in Sao Paulo, where only manufactured gas is
distributed, derived from naphtha (with a high economic cost) and from
refinery gas. The National Energy Commission (CNE) estimates that Brazil
could absorb more than four times its present consumption of natural gas
within the next decade, given sufficient development of natural gas
reserves and infrastructure.
3.       Ministerial Resolution No. 1061 of August 1986 grants to PETROBRAS
(the national petroleum company) the responsibility for natural gas
exploration, production, transport and import activities. State
governments hold the right to distribute natural gas as an energy source or
to grant concessions to local gas distribution companies. PETROBRAS has
been slow to encourage the use of natural gas as a substitute for fuel oil
in the profitable industrial market, because this would increase the fuel
oil surplus in its refineries. At the same time, inadequate incentives
have been provided for the use of natural gas in residential markets, in
terms of margins for distributors. With regard to natural gas pricing,
while the Federal Government determines wholesale prices, the
responsibility for the setting of retail prices recently passed --under the
new Brazilian Constitution-- from the Federal Government to the States.
The Federal Government has adopted a wholesale natural gas pricing policy
based on economic costs, subject to macroeconomic and financial
considerations, which is fully consistent with sound pricing policy. The
structure of retail gas prices must be revised, however, to reflect the
economic opportunity cost of gas. This will ensure that efficient
utilization of gas takes place on the basis of the economic value of gas
compared with other energy sources, with due adjustments for consumer-
related cost differentials.
4.       The State of Sao Paulo accounts for about 40X of Brazil's GDP and
export revenues. Much of this economic activity is concentrated in the
Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo. A reliable supply of efficiently priced



-2-
fuel is critical to sustaining this level of economic activity. COMGAS,
the State's gas company, presently distributes 0.6 million m3/day (natural
gas equivalent - NGE) of town gas to about 450 industrial, 5,000 commercial
and 200,000 residential customers. Annual sales are about US$50 million.
COMGAS has decided to restructure its shareholding, both as a means of
diversifying ownership and increasing equity capital investment. Under
consideration are a variety of different share offerings to potential
private and public buyers. A recent organizational restructuring has
strengthened the company's management efficiency, in particular by reducing
the layers of management and providing a greater emphasis on long-range
planning. Operating measures, such as the number of leaks/km-year and the
ratio of unaccounted-for gas are normal. However, COMGAS will have to take
measures to equip itself to deal with greatly expanded gas operations under
the project, notably through recruitment, training and retraining.
5.       The financial performance of COMGAS in the 1970s and early 1980s
was poor, as tariffs were allowed by government to increase more slowly
than inflation: financial losses had to be offset by capital injections
from the State. Pinancial performance has improved in the last three years
as sales grew steadily and as COMGAS was allowed to implement periodic
tariff increases in line with inflation; these have eliminated the need for
further State contributions to offset losses.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Brazil has
been to support Government policies and investments that will encourage
macroeconomic growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic
stability. The policies have emphasized efficient resource allocation,
increased efficiency in the public sector and the appropriate targetting
and delivery of support to the poor. The energy sector is a key element in
the Bank's strategy: although its capital intensity and high foreign
exchange requirements have had a significant impact on public investment,
the balance of payments and external debt, a secure supply of energy at the
lowest cost is indispensable to economic growth and the improvement of
social welfare. Hence, Bank lending in the energy sector seeks to foster
reforms -- in pricing and investment policies and in the institutiunal
framework -- which will lead to a more efficient development and use of
energy resources.
7.       While the Bank has been active in Brazil's energy sector, most
lending has been for electric power, where Bank loans have amounted to
about US$3.6 billion since 1949. All these loans have been investment-
based except for one sector adjustment operation, the Power Sector I
Project (Loan 2720-BR), which seeks to promote rational demand management
policies; strengthen sector finances; improve sector coordination and
planning; and increase the sector's capacity to deal effectively with
environmental and resettlement questions. In parallel, an Integrated
Energy Strategy Study (IESS) is being carried out by the Government under
terms of reference agreed with the Bank. The IESS gives particular
attention to the links between the energy sector and the macroeconomy and
provides a central focus for the Bank's continuing dialogue with the
Brazilian authorities on the full range of energy issues and policy,
including those related to natural gas.
8.       Through the proposed project, which would be the Bank's first
lending operation related to natural gas, the Bank would be contributing
significantly to the future development of the subsector, while at the same
time broadening its experience and involvement in the issues and ongoing



-3
dialogue related to energy sector policy, planning, and implementation.
The project would (a) assist in developing an expanded market for natural
gas which would reduce consumption of more costly petroleum products; (b)
contribute to ongoing efforts at the Federal and State levels to establish
an economically efficient gas pricing policy and more clearly define
institutional responsibilities for the subsector; (c) pave the way for
increased private investment or lending and provide a model for other
companies in the subsector; and (d) help establish the basis for
fundamental analysis and implementation of improvements in natural gas
development and utilization in Sao Paulo, and eventually, throughout
Brazil.
9.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project aims at:  (a) substantially
increasing the supply of natural gas to industrial, commercial and
residential consumers by 1995; (b) strengthening the management and
organization of COMGAS, its project implementation capacity, and the
efficiency and safety of its gas distribution; (c) assuring COMGAS'
financial viability and cash generation capacity for further expansion; (d)
helping COMGAS to mobilize capital, including private capital, to reduce
demand for public funds; (e) enhancing the technical and financial
regulatory framework of Brazil's gas industry; (f) reducing environmental
pollution in Sao Paulo, one of the world's most polluted areas, through the
substitution of clean-burning natural gas for other fuels; and (g),
developing a gas utilization strategy, for the State of Sao Paulo,
including economically efficient gas pricing policies.
10.      Project Description.  The proposed project would comprise: (a)
supplies, civil works, engineering and works supervision for revamping,
conversion and expansion of COMGAS' existing network to increase supply
from 0.6 million m3/day NGE in 1987 to 3.4 million m3/day NGE by 1995, of
which 3 million m3/day would be produced in association with oil in
PETROBRAS' Campos field offshore from Rio de Janeiro and are partly flared
at present, and 0.4 million m3 per day would be refinery gas; (b) supplies
and works for conversion of consumer installations from other fuels to
natural gas, permitting roughly 902 of the gas to be distributed to
industrial and commercial consumers, and 102 to households; (c)
telemetry/SCADA equipment for remote control of COMGAS' network, as well as
laboratory and safety/emergency equipment; (d) technical assistance for
conversion of the network and of customer installations; (e) training of
COHGAS' managerial and operational staff in natural gas related planning,
technical, marketing, and financial aspects; and assistance to establish a
Gas Technology Institute for gas-related research and training; (f)
feasibility and engineering studies for further expansion of natural gas
distribution; (g) a study to improve COMGAS' management, organization and
information systems; (h) a study on capital mobilization for COMGAS; and
(i) a gas utilization and tariff study for the State of Sao Paulo. Of
total project cost, component (a) amounts to 69Z, (b) to 22?, (c) to 5Z;
and the technical assistance, training and studies under (d) to (i)
represent 42.
11.      The Bank-financed project components would be carried out over six
years by COMGAS, with technical assistance from experienced, major natural
gas distributors. Conversion of large industrial installations would be
implemented and financed by the customers themselves under COMGAS'
supervision, and the gas utilization and tariff study would be carried out
under the direct supervision of the Sao Paulo State Secretariat of Public
Works. Some urgent works, financed by COMGAS and BNDES, were started in



-4-
1987. Approval of US$9.4 million (1OX of the Bank loan) for retroactive
financing of project components which have been implemented from December
1, 1987 (i.e. project appraisal), is recommended. Total financing
requirements of the project are estimated at US$285 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 102.5 million. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Two maps and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 7127-BR dated
April 6, 1989 are also attached.
12.      Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreements were reached:
- with the Sao Paulo State Government: (a) to base retail pricing
of natural gas on agreed economic principles (see para. 3); (b) to make an
equity contribution of US$30 million equivalent to COMGAS for project
related expenditures, to be entirely disbursed by December 31, 1990; (c) to
supervise and coordinate the carrying out of a gas utilization and tariff
study within 18 months from the Effective Date of the loan, review the
study's recommendations with the Bank, and present them to CNP and other
relevant authorities; (d) within one year from the date of the Shareholder
Agreement, to make the necessary administrative arrangements to enact,
throughout the State, technical and safety regulation for gas operations,
which are currently being applied by COMGAS, and to update them on the
basis of ABNT's recommendations and exchange views with the Bank from time
to time on technical and safety norms; (e) to define, by December 31, 1989,
a periodic adjustment mechanism for COMGAS' natural gas distribution
margins; and (f) to enact financial regulation of the gas sector, including
a margin adjustment mechanism, by December 31, 1990 on the basis of
experience tested during 1990.
- with COMGASt (a) to hire a team of advisers from a major gas
distributor for assistance to project implementation not later than three
months after the Effective Date of the loan agreement; (b) to retrain or
hire additional engineering staff commensurate with the expanding
operation; (c) to revalue fixed assets every four years on the basis of a
revaluation study, in addition to the annual revaluations based on official
indexes and required by law; (d) to achieve gradually increasing annual
rates of return on the average current net value of fixed assets in
operation, starting at 8% in 1990 and increasing to 12% by 1993 and
thereafter; (e) to maintain annually increasing current ratios starting in
1990, a debt:equity ratio not higher than 60:40, and a debt-service
coverage of at least 1.5, starting with loan signing; (f) to carry out
appropriate feasibility studies, including economic evaluation, based on
criteria satisfactory to the Bank for investments exceeding US$5 million
equivalent; (g) to carry out an organization and management study by 13
months after Loan Effectiveness, and provide the Bank with the study's
findings and recommendations for comments prior to implementation; (h) to
prepare margin studies on natural gas distribution at least every six
months, for submission as appropriate to Government authorities and the
Bank to establish that the margins are sufficient to meet the financial
targets; (i) not to incur expenditures for the Gas Technology Institute
until a detailed plan for its establishment and operations has been
discussed and agreed with the Bank; and (j) to forward to the Bank, by
October 31 of each year, forecasts on achieving the rate of return and the
current ratio for the subsequent year and, in case a shortfall is
forecasted, to take all the necessary actions to remedy the situation.



13.      Ratification of the Shareholder Agreement would be a specific
condition for effectiveness of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
14.      Project Benefits.  Quantifiable economic benefits of the proposed
project would yield a rate of return on the order of 332, based on the
economic value of fuels displaced by natural gas, and taking into account a
depletion premium for the gas. The Project would lower the cost of energy
by reducing the domestic consumption of more costly fuel oil, LPG, and
naphtha.  It would increase fuel oil exports and reduce LPG and naphtha
imports, thereby improving Brazil's balance of payments by annual amounts
reaching about US$200 million by 1995. It will also result in lower
electricity consumption, particularly during peak periods, postpone some
hydroelectric power plant investment, and help the country's fiscal and
debt management problem. Substitution of clean-burning gas for large
volumes of high-sulphur heavy fuel oil would significantly reduce both Sao
Paulo's severe pollution problems and the need for investing in pollution
control equipment.
15       Project Risks.  Risks include: (a) lower-than-expected supply of
gas, should PETROBRAS be unable to meet Its contractual obligations; and
(b) high inflation distorting gas and other energy prices and eroding
COMGAS's earnings situation. The former risk is minimal as existing
reserves are adequate to satisfy the anticipated project demand, and the
latter will be mitigated by agreement on a periodic adjustment mechanism
for COMGAS' margins designed to enable the company to achieve agreed
financial targets.
16.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the propused loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
