1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)


The 2001 CAS for Egypt recognized that the expansion of access at lower levels combined with a higher
growth rate in the 18-24 years age cohort, has placed severe pressure on the higher education system,
resulting in a decline in the per student expenditure by 40 percent in real terms in five years (1993-98)
and, subsequently, in a drop in quality. The CAS also mentioned the need for reforms to facilitate greater
involvement of the private sector, more use of information technology and greater cost-efficiency. It
identifies the development of higher education and skills development, as being critical to ensuring
adequate and balanced social development in Egypt.

The Government of Egypt (GOE) prepared a Higher Education Reform Strategy (HERS) discussed
during a National Conference on Higher Education held in February 2000. The conference declaration,
which identified 25 reform initiatives, was endorsed by the President and the Prime Minister. The key
issues addressed by the HERS were:

Centralized governance and system inefficiencies. The overly centralized higher education system was
governed by an outdated legislative framework and suffering from excessive control. Budget allocations
were not informed by sector policy or need-based criteria. Employment policies, following general public
sector rules and practices, were producing overstaffing and low productivity.

Low quality of university education. Despite shortage of data to assess the quality of university
education, there was a general acknowledgement that university graduates skills were below what is
needed to improve Egypt's economic competitiveness, and that employers prefer foreign skilled graduates.
University education was heavily lecture/textbook reliant with memorization-based assessment systems,
no emphasis on creative thinking, problem solving and collaborative work, and insufficient use of IT.

Poor relevance of mid-level technical education. The training offered by the Middle Technical
Institutes (MTI) network was of poor quality and had little relevance to the needs of the industry. Only
50% of the MTI students complete their degree, and about 60% of graduates remain unemployed two
years after graduation. The system suffered from outdated curricula, inadequately qualified instructors
and poorly equipped laboratories.

The GOE's reform agenda to address these key issues was shaped into 25 specific initiatives to be
implemented over a fifteen-year period. The Government sought donor financing to fill the funding gap.
The Bank committed to support the reform through: (i) a US$13 million IDA credit to support quality
improvement in the faculties of Education; and (ii) a US$50 million IBRD loan complemented by a
US$10 million funding from the GOE to finance 11 out of the 25 initiatives under the HERS. The
initiatives to be supported by the IBRD under the Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) were
selected based on the priority given to improve: (i) system governance and efficiency; and (ii) quality and
relevance of higher education.



                                                                                                        xii
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective, as described in the PAD, was to create the conditions fundamental
to improving the quality and efficiency of the higher education system in Egypt through legislative
reform, institutional restructuring, and establishment of independent quality assurance mechanisms
and monitoring systems. The wording used in the Loan Agreement (LA) was similar but not exactly the
same as the word "fundamental" was replaced by "conducive". The key indicators retained to monitor and
assess project outcomes were as follows:

* Key legislative reforms enacted for the universities to become effective self-governing institutions;
* Legislative reform enacted to establish independent quality assurance mechanisms;
* Legislative framework in place for the Technical Colleges to become self-governing institutions with
linkages to the private sector;
* Consolidation of 47 Middle Technical Institutes into 8 Technical Colleges accomplished;
* Management Information System developed and operational for the post-secondary sector.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

The project expected outcome was to facilitate quality and efficiency improvements in higher education.
The primary target group expected to benefit from project outcomes were higher education students who
would receive a better quality education and be better prepared for a rapidly changing economy.
Improvements in the quality and relevance of higher education, and expanded access to IT and related
skills and knowledge, were expected to ensure that graduates gain higher-levels skills, better matched to
market needs. Other beneficiaries mentioned in the PAD were: (i) public and private sector employers
who would recruit better-trained workers from the local market, and invest less in initial on-the-job
training; and (ii) faculty and instructors in higher education institutions who would have access to
additional resources and professional development opportunities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Improve efficiency through the reform of governance and management

This Component was to support five groups of activities aimed at improving system governance,
management and efficiency:

(i) Reform legislation governing higher education: TA to support legislative reform to allow
universities more autonomy and the development of legislative framework for the new Technical
Colleges (TCs) which will replace the MTIs.

(ii) Rationalize funding allocation mechanisms: TA and training to support the move to a more
rationale resource allocation mechanism favoring a transparent, equitable, and formula-driven approach.
Planned activities include: (a) a social assessment of parent and student perceptions of cost recovery in

                                                                                                          2
higher education; (b) international and local technical assistance to help design and implement a new
system for allocating sector resources; (c) stakeholder consultation and consensus building during
development of the funding formula; and (d) related staff training and equipment.

(iii) Establish a National Quality Assurance Council (NQAC): TA to guide the establishment of an
autonomous NQAC. The NQAC was expected to establish performance standards and a benchmarking
system for both universities and TCs, and ultimately, to work towards development of an accreditation
system for higher education institutions.

(iv) Build capacity, Develop MIS system, and train management: TA, training and equipment for the
establishment of a Management Information System (MIS) and building institutional capacity to support
changes in the legislative framework and in funding allocation mechanisms. The project was specifically
expected to: (a) support the design and implementation of the MIS in universities; and (b) develop
capacity of governing board members and institutional managers in basic planning, management and
budgeting.

(v) Establish a Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF): The HEEPF was expected to
fund competitive proposals submitted by institutions (universities and TCs) through 3 windows: (a) an
academic window to support teaching and learning improvements in academic departments through
program and course innovations; (b) an entrepreneurial window to support collaboration between
universities, TCs and the private sector; and (c) a management window which will support projects
intended to enhance management and administration in the higher education sector.

Component 2: Improve the quality and relevance of university education

This component, supporting efforts to improve the quality and relevance of university education through
facilitating the use of new learning technologies and human resource development, included two activities.

(i) Establishing an integrated computer and network infrastructure: Hardware, software,
connectivity and training to support the establishment of a high-speed university infrastructure. The
activity was also expected to finance TA to support the establishment of two pilot Instructional
Technology and Distributed Learning (ITDL) centers in Cairo University and Suez Canal University.

(ii) Training for faculty and staff: In-service training for about 5,000 university faculty and instructors
to develop their competencies in the use and application of computer technology, particularly in terms of
integrating IT into their teaching methodologies. Training will consist of instruction in computer software
operation, Internet operation, distributed learning methods, instructional design processes, course
administration, and learning assessment and evaluation.

(iii) Installation and operationalization of an inter-university library system: This sub-component
was in the Loan Agreement, but not in the PAD. There was no mention in the agreed minutes of
negotiation of this change.

Component 3: Improve quality and relevance of mid-level technical education

The objective of this component was to support the restructuring of mid-level technical education for
improved quality and relevance. Activities financed through this component include:

(i) Consolidation of the MTIs into TCs: Civil work, equipment, TA and training to support the
consolidation of the 47 MTIs into 8 TCs. The project was expected to finance refurbishment of old
facilities to acceptable international standards; generic equipment for basic laboratories and workshops;

                                                                                                         3
computers and associated equipment; networked library; and management and IT training for TC
governors, administrators and instructors.

(ii) Curriculum design and instructor training: TA and training to support the development of a new,
more relevant curriculum, to be prepared in consultation with employers. This component was also
expected to finance the establishment of new units in the TCs to provide customized in-service employee
training programs for industry on a cost-recovery basis.

(iii) Strengthened academic administration and management: Training to TC key administrators on
competency-based student evaluation and records system and on the utilization of IT and MIS systems.

1.6 Revised Components

Although the original components were not formally revised, since the project was not restructured,
project components and activities were significantly changed from what was originally stated in the PAD.
(see 2.2)

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

The closing date of the project was extended by one year to December 31, 2008, to complete project
ongoing activities. Loan resources were reallocated in December 2005 to adjust to actual component costs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

        Consultation - A long process of consultations preceded project preparation. The Bank
        contributed to this process by providing technical assistance and sharing international experience.

                                                                                                         4
   In addition, The Minister of Higher Education established a Higher Education Enhancement
   Commission in 1997 which involved a wide range of stakeholders in the preparation of the
   reform adopted by the 2000 National Conference on Higher Education Reform.
   Use of lessons learned - Project preparation benefited from the experience and some of the
   lessons learned from similar projects in Tunisia, Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina. This was
   reflected in: (i) the decentralized approach to build up higher education institutions' ownership
   and support to the reform; (ii) the involvement of industry representatives in the TCs through the
   Board of Trustees (BOT); (iii) the stress on strengthening of general skills in the TCs curricula
   reform; and (iv) the HEEPF design which was built on the successful model used in the
   Engineering and Technical Education Project (ETEP, Ln.3137-EGT).
   Use of a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) - Project team also requested a pre-PCD review to
   be conducted by QAG, and has followed some of the QAG recommendations by putting more
   emphasis on institutional and system reforms as the first Concept Note was mainly focused on
   quality aspects.
   Soundness of background analysis - Sector analysis is presented in the PAD in very broad terms,
   with little evidence and no specifics regarding the main issues of centralized
   governance/inefficiencies, low quality of university education and poor quality and relevance of
   mid-level technical education. Although, there is a consensus on these issues, the lack of specifics
   made it difficult to identify the bottlenecks and to target project measures and activities. Issues
   critical to the institutional reforms supported by the project, such as student admission policy,
   higher education financing and the role of private sector, were not mentioned in the PAD. As a
   result, project design suffered from a lack of clarity and consistency.
   Project Development Objectives - The Project Development Objective was not clearly stated in
   the PAD and Loan Agreement. Although the project obviously aimed at addressing quality and
   efficiency issues, the stated objective of creating conditions fundamental to improving the quality
   and efficiency was insufficiently clear as these conditions were not defined. The wording used in
   the LA was probably more realistic and will be used in this ICR to evaluate project performance.
   Project Results Framework- The results framework lacked clarity and consistency: (i) There was
   no reference to sector funding and resource allocation system in the set of outcome indicators (see
   1.2. above) despite the fact that there were planned project activities related to this aspect; (ii)
   There were project outputs such as the competitive grant mechanism to be established through
   HEEPF that were not reflected in project outcomes; (iii) there were subcomponents such as
   subcomponent 1.2 (Rationalizing funding allocation mechanisms) for which there were no related
   output measurements.
   Design of the project components - At the component level, two major institutional reforms
   expected to be supported by the project (institutional autonomy and funding mechanisms) were
   supposed to be supported through TA but no specific approach to such critical and sensitive
   issues was spelled out in the project. Neither were these expected reforms clearly articulated in
   other project components. Questions such as how would the support to TCs translate into
   resource allocation, or how the competitive funding mechanism introduced through HEEPF will
   be sustained through the new funding scheme were not addressed.
   Readiness for implementation - The implementation arrangements were not well developed in the
   PAD. The main assumption made was that the PMU experience with ETEP and its knowledge of
   Bank procedures would ensure smooth implementation of the project. The scope and complexity
   of HEEP would have required more detailed arrangements within the sector and the strengthening
   of the PMU. The delay in implementation experienced during the early years of the project was to
   a large extent due to the time taken by the MOHE and the PMU to fill the gaps in project
   activities planning. It actually took several months for the MOHE to appoint five directors who
   had to plan for and then manage sub-component activities.



                                                                                                     5
        Consideration of alternative designs - A number of alternatives were considered during project
        design. One was considering limiting project intervention to universities, and was rightly rejected.
        Another alternative considering limiting project intervention to fewer reform initiatives would
        have deserved a more in-depth exploration. In particular, the option of putting a stronger focus on
        middle level technical education was worth considering given the potential this sub-sector has to
        improve young Egyptians employability and to compete with traditional, more costly university
        programs. Additional resources would have been used to upgrade workshops and labs in more
        TCs (only 3 pilots out of 8 were covered by the project) and to deliver additional- and much
        needed training to TCs instructors.
        Assessment of risks - Although most critical risks were identified, the rating was not fully
        accurate. In particular, the opposition to legislative reforms for more autonomy and criteria-based
        resource allocation was underestimated (M) as experienced during implementation. On the other
        hand, the risk of institutions not buying into the quality assurance system was highlighted while
        the real risk was that the resources for them to upgrade to the required standards would not be
        available.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

The project has experienced substantial delays in its early implementation phases. Part of the delay was
due to the lack of clarity and complexity in project design, and to insufficient implementation
arrangements. The delay was also due to the time taken by the Government to appoint component
directors and to release its contribution. Some components (ICTP, FLDP, ETCP) suffered additional
delays because of change of director. By the mid-term review more than half of loan funds were
committed, and about one-third were disbursed. While recognizing that considerable progress was made
in various sub-components of the project, the mid-term review mission acknowledged the delays and
challenges facing the reform of the higher education legal framework.


The MOHE actually re-organized the project, from the start, into five sub-projects, each of them managed
by a project director within the PMU:

    Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project (QAAP )
    Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF)
    Information & Communication Technology Project (ICTP)
    Faculty-Leadership Development Project (FLDP)
    Egyptian Technical Colleges Project (ETCP)

This re-organization, which was not properly documented in project AMs and ISRs, did de-facto
overshadow the two sub-components related to governance reform and to funding allocation mechanism.
It also introduced substantial changes to two other sub-components:
     (i)      Quality Assurance: QAAP went beyond the establishment of the NQAC and the development
              of an accreditation system. The sub-project actually supported a process by which faculties
              and schools were engaged in an internal evaluation exercise, visits by peer reviewers and
              preparation of strategic plans.
     (ii)     Faculty Development: The scope of the sub-project went beyond its original target of training
              faculty and staff on IT and instructional technologies to cover a broader of skills related to
              professional development.



                                                                                                          6
Activities within sub-components have also been re-organized. The ICTP sub-project inherited from the
MIS and the IT training for both faculty and staff. Although these substantial changes were justified and
demonstrated the capacity of the PMU to make the changes necessary to improve project performance
and achieve results, they were not clearly documented and explained by the project team. Moreover, a
restructuring of the project could have been considered in order to correct the deficiencies in project
design by refining the PDO, adjusting project components and improving performance indicators.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: The PMU was expected to develop and maintain a project information system, produce
quarterly FMRs and annual progress reports, and contract independent technical auditors to undertake
technical review of each component. The set of performance indicators to measure progress against
project objectives included five outcome indicators and 12 output indicators (see Annex 2). Indicators
used to measure outcomes were actually related to either outputs (consolidation of MITs, implementation
of MIS) or processes (legislative reforms). Output indicators identified in the PAD were often vague and
lacking baseline and/or target values. One example is "All faculty & student have access to IT & new
teaching methodologies" where "access" is not defined and no baseline value is provided. Better
indicators could have been: "ratio students/computer"; "number or percentage of students taking IT
classes" or "number of e-courses offered".

M&E implementation: Although the PMU has made substantial effort to document HEEP activities and
achievements through quarterly progress reports, several publications and its website, the lack of robust
monitoring mechanisms has been one weakness of the project. From 2005 to 2007, the project team had
repeatedly stressed the need for an adequate M&E system to track and report progress made towards the
developmental objectives and the problems facing implementation, and recommended the appointment of
an M&E specialist. The M&E rating was downgraded to MS in April 2005 and to MU in July 2006,
before being upgraded to MS upon the appointment of an M&E specialist within the PMU. The
independent technical audits did not take place. However, the PMU initiated an impact assessment study,
and the first results were shared with the Bank.

M&E utilization: Despite the lack of a well documented M&E system at the project level, sub-projects
such as HEEPF and FLDP had built-in monitoring systems that allowed them to take some corrective
actions such as adjusting geographical and sectoral coverage or training content. The impact evaluation
study was used as an input to the ICR and is expected to inform the next phase of HEEP.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Procurement: The PMU has managed an important number of procurement tasks, handling the
procurement of goods and selection of consultants, and providing support to Implementation Teams at the
university level. The PMU comprised a Procurement Supervisor and assistant staff trained in Bank
financed procurement. The project was subject to an Independent Procurement Review (IPR) in 2006 and
in 2008. Both reviews questioned the practice of selection and employment of faculty members as
individual consultants under the Disbursement Category "Consultants Services and Training" without
following the procedures specified in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement for a total amount of about
US$ 12.3 million. Two points were made by the IPRs: (i) the Single Source Selection (SSS) method used
would have required a prior waiver from the Bank; and (ii) the hiring of university professors who are
MOHE employees on a systematic basis (HEEPF, QAAP, FLDP) should have been agreed during the
project preparation and disclosed in the project documents. The PMU response, supported by the project
team, was that the nature of the project, especially HEEPF and QAAP, requires contracting a large
number of university staff involved in sub-projects implementation, and that the selection of teams is

                                                                                                       7
done by peers through procedures approved by the SCU. The practice of paying university professors to
manage or participate to QAAP or HEEPF projects in their own universities can be questioned as this is
supposed to be part of their regular duties, and should have been discussed during project preparation.

The PMU awarded a US$450,000 contract for IBCT (FLDP) using CQS rather than QCBS, and without
prior Bank no objection. The no objection was granted retroactively by the TTL after consultation with
the Procurement Department, driven by concerns about potential downside impact on project
implementation and long term sustainability.

Financial management: The HEEP project was effective before the implementation of the Country
Financing Parameters (CFP). The Bank's disbursement rules did not permit the financing of certain types
of expenditures such as taxes and duties later allowed under the CFP. The project was confronted with
ineligible expenditures related to the payment of taxes under the HEEPF as university teams were not
aware of project requirements. The PMU collaborated with the project team to resolve the issue by
reconciling the amount estimated at US$ 371,000 with other project proceeds funded through the GOE
budget. Also, the Financial Management manual and the project accounting and reporting system were
not ready at the initial stage of the project which caused the FM aspects to lag behind until late in the
project life (rated U by the end of the project).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The MOHE is determined to continue the path of sector reform through sustaining the initiatives
supported by the HEEP and pursuing its efforts to reform the legislation governing the higher education
system. The MOHE has actually initiated a number of projects labeled as HEEP2 projects aimed at
sustaining HEEP outcomes and supporting new initiatives. Funding is expected to come mainly from the
Education Development Fund (EDF) established by the Prime Minister and from reallocation of funds
within the sector through either the Supreme Council of Universities (SCU) or universities budget.

The support provided by QAAP to universities to prepare their faculties and schools for accreditation is
expected to be continued through the Continuous Improvement and Qualifying for Accreditation project
(CIQAP) which is expected to receive LE 1 billion from the EDF.

The MOHE also considers that HEEPF has disseminated the culture of competitive funding and
contributed to spreading essential skills needed for proposal writing, project implementation, and
monitoring and evaluation; and that the academic community is now better prepared to compete for
available funding offered by TEMPUS, the EDF, or competitive funds established by some universities
(such as Alexandria University). According to the MOHE, the HEEPF competitive mechanism could be
considered, in the next phase of the reform, as a complementary funding system for higher education
institutions.

Funding for sustaining ICTP outcomes, especially the completion of the MIS, should come partly from
the SCU, and partly from the universities themselves which have already funded about 14% of the project
cost. The ICTP has established an interesting progressive cost-sharing mechanism by which university
contribution to the running cost of this component's activities increased annually to achieve self-
sustainability by 2009.




                                                                                                       8
The continuation of training activities initiated by FLDP is expected to be funded by universities and
through cost recovery. However, future funding for the National Center for Faculty and Leadership
Development (NCFLD) established through the project is still unclear.

The reform of Technical Education would continue to be a priority area for higher education reform as LE
1 billion funding is expected from the EDF to support the restructuring of the sub-sector. The MOHE
objectives for the next phase are to: (i) continue the reform of the TC's governance framework, (ii)
motivate the top management and administrators in the TC to upgrade their technical and administrative
capabilities, (iii) continue to upgrade the learning resources in the TC's, (iv) generate private revenues
from business community, and (v) conclude twinning arrangements with counterpart community colleges.

The MOHE has prepared a strategic plan for 2007-2012 and has identified four pillars for the next phase
of the reform: (i) improving governance at the university and sector levels; (ii) updating the legislation in
order to cover all the subsectors and introduce more institutional autonomy and flexibility; (iii)
developing strategic planning tools and mechanisms at the sector level; and (iv) continuing support to the
accreditation and quality assurance process, and to TC. The MOHE has also engaged in a sector review
exercise conducted by the Bank in collaboration with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). The review will help establish a baseline for assessing progress in the
implementation of the MOHE Strategic Plan and will be used as an opportunity to assist the MOHE
Strategic Planning Unit in developing the technical and professional expertise to conduct similar reviews
in the future.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The overall relevance of Project objectives is high, both at the time of preparation and at completion. The
improvement of quality and efficiency of the delivery of educational services at all levels remains a major
challenge in Egypt. The pressure on the higher education system will continue in the coming years, as the
MOHE is expecting the number of students enrolled in higher education institutions to increase by about
800,000, or 30% in the next ten years. This would require both additional funding and a better use of
available resources. The need for improving the higher education system to ensure competitiveness of the
Egyptian labor force, mentioned in the CAS 2001, is still valid as the economy is becoming more global
and more knowledge-based. One of the three pillars of the CAS 2006 is to enhance the provision of public
services, including the improvement of quality and relevance of education at all levels.

The project was designed to create conditions conducive to quality and efficiency improvement in higher
education. The long consultation process established with the GOE before project preparation was critical
to ensure the commitment and support of main stakeholders at the Government and the MOHE levels, and
to prepare universities and the academic community to the change ahead. Project components and
activities, although relatively ambitious and complex, succeeded in addressing major issues related to the
quality of higher education such as the establishment of quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms,
the development of universities' IT infrastructure and library networks and the modernization and
upgrading of mid-level technical education. On the other hand, project initiatives and activities aiming at
improving system efficiency lacked the global vision and coordination to ensure achievement of expected
outcomes. Greater institutional autonomy and a criteria/incentive based resource allocation mechanism
are key to improving system efficiency. Without reforming the current system, the initiatives supported
by the project may have little impact on the efficiency of higher education.


                                                                                                           9
Project implementation was mainly the responsibility of the PMU. The assumption was made that the
experience acquired through the Engineering and Technical Education Project (ETEP, ln. 3137-EGT)
would have prepared the PMU to smoothly implement HEEP. However the size, scope and complexity of
HEEP led to the need to strengthen the PMU, notably through the appointment of five sub-project
directors.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

Given (i) the discrepancies between project original design and actual activities components, and (ii) the
shortcomings in project performance indicators, this ICR evaluates project outcomes with reference to the
PDO stated in the LA and using the information available from supervision reports, PMU reports, the
Impact Assessment Study and the ICR mission. The critical question is: to what extent did the HEEP
create conditions conducive to quality and efficiency improvement?

        The project contributed to create an environment conducive to improving the quality (and
        relevance) of higher education in Egypt through:

    a. The establishment of a quality assurance and accreditation mechanism. A National Authority
       for Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Education (NAQAAE), reporting directly to the
       Prime Minister, has been created with the mandate of assessing and providing accreditation to
       public and private institutions at all levels of education. Submission to NAQAAE accreditation is
       required for all institutions, public and private, by 2012. The QAAP provided support to the
       public universities and their faculties to prepare for accreditation through the establishment of
       Quality Assessment Centers in universities and faculties, self assessments by faculties, field visits
       by peer reviewers, and preparation of actions plans for accreditation by faculties.
    b. Improving the IT infrastructure in universities to support teaching, research and
       management. HEEP supported the establishment of IT centers in all public universities,
       increased the broadband width available to universities (from 55 Mbps to 310 Mbps), and
       generally improved intranet and internet capabilities. According to the MOHE, over 60% of
       computers in the universities were connected to the internet by the end of the project. The Impact
       Assessment study shows that 58% of surveyed academic staff use internet facilities in the
       university and 83% of them are satisfied with their performance (49% and 25% respectively for
       students). The project also funded the establishment of e-learning centers and the development of
       e-learning content (95 e-courses), and allowed Egyptian universities to access digital libraries,
       including more than 81,000 electronic resources at a reduced negotiated cost.
    c. The initiation of a competitive grant mechanism to support quality enhancement. The
       HEEPF supported 159 small projects aiming at improving quality, efficiency and relevance of
       teaching and research in public universities selected on a competitive basis among 563 proposals.
       By covering all public universities, the project surpassed the target of 50% stated in the PAD. The
       project contributed to disseminating the culture of competitive funding as the number and quality
       of proposals submitted to other competitive funds such as TEMPUS increased as a result of the
       dynamics introduced by the HEEPF, and some universities such as Alexandria University
       established competitive funds at the university level.
    d. A certifying training system for faculty. The project supported the establishment of training
       centers in 17 universities and the collaboration with an international partner (ICTB). About 760
       trainers have been trained under the project, including a core group of 40 certified trainers
       expected to play a leading role in promoting quality training in their respective institutions. The



                                                                                                         10
      project supported the development of 16 specialized and 3 TOT training packages, and the
      delivery of more than 220,000 trainer/courses.
   e. The upgrade and consolidation of the Middle Technical Institutes into 8 Technical Colleges
      (TC). Boards of Trustees (BOT) for all TC with representation from industry, and a Supreme
      Council for Technical Colleges to oversee the subsector were established through the HEEP. The
      project supported rehabilitation and equipment for 3 pilot TCs (Mahalla, Mataria and South
      Valley), revision of the curricula and development of new courses, training courses to upgrade
      qualifications of existing staff, and recruitment of new qualified staff. Although facing some
      implementation issues, the establishment of BOT facilitated the development of interesting
      partnerships with private sector such as in Mataria.

       The contribution of the HEEP to create the conditions conducive to improved system
       efficiency was rather limited:

   a. Although the project facilitated a discussion among stakeholders on system reform, the new
      legislative framework to award more autonomy to universities is facing some resistance and has
      not been adopted yet. The draft law prepared by the MOHE has not been endorsed by the
      education committees of both the Shoura Council and the Parliament.
   b. The MOHE has developed a model to estimate and analyze student unit costs, and worked on a
      funding formula. However, recurrent and investment budgets continue to be allocated through
      direct negotiations between individual universities and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
      of Planning.
   c. The MIS was developed and deployed but not yet operational.
   d. The HEEPF had a "pedagogical" effect by spreading the culture of competitive funding and
      preparing academic and administrative staff to operate in a competitive environment. However,
      without reforming the resource allocation system, a competitive funding mechanism cannot be
      sustained.
   e. The SCTC and TCs Boards of Trustees (BOTs) have been established and have started operating.
      The consolidation of the MTI in a smaller number of TCs may induce some economies of scale.
      But the efficiency of TCs is still jeopardized by an overly centralized system. A Gap Analysis
      undertaken by USAID for the 3 pilot TCs (Mataria, Mahella and South Valley) in 2008,
      confirmed that BOTs have little authority over governance of the Colleges and that the majority
      of authority and decision making was done centrally at the MOHE.


 3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The Economic rate of Return (ERR) and the Financial Rate of Return (FRR) were not updated for this
ICR as they were not estimated during appraisal. Also, the nature of certain components (HEEPF, QAAP)
and the lack of data for other components (ICTP, FLDP, ECTP) did not allow for unit cost estimation.
The ICR evaluation was then limited to validating the PAD analysis based on project outputs and
expected impact.

The economic relevance of the project is still valid as the economy is becoming more global and
knowledge based. Activities funded under the project have created some conditions favoring quality and
relevance improvement. The HEEP has obviously strengthened the IT infrastructure in universities and
TCs, funded 159 small innovative projects at improving the quality and relevance of academic programs
at the undergraduate and graduate levels and established national academic standards that should help
normalize university outputs. The quality of TCs graduates should be enhanced through the

                                                                                                   11
modernization of the curricula, the new equipment and the substantial improvement in students/instructor
ratio from 1/118 to 1/40 in industrial subjects and from 1/305 to 1/98 in services subjects. The
partnerships initiated with private businesses in some TCs are also a good indicator of the potential of the
TCs restructuring to improve the employability of their graduates.

The PAD analysis estimated that the expected increase in Egypt's GDP would not allow maintaining the
same level of public funding per student, and that some measures should be taken to make an efficient use
of available resources and to develop some mechanisms of cost recovery. Actually, the share of public
funding for higher education in the GDP has dropped from 1.64% in 2002 to 1.06% in 2007 according to
the MOHE figures, and the lack of resources has led to further deterioration of quality as reflected by a
poor students/academic staff ratio of 1/29 well below the regional average of 1/21. The HEEP did not
have the expected mitigating impact as (i) the comprehensive reform for university autonomy and funding
did not take place; and (ii) enrolments in TCs increased by only 10% between 2002 and 2007 which was
below the overall increase in higher education of 12% for the same period, and the share of TCs is still at
a low 6.6%.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the Project is rated as Satisfactory. The reasons are: (i) the relevance of the
objective of preparing the Egyptian higher education for quality and efficiency improvement was and
continues to be high; (ii) the project contributed to create an environment conducive to improving the
quality (and relevance) of higher education; (iii) the MOHE has shown a strong commitment to and taken
steps for improving system efficiency, but the reform of the legislative reform governing universities is
still facing resistance.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The main social issue relevant to the project relates its possible impact on equity to access higher
education. The two major aspects that might have had an impact on equity: (i) a cap on secondary school
students access to university; and (ii) an increase in students financial contribution to the cost of higher
education were not directly addressed by the project. On the other hand, the project contributed to
increase enrolment in TCs by 10%, and to improve the quality and relevance of training programs offered
by the TCs. Students who can pay for private tutoring have a distinct advantage over lower income
students for the examination required to enter university. The TCs offer an alternative path to higher
education for students from disadvantaged part of the society.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project had a substantial institutional impact at system, MOHE and university levels.

At the system level, the project has contributed to the establishment of a national accreditation and quality
assurance for education services providers at all levels including higher education, and the SCTC which
will oversee and contribute to the development of Technical Education. The MIS developed under HEEP
will be a useful tool for piloting system performance.


                                                                                                          12
The capacity built in the PMU for managing development projects will serve for the implementation of
future phases of the higher education reform. Already PMU staff have been involved in HEEP2 projects.
The project also contributed to building the capacity of the Strategic Planning Unit in the MOHE.

The project contributed to the institutional strengthening of universities through: (i) the development and
deployment of MIS; (ii) the establishment of Quality Assurance Centers; (iii) the international
accreditation of training centers in three universities; and the establishment of a consortium of Egyptian
university libraries. A major achievement of the project was the restructuring of the Technical Education
sub-sector with the establishment of 8 TCs with BOTs including representatives from the industry.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project had several positive unexpected outcomes:

        The accreditation and quality assurance agency (NAQAA) was established with a dual mandate
        of quality assurance and accreditation, and covers not only higher education but all levels of
        education, including pre-schooling institutions. There are some limitations to this framework
        given the ambiguous position of the NAQAAE in combining the roles of fostering quality,
        granting accreditation and enforcing compliance; and institutional and program accreditation.
        Also, quality assurance in higher education and in general education are substantially different
        and, in most countries, are dealt with by separate institutions.
        The Development Engagement process introduced by QAAP was not initially planned in the
        project. This is a very useful mechanism to assist universities in preparing for accreditation.
        The establishment of the National Centre for Faculty and Leadership Development (NCFLD)
        with an international accreditation and the mandate of training of trainers and certification
        programs as well as the top Management at central and university levels.
        The establishment of the consortium of Egyptian university libraries.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Given the complexity of the project and the difficulty assessing project outcomes, the MOHE decided to
undertake an Impact Assessment Study and organize a Stakeholders workshop.

Impact Assessment Study summary

The purpose of the Impact Assessment Study (see Annex 5) was to assess the perception of HEEP
outcomes by the expected direct beneficiaries of the project. The first part of the study (available) focused
on the impact of QAAP, ICTP and FDLP, and was undertaken in three universities (Cairo, Mansoura and
Assiut) representing Urban, Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt governorates, and selected based on their
involvement in the Project. In each university, four faculties (Engineering, Medicine, Commerce and Art)
representing both hard and soft sciences were surveyed. The sample covered 3371 students (2.5%), 351
Teaching Assistants (11.2%) and 522 faculty staff members (8.9%). Beneficiaries were requested to
respond to a number of statements related to project expected impact and on the learning environment in
the universities by indicating their level of agreement/disagreement on a scale from 1-6. Despite some
methodological issues (sample bias, no baseline, no control group), the study provides some interesting
insight on the perception and expectations of the main beneficiaries of the project. Selected results
provided by the study are presented in the table below. They show: (i) a globally good knowledge and
perception by faculty members, especially for QAAP and ICTP; (ii) a significantly lower level of



                                                                                                          13
knowledge and perception of project benefits from students; and (iii) higher expectations from faculty for
project longer term impact.

Stakeholders workshop summary

An ICR stakeholders workshop was held on December 22-23, 2008, at the University of Ain Chams. The
workshop was launched by the Minister of Higher Education and included about 60 participants
representing the 17 public universities and 8 Technical Colleges. Participants worked in small groups to
reflect on project achievements and sustainability issues, and discussed the lessons learned from project
implementation. The table below provides the items most frequently mentioned by the participants (see
Annex 6):

Participants agreed that the project introduced a culture of change for quality and efficiency that need to
be generalized across the sector and sustained mainly through: (i) providing more autonomy to,
improving the governance and diversifying funding of universities (which was actually among the project
expected and not achieved outcomes); (ii) raising awareness among other stakeholders in the Egyptian
society about the changes taking place in the sector; (iii) embedding the units established by the project
in universities structure; (iv) developing partnerships with private sector; (v) continuing further reform of
technical education for quality and relevance; and (vi) ensuring funding for the next phase of the reform.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall Risk to Development Outcome is rated as moderate. It is likely that the PDOs in terms of
creating an environment favorable to improving the quality and relevance of higher education will be
sustained.
All universities must submit for accreditation by the NAQAA before 2014. It is expected that they will
use the methodology developed under the Quality Assurance Centers established through HEEP to
prepare for their accreditation. The resources reserved by the GOE through QAAP2 and CIQAP will
support those efforts.
Also the cost-sharing approach adopted by ICTP and FLDP ensures that the universities will be able to
sustain the running costs associated with the IT infrastructure and training, and with the libraries network.
The restructuring of the TCs and involvement of business representatives in the BOTs will very likely be
sustained, despite the fact that the BOTs are performing unevenly. The GOE has pledged LE 1 billion to
complete the modernization of the TCs. However, the success of TCs restructuring needs additional
reform to: (i) allow more autonomy to TCs and facilitate collaboration with industry; and (ii) improve the
transition mechanisms and collaboration with Schools of Engineering.
HEEPF has disseminated the culture of competitive funding and contributed to spread essential skills
needed for proposal writing, project implementation, and monitoring and evaluation; and competitive
funds have been established by some universities. However, this scheme would hardly be sustainable
without specific recurrent funding. The continuation of training activities initiated by FLDP is expected

                                                                                                              15
to be funded by universities and through cost recovery. However, future funding for the National Center
for Faculty and Leadership Development (NCFLD) established through the project is still unclear.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank engaged in a long
process of consultations with the GOE before preparation and supported the MOHE in the preparation of
the reform. The Bank's team also brought lessons learned from similar projects and prior operations in the
sector, and sought guidance from the QAG at the project concept stage. However, project design suffered
from some shortcomings: (i) insufficiently elaborated sector analysis; (ii) lack of clarity and consistency
in the results framework; (iii) insufficiently developed implementation arrangements given the
complexity of the project; and (iv) poorly designed indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the project team worked closely with the PMU to ensure smooth operation of the project and to
resolve issues encountered over project implementation. However, there were some shortcomings in
project supervision:

    (i)     The team did not take early action to correct the relative mismatch between the original
            design and components of the project and the actual implementation structure. This made it
            difficult to achieve PDO and to monitor intermediate outcomes. As mentioned above, the
            team could have considered restructuring the project at an early stage which would have
            allowed definition of a more realistic PDO, development of the implementation arrangements
            and improve monitoring and evaluation system and indicators;

    (ii)    The team has continuously followed up on the two major reforms related to university
            autonomy and resource allocation as recorded in supervision aide memoires. However,
            despite the fact that there has been almost no achievement in this regard, the PDO has been
            maintained as Satisfactory. Moreover, the intermediate indicator related to the corresponding
            legislative reform has been removed from the ISRs without any specific mention or
            justification;

    (iii)   Although the project team ensured proper supervision of project compliance with the Bank's
            fiduciary requirements, some issues such as the tax payment under HEEP and the IBCT
            contract (see 2.4) could have been anticipated or, at least, dealt with more expeditiously once
            identified. Also further attention should have being paid to the IPR comments related to the
            employment of university staff as consultants, particularly to make sure that staff are not paid
            to perform tasks that are part of their regular duties.




                                                                                                         16
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is considered Moderately Satisfactory, based on the following factors:

        Project quality at entry is Moderately Satisfactory;
        Quality of supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance is rated Satisfactory. The Government showed a strong commitment to
the implementation of higher education reform through the adoption of legislations establishing the
NAQAA and consolidating the 45 MTIs in 8 TCs. The establishment of the EDF is an indicator of the
government intention to sustain its support to the initiatives funded by HEEP in particular those related to
quality improvement and technical education. The government drafted and has pushed for the legislative
reform related to universities autonomy and funding. However this is a politically sensitive issue, and the
reform is still facing some resistance. The Government also fully contributed its project counterpart
funding despite some delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PMU had to face real challenges in implementing such a complex and sector wide project given the
lack of details in project design. Its structure was strengthened by the appointment of directors for the five
sub-projects. The PMU had to develop action plans, operation manuals and guidelines for the five sub-
projects. Despite the additional delays due to the change of some directors and the release of Government
contribution, the PMU was able to successfully complete almost all the activities planned in the project.
The PMU performance is however mitigated by shortcomings in monitoring and evaluation and in
fiduciary compliance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The Borrower's overall performance is considered Satisfactory, based on the following factors:

        Government performance is Satisfactory;
        PMU performance is Satisfactory.




                                                                                                           17
6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

        A clear and well articulated result framework is essential to assess development outcomes. By
        several measures, HEEP has achieved, and in some instances surpassed, its expected outputs. It is
        unclear, however, to what extent the higher education system in Egypt is prepared for quality and
        efficiency improvement.

        Resistance to systemic change should never be underestimated. Despite the long process of
        consultation and the commitment of the MOHE, key legislative measures to allow more
        autonomy to universities and reform funding mechanisms have been blocked over the life of the
        project by stakeholders who did not see their interest in the reform. Such politically and socially
        charged reforms require a substantial preparatory work, including (as recommended by the
        QAG): (i) a Social Assessment to establish breadth and depth of ownership; (ii) a comprehensive
        Communications Strategy; and (iii) an Institutional Analysis to identify and ensure the support of
        reform champions.

        The academic community can be supportive to quality assurance systems. The participative and
        "pedagogical" approach based on institutional self assessment, peer reviews and the development
        of strategic plan has ensured ownership and strong commitment from academic staff. To be
        sustained this commitment needs to be supported by appropriate funding.

        Funding mechanisms can be embedded in the project to ensure sustainability of project
        activities. The approach adopted in ICTP to cover the running costs of the university IT
        infrastructure and the digital library by requesting progressive contributions from the universities
        was successful and instructive. Would such approach has been adopted for HEEPF with
        contribution from the SCU, the competitive funding mechanism could have been sustained, and
        eventually constituted the basis for a competitive funding for universities investment budget.

        The Technical Education sub-sector still needs attention given its potential to improve the
        overall relevance and efficiency of higher education. The restructuring supported by HEEP was
        an important step in upgrading the sub-sector. More efforts are needed to: (i) increase enrolment
        in TCs which host only 5% of students; (ii) improve the transition mechanisms with universities;
        and (iii) provide more autonomy to the TCs to facilitate collaboration with business community.

        Particular attention should be paid during preparation of higher education projects to the
        employment of academic staff as individual consultants. Whenever the nature of the activities
        planned in the project require the recruitment of large numbers of academic staff, the procedures
        and conditions for hiring such staff should be agreed upon during the project preparation and
        disclosed in the project documents.

        The Financial Management manual and the project accounting and financial reporting system
        need to be ready at the early stages of the project. This would ensure fiduciary compliance of
        project payments and avoid mistakes that may jeopardize project achievements.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic evaluation undertaken during appraisal did not include an estimate of the Economic rate of
Return (ERR) and the Financial rate of Return (FRR). It focused, in turn, on the following question: (i)
Why should higher education be the focus of the Project?; (ii) What is the rationale for supporting public
higher education? The present evaluation focuses on validating the PAD analysis based on project outputs
and expected impact.

Justification for investment Project in higher education

The main justification was the potential contribution of a more relevant and of better quality higher
education system to improving the competitiveness of Egypt's economy. It was expected that, building on
the outcomes of other projects at the basic and secondary education levels (EEP, SEEP), the HEEP would
contribute to improve the quality and relevance of tertiary education outputs, particularly through
increasing the ICT content in university programs and the restructuring of the middle technical institutes.

The economic relevance of the project is still valid as the economy is becoming more global and
knowledge based. Although, it is too early to measure any impact of the HEEP on the quality and
relevance of higher education, the activities funded under the project have created some conditions
favoring an improvement in this respect. The HEEP has obviously strengthened the IT infrastructure in
universities and TCs. The HEEPF has funded 159 small innovative projects at improving the quality and
relevance of academic programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The QAAP has established
national academic standards that should help normalize university outputs and thus improve
communication with employers. The quality of TCs graduates should be enhanced through the
modernization of the curricula, the new equipment and the substantial improvement in students/instructor
ratio from 1/118 to 1/40 in industrial subjects and from 1/305 to 1/98 in services subjects. The
partnerships initiated with private businesses in some TCs are also a good indicator of the potential of the
TCs restructuring to improve the employability of their graduates.

Rationale for supporting public funding for higher education

The PAD analysis estimated that the expected increase in Egypt's GDP would not allow maintaining the
same level of public funding per student, and that some measures should be taken to make an efficient use
of available resources, on one hand, and to develop some mechanisms of cost recovery on the other hand.
It was expected that the increased enrolment and improved quality in TCs would induce a most cost
effective use of the resources allocated to higher education. It was also expected that providing more
autonomy to universities and reforming their funding mechanisms would facilitate the design of cost
recovery alternatives for the universities to compensate for the expected reduction in public funding.


Despite the favourable treatment of higher education in the education budget (about 28%), the actual
volume of funding has decreased steadily. The share of public funding for higher education in the GDP
has dropped from 1.64% in 2002 to 1.06% in 2007 according to the MOHE figures. Rapidly increasing
enrolment combined with this lack of resources has led to further deterioration of quality in most public
higher education institutions as reflected by a poor students/academic staff ratio of 1/29 well below the
regional average of 1/21. Did the HEEP mitigate this negative impact? (i) The project contributed, as
mentioned above to improving the quality of training provided by the TCs. Enrolments has increased by
10% and did therefore surpass the project target of 5%. This does not reflect however an increase in their

                                                                                                         24
weight in as the overall increase in higher education enrolments reached 12% for the same period, and the
share of TCs is still at a low 6.6%. (ii) Although the reform of university funding did not take place as
planned in the project, the GOE has encouraged public universities to diversify their income sources and
has faciliated the development of cost-sahring programs through the "special accounts" that universities
are allowed to establish for the delivery of special programs.

                                                                28
Introduction

The five projects directors prepared reports containing the targeted goals of each project and what has
been implemented so far. It has been relied basically on these reports in designing the survey forms,
which include a series of questions and statements used to develop benchmarks and indicators to identify
the degree of results achievement.

The main constraints encountered are related to short time available for study implementation, and the
beneficiary groups commitment with midterm exams dates.
Such constraints have led to the following:

- Narrowing the scope of the study to only 12 faculties within 3 universities.
- Prolonging the survey form to obtain a sufficient number of statements, to allow for developing
measurement tools to measure the extent of results achievement of various development projects with a
satisfactory degree of sincerity and stability.
- Lack of time to implement some Qualitative methods, such as the "Focus Group".
- The scope of the study did not include businesses and community.

Due to the different nature and scope of projects implementation, and different targeted samples of the
study, the study was divided into three separated parts according to the following:
Part I: Return study of implementing: ICTP - FLDP  QAAP.
Part II: Return study of implementing Egyptian Technical Collages Project ETCP.
Part III: Return study of implementing Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund HEEPF.

The First Part: Study of the return of implementing
                ICTP  FLDP  QAAP

Methodology

Beneficiaries of the three concerned projects in this part were divided into four different groups as
follows:
First group: Faculty Staff Members
Second group: Students
Third group: Teaching Assistants
Fourth group: Post Graduate Students
Four different Questionnaires were designed for each group; each one includes questions related the
projects' output associated with this group. It was taken into consideration to ask about different groups`
point of view for the same output, each commensurate with his relationship with the supposed influence.

Sample Design

The study depended on a group of random samples of the participants and beneficiaries from the Higher
Education Enhancement projects. The design includes three main stages.

The First stage: concentrated on choosing the participated universities in this study. To achieve a good
representation of participated universities in these projects, the research team decided to choose three
geographically dispersed universities, in order to reflect the Egyptian universities in Urban, Lower Egypt,
and Upper Egypt governorates. Cairo University has been selected to represent the universities in urban


                                                                                                        29
governorates and the University of Mansoura for Lower Egypt universities, and Assiut University as a
representative for the Universities of Upper Egypt.
These universities were selected for being the most active participants in the enhancement projects in
general.

The Second stage: This stage concentrated on determining the faculties inside each of the selected
universities. Here the research team agreed on including both the theoretical and applied Faculties. They
were chosen according to the participation extent of each sector in the enhancement projects on all
Egyptian universities level. According to these criteria, it was observed that Faculties of engineering and
medicine are the most active applied Faculties, while Faculties of commerce and literature are the most
active theoretical ones.

The Third stage: focused on choosing the random samples from the participants and beneficiaries of the
enhancement projects; this includes four categories:
    First: Faculty staff members
    Second: Students
    Third: Teaching Assistants
    Fourth: Post Graduate Students

The sample size in each category was identified, in a way that the error in estimated percentages shouldn't
exceed 0.05, which statistically acceptable. The size of each sample as following: 1000 students from the
third year or above, 500 of faculty staff members, 350 of the teaching assistants and 300 of post graduate
students from each participated university, equally distributed among the four Faculties in each
university. The following table shows the total number of the four categories and their achieved sample
sizes.

Analysis Method

The Questionnaires included some statements asking the respondent to identify the extent of his approval
on each statement achievement from his point of view by choosing a scale from 1 to 6, where the first
three choices show disagreement levels (totally disagree  disagree  disagree to some extent), while the
last three show the different levels of agreement (agree to some extent  agree  totally agree). The
following figure the way of explaining the degree of approval.




                                                                                                                         31

 In analyzing the results, we depended on calculating the average degree of approval on each statement
 achievement for all responses. We took into account all the arithmetic mean limitations resulted from the
 outlier values, by reviewing the mode, standard deviation values of the responses. The following figure
 shows the used measurement and its explanation.

                                             degree


 The values from 3 to below 4 express a medium degree of statement achievement, while the values from
 4 to below 5 indicates a high degree of achievement, while the values from 2 to below 3 refers to a low
 degree of achievement. On the other hand, the values from 5 to below 6 refer to a very high achievement
 degree, while the values from 1 to below 2 indicate a very little degree of achievement.


 Study Results



 Section I: Communication with the Higher Education Enhancement Project

 Knowledge about Higher Education Enhancement project
 The results highlighted that the faculty staff members' and their assistants knowledge about the
 enhancement project is higher in degree than both the under graduate & post graduate students, as 87% of
 the faculty staff members and 85% of the assistants have mentioned their knowledge about the project in
 general, while 35% of post graduate students and 46% of under graduate students said that they did not
 hear about the project before.
 Also it was observed that the project is more obvious for the faculty staff members, compared to the
 teaching assistants, as 74% of the first group mentioned the clarity of the objectives and programs of the
 project for them whether with great or medium extent, compared to only 55% from the second group, as
 shown in the following figure


                                                                                                               32

  Development within the teaching and learning environment:

  In order to identify the degree of development achieved in the teaching and learning environment for
  different beneficiaries groups, we asked the faculty staff members and teaching assistants to determine
  their degree of agreement on the following statement: "there is an improvement in the teaching & learning
  environment within the Faculty in general".
  As for the students they were asked to determine their degree of agreement on the following statement
  "there is an encouraging learning environment within the Faculty". With regard to post-graduate students
  they were asked to determine their degree of agreement on the following statement "The learning
  environment of post graduate studies and scientific research encourages and helps learning." The
  following table shows the answers of different groups of beneficiaries.

         Statement for faculty staff members and teaching assistants: there is an improvement in the
         teaching & learning environment within the Faculty in general".
         Statement for students: "there is an encouraging learning environment within the Faculty".
         Statement for post-graduate students: "The learning environment of post graduate studies and
         scientific research encourages and helps learning."

To summarize information in a certain index in order to allow analysis and comparison between
beneficiaries groups and the various scientific specialties, we relied on calculating the average degree of
agreement given by each group. The following figure illustrates the calculated average value for different
beneficiaries groups.




                                                                                                            34

The answers of the teaching stuff members indicate that there is a significant development achieved in the
teaching and learning environment in general. This was obvious in the faculty of medicine.
 It is clear from the above figure that the achieved development results were at limited extent within
teaching assistants, as they mentioned a medium degree of achieved development. Excluding Faculty of
Arts as their answers pointed to a high degree of development. With regard to post-graduate students, they
referred to medium degree of encouraging learning environment with a special increase in faculties of
medicine and Literature. Answers of the students showed an encouraging learning environment to some
extent, but this agreement degree decreased within the Faculty of Arts.

Internet Service

To measure the improvement in the Internet service, 3 statements for staff members and 2 statements for
assistants and students were used, to develop an instrument to measure various beneficiary groups'
satisfaction with the Internet service efficiency and its development.

    The previous table shows the percentage distribution of agreement degree according to the developed
    compound measurement, and in accordance with the beneficiary groups at universities sample. The table
    shows that there is a good return from the staff members and assistants view relative to the students view
    within the 3 universities. The (I do not agree % and totally disagree %) reached 33% among the students
    compared to 13% between the assistants and 8% among the staff members.
    Figure (9) and (10) show a high degree of easy internet access from inside the faculty by the staff
    members and their assistants in different faculties and universities, while this feature is available with a
    medium degree among postgraduate students and with a lower degree among students. This feature is
    relatively better for groups of beneficiaries in faculties of medicine and engineering.

Figures (14) shows the pattern of the internet access inside the University for Different Beneficiary
Groups. It is clear that 58% of the staff members access the internet from inside the faculty every day or
every week, while 74% of them access from outside the faculty. It is also clear that 13% have never
accessed the internet inside the faculty and 16% are rarely using it. 25% of the students access the internet
daily or weekly from inside the university, while 48% of them access from outside the university. It is
also clear that 36% have never accessed the internet from inside the university, and 29% rarely use it.

The Digital Library

Figures (18), (19) show the usage pattern of the electronic library by the staff members and their
assistants within different faculties and universities. The results show that 15% of the staff members and
18% of the teaching assistants access the electronic library daily or weekly. This access rate decrease
significantly in Cairo University compared with other universities. The access rate increase among the
staff members and their assistants in the faculty of engineering, to reach 20% within the first group, and
22% for the second group. Moreover, the results show that 47% of the samples` staff members do not use
the electronic library, while this percentage reaches its maximum level of 64% among Cairo University
respondents. In addition, 44% of the teaching assistants do not use the electronic library.

      It is worth noting that the training courses matrix has passed with many stages where several courses were
      excluded or introduced according to the experiment result. That indicates the need for pre-studies prior
      the implementation of any similar projects.

methods for student's level evaluation.
On the other hand, the following figure shows the students` average agreement degree on the statement "I
need only to memorize well, in order to get good marks in exams", and there was an obvious high
agreement degree among the Faculty of Medicine students, compared with a medium degree among the
students of other specializations.

The following figure shows a great concern among the staff members to clarify the applied evaluation
method to the student from the beginning of the academic year. On the other hand, we can observe that
students agree on the same thing with a high degree within the Faculty of Engineering compared to lower

some statements related to the lectures, and curriculum. It is clear that the students are keen to attend the
lectures among all specialties, as it has been noted that attendance helps in understanding the scientific
subject. The answers also indicated that the provided material (books) are not enough understood, and
there is medium satisfaction level with the lecturers performance, even lower with significant difference
within the Faculty of Medicine (P <0.001). Moreover, it was mentioned that the curriculum have helped
to upgrade some of the mental capacity among students by an average degree, this degree is lower with
significant difference for the Faculty of Medicine (such as analytical and problem solving capabilities).

Negative Aspects during the last Five Years in Higher Education Environment

The increasing number of students was considered the most significant negative aspect noted by the staff
members. Moreover, some of the staff members do not recognize the HEEP properly, in addition to the
lack of adequate scientific research facilities. Also, some staff members complained about improper
attention given to their financial and moral status, as well as red tape and intransigence in some cases
within the implementation of decisions by the University administration.
As for the teaching assistants, they mentioned the students` number increase within faculties of Arts,
Commerce, and Engineering. They also complained about red tape and the University administration
treatment within the faculties of Medicine and Engineering, also there were complaints about regulations
and laws related to the M.A. discussion and forbidding obtaining M.A. from outside the Faculty where
the assistant works.

The students` most important negative aspect was related to the exams, in terms of evaluation method, the
exam place, and the results delay and being linked with faculty fees payment; such complaints were
relatively more obvious within the faculties of Medicine and Commerce. Moreover, the students
complained about their relation with the staff members, the schedule of lectures, the delay in providing
books, some courses are not empirical and e-learning courses.
A complaint also appeared within the Faculty of Engineering about some of the specialized subjects being
taught during the first year instead of third or fourth year. Students also mentioned the expensive books
and high Faculty fees and lack of attention to expatriates. Some students demanded more attention to
cleanliness of teaching rooms and restaurants.


Positive Achievements during the Last Five Years in Higher Education Environment

Staff members believe that the development project is the most important positive achievement during the
last five years within higher education. They also pointed to salary increases, and the higher attention
given to them, as well as the development of textbooks and curricula.
Also, teaching assistants believe that such development project is the most important positive
development achieved during the last five years within higher education, and then comes the increase in
salaries and the electronic library project. Faculty of Medicine staff members mentioned both curriculum
and explanation methods improvement as positives achieved outcomes.
Students have been asked about their viewpoint regarding the most important advantages occurred during
their stay in faculty. They referred to student activities and making new friends, the style and way of
explanation, as well as acquiring new skills and information, in addition to increase in their analysis
capabilities.


Important Proposals for Higher Education Development

Staff members demanded for the provision of all facilities required for the higher education development
implementation & marketing, they also demanded more attention to scientific capacity and skills building
for them, as well as supporting and developing the infrastructure and laboratories, increasing salaries,
reducing the number of accepted students, developing of courses and books, caring about pre-University
education, and reducing red tape.
Teaching assistants' proposals included the provision of the necessary facilities and support to encourage
scientific research, greater promotion for the HEEP. They also mentioned the importance of linking

                                                                                                       54
courses to practice. Faculty of Medicines` teaching assistants pointed to the attention needed for skills
development, through the use of international expertise and the increase of specialized courses. While in
the Faculty of Engineering claim was made to reduce the working hours and to increase salaries. Faculties
of Arts and Commerce called for more attention to infrastructure.


Conclusion


Here is a quick summary of the main points of the report conclusions:


    -   There is a high degree of communication between the development project and the staff members.
        However, there is a need for further objectives and programs clarification for the teaching
        assistants and students.

    -   Regarding the communication and information technology project, there is generally an
        agreement degree about the improvement in the Internet services level; in terms of ease of entry
        and the speed of loading and a constant level of service. However, a lower satisfaction degree was
        shown among students compared to staff members and their assistants.

    -   A great praise was made regarding the electronic library, as well as its ability in providing the
        needed references and studies, but more encouragement is needed for the expansion of using this
        feature among various beneficiary groups, where the results showed a large proportion of staff
        members and their assistants who are not dealing with the electronic library.

    -   Regarding teaching e-learning courses, opinions were divided between supporters and opponents
        students, due to the presence of some difficulties in teaching these courses, such as the lack of
        computers for all students, and the need to activate a mechanism that compensates the missing
        communication between the professor and student.

    -   There is a clear need for more activation of the e- mail usage among beneficiary groups.

    -   Regarding the FLDP, the staff members and their assistants have welcomed these courses, and
        have shown satisfaction about the diversity of training matrix, and the level of equipped centres
        and classrooms as well as the trainers' level. Reference was made to a significant benefit achieved
        from attending most of these courses, and they believe that providing these courses would create
        human capital within universities. However, there is a complaint improper dates and timing of
        these training courses, especially among the staff members.

    -   Regarding the quality and accreditation project, there is a positive trend among the staff members
        in terms of the need for its application, and there is satisfactory degree of communication and
        cooperation among the quality units and centres within the faculties and universities. Also, a state
        of optimism has emerged regarding positive results achievement in the near future, as well as
        upgrading capabilities and qualifications of the graduate.

    -   A lack of knowledge about the Faculty mission content as well as a lack of content satisfaction
        has appeared in some cases among the students; this requires more publication and explanation of
        the Faculty mission for students, in order to familiarize them with the mission content and
        increase their convince with it.


                                                                                                         55
-   A moderate degree of optimism can be observed in general among the staff members regarding
    the possibility of positive results achievement through the project before the end of 2010. This
    degree increases for the long-term in terms of; better graduate upgrading and thus enhance his
    opportunities in labor market, as well as achieving better quality of higher education.

-   Centralization and regulations as well as the laws governing higher education, appeared as
    barriers to achieve satisfactory benefits from the development project implementation. On the
    other hand, the staff members and business owners associated with various specializations, and
    the presence of a competitive environment among faculties have considered as catalysts that
    could help for the development project success.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Government of Egypt (GOE) rightly accorded first priority to expanding and improving the quality of
its basic and secondary school systems. Since 1990, the Government increased its pre-university
education budget by 150 percent in real terms, achieving near universal access at the basic level and
expanded secondary enrollment rates to over 64 percent at the secondary level. Consistent with the CAS
recommendations, the World Bank has, since 1997, expanded its dialogue with the Government on basic
and secondary education and provided support under the Education Enhancement Program (EEP) and
Secondary Education Enhancement Project (SEEP). These Programs' objectives directly support the
Government's 20-year Education Sector Strategic Framework (1999-2019), developed with technical
support from the World Bank. With the reforms of basic and secondary education already under
implementation, the World Bank considered supporting Egypt's efforts to improve the market orientation
of the higher education sector by improving quality and relevance and enhancing sector efficiency. These
efforts envisioned to be accomplished through the implementation of a project specifically aiming to help
the Government restructure and change the higher education system so it produces the type of graduates
needed to underpin a private sector-led, export-driven economy, competitive in a global market.
In 1997, the Minister appointed a committee for the reform of higher education (known as the HEEP
Committee) which drew in a wide range of stakeholders including industrialists and parliamentarians. A
National Conference on higher education reform was held in February 2000, and a Declaration for action
emanating from the Conference was endorsed by the President and the Prime Minister. The Declaration
identified 25 specific reform initiatives. The Bank agreed with, and supported, the Declaration. A range of
multilateral and bilateral agencies also concurred with the Declaration's proposals, and was committed to
supporting various aspects of the reform process.
The Government's Higher Education Reform Strategy (HERS) consisted 25 sub-projects, including a sub-
project to improve the quality of the Faculties of Education (pre-service teacher training) which was
supported with an IDA credit of US$13 million from the ongoing EEP. The Government has also sought
donor financing to fill the funding gap, including a US$0.5 million grant for legislative reform from
DFID. An IBRD loan of US$50 million was concluded with the World Bank to cover eleven sub-projects
of the Government's reform strategy, and the GOE contributed approximately US$10 million allocated to
support the first phase of the HERS. The Government was well positioned to implement the measures
needed to create a more efficient, quality-driven higher education system underpinned by better
governance and greater efficiency.
The Government's reform strategy is comprehensive and ambitious. The National Conference on Higher
Education helped shape the reform agenda into 25 specific reform initiatives which will be implemented
over a 15-year period. While the Bank supports the entire reform strategy, it has made a strategic choice
to fund 11 of the 25 specific reform initiatives. This is complemented by IDA funding of US$13 million
for one of the initiatives - improving the quality of the Faculties of Education - under the ongoing
Education Enhancement Program (ITF-N0008). Other donors are supporting other reform initiatives of
the Governments 25 sub-projects, including: Prince Talal (US$ 0.5 million) supporting technical
education, The Ford Foundation (US$ 0.4 million) supporting quality assurance and accreditation
initiatives for higher education and DFID (US$ 0.5 million) supporting legislative reform for technical

education. The 11 initiatives supported by the IBRD under HEEP are those deemed most fundamental to
bringing about meaningful, systemic changes in quality, relevance and efficiency. The initiatives
included:
 Initiatives to improve governance and efficiency: the development and diversification of funding
   sources for higher education; the establishment and modernization of an MIS for the university
   system; and the establishment of a national center for education administration and management.
   Initiatives to improve quality and relevance: the reform of legislation governing the higher education
   system; establishment of a National Quality Assurance Council; establishment of centers of
   excellence in higher education; the development of an IT and networking system; the establishment of
   a National Learning Technologies and Multimedia Center.
   Initiatives to consolidate and upgrade mid-level technical education: training and upgrading of
   faculty/instructors as well as expansion and Arabization of library and learning resources.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
This project was funded by the World Bank after the success achieved in the Engineering and Technical
Education Project (ETEP) funded by the World Bank's loan agreement No. 3137-EGT. However, it was
the first project designed for a sector-wide reform to cover all specializations in the Egyptian Higher
Education Institutions. To do so, it was mandatory to start the design phase of each project component
following a top-down approach with the exception of HEEPF that was well defined from project startup
to fulfill the needs of our institutions on a competitive basis.
The World Bank and MOHE jointly prepared the design of the project based on six studies in the areas of
labor market analysis, quality assurance and relevance, private sector role, financial diversification,
governance and accountability, and developing policy framework.

                                                                                                                                                                                                 67
The project design included the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for successful implementation of the
project. However, these indicators focus mainly on outputs rather than results i.e. short or long term
outcomes or impacts. Moreover, a major shortcoming is that the bank changed its strategy during
implementation of the project to a results-based evaluation, including project impact, which was not taken
into consideration in the original design of the project. This unforeseen change in directive led to the
initiation of impact assessment studies without having baseline data to compare it with the
output/outcome from project activities. However, this new directive will benefit the second phase of
implementation of the project, and other future projects, to develop any missing baseline data according
to its targeted objectives before, ideally before starting implementation.
The design of the project was based on the assumption that the PMU and the management team are
already appointed and ready to startup implementation. The reality that has to be taken into consideration
in the design of any similar project is that appointment of the implementation team does not take place
before endorsement of the relevant authority (in Egypt's case the People's Assembly) to the loan
agreement as a mandatory bureaucratic requirement. MOHE cannot commit itself to select and appoint
the management team, and issue the necessary Ministerial Decrees, before this endorsement takes place.
In addition, the nature of this project requires at least six months startup period to develop action plans,
operation manuals and guidelines before any notable project disbursement takes place. Provision for the
planned disbursement has to be more realistic and cater for such startup provisions leading to delay in
sizable disbursements, noting that procurement of goods and services are lengthy procedures that
consume considerable amount of time until delivery of goods, and/or completion of services before
issuing payment.
Tying-up disbursement for loan proceeds to local funds under the civil works and goods categories
created many serious problems jeopardizing PMU credibility with suppliers of goods and contractors of
civil work. As a result, the contractors and suppliers became reluctant and not motivated to apply for the
bids offered by the PMU, which led to several rebids. Moreover, the suppliers and contractors sometimes
increased their offers to mitigate the risks caused by the delay of the financial reimbursements. The
discrepancy between the disbursement procedures from the loan and local funds considerably improved
when a fully autonomous financial unit was established at the PMU, handling both payment portions from
the loan and local funds at nearly the same time. However, delays in receiving local funds on a quarterly
basis, and/or receiving funding approvals from concerned government authorities, considerably affected
the payment me mechanism and led to the same gap despite the corrective measures taken to establish the
financial unit. It is essential for the World Bank to reconsider this tying-up of disbursement to avoid such
hassles in future projects.
2.2 Implementation
1. There was a delay in achieving some of the project activities due to several reasons:
   -   Universities were not ready to accept or deal with the change.
   -   The change of project directors for some project components at the start of the project. This delay
       was incurred as the new project directors familiarized themselves with the project and its
       implementation plans. However, these delays caused a slight slippage of the project time schedule
       in the first year of implementation. Nevertheless, the delays were controlled and the project
       achieved all its planned deliverables and objectives, and more.
   -   Considerable delays in issuing payments from local funds to completed civil works and
       procurement of goods due to bureaucracies in negotiating funds with MOP, getting their approvals
       and at the end receiving just a portion of the funds requested by the PMU based on actual
       contractual commitments. These delays were partially resolved after the establishment of the
       financial unit at the PMU in 1/7/2007 to handle the local funds, whenever it was made available.



                                                                                                         68
   -   The Government decision to transfer all bank accounts to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)
       created a lot of confusion and considerable delays, particularly at the institutions side, until the
       situation was cleared and settled.
   -   Delays in obtaining construction permits for the new buildings, resulted in startup delays and
       consequently in completion times. These delays caused a slippage of the project time schedule
       and a decision had to be taken by the PMU Board to continue funding projects that have not been
       completed before the closing date of the loan agreement, from local fund allocated for the second
       phase of the HEEP reform projects.
   -   Delays in the achievement of some activities implemented for EUN, TCs and universities.
       However, corrective actions controlled these delays and the project finally achieved all its planned
       deliverables and objectives.
All these delays, however, caused a slight slippage of the overall project time schedule, and their control
led to the achievement of all the project planned deliverables and objectives, and the evaluation of the
World Bank biannual Supervision Missions to implementation progress was consistently satisfactory.
2. The limitation of the project budget constrained the achievement of some planned activities such as
implementing the fifth cycle under HEEPF.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation and Utilization
The former Projects Implementation Unit (PIU) of the ETEP had more than nine years of experience in
Bank project management, including familiarity with the Banks procurement and financial management
guidelines. This unit has been reinstated as the Projects Management Unit (PMU) for HEEP. The PMU's
activities include: (i) opening and maintaining separate Special and local accounts; (ii) implementing the
different procurement actions and procedures in full conformity with the Project procedures; (iii)
monitoring performance of the Project overall; and (iv) maintaining overall responsibility for universities
procurement actions, documentation and record keeping, as well as for all overall financial management
tasks.
To strengthen the monitoring and evaluation activities, the PMU contracted a monitoring and evaluation
consultant in March 2006 to be responsible for coordinating monitoring reports from HEEP directors on
progress against agreed-upon performance indicators and follow up the impact evaluation studies
conducted for HEEP. In this direction, a template for the quarterly reports was designed and endorsed by
the World Bank supervision teams. Each project component provided the PMU with regular (quarterly)
progress reports summarizing the current status of Project implementation, including financial records,
explanations for deviations from agreed-upon implementation plans, constraints and corrective measures
to be taken using the pre-designed template for progress report. These quarterly reports were used to
develop the consolidated collective report prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant in
coordination with the PMU Executive Director.
The PMU also prepared periodic quarterly reports illustrating the main achievements and the progress of
the project activities as well as future plans for the next period. All these reports are posted on the HEEP
website for disseminating the project achievements among all stakeholders. A detailed mid-term report
about the project achievements and the progress of the project activities has also been prepared and
submitted to IBRD to serve as the basis for the mid-term review which the IBRD and the Borrower
conducted in December 2005.
The PMU also prepared this Implementation Completion Report (ICR) within the four months grace
period allocated to complete all pending payments and activities for services rendered before the closing
date of the project in accordance with World Bank regulations and guidelines. In addition, as part of the
requirements for completing the ICR, the PMU conducted an impact evaluation study in order to validate
the achievements of the HEEP project.


                                                                                                         69
The PMU also established an Impact Evaluation System that was applied in a pilot study at Zagazig
University in order to test the study tools and design before it is implemented on a wide scale. The
Supreme Council of Universities SCU has approved this system in 5/5/2008 to adopt it by all the
seventeen public universities to measure the impact of the HEEP projects on their respective institutions
focusing on academic performance.
2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
This project has provided several pathways for the future sustainable development of the higher education
system in Egypt.
First, reform legislation governing higher education under component one led to (i) the adoption of the
Government's "Higher Education Reform Agenda 2000-2007" by assisting in the issuance of several
Ministerial decrees governing the Egyptian Higher Education system such as: the Act #528/2003
governing the clustering of MTIs into technical colleges (TCs) and the Act #290l2004 concerning the
establishment of the Education Development Fund (EDF); (ii) the establishment of the National Authority
for Quality Assurance and Accreditation for Education (NAQAAE) with the Presidential Decree
#82/2006; and (iii) the development of the new legislative framework for higher education system under a
unified Law, an initiative that has been temporarily postponed for political reasons.
Second, through its support for Higher Education Reform Agenda, the project has helped create a more
robust higher education sector and assisted in the adoption of the higher education policies that call for
and insists on strategic planning for the Egyptian Higher Education by establishing a Strategic Planning
Unit (SPU) responsible for planning ahead to develop a road map for the Egyptian Higher Education,
forecast for higher education based on scientific methodology, and develop Project Appraisal Documents
PAD according to international norms.
Third, the HEEP project developed and supported the application of sustainable quality assurance
mechanisms in the Egyptian public universities and TCs through the QAAP project under component one
which led to: (i) establishing quality assurance infra-structure within the Egyptian public universities and
TCs, (ii) helped in building the qualified calibers needed to apply and review the quality assurance
systems, (iii) developed 10 National Academic Reference Standards (NARS) in different fields, and (iv)
providing the academic institutions with opportunities to test, develop, and refine their internal quality
assurance system. The second phase of the Higher Education Enhancement Project HEEP2 will support
the Continuous Improvement and Qualifying for Accreditation (CIAQP) for all the Egyptian public and
private Academic Institutions.
Fourth, the project supported competitive grant funds under (HEEPF) component one to improve
competitiveness among faculty and help enhance the quality in various fields such as: management,
academic programs, capacity building, information technology, new teaching methods, and
entrepreneurship among faculty. HEEPF created a credible, transparent, and competitive atmosphere that
helps in the development of higher education institutions and in fulfilling their needs (departments/
faculties/universities). It promoted and supported the priority areas to fulfill the actual/real needs of
universities. It also strengthened the cooperation and integration between industry and higher education
institutions. HEEPF became a comprehensive model (self-assessment, M&E, IA) that can be
implemented/replicated worldwide. Now, some Egyptian Universities allocated funds for competitive
projects based on HEEPF as a successful sustainable mechanism for replication. The second phase of the
reform activities continues to implement HEEPF as a complementary mechanism to fulfill the needs of
higher education institutions on a competitive manner.
Fifth, the ICTP project led to: (i) upgrade the network infrastructure for both EUN and Egyptian
Universities, (ii) establishing a MIS/DSS for the SCU and MIS for 3 applications for 200 faculties, (iii)
established the National e-Learning Center (NeLC) in the SCU and subsidiary e-learning centers in the
Egyptian universities responsible for producing the e-courses, and (iv) providing the staff members and

                                                                                                         70
researchers with electronic journals, books, and databases. These project components continue to provide
their services under the SCU as sustainable mechanisms.
Sixth, the establishment of the National Centre for Faculty and Leadership Development (NCFLD)
through the FLDP, which primarily focuses on training of trainers and certification programs as well as
the Top Management programs, continues its support of university FLDP centers by providing them with
certified trainer of trainers' program and workshop materials for a selected set of courses. On the other
hand, the universities will be responsible for conducting the training programs or e-training according to
their available facilities.
Finally, the ETCP project will continue in the second phase of the HEEP project as one of the priority
areas of reform. The objectives of the next phase is to: (i) continue the reform of the ETC's governance
framework, (ii) motivate the top management and administrators in the ETC's to upgrade their technical
and administrative capabilities, (iii) continue to upgrade the learning resources in the ETC's, (iv) generate
private revenues from business community, and (v) conclude twinning arrangements with counterpart
community colleges.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

This part of the report addresses the outcomes of HEEP activities based on the project developmental
objectives (PDO) grouped under the three components reviewed earlier and included in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD).
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Government's Higher Education Reform Strategy (HERS), endorsed by the National Conference in
February 2000, consists of 25 sub-projects addressing the diverse areas of reform to support efficiency
and quality enhancement initiatives and improve the quality and relevance of higher education so
graduates have the knowledge and skills demanded by Egypt's developing and globalizing economy.
Twelve projects were identified and extended together into six integrated projects that are given priority
in the first phase of the strategic plan (2002  2007). These projects are:
 FOEP             Faculties of Education Project
 ETCP             Egyptian Technical Colleges Project
 FLDP             Faculty-Leadership Development Project
 ICTP             Information & Communication Technology Project
 QAAP             Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project
 HEEPF            Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund
The first phase was funded through an IDA credit of US$13 million from the ongoing EEP and an IBRD
loan of US$50 million from World Bank Agreement No. 4385-EGT to cover the Government's reform
strategy. The GOE contributed by approximately US$10 million to support the first phase of the HERS.
The project objectives were derived from the key issues in the Higher Education (the need to: (i)
restructure the legislative, governance, and financing systems of the higher education system to support
efficiency and quality enhancement initiatives; and (ii) improve the quality and relevance of higher
education so graduates have the knowledge and skills demanded by Egypt's developing and globalizing
economy). The design of the HEEP project focused on a top-down approach for the following reasons:
      Universities were not ready to accept or deal with the change
      To create the critical mass to affect change
      To create the environment and culture for accepting the change
      Creating a competitive mechanism to encourage participation

The project objectives were derived directly from this analysis and KPIs were chosen to reflect them.
Linkage between the PDOs and KPIs was generally good.

                                                                                                          71
Implementation of the project suffered as the Educational institutions were not ready to be receptive to the
reform project due to the lack of confidence and the resistance to change. Extensive Awareness at all
projects levels was mandatory to attract faculty to participate. After the contractual agreements under
HEEPF first cycle became effective, confidence in the reform activities started to gain momentum.




3.2 Achievements of Project Development Objectives
Overall Rating: Highly Satisfactory
This section takes each of the three project development objectives in turn and reviews changes in the
KPIs and the achievements of the expected outputs that are related to each objective.
Achievements of the First Development Objective
The first development objective was to improve efficiency through the reform of governance and
management of the higher education system. The three KPIs linked to this first objective show a positive
trend. They were: (i) reform legislation governing higher education and rationalizing funding allocation
mechanisms; (ii) establish a National Authority for Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Education
(NQAAAE); and (iii) establish a Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF).
(a) Reform Legislation Governing Higher Education and Rationalizing Funding Allocation
    Mechanisms
 A draft of a new unified legislative framework for the Egyptian higher education system was
    developed during the early stages of project implementation and continuously refined but was never
    approved in its entirety in the public debates organized for concerned stakeholders to consider its
    endorsement as a comprehensive framework for change; the community resisted introducing such
    major changes. The Ministry decided to pursue implementation of many of its features in an ad-hoc
    manner until consensus is reached to accept such changes in the Egyptian higher education system.
    Extensive efforts have been exerted since project inception to establish the legislation for a new
    unified law for the Egyptian higher education system. However, the final version of this law is
    pending the consideration and endorsement of the education committees of both the Shoura Council
    and the Peoples' Assembly (the Parliament). Passing this unified law, ultimately through the
    Parliament, is highly political and largely influenced by community/ stakeholders responses, and it is
    difficult to speculate when such comprehensive framework for reform will be endorsed. Accordingly,
    it is difficult to specify the percentage achievement, although many of its features have already been
    implemented successfully and/or in the process.
 Among the initiatives considered by the project to help improve the governance and efficiency is the
    development of proposals to help diversify sources of funding. A model has been developed
    consisting of three main parts: (i) student costs; (ii) budgeting procedures; and (iii) funding formula.
    The work on the student cost component of the model has already uncovered that on average only
    35% of the higher education resources are directly allocated to support student learning while the
    other 65% goes to overhead. This is the mainly the result of the duplication of functions and
    administrative staff overstaffing.
(b) Establish a National Authority for Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Education
    (NAQAAE)
 The NAQAAE was established by a Presidential Decree #82 in June 2006 and bylaws prepared and
    endorsed by Shura Council and People's Assembly in December 2006. It has been established as a
    result of the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project (QAAP). QAAP also advanced the
    NAQAAE goals and bylaws. Now, the NAQAAE has the autonomy and established a performance

                                                                                                         72
    standard and a benchmarking system for both the education and the higher education. NAQAAE is
    now in the initial stages of planning its activities. It was expected to begin implementing its mandate
    in September 2008.
 QAAP introduced the Developmental Engagement (DE) exercise, an initiative that was not initially
    planned but has evolved during the life of QAAP, provided an opportunity for the Egyptian higher
    education institutions with the opportunity to test and develop, in cooperation with the QAAP, the
    effectiveness of the institution's quality assurance systems to meet the requirements for accreditation,
    the robustness of the evidence base and reports that they generate in those systems. Development
    Engagement took place during the transition period to offer the academic institutions with the
    opportunity to evaluate their quality assurance systems and their programs with a view to identify the
    strengths and areas of further improvement. The benefits of the DE to the institution include offering
    the academic institutions with: (i) opportunities to test, develop, and refine internal review processes;
    (ii) receiving external structured comments and the written review report identifying points of
    strength and areas require further improvement, which should offer an agenda for future improvement.
    All of these may assist further with the institution's arrangements to enhance the programs and
    disseminate good practice. At the end of December 2008, QAAP conducted 120 DE visits and all
    visited faculties received their evaluation reports.
 The development of 10 National Academic Reference Standards (NARS) has been completed for the
    following sectors: nursing, agriculture, engineering, veterinary medicine, basic science, pharmacy,
    home economics, medicine, arts and physical education.
 The QAAP project assisted the Egyptian universities to develop their strategic plans for quality. To
    date, fourteen universities have completed their strategic plans and subsequently evaluated by QAAP
    peer reviewers and two external international experts, while Kafr El-Sheikh University is in the
    process of preparing their strategic plan. Another two universities (Benha and Beni-Suef) are still in
    the process of preparing proposals to engage in the exercise.
 QAAP has offered workshops and seminars in different fields such as: peer and chair reviewing, role
    of facilitators, writing syllabi, student assessment, developing NARS and selected topics related to
    QAAP projects: preparing self-study, writing annual reports and preparing action plans. These
    workshops and seminars helped in building the qualified calibers needed to apply and review the
    quality assurance systems in the Egyptian universities. To date, the QAAP team is assisting in the
    implementation of the activities of QAAP2 and CIQAP projects as well as the NAQAAE.
 The QAAP project helped in establishing 16 Quality Assurance Centers QACs in the Egyptian
    universities as well as 150 quality assurance units in the faculties. QAAP also periodically visited and
    provided the technical support these quality centers and units. QAAP also supported the establishing
    of an internal quality assurance system in the faculties of education in cooperation with FOEP.
 Five sub-projects were established, including the one to establish Quality Assurance Centers QACs,
    to set the QA infrastructure necessary to prepare universities & faculties for accreditation by
    developing a handbook containing guidelines, procedures and mechanisms, used to implement these
    projects. Achievements of each sub-project are posted on the project website and well exceeded the
    targeted objectives.
(c) Establish a Higher Education Enhancement Fund (HEEPF)
 The main objective of the HEEPF project is to enhance quality, relevance, and efficiency of the
    higher education through establishing a sustainable competitive mechanism among Egyptian
    universities and Technical Colleges. This is done through funding of competitive projects from higher
    education institutions. Competitive grant funds have been utilized to improve competitiveness among
    faculty and help enhance quality in the following domains: management practices, academic
    programs, curriculum/course/ program development, capacity building, information technology, new
    teaching methods, and entrepreneurship among faculty. All public universities (17 public universities,
    5 Technical colleges, and MOHE) have benefited from this grant.

     HEEPF has been instrumental in engaging the academic community in a wide range of development
     projects and has reached all the public institutions in the academic community (90 faculties in 17
     public universities, 5 Technical colleges, and MOHE). About 8.4% of the under-graduate students
     benefited directly from HEEPF projects (121,722). While 6.2% of the under-graduate students

                                                                                                        74
   benefited indirectly from HEEPF projects. There are other beneficiaries from HEEPF projects such
   as: alumni, post-graduate students, university leaders, staff members, and technicians.
   HEEPF has also created the capacity and expertise in the universities to execute investment projects.
   HEEPF followed a systematic and transparent procedure to evaluate the proposals submitted by the
   educational institutions. Each proposal has been technically and financially evaluated by three or may
   be four experts. The technically qualified proposals must have at least 60% of the technical evaluation
   score (66 points out of 110) and the financial qualified proposals must have at least 50% of the
   financial score (20 points out of 40). The technical evaluation criteria includes: Academic excellence,
   technical quality, relevance to Egypt, sustainability and commitment, collaboration and focus on
   multidiscipline work, and innovation and originality. The following flow chart illustrates the
   evaluation process of the HEEPF proposals.




                       The Evaluation Process of the HEEPF Proposals

   HEEPF established a strong monitoring and evaluation system that is used to track the progress and
   evaluate the impact of all funded projects. This process involves a team comprised of internal and
   external evaluators and site visits. Formal site visit reports showing the technical performance of the
   funded projects along with recommendations for better achievements were prepared and sent to the
   project directors. HEEPF used specific defined and declared reference criteria for technical evaluation.
   These criteria includes:
    The achievements of the targeted project objectives and the achievements of the project success
       indicators specified in the project proposal.
    The achievements of the targeted project deliverables with the targeted quality.
    Following the project time schedule.
    The efficiency of the applying the project activities.
    The effectiveness of the project internal management system.
    Project quality control procedures.
    The effectiveness of the dissemination procedures for the project outputs.
    The project sustainability procedures in order to sustain the project achievements.
    The suitability of the project location.

   The level of interest that HEEPF has generated in the academic community is obvious and evident
   from the consistent increase in the number of proposals submitted to HEEPF in the four cycles.
   HEEPF has delivered a series of capacity building workshops in different fields. Specifically, 10
                           Evaluation of the HEEPF Funded projects
   project management workshops attended by 789 staff members on effective proposal writing and
   effective management of HEEPF projects, 6 financial training workshops attended by 260 staff
   members and accountants on effective financial management and preparation of financial reports, and
   2 specialized attended by 64 staff members on e-learning and new learning methodologies.
   HEEPF embarked initiatives to strengthen the link between all funded projects in the higher education,
   regardless of their sources of funding. The process is intended to forester integration and
   collaboration vertically (inside one institution) and horizontally along regional, sectoral, disciplinary
   dimensions and is seen as a vehicle for eliminating duplication, sharing resources and experiences,
   increase the number of beneficiaries, strengthening the ties and exchange of benefits among projects,
   integrating training and disseminating activities, building a stronger critical mass of activities, and
   building up bridges of interaction and attempting to achieve sustainability.
   HEEPF held a mid-term conference at Al-Azhar University in March 2007 for better dissemination of
   the projects' outputs and outcomes to the whole academic community including Al-Azhar University.
   In that regard, new publications were distributed during the conference, which include: Evaluation of
   Phase I and Future Prospects; HEEPF performance Appraisal by Egyptian Universities; HEEPF
   Specialized Booklet Series (9 parts in Arabic); Summaries of the HEEPF Funded Projects (in Arabic
   and English) and HEEPF Brochures (1 in Arabic and 2 in English).
   HEEPF established an IT system including: a comprehensive website www.heepf.com.eg (English
   and Arabic), an accounting system, Database system, and electronic documentation system (Jupiter).
   HEEPF compiled all project publications in one library (online DB of 1666 items representing a
   variety of topics related to: Basic Sciences, Engineering, Information & Technology, Medicine,
   Dentistry & Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine, Agriculture and Education) as shown in the Figure
   below.
   HEEPF has developed a well articulated database available on the website to make all the information
   related to the projects implemented accessible to all universities and concerned stakeholders for wider
   dissemination of successful models for potential replication.

Achievements of the Second Development Objective
    The second development objective was to improve the quality and relevance of university education.
The two KPIs linked to this second objective show a positive trend. They were: (i) establish an integrated
information and Communication technologies infrastructure; and (ii) provide training for faculty and staff.
(a) Establish an Integrated Information and Communications Technologies Infra-structure (ICTP)
 The Information and Communications Technology Project (ICTP) includes 5 sub- components at a
    wide level, as well as activities at the university level to address quality and efficiency related issues.
    The overall aim of this component is to being the global revolution in knowledge creation and sharing
    into the teaching and learning process in the Egyptian universities. Sub-components include: Network
    Infrastructure, Management Information System, (MIS), e-learning, Digital Libraries, and ICT
    training.

    The Network Infrastructure is organized along three tracks: (i) Egyptian University Network
    (EUN); (ii) EUN Central data Center; and (iii) Individual University Networks.
    Egyptian University Network (EUN):
     Fiber optic network is established between the universities and research institutes in MPLS cloud.
       The bandwidth of the traffic between the universities is 34 Mbps. The Internet bandwidth for the
       universities is increased from 55 Mbps to 310 Mbps.
     Videoconference and streaming network is installed in all universities in addition to EUN.

    EUN Central data Center:
      The establishment of the data center in the Egyptian Universities Network (EUN) is completed.
      Now, EUN can be considered as a reliable content delivery network that satisfies universities'
      needs in terms of bandwidth and maintains the quality of value added services as well as the
      linkage between the Egyptian Universities and the outside world.

    Individual University Networks:
        The internal information network of all the 17 public universities have been completed through
        improving the connectivity between the faculties and the universities' information center,
        increasing the network nodes, and enhancing the security and management systems. Now all the
        Egyptian universities are connected with a unified fiber optic network. Additional 310 Mbps
        (Two STM-1) Internet Bandwidth is allocated to all universities.
     The intra-network of the public universities has been enhanced by improving the links between
        the faculties and the university's information center, increasing the network nodes, and enhancing
        the security and management systems.


                                                                                                            77
       The universities started the tendering process of the second stage of the infrastructure
       enhancement projects, which are funded by MCIT as a part of the cooperation protocol between
       MOHE and MCIT. The objective of this stage is to upgrade the faculties' information networks to
       serve the MIS and D-Library applications. The tenders will be issued after transferring the
       required budget from MCIT to MOHE and expected to be finished by March 31, 2009.

   Management Information System (MIS) is organized along two tracks: (i) SCU-level MIS &
   Decision Support System (DSS); and (ii) University level MIS.
   SCU-Level MIS/DSS:
    ICTP completed building MIS/DSS in the Supreme Council of Universities (SCU).
    ICTP established for the SCU several online regular statistical reports to reflect on system
      performance and utilization, as well as making this data available to the public to monitor ICT
      related performance on the institutional level as well as at the SCU diverse activities. This is an
      ongoing activity that will continue the development and fine-tuning of the reporting system.
    SCTC is not yet fully functional and annual reporting will be initiated during the second phase of
      reform benefiting from the developments made under the SCU reporting system. However, over
      70% of the work developed for the SCU can be used to develop the reporting system of the SCTC
      with some customization to suit the needs of this sector of technical education.
    In January 2008 a one-year contract was signed with a consulting company to develop MIS/DSS
      applications for the SCU, the project scope include 22 applications and 5 DSS models. The
      consulting company developed over 70% of these applications. The rest of applications will be
      developed during 2009 and SCU will bear its cost. The implementation of the completed
      applications already started within SCU departments.

   University-Level MIS:
    The construction of MIS centers in 14 public universities (82%) has been completed.
    A contact has been signed with a consulting company in March 2007 to develop MIS for 3
      applications: student affairs, post graduate studies, and academic staff affairs for 200 faculties
      within two years. The developments of these applications were completed and the deployment
      started in December 2008. Now the applications are applied in 185 faculties in 14 universities.
      The deployment is progressively elaborated and will continue during 2009. According to contract
      of the Universities MIS projects, the cost of the deployment will be sponsored by the universities
      during 2009.

   E-Learning.
    The National e-Learning Center (NeLC) has been established in the SCU and subsidiary e-
      learning production centers (UeLC) have been established in all universities. The e-learning
      centers in the Egyptian universities have been equipped by 20 PCs and infra-structure network
      and the technical staff members of the UeLCs in the Egyptian universities have been recruited
      and trained.
    NeLC produced templates for the instructional design system and developed the web application
      that automates these templates.
    NeLC developed some e-learning tools such as e-course generator, virtual lab repository, learning
      style system, and NeLC portal.
    NeLC trained 600 staff members on "e-content" training program by Microsoft.
    More than 95 e-courses are developed by the UeLC staff under NeLC's supervision. These
      courses are hosted on servers inside EUN data center and delivered through MOODLE Learning
      Management System (LMS). Also more than 30 e-courses are under production in the UeLCs.
    During the first semester of 2008/2009 academic year, 33 e-courses are delivered to the students.
      More than 15,000 active users are currently accessing these e-courses.

                                                                                                      78
   Digital Library for academic community is organized along two tracks: (i) Digital library
   subscriptions; and (ii) Integrated Library System (ILS).
   Digital library subscriptions:
    ICTP established the Egyptian universities libraries consortium including all the public Egyptian
       universities and some foreign and private universities in Egypt.
    ICTP co-finance four projects in the consortium including: establishing a digital library for the
       Egyptian universities libraries, automating universities libraries, building a national database for
       theses and dissertations, and developing a library management system.
    The digital library now includes 16 international databases and 10 free web resources that serve
       most of the Egyptian scholars academic needs. All these resources are made available through the
       Egyptian Universities Library Portal (http://www.eul.edu.eg).
    Through the Egyptian Universities Libraries Consortium, contracts were signed with 3 major
       providers of online academic and research content and journals: ELSERVIER (Science Direct),
       OVID, and EBESCO offering full access. In 2008, additional electronic resources are subscribed
       by the Egyptian Universities Libraries Consortium including Springer database, which cover
       more than 1600 full text journals and 3500 electronic books, and Proquest digital dissertation
       database, which cover more than 2.6 millions international thesis and dissertations. Also, starting
       from January 2009, new resources are subscribed such as Wiley-Blackwell journals (more than
       1216 Full text Journal), Springer e-books (Books published in 2006, 2008, and 2009), ISI data
       base (more than 23,000 Journals and journal citation Report), Gale academic one file database.
       Now, the total available electronic resources reached 81,200 (11,400 full text journals, 37,000
       abstract journals, 32,000 industry standards, and 800 e-books) covering most subjects. These
       subscriptions yielded substantial opportunities for academic, research, and efficiency gains. The
       number of searches and downloads reached 2,873,456 and 3,843,796 until December 31, 2008.
    The project also tends to provide a document delivery service for the Egyptian scholar
       community through an international document repository.
    ICTP is now funding 15 universities to allow their libraries to input book indexes based on a
       unified Egyptian Catalogue. The automation of 5 out of those 15 libraries (33%) is completed
       with the required hardware (PCs, Printers, and Bar Code reader). the data entry of the
       Bibliographic data of the libraries holding (more than 2,210,000 records are entered) is completed.

   Integrated Library System (ILS):
       A union catalog database of the universities holdings contains the data of 60 libraries in 15
       universities. Now more than 2,220,000 records are indexed and stored in the system. Also, the
       bibliographic data of more than 200,000 theses are stored in the database of theses and
       dissertations. The Future Library management system is used in the management of these data.
       This system is currently installed in servers inside EUN data center.
    The development process finished about 85% of the main required modules which include
       cataloging, circulation, OAPC, inventory, serial control, reports and statistics. The system also
       provides an authentication methods allows the Egyptian scholars to use the digital library
       resources off campus.
    ICTP funding the process of building a national database for theses and dissertation and technical
       support through the Egyptian universities libraries consortium. More than 200,000 records have
       been entered representing more than 50% of the library holdings.
   ICT Training
    ICT training is fully coordinated with the HEEP Faculty Leadership and Development Project
       (FLDP).



                                                                                                       79
         ICTP established Central Unit for IT Training (CUIT) in early 2006 as a new unit in the Supreme
         Council of Universities to be responsible for the empowerment of the IT training in the 17
         government universities.
     The CUIT unit established ICT training centers in all the Egyptian universities. Each ICT center
         was equipped with a training lab consists of 20 PCs, UPS, Printer, and LAN. In the first two years,
         CUIT trained more than 22,000 trainees from staff members, teaching assistance and employees
         on the most essential IT programs. Through the last three years, the training was executed in three
         main levels: Basic, advanced, and professional.
     The target was to train at least 10,000 trainees from all the Egyptian universities. To date, ICTP
         provided training for more than 22,000 trainees from all Egyptian universities which exceed the
         targeted number by far.
     The project also signed an agreement with the Egyptian Education Initiative (EEI) for 6,000
         trainees to receive basic training and 4,000 trainees to receive advanced training in cooperation
         with Microsoft.
     The development of the electronic test center is completed and deployed
         (www.scutraining.edu.eg). This application allows online testing for the trainees inside the
         universities and is hosted on servers in EUN data center.
     Sustainability plan for the universities training centers is proposed and sent to the universities.
         This plans depends on converting the universities ICT training centers into units with a private
         nature and the central training unit in the SCU will accredit these centers, the training materials,
         and the trainers and also maintain the electronic test center and issue the training certificates
         against fee (10 LE for each certificate is suggested).
     ICT training is planned also to replace the ICDL training which is very good step toward
         sustainability.
     ICTP also conducted "e-learning" and "digital library" training courses for 2,000 staff members
         in cooperation with the Egyptian Education Initiative and also conducted "digital library" training
         courses for students in the faculties of education and "specialized digital library" training courses
         for EUL librarians.
(b) Provide Training for Faculty and Staff (FLDP)
 This component supports capacity of academics and administrative staff. Its specific objectives focus
    on professional development initiatives to (i) consolidate the professional and institutional
    competencies of the human resources in the Egyptian HEIs; (ii) strengthen the competencies of the
    academic staff and technical assistance in the HEIs; (iii) reinforce the capacity of the universities and
    enable them to take over the responsibility of training and development for their staff; (iv) promoting
    and supporting institutional continuous self-development in the HEIs; (v) upgrading the
    administrative and leadership capabilities in the HEIs; (vi) improving the quality of the higher
    education outcome to cope with the challenges of globalization, information age, the labor market,
    and the professional conduct of the education profession; and (vii) monitor and evaluate the quality
    and impact of training.
 FLDP established training centers in all the Egyptian universities (17 universities), 3 of which have
    been internationally certified according to the standards of namely: Alexandria, Tanta, and Zagazig.
 FLDP also established the National Center for Faculty Leadership and Development (NCFLD) that is
    internationally recognized by the International Board of Certified Trainers (IBCT) that organizes the
    certification of trainers and HRD professionals in USA and Europe since 1988. The goal of the
    NCFLD is to develop qualified, credible, and certified trainers for trainers; develop standardized
    training materials; and address the needs for top management training. The long term goals of the
    NCFLD extended to the delivery of training services to the business community and continuing
    education to professionals and to North Africa and other Middle East countries.
 FLDP also purchased the license and the training package from the International Board of Certified
    Trainers (IBCT) that certifies the delivery of training and to undertake the training of trainers for the

                                                                                                          80
    FLDP. The IBCT agreement entitles that the NCFLD to certify up to 1000 Egyptian and 1000
    international trainers. The IBCT certificate is valid for three years two weeklong face-to-face training
    modules lead to the certification training program which is 3 months long.
    The Board of PMU and the minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research has been approved
    the future role of the National Centre for Faculty and Leadership Development (NCFLD) to
    concentrate on training of trainers and certification programs as well as the Top Management
    programs and continue its support of university FLDP centers by providing them with certified trainer
    of trainers' program and workshop materials for a selected set of courses. On the other hand the
    universities will be responsible for conducting the training programs delivered by the NCFLD
    certified Trainers or e-training according to the facilities available.
    FLDP conducted a total of 42 TOT-preparatory workshops, 10 TOT-Supplementary workshops,
    and 4 Certified Trainers workshops. Now, a total of 764 individuals have completed the TOT-
    preparatory workshop, 143 individuals have completed the TOT-Supplementary workshop, and
    40 have completed the certification program which is being delivered by the European representative
    of IBCT in Cairo. Besides, the NCFLD has conducted 6 training workshops on special topics and
    training programs of the NCFLD matrix. 177 participants have been trained on the 16 training
    programs. In addition to this, the NCFLD has conducted 1 special supplementary training program
    for 15 participants.
    FLDP publically announces the certification programs to encourage potential candidates to apply.
    Transparent criteria are used for screening according to International Standards and contracts are
    signed with those who are chosen for the certificate training program to ensure that the time and
    resources invested in their training is not wasted.
    At start FLDP prepared 29 training courses in 6 different competencies for the academic leaders, staff
    members and administrators. Then FLDP revised the training programs as well as the training
    materials. The list of training programs was reduced from 29 to 16. The selection of these courses was
    based on input from the SCU and from trainers and faculty trainees in 6 different universities. These
    26 programs cluster 4 competencies: Teaching, Scientific Research, Management & Leadership, and
    Group Communication & Interaction. The training material for the 16 selected topics was revised and
    developed to conform to the IBCT standards.
    At the university level, the FLDP centers in the Egyptian universities conducted 9,552 training
    programs attended by 223,573 staff members and 80,775 administrative staff. Moreover, 1,404
    training programs were conducted in the field of management. Also 91,627 staff members have been
    trained on Management & Leadership and Group Communication & Interaction.
Achievements of the Third Development Objective
    The final development objective was to improve the quality and relevance of mid-level technical
education. The eight KPIs linked to this third objective show a positive trend. They were: (i) reform of the
ETC's governance framework; (ii) refurbishing of the ETC's physical facilities; (iii) upgrading of the
ETC's laboratories and workshops; (iv) capacity building of ETC faculty and support staff; (v)
development of the ETC's educational programs, curricula and learning resources; (vi) development of
ETC information and communication technology network; (vii) development of effective links to the
productive sectors and labor markets; and (viii) development of quality assurance and accreditation for
the ETC's.

    This component supports extensive restructuring and comprehensive overhaul of teaching content and
practices for the mid-level technical institutes in order to improve the quality and relevance of teaching in
these institutes.
(a) Reform of the ETC's Governance Framework
 Consolidation of the 45 MTIs into 8 TCs has been achieved. This is expected to improve the quality
    of teaching in the TCs as a result of more consolidated management and greater efficiencies.

                                                                                                          81
    The 8 Egyptian Technical colleges (ETCs) and a new Supreme Council for the Technical Colleges
    (SCTC) were established by ministerial decrees #528 and #2089 in 2003. The SCTC is headed by the
    Minster of Higher Education. 8 Directors and 16 Deputy Directors for the 8 ETCs were appointed
    after a rigorous and transparent selection process that involved their performance in a leadership
    training workshops supported by the project.
 A ministerial decree # 2087 was signed in November 2003 for the establishment of the Board of
    Trustees (BOTs) and the Technical Colleges Councils (TCCs). The BOTs terms of reference were
    developed and disseminated. The transfer of decision-making responsibilities from MOHE to the
    ETCs through their BOTs is a major reform breakthrough for higher education and for middle level
    technical education in particular.
 Considerable progress was made in decentralizing the governance of the TCs and shifting the
    responsibility for the policy development and strategic decision-making in the ETCs from the MOHE
    to the Boards of Trustees (BOTs) of the Technical Colleges, since the release of the new bylaw by the
    Ministerial Decree #2655 in October, 2006. The bylaw provides better representation of the
    employers and their associations on the BOTs, provides the legal framework for the eight ETCs and
    defines the rules and regulations concerning: (a) the role, mandate and composition of the BOTs, (b)
    roles, responsibilities and remuneration of teachers, academic managers and staff, (c) academic
    structures and programs, and (d) rules and regulations governing student issue
 As a consequence of BOT efforts, a new department was initiated in the Hotel and Tourism Institute
    of Mataria TC. This new department came through the cooperation of the ETCP, the BOT of Mataria
    TC, the management of the TC and a private chain of fast food restaurants in the form of a 5-year
    contract. The contract includes paid internship periods linking the training to the market need and it is
    anticipated that graduates who will have their training certified by the chamber of Commerce will be
    employed in the fast food business. Success of the program motivated its extension to be
    implemented in Alexandria TC in 2008. On the other hand, the BOT of the Mataria TC signed a
    twinning agreement with the Technical University of Berlin TUB and the first project will be
    twinning of the Institutes for Optics. TUB will provide the technical support and assistance for
    establishing a new Excellence Institute for optics.
 The existing reform program for technical colleges has been progressing positively. Measures to grant
    greater autonomy, setting up of Board of Trustees, transferring budget resources, hiring managers
    based on competitive process, developing standards and new curricula and textbooks are all reforms
    in the right direction. The challenge will be to continue the momentum, involve the private sector to a
    much greater extent to move to more demand-driven approaches, increase the incentives and
    financing mechanisms so that Technical Colleges will continue to improve their performance.
 In March, 2008; major changes have been taken in place in the management of the ETCs as a result of
    a decision taken by the ETCP National Committee not to renew the appointment of the eight ETC
    directors at the end of the three year term, and hire replacements through a careful selection process.
    Seven new ETC directors were appointed, and the former Director of ETC Alexandria was
    reappointed on probation for one year. BOTs were also reformed in September 2008.
 The role of BOTs in the technical education is a new concept in Egypt. Therefore, their ability to
    affect a measurable change in the policies and strategies directions of the ETCs remains not
    noticeable across the sector.
(b) Refurbishing of the ETCs physical Facilities
 Considerable progress has been made in the general refurbishing of the ETCs physical facilities in
    Damietta and Zagazig (Mahalla TC), and Quena (South Valley TC). Constructions for Quena will be
    handed over very soon. Refurbishing of institutions in Alexandria (Alexandria TC), Beni Suef and
    Sohag (Middle valley TC) that are funded by the MOHE has been completed and handed over.
    Progress has been made in the refurbishment of all the targeted number of computer labs, internet labs
    and language labs.



                                                                                                          82
    A GIS Database for the physical facilities of the ETCs was developed using the ARCGIS and
    ARCVIEW 2 software. The Database contains details of the architecture drawings, photographs and
    technical specifications on 90% of the institutions in the system.
 Refurbishing of the Technical Institute in Shoubra (Mataria TC) stopped in April 2008 due to
    contractor's fault. The HEEP Executive Director formed a committee with representatives of ETCP,
    HEEP-PIU, and the MOHE, which after careful investigation of the facts, decided to terminate the
    contract with the contractor, and award it to another contractor. Legal actions against the contractor
    have been taken by the PMU. The completion of the construction works will be completed in a later
    stage and will be financed by MOHE from the local fund.
(c) Upgrading of the ETC's Laboratories and Workshops
 The status of upgrading the ETC laboratories in December, 2008 involving the procurement,
    acquisition, installation, testing and commissioning of equipment in the laboratories in the three pilot
    ETCs is as follows:



                                                 Number of
            % of Total         Value in LE                                   Package and Status

                                                                 will be made in Fiscal 2009 by MOHE
                100             51,011,915            116        Total

    The previous Table indicates that the process of procurement, installation, testing, and commissioning
    of equipments in the laboratories and workshops of the ETCs has been successfully accomplished as
    87.2% of the packages have been installed and tested. The rest of the procurements will be completed
    in a later stage and will be financed by MOHE from the local fund.
(d) Capacity Building of ETC Faculty and Support Staff
 In order to increase the capacity of the TCs management and staff, 17 candidates travelled in June
    2008 to USA to start 2- month language training and join one academic-year training in community
    colleges through Fulbright commission (2008-2009). A mission from USA visited in the 3 pilot TCs
    in Egypt during March 2008 to put the training program in its final and realistic form in collaboration
    with ETCP.
 In order to raise the capacity of the TCs' management and administrative staff, 341 senior
    management staff received leadership training and 661 administrative staff received management
    skills training. As for the teaching staff, 2053 teaching staff had ICDL, English, and specialized
    training, 339 newly appointed teachers had educational training and 126 technicians had special
    training to be lab technicians.
 The ETCP working with MOHE has hired 116 teachers in 2006, 316 teachers in 2007, and 103 in
    2008 for a total of 535 new teachers (this number exceeds the approved targeted number 500 new
    teachers). Unfortunately, 59 teachers of them found other employment opportunities leaving the net
    number of new teachers at 476. The majority of the new hires are either university graduates in
    science, engineering and commerce or graduates of the Industrial Education Colleges IEC. Two of
    these colleges were established through a World Bank project in the mid 1990s. The hiring of the new
    teachers has resulted in the average student teacher ratio dropping down to 40:1 in the industrial MTIs
    and 98:1 in the commercial MTIs compared to previous ratios of 118:1 and 305:1 respectively.
 A number of training of trainers initiatives have taken place to provide training opportunities for the
    new teachers:




                                                                                                         83
      1. Training of Trainers (TOT) program offered by the FLDP, which designed, and delivered a one
           week (36 hours) " effective training" workshop to 230 new teachers, and a program in the
           management and administration of the ETCs for senior administrators..
      2. The Federation of Egyptian Industries FEI provided specialized TOT program in industrial
           automation at its centre in Amirya for 57 instructors from the ETC of Sahafa in Cairo. The FEI
           has given preliminary approval to provide training for 500 additional teachers from the whole
           system over the coming 4 years
      A contract has been signed in June 2008 with the Industrial Education College in Kuba, Helwan
      University, for continuous practical training of MTIs teaching staff.
(e)   Development of the ETC's Educational Programs, Curricula and Learning Resources
      In order to link ETC program standards to the occupational standards being developed under the
      National Skills Standards Program NSSP, a project managed by the Social Fund for Development
      SFD; the course outlines, syllabi, and associated books for 36 programs containing 592 courses in the
      commercial, industrial, civil, architect, hotel management and tourism, and social services
      specializations were developed. Moreover, the quality of and relevance of the courses outlines and
      syllabi have been revised by curricular review committees to review the integrity of the programs,
      ensure that redundancies and duplications are reduced to a minimum, review the compliance with the
      prevailing standards and the emerging quality assurance guidelines in the QAAP project.
(f)   Development of the ETC Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Network
      The 8 ETCs are now connected to the internet through commercial service providers. The quality of
      the connection varies by the location of the college and the available bandwidth that commercial
      providers in the region can support.
      Linking of six locations covering 12 institutes in 5 TCs to the Egyptian University Network EUN has
      been approved and the connection is expected to be completed in June 2009.
      MIS systems are installed, tested, commissioned and handed over in 4 institutes belonging to Mataria
      TC. The system is also installed in 2 institutes of Mahalla TC and will be installed soon in 4 institutes
      belonging to the South Valley TC. Handing over the MIS in these 6 MTIs is expected to be completed
      in June 2009. The MIS includes databases for student records, teachers and staff as well as physical
      resources.
      Three Computer Networks CISCO labs in the ETCs of Mataria, Quesna and Sahafa have been
      procured and shall be installed in June 2009.
(g)   Development of Effective Links to the Productive Sectors and Labor Markets
      Progress has been made in some of the ETCs in developing effective links to the productive sectors
      and the labor markets including: (a) the agreement between the Fast Food Services Americana and the
      Mataria TC to support the Fast Food Services program, (b) the agreement between the Social Fund
      for Development SFD and Mataria TC to support the small enterprise management programs, (c) the
      agreement between the Mehalla TC and the Association of Small Garment Manufacturers to support a
      related program in the TC , (d) the agreement between the Ministry of Culture and the South Valley
      TC to support the program for the restoration of monuments, and (e) the agreement between Mataria
      TC BOT and Olympic Group for training students of refrigeration and air conditioning branch during
      summer.
(h)   Development of Quality Assurance and Accreditation for the ETCs
      ETCP established 10 QA units in the 3 pilot TCs and 7 of their institutions.
      ETCP in coordination with QAAP has organized and delivered 20 workshops, training programs, and
      monitoring site visits providing overview of quality assurance and accreditation principles in the
      higher education and their application to ETCs, and train ETCs staff on the preparation of the
      institutional reports using QAAP templates.
      The QA units produced the first Annual Reports in a satisfactory form in November 2008.
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


                                                                                                            84
Overall Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Overall Outcome Rating is put as "Highly Satisfactory" for the following reasons:
    First, although the developmental objectives of the project were ambitious and all the challenges
    faced by the project, it succeeded focused and achieved more than its specified developmental
    objectives.
    Second, despite all the challenges, the HEEP project participated to the adoption of the "Higher
    Education Reform Agenda 100-2007", by assisting in the development of several Ministerial decrees
    governing the Egyptian Higher Education system such as: the Act #528/2003 governing the
    management of the technical colleges and the Act #290l2004 concerning the education development
    fund; (ii) the establishment of the National Authority for Quality Assurance and Accreditation for
    Education NAQAAE with the presidential decree #82/2006; and (iii) the development of the new
    legislative framework for higher education which is expected to be presented to the Shura Councils
    and education committee of the People's Assembly (the parliament) soon.
    Third, through its support for Higher Education Reform Agenda, the project has helped create a more
    robust higher education sector and assisted in the adoption of the higher education policies that call
    for strategic planning for the Egyptian Higher Education by establishing a Strategic Planning Unit
    (SPU) responsible for planning ahead to develop a road map for the Egyptian Higher Education,
    forecast for higher education based on scientific methodology, and develop Project Appraisal
    Documents PAD according to the international norms.
    Fourth, the project has made substantial achievement in institutional strengthening and capacity
    building of academics and administrative staff at universities. The stakeholders' feedback in the ICR
    workshop indicated that the main achievements of the FLDP project is: (i) providing the Egyptian
    universities with the qualified certified trained, (ii) changing the attitudes of the staff members
    towards training, (iii) establishing the FLDP centers at all universities, (iv) spreading the culture of
    training among staff members, and (v) improving the efficiency of staff members and teaching
    assistance.
    Fifth, the HEEP project supported the application of the quality assurance systems in the Egyptian
    universities though the QAAP project under component one which led to: (i) establishing quality
    assurance infra-structure within the Egyptian public universities, (ii) helped in building the qualified
    calibers needed to apply and review the quality assurance systems, (iii) developed 10 National
    Academic Reference Standards (NARS) in different fields, and (iv) providing the academic
    institutions with opportunities to test, develop, and refine their internal quality assurance system. The
    second phase of the Higher Education Enhancement Project HEEP2 will support the Continuous
    Improvement and Qualifying for Accreditation (CIAQP) for the Egyptian Academic Institutions.
    Sixth, the project supported competitive grant funds under (HEEPF) component one to improve
    competitiveness among faculty and
    Seventh, the ICTP project led to: (i) upgrade the network infra structure for both EUN and Egyptian
    Universities, (ii) establishing a MIS/DSS for the SCU and MIS for 3 applications for 200 faculties,
    (iii) established the National e-Learning Center (NeLC) in the SCU and subsidiary e-learning centers
    in the Egyptian universities responsible for producing the e-courses, and (iv) providing the staff
    members and researchers with electronic journals, books, and databases. This project will continue to
    provide its services under the SCU.
    Eighth, The Board of PMU and the minister has been approved the future role of the National Centre
    for Faculty and Leadership Development (NCFLD) established through the FLDP to concentrate on
    training of trainers and certification programs as well as the Top Management programs and continue
    its support of university FLDP centers by providing them with certified trainer of trainers' program
    and workshop materials for a selected set of courses. On the other hand the universities will be
    responsible for conducting the training programs or e-training according to the facilities available.


                                                                                                          85
    Ninth, the ETCP project will continue in the second phase of the HEEP project. The objectives of the
    next phase is: (i) continue the reform of the ETC's governance framework, (ii) motivating the top
    management and administrators in the ETC's and upgrading their technical and administrative
    capabilities, (iii) continue upgrading learning resources in the ETC's, (iv) generating private revenues
    from business community, and (v) twinning the ETC's with international community colleges .
    Tenth, the stakeholders' feedback in the ICR workshop indicated that investments in universities
    though the competitive sub-projects have led mainly to: (i) creating a culture of competitiveness with
    team work spirit, (ii) creating a credible, transparent, and competitive atmosphere that helps in the
    development of higher education institutions and in fulfilling their needs (departments/
    faculties/universities). It became a comprehensive model (self-assessment, M&E, IA) that can be
    implemented/replicated worldwide. Now, some Egyptian Universities allocated funds for competitive
    projects based on HEEPF mechanism (replication & sustainability), and (iii) enhancing the quality in
    various fields such as: management, academic programs, capacity building, information technology,
    new teaching methods, and entrepreneurship among faculty. Furthermore, HEEPF has created the
    capacity and expertise in the universities to execute investment projects.
    Eleventh, the stakeholders' feedback in the ICR workshop indicated that the ICTP project participated
    mainly to: (i) developing of the IT infrastructure, (ii) developing of the MIS for both SCU and
    universities, which will lead to effective decision making, and (iii) establishing of e-courses.
    Twelfth, the project has helped the Ministry of Higher Education to define its future reform program
    in higher education and create a more conductive environment for planning and development of the
    Egyptian Higher Education system.
    Finally, the HEEP Impact Assessment study revealed that both the staff members and the students
    agreed that HEEP project led to a significant improvement for the learning environment in the
    Egyptian universities.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
Monitoring and evaluation was built into the project based on Key Performance Indicators KPIs.
However, there were no records for the initial baseline measurements. Also, the evolution of the project
KPIs was not taken into consideration in the WB mission aide memories.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Supervision by the bank was timely, frequent and technically sound. However, the frequent changes in the
Bank supervision team during the course of implementing the project led to the unfamiliarity of the newly
appointed members that took them some time to become familiar with the project design and its progress.
Bank reporting of the project performance, of the development outcomes and of the implementation
outputs and progress was comprehensive and provided directions for future implementation. However, as
already mentioned the WB aide memories described the status of the project performance but it did not
report the evolution of the project relative to the originally designed KPIs. Moreover, although the
Projects Management Unit (PMU) issued quarterly performance reports based on the data collected from
the sub-projects, little attention was paid to use these reports to assess the impact of the quality of project
performance.
Procurement the challenge of procurement thrown up by this project was to ensure that the Projects
Management Unit PMU correctly carried out competitive biddings centrally. This task was completed
satisfactorily for 261 bidding packages with a total amount of US$ 26.2 Million.

                                                                                                            86
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
The overall Bank performance is rated as "Satisfactory". The project design was relevant to the Egyptian
Government and was adapted to the policy context. The development objectives and outcomes were well
aligned with the higher education system. The project suffered from some of the implementation
difficulties due to the unfamiliarity of the higher education sector with these projects. However, these
difficulties were generic and overcome by the Bank and the Projects Management Unit. Adequate
attention was paid to the Implementation Status Reports ISRs and aide memories, although greater effort
should have been paid to the use of the monitoring and evaluation of the project reports.
4.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The government's ownership and commitment was demonstrated when establishing a high-level steering
committee and the Projects Management Unit (PMU) to provide support to the governmental Higher
Education Institutes (HEIs) to implement the first phase of the Higher Education Enhancement Project
(HEEP). The PMU closely monitored project inputs, outputs, and outcomes during the life of the project,
and evaluated over the HEEP lifecycle.
The Ministry of Higher Education MOHE highly supported sustainability of the outputs and the outcomes
achieved by the HEEP project by issuing all the necessary ministerial decrees that supports the
implementation of the project Such as the establishment of the National Authority for Quality Assurance
and Accreditation (NAQAAE) as well as the establishment of the National Center for Faculty and
Leadership Development. (NCFLD).
The MoHE also supported the initiatives considered by the project to help improve the governance and
efficiency is the development of proposals to help diversify sources of funding. A model has been
developed consisting of three main parts: (i) student costs; (ii) budgeting procedures; and (iii) funding
formula.
Although, extensive efforts have been exerted since project inception to establish the legislation for a new
unified law for the Egyptian higher education system, the final version of this law is pending the
consideration and endorsement of the education committees of both the Shoura Council and the Peoples'
Assembly (the Parliament). Passing this unified law, ultimately through the Parliament, is highly political
and largely influenced by community/ stakeholders responses, and it is difficult to speculate when such
comprehensive framework for reform will be endorsed.
There were some delays in the availability of the counterpart local funds but these have been resolved by
establishing a unit for local fund in the PMU.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) through its Projects Management Unit (PMU) was
responsible for the HEEP project. They were clearly engaged and committed to the developmental
objectives of the project. They provided all the necessary support to implement the first phase of the
Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP). The PMU closely monitored project inputs, outputs, and
outcomes during the life of the project, and evaluated over the HEEP lifecycle.
Internal communications and coordination between the MOHE and the PMU was strong. Also, the
minister was fully engaged and informed with the progress and achievements of the HEEP projects. He
also headed some of the meetings of the Board of Directors of the Projects Management Units.



                                                                                                         87
Consequently, full coordination and support was achieved and all diffculties have been solved throughout
the project lifecycle.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating for the Borrower performance is "Satisfactory" for the reasons given above. Both the
government and the Projects Management Unit remained focused and committed to the original project
objectives throughout the project lifecycle. Also, all project results and outputs were achieved and the
project built capacity at the Projects Management Units that will be responsible for the implementation of
the second phase of the project HEEP2.

5. Lessons Learned

Policy related lessons: the following policy related lessons can be drawn from this project:
   1. To ensure support and success of the Higher Education Reform, commitment of the main
      stakeholders needs to be in place at all levels:
        The Egyptian government
        The Ministry of Higher Education
        The Supreme Council of Universities (SCU)
        The directors of the HEEP projects.
        Presidents of Universities and their Vice Presidents
        Deans and Deputy Deans of Faculties/institutes
        Heads of Departments and Units/Centers, etc.
        Project Managers of the HEEP funded projects.
   Everyone has a fundamental role to play in his own capacity and responsibilities to ensure success of
the reform.
   2. Establishing a Strategic Planning Unit (SPU/MOHE) was mandate to:
        Plan ahead to develop the Road Map for Higher Education based on real data generated from
        diverse studies
        Forecast for Higher Education system based on past, current, and future data to better plan based
        on scientific methodology
   3. It is mandatory that the Egyptian universities to develop their Strategic plans on both the
      University/Institution and the Faculty/Department levels
        Strategic Planning on the University/Institution level
        Comprehensive strategic plan that includes plans for QA and Accreditation, as well as for
        Capacity building and training
        Establish an action plan identifying priority areas
        Periodic revisiting of the strategic plan to meet continued and changing needs

        Strategic Planning on the Faculty/Department level
        For Accreditation requirements
        To improve efficiency of the system
Process and Capacity Issues: the following lessons can be drawn from this project:


                                                                                                       88
1. The continuity in the staff responsible for project oversight, management and implementation is a
   major contribution to project success.
2. Establishing the Projects Management Units provided support to the governmental Higher
   Educational Institutes to implement the Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) and create
   the capacity required to conduct the second phase of higher education reform. This includes
   institutional capacity for financial management and procurement.
3. The first phase of HEEP project focused on a top-down approach for the following reasons:
    Universities were not ready to accept or deal with the change
    To create the critical mass to affect change
    To create the environment and culture for accepting the change
    Creating a competitive mechanism to encourage participation
    While, the second phase of will focus on a bottom-up approach for the following reasons:
    To emphasize more institutional autonomy
    To create a state of ownership of the reform according to institutional needs
    Building capacity to cope with this approach that depends primarily on taking initiatives to fulfill
    the needs
4. HEEPF created a credible, transparent, and competitive atmosphere in the Egyptian higher
   education institutions.
5. HEEPF became a comprehensive model that can help the development of higher education
   institutions, on both faculty/university levels, to promote and support the priority areas and to
   fulfill their actual/real needs. Some Egyptian public universities allocated funds for competitive
   projects based on HEEPF mechanism.
6. HEEPF model can also be implemented/ replicated worldwide.
7. The FLDP project passed through two phases. The first phase of the FLDP project focused on
   consolidating the concept of Long Life Learning culture within universities. It established a
   Faculty and Leadership Development Center in all the Egyptian public universities. It also
   produced a competency and Skills Matrix needed for capacity building of human resources in
   Egyptian universities at all levels and developed the training Materials based on the competency
   and skills matrix. In order to encourage the academic staff members to attend the training courses,
   FLDP linked the fulfillment of training attendance/requirements with Promotion. The second
   phase of the FLDP focused on quality training. It established the National Center for Faculty and
   Leaders Development (NCFLD) authorized by an International Certifying body IBCT
   (International Board of Certified Trainers) in the USA to offer International Certification locally
   and on the regional level. It also worked on certifying the FLDP centers in the Egyptian
   universities in accordance with the IBCT standards (3 FLDP centers have been certified till now).
   It also provided the Egyptian universities with certified trainers in accordance with the IBCT
   standards to provide training courses.
8. The ICTP project focused on: (1) Reinforcing the backbone network infrastructure for the
   Egyptian Higher Education system, (2) Establishing Management Information and Decision
   Support Systems at the Supreme Council of Universities (SCU) and Egyptian Public Universities
   (EU), (3) Introducing new teaching and learning methods such as e-learning and establishing the
   National e-Learning Center (NeLC) as a coordinating body among universities e-Learning centers,
   (4) Providing Digital Library and electronic resources to all academic staff and researchers to
   enhance the chances for creating better quality researchers and research, and (5) Upgrading the
   capabilities of the academic and administrative staff in Egyptian universities and scientific
   research institutions for using Information Technology.

                                                                                                     89
   9. Extensive Awareness at all projects levels is mandatory to attract faculty to participate
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) : the following lessons can be drawn from this project:
   1. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities within the capacity of the borrower are essential.
      Also, the continuing Bank support and technical assistance was beneficial to the project.
   2. A well designated results M&E framework coupled with a monitoring and evaluation system
      should remain simple and focus attention on outputs and outcomes, thus avoiding being swamped
      by administrative issues that tend to dominate whenever implementation is delayed. However, the
      outcomes and impact of many interventions in education are often only apparent sometime after
      the closure of the project.
   3. Measurement of the project outcomes and impact on the academic community is a challenge
      especially in large reforms. On large projects that support large reforms, it is difficult to isolate the
      contribution of the project from other factors.
   4. Establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation system for HEEP was essential to:
        Developing a sustainable monitoring and evaluation system that focuses on outcomes rather than
        outputs Better control and follow-up the implementation to assure compliance of HEEP Projects
        with their indicators of success
        Designing a unified reporting system for HEEP
        Strengthening the M & E and reporting system as well as World Bank requirements for
        certification of UPMUs
        Establishing analysis reports based on the comparative evaluation to recommend areas of
        emphasize and future directives
   5. It is mandatory develop a sustainable impact assessment system, including tools which can be
      easily used, modified and/or institutionalized as a routine procedure to suite different
      educational/academic environments
   6. It is mandatory to develop baseline data at the startup of the project in order to be able to assess
      the impact of HEEP Sub-projects on improving the higher education system in Egypt and
      providing information about the actual fulfillment of the program objectives
   Sustainability: the following sustainability related lessons can be drawn from this project:
   7. Among the key issues for sustainability of the reform programs is the establishment of three
      Centers/Units as part of the organization structure of each university:
        Quality Assurance and Accreditation Center (QAPAC)
        Faculty and Leadership Development Center (FLDC)
        University Projects Management Unit (UPMU)
