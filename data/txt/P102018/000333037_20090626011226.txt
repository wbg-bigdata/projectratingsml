OperationType          First Development Policy Loan (DPL-1) prepared as crisis response
                       operation as part of an international support package.

MainPolicy Areas       Public financial management, social sectors, and financial sector.

ProgramDevelopment     Inthe context of the international financial crisis, the objective of the
Objective(s) and       proposed operation i s to support the Government's reforms in fiscal
Contribution to CAS    management, social protection and the financial sector. Specifically, these
                       reforms aim to (i)strengthen public expenditure management which has
                       been a key weakness that contributed to the buildup of Romania's
                       vulnerability to the financial crisis; (ii)cushion the impact of the crisis on
                       the poor and vulnerable; and (iii)     minimize risks of a domestic financial
                       sector crisis by addressing current and potential vulnerabilities as well as
                       strengthening regulation and supervision for a more resilient and well
                       functioning financial sector in longer-term. The ultimate objective i s to
                       support the Government's efforts to emerge from the crisis on a stronger
                       footing, so as to be able to resume and sustain high growth and
                       convergence to the living standards of other more advanced EU
                       economies. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) being presented to
                       the Board with this operation focuses on three pillars: i)economic growth
                       and competitiveness; ii)public sector reform; iii)social cohesiveness. The
                       focus of this DPL series on public financial management, the social sectors
                       and the financial sector i s fully aligned with all three of these pillars.

Risksand Risk    The proposed DPL series is a relatively highrisk operation. Romania has
Mitigation       been hit hard by the global economic crisis. The large fiscal deficit that
                 Romania had going into the crisis increases the need for adjustment at a
                 time when the severity of the economic downturn increasesthe difficulties
                 inachieving such anadjustment. The IMF's parallel programrests heavily
                 on strong macroeconomic policy adjustments combined with large external
                 financial support to stabilize the economy and support external debt
                 rollover/debt service without excessive pressures on the exchange rate that
                 could further weaken the banking sector.

                 There are economic risks that could prove the macroeconomic
                 assumptions underpinning the overall IF1program to be overly optimistic.
                 There are also political risks-particularly      in light of the coalition
                 government-which      could result in policy slippages. In turn, these policy
                 slippages could undermine market confidence and increase balance of
                 payments pressures.

                 A key risk affecting the proposed operation is the uncertainty of the global
                 economic outlook. There i s a possibility that international financial
                 markets will remain frozen and that the global economic downturn,
                 particularly in the EU, will be more severe and protracted than currently
                 projected. Lower debt rollover rates or larger capital outflows would affect
                 the domestic banking sector directly. A more protracted downturn would
                 affect the Romanian economy and could also have serious implications for
                 the domestic banking sector through increased corporate and household
                 debt distress.

                          This risk is partially mitigated by the size of the multilateral support
                          package, which offers a small cushion in terms of a build-up of reserves
                          under the program to deal with a worse-than-expected case scenario of
                          capital outflows. The content of the program also mitigates risks. In the
                          banking sector, the Fundprogram includes in-depth examinations of banks
                          and recapitalization requirements inthe event of capital shortfalls, as well
                          as the strengthening of regulatory and supervisory powers. Under the
                          proposed DPL, these measures are fiuther reinforced through additional
                          contingency planning reforms including the preparation of a strategic
                          action plan to deal with potential interventions in the banking sector and
                          establishment of a framework to facilitate debt restructuring. Finally, the
                          fiscal reforms envisaged under the overall program will help to reduce the
                          fiscal pressures both in the short run and over the medium term and
                          contribute to loweringthe external financing needs.

 1.     This document describes a program supported by a Development Policy
Loan @PL) for "Public Financial Management, Social Protection and Financial
 Sector Strengthening" to Romania for a total of 1 billion. The proposed DPL
program i s a part o f an international crisis response support package o f 19.95 billion,
primarily involving the IMF and the European Commission. The IMF i s extending
12.95 billon and the EC 5 billion, and about 1 billion in incremental lending i s
 expected from the EBRD, EIB and IFC.

2.      This operation is being proposed as the first of a series of three single-
tranche programmatic loans totaling 1 billion. The first DPL is for 300, and the
second and third DPLs would be 360 million and 340 million respectively. The
proposed D P L program supports the Government's structural reforms in three key areas:
a) improving fiscal sustainability and public financial management (cross-sectoral
reforms and reforms in two key sectors-health          and education); b) enhancing social
protection systems-social    assistance and pensions-to     address the immediate needs o f
the poor and vulnerable but also to ensure more effective social protection over the longer
term; and c) strengthening the contingency planning and resilience o f the financial sector.
Inthe fiscal and financial sector areas, which are also being coveredby the IMF and the
EC programs, the proposed Bank operation reinforces and complements the measures
envisaged under these respective programs.


3.      The proposed DPL series is central to the Bank's proposed engagement in
Romania, as discussed in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) being presented to the Board with this operation focuses on
three pillars: i)economic growth and competitiveness; ii)public sector reform; iii)social
and spatial cohesion. The focus o f this DPL series on public financial management, the
social sectors and the financial sector is fully aligned with all three o f these pillars.

GrowingMacro Imbalances and Buildup of Vulnerability

4.      The Romanian economy experienced an economic boom during 2003-08,
associated with the process of accession to the EU. Growth averaged over 6.5 percent
per year during that period, reaching over 7 percent in 2008. A large part o f the domestic
absorption boom was driven by private investment: with EU accession prospects secure,
capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment, were attracted by perceptions o f
lower investment risk that triggered a re-assessment o f Romania as a favorable
investment location. Sharp increases in asset prices and rising collateral values added a
self-reinforcing momentum to the absorptionboom.

5.         The strong economic growth was accompanied by widening current account
imbalances (Figure 1). Although exports to the EU countries grew at a robust pace,
domestic demand grew at an even faster rate, and the current account deficit rose from
just over 5.0 percent o f GDP in2003 to 12.4percent o f GDP in2008.



6.         At the same time, in the past two to three years, the composition of the
capital inflows moved increasingly towards private debt flows (Figure 2)-in                                         large
part the result o f borrowing by banks, often by subsidiaries o f foreign banks from their
parent banks but also as a result o f direct borrowing by corporates.

7.         The domestic overheating and external imbalance were exacerbated by the
fiscal policy stance. Fiscal policy in Romania has traditionally tended to be highly pro-
cyclical with fiscal management lacking in medium term orientation (Figure 3).
Following efforts o f fiscal consolidation during 2003-05 that led to a narrowing o f the
fiscal deficit to 0.8 percent o f GDP in2005, the fiscal deficit widened again progressively
to reach 4.9 percent in2008 (while the structural fiscal deficit increased from 0.7 percent
o f GDP in 2005 to 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2008) as a result o f excessive public spending
policies. Government spending doubled between 2005 and 2008 pushingthe public sector
share o f economic activity from 31 percent o f GDP to 37 percent o f GDP. The public
sector wage bill more than doubled over these three years due to high wage increases
(Figure 4), combined with a huge increase in government employment In the final
months o f 2008, further expenditure hikes in the run up to the elections left a legacy o f
precarious financing o f the deficit.

8.         The overheating and large capital inflows complicated monetary policy.
Monetary policy was relatively tight-with                the National Bank o f Romania (NBR)
increasing reserve requirements and interest rates in an attempt to dampen inflationary
pressures. In addition, a number o f measures were undertaken to contain credit
expansion, especially in foreign currency lending. Between 2004 and 2008, policy
interest rates were raised, as were minimumreserve requirements (to 18 percent on local
currency liabilities and 40 percent on foreign currency liabilities); measures were taken to
limit household debt exposures, especially with regard to mortgage debt; prudential
regulations were strengthened to limit lending to unhedged borrowers o f foreign
exchange, and restrictions on household debt service ceilings were tightened. These
measures contributed to the subsequent deceleration in household credit growth, but
pressure from an expansionary fiscal policy and capital inflows caused the NBR to miss
its inflation target in 2007 and 2008. At the same time, the interest rate differential
between domestic and international rates and the restrictions on credit growth mentioned
above, may have served to further encourage direct external borrowing and short term
capital inflows. Inparticular, large firms began to borrow directly abroad as reflected in
an increase indirect borrowing by firms from the equivalent of 4 percent (on a net basis)
o f GDP in2005 to nearly 11percent o f GDP in2007.

9.         Romania's financial system-which              i s dominated by commercial banks-
played an integral part in the domestic overheating. Between 2003 and 2007, total
financial system assets more than doubled from about 36 percent to 74 percent o f GDP
(with the banking sector accounting for 83 percent o f total assets). At the end o f 2007,
foreign-owned banks (mostly subsidiaries) accounted for 88 percent o f total banking
sector assets. Growth inreal private sector credit rose fi-om 23 percent per year in2003 to
over to 60 percent in 2007 before slowing slightly to 54 percent in 2008. Much o f banks'
lending was directed towards households. Between 2003 and 2007, claims on households
rose fi-om 12 to 28 percent of total banking sector assets (19.5 percent o f GDP in mid-


                                                      3

2008), while claims on companies declined from 37 to around 30 percent o f banks'
assets.


10.     The proportion of banks' lending funded from non-deposit sources-
particularly foreign borrowing-rose          progressively. While deposits grew relatively
steadily, lending significantly outpaced the growth in deposits with the loan to deposit
ratio increasing by over 43 percent during 2003-2008 to reach 130 percent at end 2008.
The large resort o f banks to external financing o f lending i s reflected in the rise in net
foreign liabilities o fbanks from the equivalent of -2 percent o f GDP in 2003 to around 18
percent at end 2008.


11,     The indebtedness of households and corporates also grew rapidly, with much
of the borrowing denominated in foreign currency. Total borrowing by the corporate
sector grew at an annualized rate o f 44 percent between 2004 to midJune 2008 entailing
a near doubling o f indebtedness to 28 percent o f GDP. Although the proportion o f foreign
currency (FX) borrowing declined slightly over the period, it was still over 70 percent in
2008. While household disposable income grew at an average annual rate o f 20 percent,
household debt increased at a rate o f 77 percent, with FX denominated borrowing rising
even more rapidly; by mid-2008, the share o f FX borrowing intotal householdborrowing
had risen to 56 percent (from 45 percent in2005).


12.     In sum, the Romanian economy had become vulnerable to liquidity and
foreign exchange risks by the time the global financial crisis unfolded. The current
economic crisis being faced by Romania has therefore both domestic (inparticular due to
the path o f fiscal policy inrecent years) -as  well as external origins.


Impact of Crisis

13.     The economy has been hit hard by the global economic downturn. Economic
activity declined sharply in the last quarter of 2008 and has fallen further in early 2009.
Real GDP growth shifted from an average o f 9 percent (quarter on quarter annualized)
during the first three quarters o f 2008 to a 13 percent decline in the fourth quarter. The
decline was driven primarily by a drop in domestic demand. Export growth also slowed.
With imports dropping even more sharply, the correction in the current account deficit
began towards the end o f last year. For the first quarter o f 2009, early indicators
(confidence, industrial production, retail sales and tax revenues) all point to a continued
sharp drop inGDP.

14.     Asset and financial markets have been severely affected by the effects of the
global crisis and economic downturn. The stock market has lost 65 percent o f its value
since the peak in August 2008. The inter-bank market was disrupted in October 2008 by
rumors of liquidity problems at a commercial bank, leading to a spiking o f rates; these
rates remained relatively high thereafter due to lingering concerns about counterparty



                                               4

risk, high risk aversion, and market segmentation due to an uneven distribution o f assets
(T-bills) eligible for discount with the NBR. Balance o f payment pressures drove a 15
percent depreciation o f the RON against the Euro from October 2008, putting pressures
on household, corporate and bank balance sheets. To dampen currency volatility, the
central bank intervened inthe spot market, losing some 4% billion inreserves since end-
October 2008. Despite the depreciation, financial conditions tightened significantly on
increased sovereign credit default swap premium and monetary policy tightening.
Romania's international credit rating was cut in late 2008 (to below investment grade in
the case o f Fitch) by a larger margin than those o f other countries inthe region, reflecting
market concerns about the sustainability o f Romania's large current account deficit,
uncertainties surrounding the outlook for fiscal and incomes policies, and the financial
health o f banks with subsidiaries or branches in Romania. This has translated into
significantly higher external borrowing costs for Romanianbanks and corporates.


15.     As conditions in the financial markets have worsened, the financing of the
fiscal deficit has been increasingly concentrated at very short maturities. This has
exposed the government to roll-over and funding risks in the current environment o f de-
leveragingalthough the situation as improved somewhat inthe most recent months.



16.     Romania's deteriorating macro-financial environment has created risks for
financial stability. Over the last few months, liquidity risk has become substantial in
view o f the difficulties in parent banks and the downgrading o f Romania by major
international ratings agencies in late 2008 leading to a decline in the capital account
flows. A sharp contraction or reversal o f inflows could threaten macroeconomic and
financial stability through a drying up o f credit to the private sector, resulting in an even
sharper slump in economic activity and larger increases in loan defaults. In addition, a
reversal o f capital inflows would put additional downward pressures on the exchange
rate. While banks' direct exposures to foreign exchange risk reflected in their net open
positions are low, as noted above, many households and businesses are exposed to
unhedged foreign exchange risks. Banks, therefore, have substantial indirect foreign
exchange risk exposures, inthe form o f credit risk.



17.     The rapid deterioration in economic conditions and depreciation of the RON
will place strains on bank capital positions. The banking system entered the crisis well
capitalized and with high liquidity buffers. However, stress testing analysis suggests that
some banks may be at risk o f becoming undercapitalized as the downturn continues. Thus
a strengthening o f capital positions i s warranted and it will be important for parents o f
foreign owned banks to maintain lines of credit to their subsidiaries and borrowers in
Romania. In addition, banks will need to be proactive in enhancing loan quality by
developing and implementing effective debt restructuring or workout procedures for
household and corporate clients.

         B. MACROECONOMICOUTLOOKAND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

18.     The economy is expected to contract by about 4 percent in 2009 (Table 1).
Domestic demand will contract as foreign direct investment and capital inflows, which
previously helped finance high consumption and investment growth, will drop sharply.
With no fiscal space and tight financing conditions, an easing o f fiscal policy to cushion
the downturn will not be possible.

19.     The deterioratingeconomic prospects havepromptedthe governmentto seek
multilateralsupport, includingthe IMF, the EC and the World Bank. The Fund's
program o f support seeks to i)strengthen fiscal policy further to reduce the government's
financing needs and improve long term fiscal sustainability; ii)maintain adequate
capitalization o f banks and liquidity indomestic financial markets; iii)sustainably reduce
inflation; and iv) secure external financing and improve confidence.


20.     The government has already initiated substantial measures to address the
fiscal deficit. The 2009 approved budget contains important spending cuts and revenue
increases yielding around 3 percent o f GDP in total. These measures include i)an
increase o f 3.3 percentage points in social contributions; ii)higher property taxes due to
an overdue increase in appraisals; iii)removal of a reduced VAT rate for the purchase of
a first house; iv) significant cuts in the public wage bill by reducing bonuses and other
benefits and by eliminating 137,000 vacancies (previously used to grant higher
allowances to existing staff); and v) substantial cuts in spending on goods and services as
well as subsidies. It i s estimated that the fiscal measures already approved in the budget
would reduce the fiscal deficit to about 5.2 percent o f GDP (without these measures the
fiscal deficit for 2009 would have been on the order o f 8-9 percent o f GDP); and the
structural deficit would fall by about 1.7 percent o f GDP.


21.     Under the Fund's program,the fiscal deficit is expectedto further narrow to
4.6 percentof GDPin2009 from4.9 percentof GDPin2008. Fiscal measures yielding
an additional 1.1 percent o f GDP are to be implemented in 2009 as prior actions for the
IMFprogram, concentratingon expenditure reductions. The fiscal deficit for 2009 is thus
expected to be 0.3 percentage points lower than 2008, at 4.6 percent of GDP. In order to
safeguard the targets, spending plans will be backloaded and their execution will be
conditional on revenue performance. The structural fiscal deficit would decline by nearly
3 percentage points o f GDP (from 6.7 percent to 3.8 percent o f GDP). The authorities
envisage additional adjustment efforts in 2010 to bring the deficit down to around 3.7
percent in that year, and to bring it to well below 3 percent o f GDP in 2011 to meet the
Maastricht deficit criterion.


22.     The current accountdeficit is projectedto decline from 12.5 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2009 and further to 6.5 percent in 2010. This adjustment
process i s expected to be driven primarilyby a sharp import decline arising from the drop
indomestic demand and the depreciation inthe real exchange rate.

23.     The balance in the capital and financial account is expected to fall from a
surplus of 18.8 billion in 2008 to a 2.7 billion deficit in 2009. Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) i s expected to decline considerably in 2009, and trade credit contracts
will fall inline with import compression, consistent with developments inrecent months.
The capital and financial account i s projected to reach a 3.8 billion surplus in 2010, on
the back o f a slight recovery inFDIand reduced capital outflows.

  24.     Over the medium term, a gradual economic recovery is projected. Once
  confidence is restored and balance sheets readjust, domestic demand is expected to
  slowly rebound (Table 1). Output is projected to follow a U-shaped adjustment pattern,
  and positive growth should resume by the second quarter o f 2010. However, as noted
  growth would remain near zero in 2010, before recovering to 5 percent in 2011. After
  contracting sharply in 2009, the current account i s projected to adjust slowly over the
  mediumterm, supported by strong export growth and a recovery inworkers' remittances.

  25.     The outlook is, however, subject to exceptional uncertainties and risks. The
  recovery depends on global events and on restoring consumer and investor confidence. In
  the near term, output could be further compressed through balance-sheet effects arising
  from a further RON depreciation and higher-than-expected inflation, especially if capital
  outflows are larger than anticipated. Almost 55 percent o f banks' loans are in foreign
  currency-a    large portion o f which are extended to households and corporates whose
  earnings are in RON-thereby        exposing banks in Romania to significant indirect
  currency mismatch. The macroeconomic outlook would also clearly be affected by a
  further worsening o f global growth prospects.


  26.     Romania faces considerable balance of payments financing needs over the
  next 24 months. (Table 2) Based on the projected current account deficit and stock o f
  short term and maturing medium and long-term debt, Romania's gross financing needs
  would amount to 44 billion in 2009. The average rollover rates assumed for amortizing
  debt in2009 is around 90 percent for banks and 70 percent for corporates. These average
% rollover rates assume a full rollover for foreign banks' exposure to Romania once the
  Fund program takes effect from May 2009 and a rollover rate o f 50 percent throughout
  2009 for Romanian banks. For corporate external debt to their parents, the assumption i s
  a rollover rate o f 50 percent throughout 2009. Under these assumptions o f average
  rollover rates o f around 90 percent for banks and 70 percent for corporates in 2009, a
  financing gap o f approximately 11% billion would emerge. For 2010 and the first
  quarter o f 2011, the Fund's macro framework assumes that a strong adjustment program
  will reduce the financing gap to about 85billion, bringingtotal financing gap under the
  program to just under 20 billion, as the current account i s expected to continue to adjust
  and rollover rates and FDIto improve due to higher confidence in economic policies and
  the expected incipient recovery in the world economy. The financing gap for 2010
  includes a build up in gross international reserves o f about 3 billion, increasing reserves
  coverage to about 100 percent o f short-term external debt at end-2010 from about 75
  percent at end-March 2009, significantly reducing external vulnerabilities.

                       111. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

29.     The new government, which came into power in December 2008, is seeking to
narrow fiscal imbalances and to improve fiscal credibility and sustainability over
the medium term by putting in place mechanisms to ensure better public financial
management and fiscal transparency. The government is also seeking to protect the
poor and vulnerable from the impact of the financial crisis, to minimize risks of a
domestic financial sector crisis and to strengthen the regulation and supervision for
a more resilient and well functioning sector in the longer-run. The government's
ultimate objective is to emerge from the crisis on a stronger footing to resume and
sustain high growth and convergence to the living standards of other more
advanced EUeconomies.


                 A. IMPROVINGPUBLICFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

30.     As noted above, weakness in controlling public expenditures has been one of
the main causes of large fiscal deficits in the past. A key element in the government's
reform agenda therefore i s improving public financial management-in                particular,
strengthening the medium term expenditure framework, and improving the public sector
pay system.

31.     Under the IMF program, the authorities have proposed a series of key fiscal
reforms to contain key expenditure pressures and improve the budgeting process.
An important component o f these reforms will be the approval o f a Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL) that should allow the government to strengthen the budget process and ensure
fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Key features o f the FRL include i)a
framework for improved multiyear budgeting; ii)limits on intra-year budget revisions;
iii)fiscalrulesonexpenditures,publicdebtandtheprimarydeficit;iv)thecreationofan
independent fiscal council; and v) a framework for managing guarantees and other
contingent liabilities. The passing o f the fiscal responsibility legislation is an IMF
structural benchmark. The public financial management/MTEF                  reform measures
supported under the proposed DPL program build on this fiscal responsibility law. The
IMF program also includes two structural benchmarks that are in the areas that the
Bank's proposed DPL also covers. These are the passage of revised public compensation
legislation and the passage o f revised pension legislation. The revised public
compensation legislation envisages the establishment o f a unified, simplified pay scale
and reform o f the current system o f bonuses (including a ceiling o f under 30 percent on
the share o f all non-wage personnel expenditures as a share o f total compensation to be
phased in over three years and the consolidation o f monetary bonuses-eliminating          the
large majority o f bonuses or rolling them into the base salary). The Fund program
envisages that further attributes o f this public pay legislation will be coordinated with the
reform measures supported by the Bank's proposed DPL program. Similarly, with regard
to the pension legislation, the Fund program envisages that the reform o f the key
parameters o f the pension system will be done in coordination with the Bank through the
proposed D P L program (see paragraph 91 and Table 4 below).

Strengtheningthe MediumTermExpenditureFramework

32.      Although Romania currently prepares a form of medium term expenditure
projections, these have little impact in linking planning and budgeting. The annual
budget i s changed frequently during the year to accommodate new measures-a
reflection o f poor planning and weak commitment to budget discipline.             Personnel
expenditures inparticular, have grown rapidly and the agreements to increase wages have
often been in excess o f the approved budget levels.           Consequently, there are wide
differences between the original approved budget and the actual spending at year-end,
and strategic planning efforts o f the line ministries are so far not bounded by any resource
parameters. Medium-term projections have been done in the past by the MoPF with
limitedpolitical buy-inand weak analytical underpinnings.

33.      Measures are needednot only to restore aggregatebudget discipline,but also
to improvethe effectivenessand efficiency of public expenditure. Ad hoc reductions
in spending during the year impede ministries' ability to plan and manage effectively.
Capital investment projects also suffer from weak programming o f funds across the
years, resulting in project delays and increased cost. Though efforts have begun to
develop strategic plans for all line ministries, the process i s detached from the budget
planning and so ministries have little incentive to prioritize within their policy area.
Performance based budgeting may be a useful tool in the long-term, but greater stability
inbudget fundingand stronger policy analysis will beimportant prerequisites.


34.      The reform measures on public financial management (PFM) to be
supported by the DPL aim at improvingthe quality of annual budget planning by
rooting it more firmly in a credible medium term expenditure framework. The
MTEFprocess would be strengthened so that it guides the strategic planningprocesses o f
the line ministries and encourages prioritization o f expenditures within credible resource
envelopes, especially for public investment. While the substantive changes in the culture
o f budgeting inRomania will take time to take root, the reform measures in the proposed
operation are intended to set in motion a process that could enhance the aggregate fiscal
discipline on the one hand, and the strategic allocation o f resources on the other. In
setting such objectives, the Parliament has to be more firmly integrated into the process
for it to be credible.



35.      In addition to outlining the high-level aggregate trends in revenue and
expenditure, the initial reforms to the MTEF (supported under DPL1) entail
specification of the broad composition of expenditure and the policy choices they
represent-such as the trade-off between personnel costs and capital expenditure.
Where the projections represent substantial changes from the budget year or the prior
year's actual spending, the policy justification also needs to be explained. The initial
reform entails approval o f the MTEF by Government so that it can form a basis for the
budget preparation instructions to line ministries.




                                              13

36.     Further reforms aim at establishing rules that prevent ad hoc deviations
from the agreed upon framework. The primaryobjective is to use the introduction of
a new fiscal responsibility law to include a two stage process for approving the annual
budget. This i s needed in order to deepen the political commitment to the overall revenue
and expenditure limits o f the budget and to reduce the flexibility to make changes during
the implementation o f the budget. The initial vote is on the MTEF framework. Once
approved, the fiscal responsibility law would mandate that the annual budget must
respect those limits. Thus, the debate within Parliament on the annual budget law would
focus on the composition o f spending (and perhaps its effectiveness) rather than the level
o f aggregate spending. A special provision will also be needed to specify that duringthe
budget year, new measures may not be introduced if they violate the aggregate
expenditure limits or the limit set specifically on personnel costs. This i s essential to
assure that the annual budget execution i s not destabilized by ad hoc agreements with
unions on wage increases. Any decisions to increase pay levels need to be explicitly
accounted for when the budget i s first approved by the Parliament and may not be
introduced through budget rectifications duringthe year.



37.     Building on the first two reform measures, the MTEF will be further
strengthened to set in motion a process by which the Government signals to major
ministries the funding levels they should expect over the medium term and places
responsibilityonthemfor outlininghow their publicinvestmentprogramfits within
those parameters. This would not necessarily mean ceilings for every institution, but
would include ceilings for the biggest policy areas covered by the budget (e.g., education,
transport, public security, health). By having this indicative funding information, the
following years' strategic planning documents should be obliged to prioritize activities
and scale the policy agenda accordingly.



38.     The MTEF will also be one of several instruments to encourage the
Government to frame its public investment program within a multi-year funding
window. For capital projects especially, the MTEF should provide the critical structure
through which to program funding amounts for specific projects to be completed within a
specific time frame. Once allocations for capital are agreed through the MTEF, then an
annex to the annual budget law should list which specific projects are to be funded during
the three years, and by how much each year until completion. The imperative is to put in
place a series o f steps through which ministries can be assured o f getting the funding
needed to complete projects, but also encouraged to drop projects for which funds cannot
realistically be expected over a medium term horizon.


39.     Including fiscal scenarios in the MTEF is intended to encourage a priori
agreement by the government and the Parliament on the budget priorities in the
case of an unexpected increase or decrease in revenues. This could help stem the
tendency for ad hoc increases and decreases in budgets that occur during the year, by
planning for some level o f fluctuation to occur. One policy choice government may



                                            14

consider is to target unexpected surplus revenues toward deficit reduction or toward
completion o f pre-designated capital projects.



Improving the PublicSector Pay System

40.     Personnel costs consume a large and rapidly growing component of the
Romanian budget. Aggregate spending on personnel cost increased by 58 percent from
2005 to 2007, while GDP only grew by 42 percent duringthe same period. Despite these
increases in expenditure, the effectiveness o f the public administration has not improved
significantly. The government has relied each year on broad-based salary adjustments
negotiated with public sector unions. However, the fundamental character or structure o f
the pay system has changed little, and it i s out-of-sync with the need to motivate
performance amongpublic sector employees and attract new talent.

41.     Romania's public sector pay system is at variance with those in the rest of
Europe in several ways: (1) Non-wage compensation represents a disproportionate share
o f total compensation, which undermines transparency and equity; (2) there are wide
                                                                         .
disparities in pay between positions with similar responsibility; (3) incentives to take on
new responsibilities are undermined by a compressed salary scale and over-reliance on
seniority; and (4) compensation decisions are not based on reliable information on private
sector comparators.   In addition, there are widespread reports o f substantial political
interference in the staffing for senior positions, and abuse in the use o f bonuses.
Therefore, the independence o f the civil service has been under attack, and principles o f
merit-basedrecruitment have been weakened.


42.     Since early 2009 the government has taken some initial steps towards reform.
The government has approved a salary ordinance to reduce non-wage compensation.
There have also been plans to develop a unitary pay law, which aims to integrate under
one statute the pay ranges for all public sector workers. The specific characteristics o f
the pay law have not been worked out yet. The National Agency for the Civil Service i s
also proposing new rules that would increase their influence inrecruitment decisions, and
thereby enhance their ability to assure merit is used.


43.     The reform program supported by the proposed DPL envisions changes to
the pay system that would enhance capacity to attract and retain critical skills in the
public administration. Enhancingtransparency o f the public sector pay system would be
one element o f the strategy as would more accurate benchmarking o f pay to the
appropriate labor market. Functional reviews o f the public administration would help
identify budget resources that could be released for better targeting o f pay rewards.


44.     The reform measures are intended to encourage reform of the pay system to
be better aligned with European practices and to enable the public sector to more
effectively recruit and motivate high-skilled workers. The civil servants are one


                                            15

component o f the broader public service, and a substantial body o f analytical work was
completed for the National Agency o f Civil Servants in 2006.               Some o f the
recommendations from that project could be used now to form the principles behind a
new public service regime. The reform measures envisaged are intended to recognize the
Government's commitment to develop a new salary ordinance on public sector pay and to
reduce the role o f non-wage compensation. Work has been underway for several weeks
on this, led by the Ministry o f Labor. Consultations are underway to assess which
allowances will be merged into base salary and which might be eliminated. The reform
measures sets specific goals for the extent o f the reform, by indicating what would be
appropriate limits on the use o f allowances.



Improving Financial Management and Provision of Services inEducation and
Health

45.    In addition, the government's reform agenda focuses on enhancing
expenditure management in two key sectors-education and health. These sectors
have seen increases in public expenditures in the past few years (spending on the
education sector rose from 5.5 percent o f GDP in2007 to 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2008 for
example) and account for a sizable proportion o f the budget, but still lag in outcomes-
both in terms o f quality and access-relative     to other EU economies. Although they
remain somewhat under-funded in terms o f expenditures to GDP relative to other EU
economies, there are inefficiencies in spending and potential for savings within the
sectors. In an environment o f overall fiscal constraint, improved fiscal management and
greater efficiency in the provision o f services can generate savings that can, in turn, be
used to broaden access to public health and education services.

Education

46.    There is scope for improving the efficiency of resource use while enhancing
the quality of, and access to, general education.

47.    The clearest evidence of poor efficiency of spending inthe education sector is
the relatively small classes in Romanian schools and the large number of teachers
relative to the number of students. The average class in Romania has 20.6 students and
has been decreasing over time. While there i s no consensus on an optimal class size, most
educators (and researchers) would agree that the same quality o f education could be
provided insignificantly larger classes. Moreover, the average class size is low compared
to many Western European countries (e.g. 22 students in Germany and France) and some
neighboring countries (e.g. 24.5 inLatvia).


48.    Largely-but      not exclusively-as     a result of small class sizes, Romania
employs a large number of teachers relative to a shrinking number of students.
According to the Ministry's report on the Status o f National Education System in 2008,
the student teacher ratio was only 16 for primary schools and 11 for lower secondary
schools in 2007/2008. By comparison, the OECD average for primary schools was 16.2


                                             16

and 13.3 in lower secondary schools (in2006). Romania's low ratio is the result o f a very
small reduction in the number o f teachers and schools in response to the decline in the
number o f students. Between 1992 and 2006, the number o f primary school students
declined by 24 percent, while the number o f teachers declined by only 4 percent.



49.       The main cause of the low class sizes and highnumber of teachers is the poor
financial incentives facing the local authorities and school principals to merge
classes and close down schools. Inparticular, the financing for education which schools
and local authorities receive i s tied to inputs-the                   most important o f which i s a teacher-
rather than being tied to the number o f students. As a result, neither the schools nor the
local authorities have any incentives to try and reduce the teacher numbers-doing so
would only involve the difficult task o f dismissing a teacher but no additional resources
to reallocate to remaining schools and teachers. In fact, a dismissed teacher (or a closed
school) implies savings to the central government but not to schools and local authorities.



50.       Improving the efficiency of resource use is particularly important in view of
the fiscal constraints on the one hand, and the need to improve the quality and
access to education on the other. Romania still lags behind most other EU countries in
terms o f completion rates and the quality o f secondary education (Figure 5). Many
disadvantaged youth (particularly Roma and poor rural residents) do not complete
secondary school, and a large number o f secondary school graduates do not attain
minimum quality standards. Improving the quality and skills o f its workforce is a key
policy priority to help the Romanian economy emerge stronger from the crisis to sustain
growth and faster convergence with other EUcountries.

51.      The reforms supported in the DPL program directly address the poor
incentives currently faced by local authorities in using resources efficiently. In
particular, it would support the introduction o f a per capita student financing formula in
eight counties (accounting for 20 percent o f the total student population). While no
triggers are envisioned for D P L l,legislation to enable per capita finance will be prepared
and submitted to Parliament by the end o f 2009. Moreover, this legislation would be
passed by June 2010 (trigger in DPL3) in time for implementing per student financing o f
all schools located in the eight counties starting with school year 2010/2011 .4 Having
money tied to students rather than teachers would provide substantially better incentives
for these counties and schools to create larger schools and classes.

52.      By creating better incentives for local authorities and schools, the reform
measures are likely to generate fiscal savings, but the new scheme would have
additional benefits. In addition, by tying resources to the number o f students, local
authorities would face better incentives to prevent student drop outs. Moreover, a well
designed formula would also provide for more horizontal equity in education services. In
particular, the formula could explicitly allow for differences in costs based on structural
features that make it more difficult to provide education in certain areas (e.g. rural,
mountainous or low density areas) or to certain groups o f the population (e.g. minority,
low income, special needs, etc).



Health Services

53.      Public expenditure on health increased from 2.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to
3.7 percent in 2007. However, Romania's health status remains poor compared with
other European countries4espite significant improvements in Romania's basic health
indicators since the 1970s. Although male and female life expectancies have increased,
and infant and maternal mortality have declined, life expectancy is 6 years shorter than
the EU average. Infant and maternal mortality are among the EU's highest. Romania also
has one of the highest levels o f cardiovascular diseases inthe EU.

54.      Health insurance and taxes are the two main sources of health financing. In
2007, the contributions to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAS) accounted for 78
percent o f total public expenditure and taxes accounted for 22 percent. Part o f alcohol
and tobacco taxes is earmarked for the M o H budget. Informal out-of-pocket payments by
the patients are considered to be widespread and significant, although there are no firm
estimates. CNAS provides universal coverage to the population and i s primarily funded
by contributions collected from employers (5.2 percent o f the payroll), employees (5.5
percent o f the wage income) as well as the self-employed (5 percent o f the income).


55.      As the purchaser of services, the CNAS is facing major challenges, which
include the following:



 A small number o f very small schools may not necessarily receive their funding according to the formula.


                                                        18

       0      The benefits package is very generous. Currently, the range o f services
              covered in the benefits package i s broad and there are very limited co-
              payment mechanisms - not even for more expensive and less essential
              interventions. As a result, providers (especially hospitals) are not
              adequately reimbursed and try to shift the costs o f drugs, medical supplies
              and food to patients who have to pay out o f pocket for items that are
              supposed to be free.


       0      Drug costs are escalating.       In 2007, drugs and medical supplies for
              outpatient care alone accounted for more than 30 percent o f CNAS
              expenditure, the second highest expenditure after hospital services. Inthis
              context, drug pricing, prescription and reimbursement policies need to be
              revisited.



       0      Efficiency of the system could be improved through better
              purchasing, and in particular improved payment methods. Overall, the
              system is skewed towards hospital care. The CNAS spends more than 46
              percent on expensive hospital care and less than 6 percent on primary care.
              Hospitalization rates are high in comparison with international standards.
              Primary care providers receive a combination o f capitation (90 percent)
              and fee-for-service (10 percent), but mechanisms to monitor their
              performance and ensure they act as gate-keepers are sub-optimal. For
              ambulatory care, the pricing policy tends to benefit hospitals' outpatient
              departments rather than stand-alone ambulatory centers. Hospitals, which
              are paid on the basis o f Diagnosis Related Group (DRG), are reportedly
              struggling with deficits as the DRG rates are generally too low to recover
              costs. The system also creates perverse incentives to perform more
              surgical procedures as their reimbursement rates are higher. Overall,
              provider payment mechanisms need to be thoroughly evaluated and
              revised to ensure that they contribute to improving technical and allocative
              efficiency inthe system.



       0      Lastly, the burden of funding the CNAS is not equitably shared. Of
              the 22 million people entitled to coverage, only 5 million actually pay a
              contribution. Clearly, not all o f the 75 percent of the population exempted
              i s poor. This issue requires a separate debate in the broader context o f the
              governments' fiscal policy, but it will also have to be addressed to ensure
              the CNAS i s sustainable.


56.    Romania also inherited a fairly large and poorly managed hospital
infrastructure. Other than the introduction o f new payment mechanisms, the progress in
hospital reform has been limited. The number o f hospitals has remained relatively
constant since the 1 9 8 0 ~with 416 hospitals in 1980 and 422 in 2003. Including short-
                            ~


                                            19

term acute care and long-term care, Romania had over 142,000 hospital beds or 6.5 beds
per 1,000 people in 2004. There are large regional variations in the bed per population
ratios, ranging from 8.5 inthe west and inBucharest to 4.1 inthe south. The bias towards
hospital care is reflected in the high number o f hospital admissions (24.3 per 1,000 in
2006). A high number o f cases are treated in hospitals while they should be handled on
an outpatient basis. There are no functional referral links between primary health care,
ambulatory system and hospitals. Low funding levels, poor management systems, poor
fiscal discipline and perverse incentives contribute to the low efficiency o f hospitals.
Many Romanian hospitals have incurred financial debts in recent years, despite a
substantial increase inhealth insurance collections and an expansion o f the health service
budget.

57.      The reform measures supported by the proposed DPL focus on mobilizing
resources and improving the efficiency and equity of service provision. Inparticular,
the proposed DPL operation addresses the factors listed above that are draining the
resources o f the CNAS and which ultimately result in inadequate and less than equitable
coverage o f the more essential health services. The measures o f the proposed DPL
program also aim to redress the balance from the costly hospital based services towards
the less costly outpatient and primary care services-as     noted above a high number o f
cases are treated in hospitals that would be more appropriately handled as outpatient
cases.



                     B. STRENGTHENINGSOCIAL PROTECTION

Social Assistance

58.      Although the poverty rate decreased dramatically from 36 percent in 2000 to
5.7 percent in 2008, Romania still had 1.2 million poor in 2008. Indeed, the poverty
rate in Romania is one o f the highest in the EU25 countries. With the economy
contracting by 4 percent in 2009, this number i s expected to increase to 7.4 percent (1.6
million people). The percentage o f children (between 0 and 14 years o f age) living in
absolute poverty is expected to increase from 7.8 in2008 to 10.7 in2009.

59.      Spending on the poor is low, and has declined over time, resulting in
inadequate coverage. Although social protection spending as a percentage o f GDP has
remained constant over recent years, two factors bear noting: (i)      the social protection
expenditure per capita i s the lowest inthe EU; (ii) spending on poverty-targetedprograms
i s low (as a percentage o f GDP, and relative to the magnitude o f poverty).

60.      At the same time, there is scope for improving some of the social assistance
(SA) schemes. Inmost programs, benefits are not linked to actions that reduce exposure
to risks, resulting in welfare-dependency and work disincentives. The Guaranteed
Minimum Income (GMI) is the only program that has a work incentive built in (benefits
increase by 15 percent if a family member works). The child raising allowance creates a
work disincentive for women by granting generous benefits (85 percent o f the salary) for
a long period o f time (2 years). The child allowance i s no longer conditional on the
schooling o f children, and the school attendance conditionality for the income-tested
family allowances i s poorly designed and not enforced. To the extent that a large number
o f children from poor families continue to drop out o f school before completing
secondary school, conditioning benefits on schooling up until the end o f secondary
school may reduce future poverty.

61.      Overall, there is a lack of coherence in the social assistance programs and
weak targeting (Figure 6). Social assistance benefits are very fragmented, with a large
number o f benefits going to families (with no clearly distinguishable objectives), while
poor elderly (particularly from rural areas) are hardly covered by any program (about one
half o f the poor elderly are not covered by social assistance). Most o f the benefits going
to families are universal (child allowances, child raising allowances). Targeted programs
use multiple criteria: most benefits are income-based and use different eligibility
thresholds relative to the minimumwage per capita, which is significantly higher than the
poverty line. The threshold for heating allowances i s actually higher than the minimum
wage per capita, resulting in 50 percent o f the households getting this benefit. Income-
based targeting i s problematic given the size o f the informal economy, which makes it
hard to verify self-reported income. Some efforts to rationalize the system have been



                                                21

made, including the piloting o f the unique payment system and some movement towards
the adoption o f a "life c o ~ r s e "approach to SA. The government i s planning to conduct a
                                           ~
review o f SA system and to consolidate the benefits for newborns under one single
benefit.



62.       Monitoring and Evaluation of the SA programs is needed. The only way to
learn about the efficiency and effectiveness of SA programs and to refine the design and
implementation o f those programs accordingly, i s by setting up a sound monitoring and
evaluation system (M&E). This system would monitor program costs, beneficiaries,
outputs and outcomes. It would also assess the effectiveness o f key or innovative
programs against their stated objectives. The new unique payment system is a step inthe
right direction to develop an integrated information system for SA programs.


63.       The financing and administrative setup for social assistance benefits is also
fragmented-resulting               in inefficiencies. There have been some efforts to bring SA
benefits under a unique payment system (National Agency for Social Benefits, NASB)
under MLFSP (Ministry o f Labor, Family and Social Protection), with a single form for
all benefits, a single payment system and a single beneficiary registry. However, this
system i s not fully operational yet, and the most important benefit for the poor (GMI) i s
not part o f it. The GMI is currently financed from a conditional block grant to local
governments (based on needs estimates reported by local governments). The transfers
from the central budget for the GMI have to be matchedby local governments. However,
this system has generated horizontal inequities, as some local governments are not able to
meet the demand, resulting in some benefits not being paid to entitled beneficiaries and
partial payments6This system also suffers from a lack o f transparency in the allocation
o f funds as well as little control over the flow and use o f funds.7 The capacity o f the
Social Inspection to control and monitor has improved, but its sanctioning authority and
capacity to enforce compliance with SA program rules are still relatively low.


64.       As a result the impact of social assistance programs on poverty is limited and
i s achieved at a high cost. About 29 percent o f the poor are not covered by any social
assistance benefit. For those who are covered the benefit levels are low relative to the
minimum wage (between 10 and 20 percent) and the consumption of poor beneficiary
families (between 9 and 31 percent). Clearly, not all social assistance programs have
poverty reduction as the main objective. However, even if the objective i s to increase
fertility or to improve the health and education o f children, these benefits should be given

  A life course approach involves looking at the different demographic groups (e.g. children, elderly) and the risks
faced by these groups and determiningwho within these groups are the most vulnerable.
  According to MLFSP, an additional 90 million RON would have been needed in 2008 to cover all entitled
beneficiaries. In terms of partial payments, the 2008 Social Inspection report shows that in some communes only 80
;percentof the due amounts (according to entitlements) are beingpaid.
  The allocation of funds is done in two steps. The first step is the allocation to counties, which then further distribute
the funds amongst local governments. No formula or transparent criteria is used. There is a large disconnect between
the programmed GMI budget (provided by MoPF) and the actual spending(provided by MLFSP), due to many factors,
including the block grant approach (in which the local governments have the discretion to allocate amongst various
benefitshocial assistanceexpenditure categories).


                                                           22

to families for whom receiving the benefits would affect their decision to have children or
to invest in their education and health. Given the limited fiscal space and the significant
challenges in terms o f poverty and vulnerability, there is a need to focus SA efforts
around programs with clearly-defined objectives and design those programs (including
the target population) to meet those goals at the lowest cost possible.


65.        The reform measures supported bythe DPL program relate to increasing the
coverage and improving the design of the -most efficient and well targeted social
assistance program-the               GMI-while           progressively rationalizing and reducing the
coverage of the less efficiently targeted programs and improving the targeting of
these programs. Currently, a large number o f benefits go to families with no clearly
distinguishable objectives, while one half o f the poor elderly are not covered by social
assistance at all.



Pensions

66.        The Romanian public pension system (pillar 1) i s projected to run a fiscal
deficit amounting to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009. Comprehensive reforms since 2001
combined with better revenue collection performance and supported by steady economic
growth, improved pension system financial performance to achieve a fkagile surplus o f
0.3 percent in2006 and 0.2 percent in2007. This favorable fiscal situation i s projected to
reverse due to the decisions in2007 and 2008 that introduced sizable increases inpension
point value (hence a generous indexation o f benefits) and granted additional pension
increases to certain groups o f workers and due to the impact o f the projected economic
slowdown on pension system revenues. In order to respond to this fiscal pressure the
government maintained contributions to the second pillar at 2 percent in2009 (instead o f
the previously legislated increase to 2.5 percent in 2009) and increased the overall
contribution rates from 27.5 percent in 2008 to 31.3 percent in February 2009. Even
taking into account the recent increase in the overall contribution rates, the pillar 1
pension system i s projected to run a fiscal deficit o f 1.7 percent o f GDP in 2009. The
pension scheme would face even greater fiscal challenges as a result o f the rapidly aging
population. Based on the existing benefits scheme and projected dependency ratio, the
deficit is projected to increase from 1.7 percent o f GDP in2009 to 2.0 percent o f GDP by
2012 and to 3.5 percent o f GDP by 2050.'

67.       Generous indexation rules in Romania contribute to the fiscal deficit. Under
the current pension system, a working individual accumulates points based on his wages
relative to the average wage. Benefits are based on total accumulated points at retirement.
Once the individual has retired, the number of points accumulated is multiplied by the
point value. The point value in turn i s a percentage o f the current gross average wage-
(currently set at 42.4 percent). Thus even after retirement, changes in the individual's

* Theseprojectionshave been made usingthe World Bank's PROSTmodel (the World Bank's pensiontoolkit) and the
macro projections of the government. These projections are optimistic as they don't take into consideration the
potential decrease in formal employment.The reduction in formal employment due to economic slowdown and due to
the recent increasein overall contributionrates is difficult to predict.



                                                            23

benefits are linked to current wages and can vary if either wages increase or as has been
the case, the point value as a percentage o f wages i s changed. In fact, over the past few
years prior to 2009, the increase in the point value has resulted in pensions rising faster
than wages because the point value, as a share o f the average wage, increased from 31
percent in early 2007 to 45 percent in December 2008 (an increase o f about 50 percent).
Overall, the Romanian indexation rule i s generous compared to most OECD countries
that index pensions to inflation (including Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Korea, Spain,
Turkey, UnitedKingdom and United States).


68.     The absence of a transparent pension indexation rule in Romania-unlike
most OECD countries-also          makes the pension system extremely vulnerable to
political pressure leading to uncertainty for the system participants, and for Romania's
fiscal outlook. As discussed above, existing pensions are re-valued based on changes in
the point value by multiplying an individual's average points by the new point value.
Currently (for the first three months o f 2009), the point value i s set at 41.2 percent o f
gross average wage and has been legislated to increase first to 42.4 percent in April 2009
and then to 43.2 percent o f average gross wage inOctober 2009. This highlightsthe non-
transparency and uncertainty embedded inthe current indexation rule inplace.


69.     Relatively low retirement ages also contribute to the fiscal pressure in the
first pillar. The reforms introduced in 2001 gradually increase retirement ages fiom
55/60 to 60/65 for women and men respectively. For men, life expectancy at retirement
i s 13.5 years, making it difficult to increase the retirement age beyond the legislated
gradual increase. For women, however, life expectancy in retirement i s 20.9 years and
will go down to 20.6 years in 2014 at the time when the retirement age reaches 60.
Current retirement rules raise both the issue o f gender equity, and add to the fiscal
pressures on the pension system. Most OECD countries have equalized retirement ages
between men and women, and some have increased the retirement age beyond 65,


70.     With regard to the first pillar, the reforms supported by the DPL entail
gradually indexing benefit adjustments to inflation (and de-linking retirement
benefits from the point value) and eventually equalizing retirement ages between
men and women to improve fiscal sustainability. Indexation to inflation would
maintain the living standards o f the pensioners and could reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.7
percentage point relative to the baseline by 2015.


71.     A new second pension pillar was enacted into law in 2006 to address future
fiscal constraints and its sustainability is now jeopardized. The second pillar can be
important in easing pressures on the government budget. Its success in doing so and in
providing better benefits depends on motivating contributors to declare correct earnings
and on the effectiveness o f supervision. Almost 3.5 million workers participate in the
second pillar. The contribution rate to Pillar I1 schemes was set at 2 percent and was
supposed to increase by 0.5 percent per annum until it reached 6 percent. However, the



                                             24

increment that was to be made in 2009 was suspended by Emergency Ordinance 4/2009
(art. 9). The suspension potentially threatens the viability o f the schemes andjeopardizes
the government's long term objective o f reducing the fiscal impact o f pensions. In
addition, the suspension has the potential to drive out from the market pension fund
management companies that are already operating on very tight margins and long pay-
back periods due to the low level o f fees permitted under the law. This would reduce
competition and choices for contributors, and ultimately risk translating into higher fees
for contributors.


72.     The reform measure with regard to the second pillar entails restoring the
pace of increase in contributions. The contributions would increase by a minimum o f
0.5 percent in 2010 and see contributions increase by 0.5 percent per year thereafter until
they reach 6 percent.



                      C. STRENGTHENINGTHE FINANCIAL SECTOR

73.     The slowdown in capital inflows, depreciation pressure on the currency, and
decline in demand pose significant risks to financial stability. The contractionary
effects on economic activity and adverse valuation effects for household and corporate
financial positions could affect the banks through credit risks. Stress testing suggests that,
although most banks are fairly well placed in terms o f capital positions and liquidity
ratios to date, any significant deterioration inbanking sector credit portfolio quality could
result in undercapitalization o f some banks. Difficulties in some banks could potentially
trigger a more systemic crisis through contagion effects.

74.     Important steps have been taken to improve liquidity management and
strengthen domestic coordination. The National Committee for Financial Stability
(NCFS) was established in July 2007 as the Domestic Standing Group (DSG), following
the MOU signed by the domestic supervisory authorities and the Ministry o f Public
Finance (MoPF), and several working groups have since been set up.' The NBR has
taken a range o f important steps to enhance its monitoring and management o f liquidity
conditions. These include stepped up contacts with market participants' trading desks,
and daily monitoring o f banks' foreign currency debt payment schedules. The NBR has
also re-introduced rep0 operations to provide short-term liquidity additional to overnight
Lombard lending, and has also conducted occasional bilateral swaps against euro. The
NBR has further agreed with the IMF that it will impose more detailed reporting
requirements on liquidity.


75.     The minimum level of the capital adequacy ratio also will be raised from 8
percent to 10 percent as part of the IMF program. Stress tests o f individual bank

 The NBR and MoPF have also been also participants in the longer-standing crisis simulation exercises organized at
the EUlevel by the Economic and Financial Committee of the Council.

potential increases in own funds needed to ensure that solvency ratios remain above 10
percent. The NBR will require banks to secure sufficient resources to cover potential
shortfalls.


76.     The government has also started to review some aspects of contingency
planning as part of the IMF program. These include reviewing the bank resolution
framework and the means for potentially injecting capital into systemically important
banks. It i s also addressing weaknesses in the deposit insurance framework, moving
towards adoption o f IFRS accounting standards, and seeking an agreement with
commercial banks to facilitate the restructuring of household debt contracted in foreign
currency.


77.     Further aspects of contingency planning need to be considered. If negative
spillovers from the ongoing global financial crisis were to intensify, the worsening
situation inthe Romanian banking sector could significantly deteriorate.


78.     A Strategic Action Plan needs to be prepared to deal with potential future
strengthening within the financial sector under adverse but plausible scenarios. The
materialization o f certain risks may require policy interventions from the Romanian
government (the NBR or the MoPF). Timeliness of such interventions will be critical in
such a situation so that preparedness is highly warranted to sustain stability o f the
Romanian financial system looking forward.


79.     A debt restructuring plan-for     both mortgages and corporate debt-is        also
needed as part of the contingency planning. There is an increasing number o f
insolvency proceedings filed in Romania. The number o f cases filed was 8,297 in 2007
compared to 14,483 in 2008. In the first three months o f 2009, 4,967 insolvency cases
were filed.     Most insolvency cases end up as liquidations because the formal
reorganizationproceedings are not widely used due to several legal features that make the
mentioned proceeding rather rigid. Infact, only about 1.5 per cent o f insolvency cases are
reorganizationproceedings.


80.     Out-of-court corporate restructuring mechanisms ("workouts") are almost
unknown in local practices. In highly critical scenarios, formal insolvency law
proceedings should be complemented with out-of-court mechanisms for corporate
restructuring because in systemic crises environments:          (i)even sound formal
reorganization proceedings typically are ineffective (costly, lengthy, value destructive);
and (ii) are not prepared to handle massivenumbers o f corporate insolvencies inan
        courts
effective manner.




                                           26

81.      Consumers are not eligible for insolvency proceedings. Because consumers are
not able to restructure their debts under a formal insolvency mechanism, consumer debts
in default are individually dealt with under individual enforcement proceedings. Given
the large amount o f mortgage credit supplied to individuals in Romania, in a systemic
crisis scenario the lack o f formal restructuring mechanisms could cause a highly
undesirable situation, in which creditors could exercise their individual enforcement
rights massively and debtors could try to put procedural obstacles to execution, thereby
delaying credit recovery.


82.      Creating a favorable restructuring environment demands a strategy that
includes several components. First, this strategy needs to contemplate special guidelines
to preserve asset values and to induce corporate restructuring. Taking as a starting point
the London Approach and the Bank o f England's Pre-Foreclosure Protocol, a framework
for mortgage debt and corporate debt restructuring should be created to complement
foreclosure and insolvency proceedings. The restructuring strategy also needs to consider
and review potential impediments to restructuring inthe insolvency law (such as stringent
avoidable transactions provisions, and sanctions for debtors who do not file for formal
insolvency proceedings within certain time periods) and possibly in other laws. Finally,
out-of-court negotiated restructuring plans need to be protected through legal provisions
allowing expedited court approval o fpre-negotiated agreements.


83.      There are also several regulatory and supervisory issues that need to be
addressed to ensure greater resilience and stability of the sector over the longer
term. First, it i s important that the sectoral regulatory and supervisory bodies, the
Insurance Supervisory Agency (CSA) the National Securities Commission (CNVM), and
the Private Pension Supervision Commission (CSSPP) are politically independent, inline
with the NBR, and that these bodies have financial autonomy. Currently the process for
appointing Board members involves Parliament preparing a list o f possible appointees,
shortening that list and then selecting members from that list. This process does not fully
guarantee that members are free from political interest as recommended by international
standards o f regulation and supervision. In addition, it will be important to maintain the
financial independence o f these institutions and to ensure their capacity to establish their
staff salaries inline with market levels.


84.      The implementation process of Basel I1is a major prudentialpolicy decision,
which can have a significant effect on the resilience of the banking system. Hence, a
robust assessment process for all advanced models (Internal Rating Based (1RB)I
Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA)), as well as a governance structure
involving all stakeholders within the NBR, are necessary as part of the NBR's Basel 11
implementation. In addition, it i s critical that the minimum capital requirements o f the
first pillar be accompanied by a robust implementation o f the second and third pillars.
The Basel I1 Framework i s composed of three mutually reinforcing pillars that are
intended to be implemented simultaneously. There are three main areas that are assessed
under Pillar 2: risks considered under Pillar 1 that are not fully captured by the Pillar 1



                                              27

process (e.g. indirect foreign exchange risk, residual credit risk, credit concentration
risk); those factors not taken into account by the Pillar 1process (e.g. interest rate risk in
the banking book, business and strategic risk); and factors external to the bank (e.g.,
business cycle effects). A robust Pillar 2 implementation process should be tailored to the
specific risks o f the Romanian banking system, including for the local subsidiaries o f
foreign banks. This also needs to include a timely assessment o f capital adequacy by all
Romanian banks and a systematic indepth review o f the latter by the NBR.A framework
for the proper implementation o f Pillar 3 should also be developed by the NBR at the
same time.


85.     The ongoing modernization of supervision entailing stronger consolidated
supervision is important in an increasingly sophisticated market. Despite the
existence in Romania o f financial groups whose activities span various sub financial
sectors, supervision remains largely sector based and silo oriented. While there i s an
MOU between the supervisors on collaboration, in practice this collaboration has been
limited. For instance, there have been no joint inspections o f financial groups by various
supervisors and little supervisory attention seems to be devoted to intra-group transaction
and risk concentrations.


86.     The government's reform program in the financial sector supported by the
proposed DPL aims to address the key issues mentioned above. This includes the
preparation o f a Strategic Action Plan for potential bank interventions, the preparation o f
mortgage and corporate debt restructuring guidelines, the strengthening o f consolidated
supervision for financial groups, improvements in the decision making process and
implementation o f Base1 I1 and measures to ensure the political and financial
independence o f the sectoral regulatory and supervisory bodies.




          IV.    BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


               A. LINKTO THE COUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY

87.     The proposedDPL programis centralto the Bank's proposedengagementin
Romania, as discussed in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) beingpresented
to the Boardwith this operation. The Bank's strategy duringthis CPS period will be to
help Romania mitigate the impact o f the current financial and economic crisis, while
putting in place the fundamental structural reforms needed to both put Romania onto a
sustainable economic growth path and to prevent such imbalances arising again. The
main pillars o f the CPS are: i)economic growth and competitiveness; ii)public sector
reform; iii)social and spatial cohesion. The focus o f this DPL program on public
financial management, the social sectors and the financial sector i s fully aligned with
these pillars.




                                             28

88.     The DPL series will constitute the bulk of new lendingin the early years of
the CPS. Given the severity o f the crisis and the exceptional need for large-scale budget
support, almost all new lending inthe first year or two o f the CPS will be concentrated on
this DPL series. A large existing portfolio o f investment loans is being restructured to
provide a better fit with the Government's priorities and absorption capacity. Selective,
new investment lending could be considered in the outer years provided there i s
headroom from the portfolio restructuring to accommodate it. The CPS outlines a
substantial AAA program that supports the design o f the DPL program.




           B. COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

89.     The proposed Bank operation supports and complements an overall
multilateralpackageprimarilyinvolvingthe IMFand the EuropeanCommission,as
well as potentiallythe EBRD, EIB and IFC. The overall financing package amounts to
19.95 billion, o f which the IMF i s extending 12.95 billon and the European
Commission 5 billion. The proposed loan (DPL 1) represents a part o f the Bank's share
o f 1 billion in the package. The Bank team has collaborated very closely with the IMF
and the EC from the start o f the multilateral support program. The measures under the
proposed DPL program have been discussed with both the IMF and the E C to ensure that
the measures envisaged reinforce and are complementary to the measures under the IMF
and EC operations. In the area o f public sector reforms, the Fund's Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) envisages a new Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) that will, among
other things, set up procedures for improved multiyear budgeting and the medium
expenditure framework reforms supported by proposed DPL program could be enforced
eventually through the new fiscal responsibility law when this i s passed in 2010. The
main advantage o f the FRL might be a requirement o f some sort o f super majority to
change. Similarly, in the area o f social protection, the Fund's SBA envisages a reform in
the key parameters o f the pension system to be undertaken in coordination with the Bank
and the DPL measures seek to determine the changes inthese parameters. Inthe financial
sector, the measures under the proposed D P L are directly complementary to those in the
IMF program. Together, the programs o f support in the financial sector address the key
areas identified in the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Romania.
The complementary aspects o f the Bank and the Fund support to the government's
reform program are summarized inTable 4.

90.     The current economic and political context provides a good opportunity to
revive the structural reforms agenda, with support from the the IMF, the EC and
the Bank under the agreed multilateralsupport package.The DPL continues reforms
launched under the 2003-2006 P A L program. The previous programmatic adjustment
loan (PAL) was designed as three-series program to support Romania's accession and
integration with the European Union by accelerating economic growth and promoting
social inclusion.    The P A L supported a wide range o f reforms in public finance
management, education, health, social assistance, pensions, judiciary, and private sector
development.       Following the successful implementation o f P A L 1 (rated Highly
Satisfactory by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) the subsequent PALSwere
canceled, as the government's appetite for bold and painful structural reforms dropped

after EU accession in 2007 and the Government sought to diversify its sources o f
financing.


91.        The DPL agenda is complemented by reforms and activities undertaken in a
series of investment operations, as well as the substantial technical assistance
provided under the Public and Private Institution BuildingLoan (PPIBL), which closed in
December 2008 (Table 5).

92.        The Bank has played an important role inRomania since 1990, the beginning
of the transition period. Between 1991 and 2008, the Bank supported a total o f 54 Bank
financed projects, with a total commitment o f about US$ 5.5 bn, representing on average
a commitment o f US$ 326 mn per year. The largest lending volumes (US$ 343 mn per
year on average) were registered between 1995- 2000. Adjustment operations accounted
for 33 percent o f the total lending since 1990. The Bank's financial assistance accounts
for 39 percent o f all net multilateral assistance over 1991-2008, and 8 percent o f all net
(long term) inflows.

93.        About one third of the Bank lending (33 percent) has been directed towards
the structural adjustment of the enterprise and agriculture sectors. The Bank has
financed projects in the health, social protection & inclusion, agriculture and sustainable
community development areas representing about 23 percent o f the total lending. A
similar 23 percent o f the financing has supported infrastructure operations, as well as the
energy and mining sector restructuring.           Targeted TA to public institutions and the
support for judicial reforms has accounted for some 7.5 percent o f total lending. The
remaining 13.5 percent covers operations in a variety o f areas including but not limited to
private sector development and KE, hazards mitigation, cadastre reform, trade and
transport facilitation.


94.        The EU accession objective succeeded in bringing together the main political
parties and mobilizing the support for deep structural reforms. However, once the
political goal o f joining the EU was attained in January 2007, the support for difficult
reforms substantially subsided. The prospects o f accessing substantial grant funds from


                                                 32

the EUunder the Structural and Cohesion Funds also contributed. These prospects have
not materialized so far.


95.     The capacity to design and implement coherent policies, programs and
projects has been a central factor in the success or failure of the previous
operations. The Bank and the EU, through the pre-accession programs, have contributed
substantially to enhancing administrative capacity in various areas targeted by reforms.
However, in general, the capacity o f the public sector to prioritize, plan and implement
policies in an effective and efficient manner remains limited. Further assistance may
therefore be needed to pushthrough complex reforms.


96.     Strong leadership from the center of the government, i.e. Cabinet of the
Prime Minister, and support from the Presidency has been crucial for the successful
implementation of the previous reforms, especially the politically sensitive ones. It i s
important that the support o f these institutions is mobilized for the program from the
early stages.


97.     Flexibility has been also an important factor in the success of the previous
programmatic adjustment operations. The policy reform agenda needs to be realistic
interms o f content and timing, andrisks, includingthe political ones, needto be carefully
weighed in the preparation o f the operation.     Ensuring the understanding o f and the
appropriate popular support for reforms through a carefully planned and implemented
communication strategy o f the government should be part o f the agenda.



                          E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

98.     The agenda promoted by the DPL is strongly anchored in the past and
ongoing analytical work done by the Bank and complements several investment
operations. The Bank has undertaken substantial analytical work in recent years in all
areas covered by the DPL (Table 6). Most recently, a Public Expenditure Review (PER)
i s underway and focuses on identifylng opportunities for efficiency gains in the major
expenditure categories o f the public budget. The main purpose o f the PER is to analyze:
a) the recent aggregate and sectoral expenditure patterns; b) the effectiveness and
efficiency o f spending; and c) the policy and institutional challenges faced by the
government in the main public spending areas in the context o f the ongoing crisis,
including in education and health. There i s also on-going work on the impact o f the crisis
on poverty. In the financial sector the proposed DPL draws on the FSAP that was
undertaken with the FundinNovember 2008.

                            V.     THE PROPOSED OPERATION


OBECTIVEAND RATIONALE

99.      The objective of the proposed operation is to support the Government's
reforms in fiscal management, social protection and the financial sector. These
reforms aim to cushion the impact o f the financial crisis on the poor and vulnerable,
while strengthening the resilience o f the economy to better position Romania to resume
and sustain highgrowth over the medium-tem.

100.     The proposed operation would achieve its objective by contributing to the
international financial support package of the IMF, EC and other development
partners. The direct financial contribution o f this operation i s relatively modest at 1
billion inan overall package of 20 billion. However, the contribution o f this operation to
reform agenda is significant as it tackles the structural reforms needed to improve fiscal
sustainability and the quality and equity o f access to public sector programs, enhance
social protection systems to address the immediate needs o f the vulnerable but also to
ensure more effective social protection over the longer term, and strengthen the resilience
and functioning o f the financial sector. The Bank is well placed to engage in these areas



                                                 34

as it can draw on its rich base o f analytic work, as mentioned above, and an ongoing
policy dialogue.


OPERATION DESCRIPTION

101.    The proposedoperation is the first of a programmatic series of three DPLs,
envisaged to span the 24 months of the IMF Stand-by Arrangement. The proposed
operation (and the two subsequent DPLs) focuses on structural reforms in the three board
areas that are o f critical importance in the current economic context in Romania: public
expenditure reforms; social protection; and financial sector strengthening.     The prior
actions, triggers and milestones are summarized inTable 7.


     A. CROSS-SECTORALPUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORMS

102.    The proposed operation focuses on reforms related to expenditures. As
discussed above, the large fiscal deficits o f the past few years were driven primarily by
excessive and poorly managed public spending. Inparticular, the reforms envisaged will
improve the predictability o f public spending as well as the quality o f public services.
The cross-sectoral reforms covered in the proposedprogram include measures relating to
the a) Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which would be consistent with
the Fund's proposed introduction o f a Fiscal Responsibility Law and consistent with the
reform measures suggested by the EC; and b) initial steps on public sector pay reforms.
Inaddition, the proposed operation focuses on sectoral reforms in education and health,
where, again, the measures seek to improve fiscal management while promoting more
efficient service provision and more equitable access.

MediumTerm ExpenditureFramework

103,    The specific measures are:

        A medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) has been approved by
        Government prior to the budget instructions being sent to line ministries
        (DPLl prior action)
        0   For D P L l the MTEF i s the one submitted to the EC in the Convergence
            Program.
            The MTEF includes macroeconomic assumptions,              aggregate revenue,
            aggregate spending, and fiscal balance for a two-year forward looking period
            (2010-1l), well as the estimates for the current year and the actual spending
                         as
            for the prior year.
            For expenditures the MTEF includes a breakout by type o f budget (e.g., State,
            local, etc.), and as well as expenditures by major economic classification -
            Personnel, Operations and Maintenance, Transfers/Subsidies, Capital (fixed
            and non-fixed), and Debt Service.

       The MTEF updated by MoPF (for macroeconomic changes) will be
       presentedto Parliamentwith limits on aggregate expenditures and the rules



                                             35

          enforcing the ceilings are integrated into the draft Fiscal Responsibility Law
          (DPL2trigger)
          0    The MTEF would include analysis o f fiscal risks and provisions for
               respondingto them under different scenarios.
               The draft Fiscal Responsibility Law would require Parliament to approve the
               MTEF prior to voting the annual budget and would prohibit new measures
               during the budget year that increase aggregate expenditures beyond the limits
               agreed under the MTEF.
               Collective bargaining agreements on public sector wages would be subject to
               MTEF ceilings for personnel costs and would only be valid within that
               framework.

          The MTEF(2011-13) will be approved by the Parliament (prior to the annual
          budget law) with ceilings for major ministries that collectively comprise at
          least 70 percent of the spending (DPL3 trigger)
               A Fiscal Responsibility Law would be enacted, with rules on the MTEF,
               including limits on the ability o f the Parliament or the Executive to breach
               2011 spending ceilings approvedunder the MTEF.
          0    A detailed annex would show how the three year MTEF envelope for capital
               expenditure would be allocated across existing projects inorder to assure their
               timely completion.
          0    Projects that could not be completed within the period due to funding
               limitations would be prioritized for redesign, cancellation, or new funding
               authorization.
          0    The MTEF would include an explanation for the policy basis for the
               allocations and fiscal scenarios for years 2 and 3.


Public Sector Compensation

104.      The specific measures are:

          An Emergency Ordinance (EO)" has been adopted reducing non-wage
          personnel expenditures on 2009 (DPLI prior action)
               Some allowances have been eliminated or redefined to achieve savings.

          A regulation will be issued for implementing a Unitary Pay and Grading
          Law for public service over three years. (DPLZ trigger)
          0    The regulation would phase in a limit of 30% on non-wage personnel
               expenditures and caps on individual bonuses for non-military personnel.
               The salary grading structure would be based on job responsibility and
               qualification.
          0    The salary grades established would more closely align pay for selected


lo Although the Bank discourages the use of Emergency Ordinances in general, the Government has explained that
given the time neededto pass legislationthrough the Parliament this would be the only feasible solution to meet the
crisis needs. EmergencyOrdinances becomeeffectiveimmediatelybut they are still requiredto go through Parliament
andonceapproved inParliament,they becomelaw.



                                                      36

         benchmarkjobs to actual labor market conditions (through a salary survey).
         The disparities inpay between similar performing positions would be reduced
         and the pay reform would provide enhanced career advancement for high-
         performing public servants invarious occupational categories.
         The implementation plan would be fully costed, and would be consistent with
         the mediumterm budgetprojections.

     Pay adjustments in 2010 will be made in accordance with the implementing
     regulation of the new Unitary Pay and Grading Law, and procedures will be
     introduced to enhance compliance with personnel policies (DPL3 trigger)
         The regulations will (a) enforce compliance with merit-based principles o f
         employment and promotion, and (b) report quarterly statistics on the
         effectiveness o f human resource management policies (e.g., turnover by
         position, qualified applicants for positions, etc.).


      B. SECTORAL PUBLICFINANCIALMANAGEMENTREFORMS:
                              EDUCATIONAND HEALTH

105. Ineducation, the specific measures are:

     Legislation will be submitted to Parliament to enable per capita financing starting
     with school year 2010/2011 in eight counties (accounting for 20 percent o f total
     student enrollment) (DPLZ milestone)

     Legislation will be in place to allow all schools in eight counties to receive
     their budget accordingto a per capita finance formula (DPL3 trigger)
         A few very small schools would not necessarily receive their funding
         according to a formula.

106. Inhealth, the specific measures are:

     Legislation has been adopted to raise overall tobacco excise taxes from 50 to
     57 per 1,000 cigarettes (DPLl prior action)
         Considerationto be given to increase the budget o f the health sector

     A ministerial order on drug pricing has been issued and joint order has been
     issued promoting the prescription of generic drugs in the framework
     contracts with service providers (DPLI prior action).

     A government decision will be issued to adopt updated hospital rationalization
     strategy (DPLZ milestone).

     Legislation for a revised benefit package will be adopted which includes:
     (DPLZ trigger)
        Introduction o f co-payment system and exemption mechanisms for the poor
     (e.g. targeted voucher system).



                                           37

          0   Evidence-based transparent mechanisms for the inclusion of new technology
          and drugs inthe benefitspackage.

          A public awareness campaign will be conducted nation-wide for (i)                          introducing
          co-payments for health services and (ii)             discouraging informal payments (DPLZ
          milestone)

          Legislation will be adopted for revised provider payment mechanisms (DPL3
          trigger)

          Legislation will be adopted for development of supplementary voluntary health
          insurance (DPL3 milestone)


                                C. SOCIAL PROTECTIONREFORMS
107.      The measures to strengthen social protection focus on social assistance
programs and pensions that cushion the impact of the current financial crisis and
economic downturn as well as improve the efficiency and viability of these programs
for the future.

108.      The specific measures insocial assistance are:


          An Emergency Ordinance (EO)" has been adopted to incorporate the
          following: (DPLIprior action)
          0    An increase in the GMI eligibility threshold level by 15 percent starting in
               July 2009.
          0    100percent financing of the GMI from State budget

          Agreement has been reached to undertake a Public Expenditure Tracking System
          (PETS) o f the GMI starting in September 2009 (DPLI milestone)

          The revised Minimum Income Guaranteed (GMI) Law (416/2001) will be
          approved to incorporate the following (DPLZ trigger)
          0    Increase the GMI eligibility threshold level by 15 percent (i.e. incorporate the
               changes inthe EO under DPLI).
          0    Maintain indexation o fbenefits to inflation as in current law.

          0    Ensure 100 percent financing o f the GMI from the State budget (i.e.
               incorporate the changes inthe EO under DPLI).
          0    Depending on the results o f the PETS, include the GMI under the National
               Agency for Social Benefits (NASB) starting with January 2011 (adjusting the
               software accordingly)



" Although the Bank discourages the use of EmergencyOrdinancesin general, the Government has explained that
given the time needed to pass legislation through the Parliament this would be the only feasible solution to meet the
crisis needs. Emergency Ordinances become effective immediately but they are still required to go through Parliament
and once approved in Parliament, they become law.



                                                        38

       Depending on the results o f the PETS, implementation o f regulation on including
       GMIinNASB will be issued (DPL3 milestone)

       The current level of the Universal Child Allowance (UCA) for children up to
       2 years of age and 3 years of age in the case of disabled children will be
       maintained for the period 2009-2011. For children above these age limits, the
       UCA will be unified with the income-tested Complementary Family Benefit
       (CFB). The thresholds andor benefit levels could be increased without
       exceeding the existing aggregate envelope of UCA and CFB. (DPL2 trigger)

       An improved design of the school conditionality among CFB beneficiaries will be
       adopted (DPLZ milestone).
       0   Mechanisms for verifying compliance with the conditionality will be
           introduced.

109.   Inpensions the measures relate to improving the fiscal sustainability of the
public pension scheme, designing an appropriate social protection for elderly poor
who are not covered at present and protecting and strengthening the integrity and
equity of the multi-pillar pension system.

110.   The specific measures are:


       Legislation will be adopted that gradually links benefit adjustments in pillar
       1to inflation (and de-links the indexation of already awarded retirement
       benefits from the point value) and increases retirement ages for women to
       equalize women's retirement ages with that of men at 65 (DPLZ trigger).
       0  Indexation of retirement benefits would be gradually linked to inflation. The
       legislation would de-link the point value from indexation o f pensions after the
       pension i s awarded. The point value would be kept at the current level and would
       be used to calculate the pension at the time o f retirement only. At the time o f
       retirement, the pension would be calculated by multiplying the average points
       accumulated by the point value as is currently the case. Once the individual retires
       his pension would be completely de-linked from the point value and the
       indexation o f this pension from this point would include some component o f wage
       growth initially. However, the weight on the wage growth component would be
       progressively reduced while the weight on the inflation component would be
       progressively increased. The weights and speed o f adjustment will be determined
       with the authorities prior to DPL2.
       0  The legislation could allow for the indexation to include some percentage o f
       the real wage growth (instead o f the regular formula outlined above) if the real
       wage growth exceeded a certain threshold in a specific year. The threshold for
       real wages and the percentage o f real wage growth to be included in the
       indexation o f pension benefits in that specific year will be determined prior to
       DPL2.




                                             39

          The retirement ages for women will be equalized with that o f men at age 65.
       The timing (start and completion) o f the increases in retirement age for women
       will be determined with the authorities prior to DPL2.

       An Emergency Ordinance will be issued increasing the contribution rate to the
        second pillarby a minimumo f 0.5 percent for 2010 (DPL2 milestone).
        0  The level o f contributions to the second pillar will be increased by 0.5 percent
           per annum thereafter untilthey reach 6 percent.

       Measures will be designed and implemented to deal more effectively with the
        social protection of elderly poor (DPL3 trigger)
            This would be a zero pension pillar or an additional component to GMI,
            depending on the results o f AAA work currently being undertaken.


                           D. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS

111.    In the financial sector the reform measures supported by this operation fall
under two broad categories-contingency          planning and reforms to enhance the
governance and supervision of the financial sector with a view to strengthening the
resilience, functioning and stability of the sector.

112.    With regard to contingency planning, complementing the measures already
envisaged under the Fundagreement, the specific measures are:


        A Strategic Action Plan for further strengthening of the financial sector has
        been approved by NBR and M o P F (DPLlprior action).
        0   The Action Plan i s based on the results o f the ongoing banking sector stress
            tests being undertaken by the NBR and envisages future interventions within
            the financial sector under adverse but plausible scenarios.
        0   The Action Plan has been prepared at the level o f the Domestic Standing
            Group with adequate confidentiality.
        0   The Plan includes, among others, a dynamic classification o f banks into
            systemically important banks and others, and a typology o f potential
            interventions o f the NBR and the MoPF (and other financial supervisors as
           needed) in the resolution o f illiquid or insolvent banks according to their
            systemic importance and other relevant parameters - e.g. the quality o f
            governance, the capacity o f shareholders to raise capital, etc. In addition, a
            strategy for containing reputational risk in case o f a bank's failure, including
            an adequate communication strategy, should be prepared.

       Mortgage debt and corporate debt restructuring guidelines will be issued and
       necessary amendments to the Insolvency Law will be issued (DPL 2 trigger).
        0  The legal amendments to the Insolvency Law would aim to remove obstacles
           to out-of-court insolvency proceedings and allow pre-packaged reorganization
           plans approval (based on an assessment o f the law).

113,   The specific measures to improve the governance and functioning o f the financial
sector are:

       A Law on the Political Independence and Financial Autonomy of the
       Financial Sector Regulators and Supervisors will be approved by Parliament
       (DPL2 trigger).
           The de LarosiereReport recommends the establishment o f a European System
           o f Financial Supervision (ESFS). In the framework o f the ESFS, the report
           recommends that financial sector supervisors o f Member States be
           independent o f the political authorities and have sufficient resources and
           powers. The report further recommends that the powers o f all financial sector
           supervisors be harmonized and increased to reach a highlevel standard.
           A legal fi-amework should be established that aligns the degree o f political
           independence and financial autonomy o f the non-bank regulators, the CSA,
           C N V M and CSSPP with that o f the NBR.
           The law should guarantee inter alia that:
                      these institutions determine their staff compensation policies and
                      levels based on transparent market benchmarking principles;
                      the selection and dismissal process o f staff o f these institutions i s
                      not subject to political decisions;
                      the nomination process for Board members and statutorily-
                      appointed executive members o f these institutions i s based
                      exclusively on technical qualifications;
                      these institutions' budgets are not subject to Parliament approval;
                      and
                      the directors and supervisory staff o f these institutions have
                      statutory indemnity for actions taken in good faith inthe course o f
                      their duties.

       An internal regulation governing the decision making process and methods
       for Basel I1implementationwill be adopted (DPL2 trigger).
           An internal governance structure, preferably with NBR Board involvement,
           for Basel I1policy and accreditation decisions needs be established within the
           NBR. The implementation process o f Basel I1is a major prudential policy
           decision, which can have a significant effect on the resilience o f the banking
           system. Hence, a robust assessment process for all advanced models
           (IRB/AMA), as well as a governance structure involving all stakeholders
           within the NBR, needs to be rolled out as part o f the NBR's Basel I1
           implementation.

       For consolidated supervision, an assessment will be made, and amendments
       will be made as necessary on a) the adequacy of the definition of "Financial
       Conglomerate" in Ordinance 98/2006 in capturing all financial groups
       operating in Romania with material operations across more than one
       financial sub-sector and b) the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the
       Memorandum of Understanding between the financial regulators for


                                            41

financial groupsinRomania (DPL.3 trigger).
0  The EU Financial Conglomerates Directive gives the national authorities the
   discretion to apply supplementary supervision to financial groups which,
   although they do not exceed the minimum thresholds set in the Directive to
   qualify as a financial conglomerate, have material operations across more than
   one sub-sector o f the financial system. The Directive requires the
   identification, regulation and supervision of financial conglomerates on a
   collegiate basis under a coordinating agency agreement between domestic
   financial sector supervisors. Prudential requirements to be monitored at the
   level of a financial conglomerate relate to capital adequacy, risk
   concentration, intra group transactions, internal control mechanisms and risk
   management processes. Ordinance 98/2006 transposes this Directive into
   Romanian law and outlines the conditions under which a financial group i s
   considered a financial conglomerate.
   To mitigate the risk that certain financial groups are exposed to material intra-
   group risks not covered by the definition of a Financial Conglomerate in
   Ordinance 98/2006, the financial sector authorities should compare the
   existing financial groups operating in Romania against the definition o f
   Ordinance 98/2006. The NBR should review each group to assess whether
   there are material intra group risks, such as contagion risk, across sectors.
   Where the NBR judges such risks to exist, they should consider whether the
   application o f the existing definition of financial conglomerates i s adequate to
   identify these groups. Ifnot, they should amend the definition accordingly.
0  Ifsuch groups areidentified, the regulators must ensure that allmaterial intra-
   group transactions and risk concentrations are monitored under joint
   supervision arrangements. Where this is currently not the case, the relevant
   regulators   should    establish    appropriate   regulation  and supervision
   arrangements and, ifnecessary, amend the relevant MOU.

Box 1: Good Practice Principlesfor Conditionality

Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership
There is ownership and commitment at the executive and parliamentary level as evidenced by a number o f
policy actions taken under the multilateral package. The government had already embarked on a fiscal
adjustment path prior to seeking the multilateral support package. The Bank's contribution i s based on
analysis conducted during preparationand accepted by the authorities as the basis for further policy actions
to add to and strengthen the set o f reforms underway. The Bank team includes experts with lengthy field
experience in the country and knowledge o f the executive, parliamentary, and other consultative and
consensus building procedures.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

The program is very closely coordinated with the other collaborating donordpartners, namely, the IMF and
the EC. The accountability framework delineated in the policy matrix contains very specific actions with
associated indicators for measuring results to gauge success o f the program.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

The financing package and associated policy measures are specifically geared to address both the
government's actual (and contingency) funding needs as well as reducing the economy's vulnerability to
future shocks. As such, the measures are tailored directly to Romania's situation. The financing will
address actual fiscal gap and provide a cushion for potential gaps that may emerge in light o f the uncertain
global environment with a view toward ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability, while the program
lays the foundations for sustained growth inthe future.

Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving resultsas conditionsfor disbursement

The policy actions focus only on those that are considered crucial toward strengthening the public sector
expenditure management, social protection and financial sector. The actions are those which contain key
added value features as contributions from the Bank to the policy agenda. Other actions, already agreed
with the other donors/partners, are essential to the overall basis of the program and complement the policy
measuresdeveloped by the Government incollaboration with the Bank.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

Monitoring will take place during loan implementation as two other single-tranche DPLs are embedded
within the program period. Program conditions are aligned with the appropriate cycles: public sector
conditions are aligned with the government's budget cycle; conditions in education are aligned with the
academic year.

                        VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                           A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

114.    The social assistance policies supported by this operation are expected to
have significant positive poverty impacts. Although poverty decreased sizably in2008,
it is expected to rise again in 2009-with      the number o f very poor people expected to
increase from 1.2 million in 2008 to almost 1.6 million persons, the very poorest of
whom would need to be covered by the social safety net. The proposed DPL envisages an
expansion in the coverage o f the best targeted social assistance scheme, the Guaranteed
MinimumIncome (GMI) and aims to reduce leakages to non-poor by freezing the benefit
level o f the Universal Child Allowance.

115.    With the GMI reform measuresupported bythe proposedDPL program, the
coverage of the GMI program is expected to increase by 30 percent or by an
additional 70 thousand of very poor families. Inparticular, the program supports a 15
percent increase in the current threshold level which would amount to 21 percent o f the
gross minimum wage. (The current threshold-RON            108 for a single person family-
amounts to only 18 percent o f the gross minimum wage in 2009 and i s 25 percent lower
than the $2 a day international poverty line). Raising the threshold level by 15 percent
would result in a 25 percent increase in the average benefit level. The proposed DPL
program i s also supporting the reform measure to finance 100 percent o f the GMI
benefits from the central budget rather than the current formula in which 80 percent i s
financed from the central budget and 20 percent by local governments. The current
formula results in a situation in which some fiscally constrained local governments are
unable to cover all eligible applicants. (The difference between what would have been
paid ifall eligible families receivedpayments and what was actually paid was reportedby
the Ministry o f Labor to be 90 million RON).


116.    The pension reforms envisaged under the DPL program also aim to protect
the elderly and vulnerable over the longer term. The measures related to pillar 1 o f the
pension system aim to restore the sustainability o f the pension system and hence protect
all the future generations o f retirees. At the same time, the real income o f current retirees
would be maintained under the reforms envisaged since their benefits, once retired,
would be linked to inflation. Although current retirees may perceive themselves as losing
from the reform measure since over the past years wage increases have outpaced
inflation, the present system o f linking retirees' benefits to wages i s in effect allowing
current retirees to benefit from the productivity gains o f the current workers-whose
retirement benefits, moreover, may be jeopardized unless the fiscal sustainability o f the
pension system is improved. (It should also be noted that the reform measure could allow
for pension indexation to include some component o f wage growth in cases o f highreal
wage growth (for example, exceeding 10 percent)). Improving the fiscal sustainability o f
the pension scheme would allow the Government to use these resources in other sectors
such as health, education and social assistance that are also essential for poverty
reduction. The DPL program also supports pension reforms to protect the elderly poor


                                               47

who are not at present covered by any retirement schemes. The exact mechanism through
which this protection will be provided-whether     through the introduction o f a zero pillar
pension or through an expansion o f the GMI-will        be determined following analytic
work duringthe course o f the first and second DPLs intime for DPL3.


117.    The other measures envisaged in the DPL program are not expected to have
direct adverse impacts on poverty and would likely have positive indirect effects. In
particular:

(a)     The public sector pay reforms would not be expected to affect the poorest
segment directly. Indirectly, the pay reform conditions and the public expenditure
management conditions would be expected to contribute to fiscal and macro stability
which i s beneficial for the population as a whole. The pay reform in particular seeks to
restrain public sector pay awards from outpacing the private sector labor market rates
thereby fuelling inflationary pressures; b) the conditions in the health and education
sector aim to achieve fiscal savings which could be used to promote greater equity and
access to these services with improved quality. For instance the increase in cigarette
excise taxes (while these in and o f themselves could be regressive) would be expected to
generate additional revenues a part o f which could be used for health services.
Furthermore, special attention is being paid in the measures to address poverty/equity
issues. Thus in education, the per capita financing reform measure, which involves
allocation of funds to schools for operational expenditures (salary and non salary)
primarily based on the number o f students, would generate cost savings which could be
invested in quality improvements and ensure horizontal equity across schools and
regions. In health, health insurance reform is expected to help discourage informal
payments-which      affect the poor-and      the introduction o f co-payments for health
insurance will include a targeted exemption mechanism to ensure continued access o f
health services by the poor; c) the financial sector conditions aim to minimize the risks o f
a financial crisis by enabling the authorities to address current and potential
vulnerabilities in the banking sector and strengthen regulation and supervision in the
long-term. Thus, they aim to avoid potential costs on depositors that could be very large,
ifa bankingcrisis were to develop, or on tax payers in case a bailout of banks became
necessary. As such, while there i s no immediate impact on the poor, these measures
would be expected to bebeneficial for all segments o fthe population.

118.    Further analysis on the poverty, social and distributional impact of the
measures envisaged under the proposed DPL program will also be undertaken
during the course of the program. In particular, once the design o f the co-payment
system (in health) has been decided, simulations o f the distributional impact o f this
measure will be carried out based on the existing surveys (e.g. Household Budget
Survey) and administrative data provided by the Ministry o f Health. For the per capita
financing measure in education, an impact evaluation will be carried out using the pilot
areas and a control area, paying special attention to the poor and vulnerable communities
and risks o f student drop outs. The distributional impact o f the public pay measures will
be monitored yearly based on the HBS data and administrative data provided by the
Ministryo f Labor, Social Protectionand Family.As far as social protectionmeasures are


                                             48

concerned, the Ministry i s monitoring and reporting the impacts o f main social programs
on an ongoing basis. These assessments will include the measures under the DPL
program. The findings o f these analyses will be reflected inDPLs 2 and 3.


                                   B. CONSULTATIONS

119.    The proposed DPL series builds on current analytic work and some
consultations have already been conducted as part of the dissemination activities
associated with the work. For example in the case o f the Per Capita Financing (PCF),
the Ministry of Education, representatives of the teachers' union and local governments
participated in a consensus building workshop organized by the Bank that brought in
international experience, and discussed the current situation inRomania and steps needed
for implementation in Romania. In the area o f social assistance, a workshop in May,
organized jointly with the UNICEF, will bring together local governments, the Ministry
o f Labor and Social Protection, NGOs, members o f the Parliament and the press. Further
consultations will be undertaken inkey areas duringthe course o f the DPL program.



                            C. ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

120.    The specific country policies supported by the operation are not likely to
have significant effects on Romania's environment and natural resources. The
measures contemplated under the loan are primarily geared toward ensuring stability and
future financial system solvency, to allow an economic reactivation once the global and
EU economic distress turns around. These will cover public sector reforms, social
protection and financial sector strengthening. None o f the sectors included in the
operation are expected to have any significant links to the environment. Moreover,
Romania has adequate environmental controls in place. Romania's environmental
legislation and regulation i s reinforced by EU environmental directives, including the
EU's guidelines on adoption o f environmental assessments at the planning and
programming level (June 2001) and the EU's Environmental Liabilities Directive setting
out liability for damage to properties and natural resources (April 2007).


             D. IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGAND EVALUATION


121.    The implementation of the loan will require close coordination among the
Bank and the respective institutions responsible for implementation. These include
the Ministry o f Finance, the Central Bank, the Ministryof Labor and Social Protection,
Ministry o f Health, Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Justice, and National Agency o f
Civil Servants (NACS), all o f which will provide the requisite baseline data from which
to measure outcomes by the end o f the program (Table 8). The Ministry of Public
Finance will assist in the coordination of information reporting on the program's
monitoring indicators. These will be tracked, discussed and assessed among the Bank
team and implementing agencies both by staff based in the field and during visits
between the three DPLs.

                                 E. FIDUCIARYASPECTS


122.    The Bank has extensive knowledge of the country's Public Financial
Management (PFM) system. A CFAA was completed at the end o f 2003, while a
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was done in 2005 and a Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) was published in 2006. Regular updates o f
PFM recent reform activities and their impact have been carried out over the recent years
as part o f the continuous dialogue with Romania.

123.    The 2003 CFAA deemed the overall fiduciary risk associated with the PFM
system moderate. Inthe areas o f accounting, financial reporting and internal control, the
fiduciary risk was considered significant, partly due to the heavy dependence on manual
accounting and reporting processes, weak arrangements for management accountability
and the limited modern internal audit capabilities. Considering the introduction o f
program budgeting, the generally reliable cash distribution facilities provided by the
Treasury system and the Court o f Accounts capacity, the fiduciary risk was considered
moderate in the fields o f budgeting, treasury, cash management and external audit and
parliamentary oversight. The fiduciary risk related to World Bank investment operations
was considered low.


124.    Inresponse to the recommendations of the 2003 CFAA, the Government has
taken action to improve coordination and management of PFM reform and
strengthen internal control, financial reporting and auditing systems. An Inter-
Ministerial Committee;headed      by a State Secretary o f the Ministry o f Public Finance
(MoPF) endorsed a PFM Strategic Development Plan (SDP) in 2005 and has since
monitored its implementation. A number o f the CFAA recommendations have already
been addressed by the Government, including in the areas o f treasury management,
harmonization o f accounting standards and practices, decentralization and rationalization
o f ex-ante financial control and strengthening internal audit functions. The organization
and effectiveness of the Court o f Accounts has also been improved. Overall, steady
progress has beenmade inthe development o f PFM systems and institutions.


125.    Romania has made significant progress in government budget transparency
as measured by the 2008 Open Budget Index assessment (OBI). Romania has been
promoted from the OBI category "provide some information" to the next one, "provide
substantial information". According to OBI, the remaining budget issues are the absence
o f pre-budget statements, o f a citizens' budget and o f a mid-year review; whereas only
partial information i s available for areas such as Executive's budget proposal, in-year
reports and audit reports. However, several important P F M challenges remain. While the
introduction o f program budgeting has enhanced budget management, budgets lack
realism. A Medium Term Expenditure Framework is not yet fully developed. There are
still several budget adjustments done during the year, as needed, with no formal mid-year
review. Timely budget approvals and timely reports on changes in budget allocations



                                             51

remain a challenge. While internal control and internal audit have recorded substantial
improvements, there are several unfinished reform agenda points. An extensive
decentralization o f the ex-ante control functions has been rolled out to most line
ministries however, this has not yet happened for several line ministries, which include
some major budget spenders, that account for about half o f the total budget funds. While
overall the internal audit function has increased and most o f the internal audit procedures
have been developed, however, professional capacity, development and training
requirements to apply those remain problematic. Several line ministries, including some
main budget spenders, have low internal audit capacity. Also, despite the use o f internal
audit planning tools, a large part o f the assignments i s done on an ad-hoc basis.


126.     Several achievements have been made in accounting and reporting, but
challenges remain. While accruals accounting has been rolled out, the new chart o f
accounts introduced in2006 and a major assets revaluation exercise carried out, reporting
i s still done both on accruals and cash accounting methods. Good progress has been
recorded towards gradually introducing IPSAS. However, the budgets are developed
using the cash basis only, with additional information on commitments. Inaddition, there
i s still significant reliance on manual accounting and bookkeeping processes. A
substantial unfinished agenda is left for the local public finances area.


127.     The treasury and cash management functions have improved, but there is
still not a fully integrated financial management information system in place. The
existing treasury system has further developed, with significant improvements in the
payments processing, but there are still no direct links with the line ministries. A web
based integrated system, with centralized databases and servers, i s being envisaged, with
the technical specifications being defined.      This will address several current issues,
including the ability o f the treasury to ensure the contracts monitoring, optimized
prognosis o f cash needs; foreign currency payments, letters o f credit and online banking
functions.


128.     Some progress has been achieved on external audit. The Court o f Accounts
(CoA) has developed and updated its procedures manuals on compliance, financial and
performance audits. Still, the main CoA activities are to a great extent focused on the
budget holder's compliance for individual transactions. The external audit Parliamentary
oversight committees appear to have a limited use o f the CoA reports and thus the
subsequent impact o f the CoA reports i s limited.


129.     The fiduciary risk associated with the Public Financial Management System
i s moderate.


130.     The Central Bank can be relied on to hold proceeds from development policy
operations. The IMF's safeguards assessment completed in June 2005, concluded that

safeguards in place at the National Bank o f Romania (NBR) generally appear adequate.
However, certain weaknesses were identified inthe internal audit and control system, and
the safeguards assessment recommended measures to address them. Based on the IMF's
assessment the National Bank o f Romania can be relied upon to account for the World
Bank's proceeds from development policy operations, assuming that the arrangements
are otherwise in accordance with the World Bank's policies and with specific mutually
agreed terms for the operation inquestion.



                          F. DISBURSEMENTANDAUDITING


131.    The proposed loan will follow the World Bank's disbursement procedures
for development policy loans. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases,
thus evidence will not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement
requirements be necessary. The front end fee will be covered from the Borrower's own
sources. The Government will submit a withdrawal application to the Bank. At the
request o f the MoPF, the Bank will deposit the proceeds o f the loan into a foreign
exchange deposit account (deposit account) designated by the Government that forms
part o f the general foreign exchange reserves o f the country and acceptable to the Bank,
such account to be held at the National Bank o f Romania (NBR). The deposit account i s
available for budget financing and will be managed by the MoPF. The proceeds o f the
loan will be used as needed by the MoPF, either in foreign currency, or converted into
local currency, to cover the budget deficit. If the proceeds of the loan are used to
ineligible purposes as defined inthe Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower
to promptly, refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to the Bank upon
notice from Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

132.    The administration and accounting of the loan proceeds will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Public Finance. The standard country rules will be
followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The government will maintain
accounts and records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that the loan
disbursement i s in accordance with the provisions o f the Loan Agreement. Such accounts
and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. The proceeds o f the
Loan deposited at the NBR will be used to cover the budget deficit. The MoPF will be
responsible for the operation's administration and for preparing the withdrawal
application, maintaining the deposit account as required. The MoPF, with the assistance
o f the NBR, will maintain records o f all transactions under the deposit account in
accordance with sound accounting practices. The Borrower will report to the Bank within
30 days after receiving the loan amounts, by sending a confirmation letter on the loan
amounts deposited inthe foreign currency deposit account.


133.    The proceeds of the loan will be deposited in a single tranche by the Bank in
an account chosen by the Borrower at the National Bank of Romania (NBR) and an
audit of that account will not be required. The currency o f the chosen NBR account
will be the currency o f the loan. Given the positive IMF assessments o f the NBR, the


                                           53

unqualified NBR audit reports for 2005-2007, as well as the satisfactory audit compliance
under the previous P A L and PSAL-2 development policy lending operations (disbursed
in 2005), an audit of the NBR account for the proceeds of the loan is not considered
necessary. The above mentioned confirmation letter will be inlieu o f the audit.




                            G. RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION


134.   The proposed D P L series i s a relatively highrisk operation. Romania has been hit
hard by the global economic crisis. The large fiscal deficit that Romania had incurred
going into the crisis increases the need for adjustment at a time when the severity o f the
economic downturn increases the difficulties in achieving such an adjustment. The Fund
program rests heavily on strong macroeconomic policy adjustments combined with a
large package o f external financial support to stabilize the economy and support external
debt rollover/debt service without excessive pressures on the exchange rate that could
further weaken the banking sector. As discussed below there are economic risks that
could prove the IMF's assumptions underpinning the program overly optimistic. There
are also political risks-particularly  in light of the coalition government-which    could
result in policy slippages. In turn these policy slippages could undermine market
confidence and increase balance o f payments pressures.

135.   A key risk affecting the proposed operation is the uncertainty of the global
economic outlook. There i s a possibility that international financial markets will remain
frozen and that the global economic downturn, particularly inthe EU, will be more severe
and protracted than currently projected. Lower debt roll over rates or larger capital
outflow would directly affect the domestic banking sector. Balance-sheet effects arising
from a further RON depreciation beyond the current program assumptions (and the
resulting higher than expected inflation), would further compress Romanian growth. The
domestic economy would also be affected by a further worsening o f the global growth
outcome through trade and through continued erosion o f investor and consumer
confidence. In turn a more protracted downturn in the Romanian economy could have
serious implications for the domestic banking sector through increased corporate and
household distress.


136.   This risk is partially mitigated by the size of the multilateral support
package. The size o f the package provides some cushion in building up reserves that
would help deal with a worse-than-expected case scenario o f capital outflows and
prolonged financial sector distress.


137.   The content of program also mitigates risks. In the banking sector, the Fund
program includes in-depth examinations and recapitalization requirements inthe event o f
capital shortfalls, as well as the strengthening o f regulatory and supervisory powers.
Under the proposed D P L program, these measures are further reinforced through


                                             54

additional contingency planning reforms including the preparation o f a strategic action
plan to deal with potential interventions and the establishment o f a framework to
facilitate debt restructuring. Finally, the fiscal reforms envisaged under the overall
program will reduce the fiscal pressures both in the short run and over the medium term
and contribute to lowering the external financing needs.

Annex 3: Assessment from the International Monetary Fund

        On May 4th, 2009 the IMF Board approved a Stand-by Arrangement o f Euro 12.95
billion for Romania. This annex provides the Public Information Notice/Press Release o f the
SBA.

    IMFExecutiveBoardApproves 12.9 BillionStand-By Arrangement for Romania

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF) today approved a 24-month
SDR 11.4 billion (about 12.9 billion or US$17.1 billion) Stand-ByArrangement for Romania
to support an economic program designed by the Romanian authorities and intendedto
cushion the effects o f the sharp drop incapital inflows while addressing the country's external
and fiscal imbalances and strengthening the financial sector. The approval makes SDR 4.37
billion (about 4.9 billion or US$6.6 billion) immediately available and the remainder will be
available ininstallments subject to quarterly reviews. The Stand-By Arrangement entails
exceptional access to IMFresources, amounting to 1,111 percent o f Romania's quota.

The Stand-By Arrangement will be combined with other multilateral financial support to fill
the country's 2009-2010 financing gap. The total international financial support package will
amount to 19.9 billion (about US$26.4 billion), with the European Union providing 5
billion (or about US6.6 billion), the World Bank 1 billion (or about US$1.3 billion), and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank
(EIB), and the InternationalFinanceCorporation (IFC) a combined 1billion (or about
US$l.3 billion).

Following the Executive Board discussion on Romania, Mr.John Lipsky, First Deputy
Managing Director and acting Chairman, said:

"The Romanian authorities are to be commended for seeking early international support to
assist them with an orderly correction of the large external imbalances and vulnerabilities built
upduringrecent boom years, and leavingthe country highlyexposed to global financial
turmoil and exchange rate volatility. Excessive public spending inrecent years also produced
sizeable fiscal deficits which, inthe current tight financing environment, are destabilizing.
With the global downturn increasingly spilling over to Romania, a rebalancing of the
economy i s unavoidable.

"The Romanian authorities have launched a comprehensive program to respondto the current
challenges. The program aims at reversing the deteriorating fiscal path with significant

                                                65

expenditure cuts and additional revenues. Planned fiscal reforms are designed to contain
future expenditures pressures, improve the budgetingprocess, and enhance the efficiency o f
tax collections and government operations over the medium-term. An action plani s being
implemented to maintain confidence inthe banking system, including by preemptive bank
recapitalization, agreements to maintain foreign banks' exposure inthe country, and efforts to
strengthen bank supervision and resolution. This program, combined with significant external
financial support, should ease short-term funding pressures and enhance medium-term
economic prospects.


"The joint financial assistancebeing provided by the IMF, the EuropeanUnion, and the
World Bank will help cushion the economic downturn and will provide reassurance to
markets that Romania's external obligations will be met. It sends a strong signal o f the
international community's confidence that, with the consistent implementation o f the
program, Romania will weather the current difficulties and emerge with a better-balanced and
more flexible economy," Mr.Lipsky said.

RecentEconomicDevelopments

Romania experienced an economic boom over the past five years that led to overheating and
unsustainable imbalances. GDP growth averaged over 6% percent per year from 2003-08, as
foreign direct investment and capital inflows, inpart through subsidiaries o f foreign banks in
Romania helped finance highconsumption and investment growth. The rapid increase in
borrowing that fueled the boom left Romaniahighly exposed to global financial difficulties
and to exchange rate volatility. Loose fiscal and incomes policies also contributed to the
overheating o f the economy and to its current vulnerabilities, with excessive spending,
especially on wages and pensions, as the main culprit.

Economic activity turned down sharply inlate 2008 and has fallen further in 2009. Growth i s
projected at about 4 percent in2009 on account o f a sharp contraction indomestic demand,
which inturnwill set off a correction inthe current account deficit from 12%percent o f GDP
in2008 to 7%percent in2009. Foreign direct investment and capital inflowswill drop
sharply. Increased financial stress, tightening credit standards and limitedaccess to external
fundingwill inhibit lendingto the private sector. Once confidence is restored, domestic
demand is expected to slowly rebound, but growth will remain near zero in2010, before
recovering to 5 percent in2011. Inflation i s expected to fall in2009 to within the official
target (3.5 percent, plus or minutes 1percent) and remain there in2010.

ProgramSummary

The IMF-supported program combines strong policy measures with sizable financial support.
Keyto restoringconfidenceis a reversal o fthe sharp increase inpublic spending, which
caused a large deficit to accumulate even duringa period of strong economic growth. Short-
term budget cuts will be combined with fiscal policy reforms to place the public finances on a
more sustainable path. The effects o f the fiscal adjustment andbudget reforms will be
cushioned byboosting social safety net spending and safeguarding capital spending. Banking
sector measures will also be implemented to ensure that banks remain sufficiently strong to
weather the economic downturn.

Specific program objectives include:


0  Reduce the fiscal imbalance to bringthe deficit back under 3 percent o f GDP by 2011


0  Maintain adequate capitalization o fbanks and liquidity indomestic financial markets.


0  Bringinflation within the target range o fthe National Bank o fRomania (NBR) by end-
     2009 and maintain it there.


0  Secure adequate external financing and improve confidence.
