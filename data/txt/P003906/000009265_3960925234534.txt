MEMORAWDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE INDUSTRIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for US$21.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate, and would assist in financing an Industrial Energy
Conservation Project.  The equivalent oi US$16.5 million of the loan proceeds
would be on-lent by the Government to P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI) for 10
years, including 4 years of grace, at a 13.51 per annum (p.a.) fixed interest
rate, and the equivalent of US$4.5 million would be on-lent to P.T. Konservasi
Energi Abadi (KONEBA) for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at a 13.5Z
p.a. fixed interest rate. The Government would bear tbe foreign exchange
risk.
2.        Background.  Indonesia is endowed with abundant and diversified
energy resources which include oil, gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal
energy. The energy sector plays a key role in Indonesia's economic develop-
ment, and provided about 502 of the country's foreign exchange earnings in
1986/87 through oil (34%) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports (161).
Indonesia's energy consumption, however, is also concentrated heavily on
oil. In 1984, about 83X of the total commercial energy used (including
electric power generation) was in the form of oil, and the remaining 17% in
the form of gas.
3.        In 1981, a UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Report (No. 3543-IND)
highlighted the need to: (i) explore and develop the country's non-oil energy
resources to substitute for oil in the domestic market to save oil for export;
and (ii) formulate energy pricing policies and develop programs and tech-
nologies to promote more efficient energy use and to stimulate interfuel sub-
stitution. The recent decline in the growth of foreign exchange earnings from
oil and the concommitant weakening of the country's resource position has
accentuated the need to give increased emphasis to economically sound diversi-
fication of domestic energy supplies and to energy conservation. To help
achieve this objective, the Government has taken steps over the past three
years to increase the domestic price of petroleum fuels to stimulate the
substitution of oil by other competing fuels, reduce distortions in demand
between individual petroleum fuels, and spur conservation. The domestic
prices of all petroleum products are now, on average, close to international
price levels, although some adjustments in the relative prices of fuels,
particularly diesel and kerosene, remain to be addressed. This issue is being
reviewed in the context of an ongoing energy options study being carried out
*        under Bank sector work.  Various energy conservation-related promotional
activities have also been carried out, but in a sporadic and uncoordinated
manner, and have not led to significant interest among major energy users.
More recently, however, with the financial difficulties brought about by
depressed domestic market conditions, industrial establishments are now
looking at energy conservation and rationalization as a means of improving
their cost efficiency in the short run, and their international competitive-
ness in the long run.



a2-
4.        In order to provide an institutional focus for energy conservation
activities, the Government has decided to establish an Energy Conservation
Center, for which the lesal nd administrative requirements were completed in
January 1987 with the incorporation of a new company, P.T. Konservasi Energi
Abadi (KOEIUA), in the form of an autonomous, commercial subsidiary company of
P.T. Pupuk griwidjaja (JPUSRr)  the largest fertilizer company in Indonesia,
and four other Indonesian fertilizer companies.-   KONESA has been broadly
entrusted with planning, coordination, training, promotion, research, and
energy auditing and monitoring tasks related to energy conservation. In the
initial years, KONEBA is expected to focus its activities on the industrial
sector.
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would assist the
Government to establish the institutional fraework and policies to improve
the planning, promotion, coordination, implementation and monitoring of energy
conservation activities. The project would, in parallel, demonstrate the
benefits of energy conservation in industry through the implementation of an
energy efficiency scheme in PUSRI.
6.        Prolect Description.  The proposed project would support the estab-
lishment of an Energy Conservation Center, m[NEBA, to assist in reducing
energy costs through conservation and rationalization activities. In
particular, the proposed project would help KONERA to: (i) prepare a compre-
hensive energy conservation program for the industrial sector and set energy-
related norms for industrial energy use by industry subsectors and products;
(ii) carry out promotional campaigns and coordinate technical assistance to
help enterprises identify and implement energy conservation measures; and
(iii) provide training in energy conservation, including training for
independent energy auditors and energy managers of industrial enterprises. In
addition, the project would enhance PUSRI's overall production efficiency
through modifications to three  mmonia plants directed towards increasing
energy efficiency and effective capacity. The plants' heat recovery systems,
furnaces and associated equipment would be upgraded and modern energy-saving
equipment such as superheat burners, low-pressure boilers and molecular sieves
would be installed. The project is expected to result in: (i) a 10Z reduction
in PUSRI's current energy use per ton of ammonia, and (ii) a corresponding 121
increase in effective production capacity in three plants. Upon completion of
the project, the available energy use per ton of ammonia is expected to
decline from 38.3 u_ tu to 34.3 _mltu.
7.        The total project cost is estimated at US$29.4 million equivalent,
including estimated taxes of US$900,000. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$21.0 million, or 741 of the total project cnmt, net of taxes,
of US$28.5 million. Including interest during construction, the total
financing requirement is estimated at US$36.1 million, of which US$25.0 mil- -
lion (69Z) is in foreign exchnge. The proposed Bank loan of US$21.0 million
equivalent would cover about 582 of the total financing requirement, including
taxes, and finance 1001 of the foreign exchange requirements, excluding
1/   P.T. Gresik, P.T. Iskander Muda, P.T. Kaltim, and P.T. Kujang.

interest during construction. For the KONEBA Energy Conservation Center
component, PUSRI and the other shareholders would meet the interest during
construction costs and all the local costs through equity contributions. For
the PUSRI energy efficiency component, PUSRI would meet the interest during
construction costs and the local costs through internal cash generation.
Under Subsidiary Loan Agreements, the Government would on-lend about 212 of
the total Bank loan (US$4.5 million) to KONEBA, and the remaining 792 of the
Bank loan (US$16.5 million) to PUSRI. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 5959-IND, dated September 16, 1987, is being
distributed separately.
8.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, it was agreed that as condi-
tions of effectiveness of the proposed loan, the Government would execute
Subsidiary Loan Agreements with: (a) KONEBA, with lending terms of 15 years,
including 5 years of grace, at a 13.5% p.a. fixed interest rate, and
(b) PUSRI, with lending terms of 10 years, including 4 years of grace, at a
13.52 p.a. fixed interest rate. In view of its recent establishment, KONEBA
has been given longer repayment and grace periods than PUSRI to help
facilitate an efficient start-up of operations. In addition, assurances were
obtained during negotiations that (a) the Government would not take any action
which would prevent PUSRI, operating efficiently, from earning a reasonable
return, after taxes, on its assets (except fixed assets not yet in service);
(b) PUSRI would make available, in a timely manner, all funds, including
working capital, as and when required to enable KONEBA to carry out its tasks;
and (c) KONEBA would complete by December 31, 1987, the design, installation
and operation of an accounting system to record all of its financial
transactions.
9.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through the proposed project, the
Bank would support the Government's primary objective in the energy sector to
increase the economic and technical efficiency of energy use, an objective
which has taken on increased importance in recent years due to the country's
severe resource constraints. A major element of the Government's energy
strategy is to shift domestic energy consumption away from heavy reliance on
oil towards the use of alternative resources which can be exploited with gains
in economic efficiency. A second element of the Government's strategy, which
would be the primary focus of the proposed project, is to generate energy
savings through improvements in the technical efficiency of energy use. The
principal lever the Government has used to implement this strategy has been
pricing, and in recent years, Indonesia has made significant progress towards
setting energy prices at levels which reflect long-term economic costs.
Domestic energy prices are now, by and large, close to international price
levels, although some adjustments need to be made to relative prices.
Nevertheless, in order to realize fully the potential for energy conservation
and savings, there is a need to carry out an extensive promotional campaign,
disseminate information on conservation-related technologies and potential
benefits, and provide support for research, training and technical issistance
to complement this pricing policy. The proposed project would help the



Government to establish the institutional capacity to meet this objective, and
to demonstrate the potential for energy savings through energy efficiency
investments in fertilizer plants.
10.       Justification.  The establishment of the KONEBA Esergy Conservation
Center wou ldhelpIndonesia to meet the substantial potential demand for
energy conservation services and would complement the Government's efforts to
promote energy conservation through appropriate incentives including a
realistic energy pricing policy. The energy efficiency investments in PUSRI
would provide a modest demonstration of the economic benefits to be derived
from energy conservation measures. These investments are expected to result
in substantial financial and economic benefits. The financial and economic
rates of return are estimated at 41Z, and 50Z, respectively, in 1987 US
dollars. The results of the sensitivity tests indicate that the project would
remain financially and economically viable under reasonable changes in the
main project parameters which are capital cost and output prices. The project
is also expected to generate foreign exchange savings of about US$62 million
in real terms over the project's eccnomic life, or an average of US$6.2
million per year.
11.       Risks.  Although the success of the project will depend to a large
extent on the Government's ability to sustain a sound pricing policy
environment, the technical, financial and commercial risks associated with the
project are minimal. The energy conservation measures that would be imple-
mented by KONEBA and PUSRI are based on proven technology and practices. The
financing requirements are modest, and the expected financial and economic
returns are high. There is, however, . risk that KOn. \ may not be able to
realize fully the potential for energy savings in the economy, since its
ability to do so will depend on the effectiveness of the promotional campaigns
that it would undertake and on the quality of the technical assistance that it
would provide to beneficiaries. KONEBA's organization and work program have
therefore been formulated around such considerations. KONEBA would, in
addition, be assisted by capable consultants. Risks associated with the PUSRI
energy efficiency component are minimal; PUiRI has an impressive record of
efficiency in implementing and commissioning complex fertilizer projects.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
