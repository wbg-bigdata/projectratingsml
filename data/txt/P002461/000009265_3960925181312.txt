(Cr.1465-SQ)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fisheries Exploration/Pilot Project
in Somalia for which Credit 1465-SO in the amount of SDR 12.9 million (US$13.5 million equivalent)
was approved on May 1, 1934. The actual closing date was April 30, 1990, two and a half years
behind schedule. SDR 60,d00 remains undisbursed. The last disbursement was on September 25,
1990. The credit account cannot be closed because the special account cannot be reconciled due to
the civil war in the country.
Parts I and Im of the report were prepared with the assistance of the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program and finalized by the Agriculture Operations Division, Country Department II,
Africa Regional Office. Parts I and mH cannot be sent to the Borrower for comment because of the
c.vil war.
Due to the security situation in Somalia, field visits did not take place. The report is a desk
study based, inter alia. on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECf7 COWLETON REPORT
SOMALIA
FISHERES EXPLORATION/PILOT PROJECT
(Cr.1465-S2)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.     The project aimed to lay the foundation for Somalia to: (i) determine the feasibility and
financial viability of offshore catching of a variety of pelagic species known to be present in
considerabie abundance in North Somali waters: (ii) test critical assumptions for the development of
the artisanal fisheries in the project area and to provide a framework for future income and
employment generation to one of the poorest parts of the country; and (iii) develop an institutional
framewvork for long-term public and private sector activities through the operation of an autonomous
enterprise, providing services to the fisheries subsector. The project was to be implemented over a
three-year period by the Northeast Coast Fisheries Enterprise (NECFISZI).
Implementation Experience
2.      The project became effective on October 12, 1984, four months after signing. The
conditions of credit effectiveness were met and initial implementation of the offshore component was
good. A consulting firm was hired to design and execute the exploratory fishing program. Under this
contract, there was also a subcontractor for scientific services. Later in 1985, however, the
relationship between the consultant team and NECFISH became problematic. The contract was
*          terminated in mi-1986 and the subcontractor carried on the remainder of the program. A final report
was produced at the end of 1987.
-          3.      The inshore program ran into problems from the start. The contribution from the Arab
Fund, which was supposed to provide $3.5 million for this component, could not become effective
because of Govemment of Somalia (GOS) arrears to the Fund. After its withdrawal, DANIDA
became the cofinancing agency. The component was reformulated with a cost of about $9.5 million,
$3.0 million higher than appraisal estimates. This resulted mainly from the increased cost of
construction of the turnkey shore facilities and the incremental costs of interim facilities.
Construction was on schedule.
4.      Following results of initial operations at Candala, it was found that because of the extremely
hot climate, it was impracticable to store fish on ice at the receiving station and transport it to
Bossaso for freezing. The quality of the fish could not be retained. Thus it was decided that the



- iv -
original concept of a fresh fish collection and transport system should be replaced with a system of
freezing fish as soon as possible after landing at each of the stations. This meant equipping the
collector vessel with 20-foot containers for frozen fish and the installation of additional freezer plants.
5.      The lack of autonomy of NECFISH in financial and employment matters also created
problems iluring implementation. Contrary to stipulations that NECFISH should be financially
autonomous, it experienced Government interference that affected its ability to operate in a
commercially effective manner. NECFISH had to depend on the Government for budgetary
allocation, which was often inadequate. The Government also flxed fish prices and interfered with
setting salaries and hiring. Despite these shortcomings, training was provided for the plant workforce
at Bossaso, fish purchase and credit staff and fishermen. Control, monitoring and reporting systems
for fish purchasing, fuel and gear sales and credit sales of fishing boats were established. The staff
to operate the systems were recruited and trained. The project closing date was extended twice to
April 30, 1990. Total project cost was estimated at US$22.4 million equivalent, 13 percent over
appraisal estimates.
Results
6.      The offshore component was successful in providing information that d'etermined the
feasibility of large scale offshore fishing in the area. Although the results were negative, the objective
was met. As for the inshore component, the failure of transporting catches on a fresh fish basis
increased capital and operating costs to the extent that its financial rate of return was negative.
Consultants prepared a feasibility study for the future of the inshore facilities. It concluded that the
facilities were not financially viable unless additional investments were made to increase levels of
throughput and utilization of facilities.
Sustainability
7.       The inshore facilities as at the end of the project were not sustainable. A study carried
out with DANIDA and IDA technical assistance concluded that several conditions were necessary
for the operations to become viable. It recommended that a foreign commercial company be invited
to assist in the operations of the facilities. Such company should have direct access to fish markets
and to refrigerated reefer transport in the area, have experience in dealing with small scale fishing
operations and marketing of tropical fish and offer a support package to assist small scale fishermen.
Two joint venture candidates were identified, but since the country was thrown into a state of civil
war in 1990, nothing has materialized. There is no question of sustainability for the offshore
component, since all operations have come to an end.
Lessons Leamed
8.      The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a) It was wise to carry out pilots before rushing into large investment projects;
(b) A pilot project should include the minimum investments for testing out technologies.
While the offshore component was correctly designed, the size of the inshore program



-~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~V
was incommensurate with its pilot nature.  When the technology failed, the
Government was larded with a network of unprofitable facilities.
(c) After an institution has been set up, there is often vested interest within the
Government to maintain the status quo. While the Bank saw the establishment of
NECFISH as a transitional development to private sector involvement, the Government
resisted relinquishing control and restructuring the enterprise.
(d) Project results show that offshore fishing in the project area is unlikely to be profitable.
Inshore fishery has demonstrated potential but a number of issues need to be resolved,
such as the technology for transporting fish and catching high value species, the
involvement of the private sector and the transformation of NECFISH into a
commercial enterprise. When the Bank resumes lending in Somalia, these issues should
be looked into carefully in our future involvement in this sector.

Sub-sector     :  Fisheries
2. Background
2.1     With an average per capita income of about US$ 170, Somalia is among the poorest
countries in the world. Moreover, the hostile physical environment, the general lack of physical and
institutional infrastructure, and scattered population centers have created serious obstacles to
development of the country.
2.2     The 1981 Somalia Agricultural Sector Review emphasized thc need to strengthen and
develop certain key areas of the sector. Important were those which generate increased production
and exports in the short-run. The sector strategy called for the development of underutilized
resources (including activating sunk capital), the expansion of private sector incentives and
opportunities, and the establishment of additional export markets to increase foreign exchange
earnings. The Review also identified the potential importance of the fisheries subsector to the
country. T`he subsector was still largely underdeveloped not only because of envirommental and
infrastructure obstacles, but also because of inadequate subsector strategy, and financial and
manpower constraints.
2.3     Situated in the northeastern corner of Africa, Somalia has a coastline of about 3,000
kilometers. Adverse conditions that hamper a fullei exploitation of the fisheries resources include:
lack of natural hai bors; a continental shelf which is too narrow and too rough for large scale trawling;
the absence of adequate physical and institutional infrastructure; and uncertainties about seasonal
variations in distribution and abundance of fish resources. Data gathered by fishery research vessels
in the area, the most notable being that of the FAO/NORAD survey ves,cl R.V. Fridtjof Nansen,
indicate good availability of pelagic stocks. The major resources are the small pelagic species located
off the north and northeast coast. However, because no successful modern commercial fishery has
been conducted, it is recognized that the first attempts should be exploratory and expanded only as
more experience and data are gained.



-2-
2.4      The strategy of the Government of Somalia's (GOS) five-year development plan called for
modifications of fisheries policy including: privatization of vessel ownership; abolition of the fixed
price system for fish marketing; liberalization of trade in fish and fish products; cessation of free
s;upply of boats and gear, and institutional changes. As a first stage, the Ministry of Fisheries had
created two autonomous enterprises in the fishing industry.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1     The project aimed to lay the foundation for Somalia to: (i) determine the feasibility and
financial viability of offshore catching of a variety of pelagic species known to be present in
considerable abundance in North Somali waters: (ii) test critical assumptions for the development of
the aitisanal fisheries in the project area and to provide a framework for future income and
employment generation to one of the poorest parts of the country; and (iii) develop an institutional
framework for long-term public and private sector activities through the operation of an autonomous
enterprise, providing services to the fisheries subsector.
3.2     The project was to be implemented over a three year period by the Northeast Coast
Fisheries Enterprise (NECFISH) and had three components:
(a) Offshore Fisheries: financing of two chartered purse seiners to be deployed in North
Somali waters for a period of up to two years, a vessel to provide the necessary support
services, purse seine fishing trials in order to determine the catch rates, species
composition and seasonal variation of pelagic fish stocks in the project area; and
concu;rrent biological and oceanographic observations critical for evaluation of the
future financial and economic basis of a pelagic fishery.
(b) Inshore Fisheries:
(i)    Bolimog. Provision of fish receiving, processing and transport facilities,
supported by low capital cost shore facilities.
(ii)    Bossaso and Candala. Installation of additional modestly scaled fish receiving
facilities at these points including repairs to existing jetties and facilities to
service outlying fishing villages.
(iii)   Fish Collection and Trans-shipment Vessels Provision of two vessels to support
inshore activities, a vessel for fish collection from coastal villages, and a trans-
shipment vessel to deliver frozen product from Bolimog to the cold storage at
Berbera and to resupply Bolimog.
(iv)    FLshing Boats and Gear. Purchase of small fishing boats and appropriate gear
under a credit program administered by the North East Coast Fisheries
Enterprise (NECFISH) in collaboration with the Somali Development Bank
(SDB).
(c) Technical assistance to: assist in the management, setting up and operation of the
inshore facilities, provide training to pro"-ct area fishermen mainly in the areas of boat,



-3.
gear and engine maintenance, supervise and carry out the offshore exploratory fisheries
program and provide training for senior and mid-level cadres in the specialized fields
of fisheries management and ddministration; and training of personnel capable of
operating fully eqgipped modern fishing vessels, gear and engine room equipment.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1     The original project proposal was prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program
at the request of GOS. The project identified followed a traditional approach to the development
of artisanal fisheries, almost entirely relying on existing Government institutions and oriented to the
public sector. The Bank thought that such a design was unlikely to lead to sound future
development. Subsequently, the Bank and IFC sent a mission to Somalia to identify ways to promote
private sector involvement in fisheries. Following a period of discussions and investigation, an
IFC/IDA review concluded that this project would not be attractive to conventional commercial
investment because of the high risks due to uncertainties regarding catch rates, species composition
and seasonal variation. Consideration of these uncertainties led to an IDA proposal for an
exploratory pilot project.
4.2     The exploratory nature of the project was correct and was the key to the success of the
offshore fisheries component. With a modest amount of funds, GOS was able to determine whether
a profitable commercial offshore operation was feasible in this area before undertaking any major
investment in infrastructure. The inshore component, however, was not as sharply focused because
of a divergence in intentions between GOS and the Bank. The Bank had wanted to carry out the
pilot for offshore fisheries before making any other investment for fishery in this area. GOS,
however, insisted on a larger capital investment project to develop one of the poorest parts of the
country. The Bank eventually gave in and agreed to include an inshore component but only on a
pilot scale to test out the technology for artisanal fisheries. The final design, however, involved a
scale of operations incommensurate with the pilot nature.
4.3     The implementing agency was the newly established NECFISH, an enterprise wholly owned
by the Government with legal and financial autonomy, and powers to recruit on acceptable pay scales.
The establishment of NECFISH was seen as a necessary step to provide the mechanism for future
private sector and possible IFC investment in the fisheries sector. Given the uncertainties of the
operation and unwillingness of the private sector to participate at this stage, this was considered the
best option. The drawback was that once established, it might be difficult to discontinue support to
the enterprise even when the operation proved to be non-viable.
5. Project Implementation
5.1     The project became effective on October 12, 1984, four months after signing. The
conditions of credit effectiveness were met and initial implementation of the offshore component was
good. A consulting firm was hired to design and execute the exploratory fishing program. Under this
contract, there was also a subcontractor for scientific services involving collection, analysis and
reporting of data related to exploratory fishing operations. For logistical reasons, it was decided that
the consultant team should be based in Djibouti where the project vessel could receive adequate
servicing. Later in 1985, however, the relationship between the consultant team and NECFISH



4-
became problematic. The friction was due to the absence of agreed procedures for administration,
financial control and reporting, which were not clearly defined in the contract. There were also
differences in opinion on the fishing meth(;ds and gear. Attempts for the two parties to enter into
a supplementary agreement on administrative guidelines failed. The contract was finally terminated
in mid-1986 and the subcontractor carried on the remainder of the proj'ram. A final report was
produced at the end of 1987 (see para. 18).
5.2     The inshore program ran into problems from the start. The contribution from the Arab
Fund, which was supposed to provide $3.5 million for the shore and processing facilities, the purchase
of small fishing boats and gear and the refit of the support vessel, could not become effective because
of GOS arrears to the Fund. Afier its withdrawal, pending resolution of the funding impasse, the
GOS decided in December 1985 to reallocate some IDA credit funds to launch an Accelerated
Implementation Program (AIP) as a means of establishing interim facilities in the project area that
would allow initiation ot fisheries development activities up to the start of the next fishing season in
September 1986. Government also contacted DANIDA as a potential cofinancier. Finance for the
processing facilities was provisionally committed by DANIDA in May 1986 and finally approved in
October 1986. AIP was reformulated into an Extended AIP in order to make maximum use of the
fishing seasons up to the time the DANIDA funded facilities would be completed at the end of 1987.
5.3     When DANIDA reappraised the component, it was reformulated in this way:
(a) relocation of the main processing facilities from Bolimog to Bossaso. The reason was
that the infrastructure in Bossaso was to be strengthened by Italian aid.
(o) construction of the main shore facilities on a turnkey basis; and
(c) relocation of a substation from Bossaso to Habo which would be closer to the main
plant.
The reformulated component was to be implemented over a 30-month po-riod from DIcember 1986
till Jur.e 1988. The reformulated cost of the inshore program (including contingencies) was about
$9.5 million, $3.0 million higher than appraisal estimates, This resulted mainly from the increased
cost of construction of the turnkey shore facilities and the incremental costs of interim facilities under
AIP and EAIP.
5.4     Construction started on schedule. During 1987, most of the facilities were imtalled;
rehabilitation of seven boats was completed within the budget. By June 1989, the plant at Habo. a-s
delivered and put into operation, collecting chilled and frozen products. Fourteen imported fishing
boats arrived and were distributed to fishermen, some on credit, others for cash. There were
problems with the project's .najor vessels. AWDAL, a government-owned vessel was designated as
a collector vessel for transshipment of frozen product from Bossaso to Berbera. Its refurbishment,
however took more than five months and exceeded the original estimate by 50 percent. In March,
1989, the main engine of AWDAL broke down and reduced the ability to transfer fish to Berbera.
Repair work of a second fish collector and a landing craft was also delayed.



-5-
5.5     Following results of initial operations at Candala, it was found that because of the extremely
hot climate, it was impracticable to store fish on ice at the teceiving station and transport it to
Bossaso for freezing. The quality of the fish could not be retained. Thus it was decided that the
original concept of a fresh fish collection and transport system should be replaced with a system of
freezing fish as soon as possible after landing at each of the stations. This meant equipping the
collector vessel with 20-foot containers for frozen fish and the installation of additional freezer plants
at Habo and Bereda.
5.6     The lack of autonomy of NECFISH in financial and employment matters also created
problems during implementation. Contrary to stipulations that NECFISH should be financially
autonomous, it experienced these difficulties stemming from central control: (a) inadequate budgetary
allocation; (b) restrictions on retention of foreign exchange earnings; (c) Government interference
in setting salaries and hiring; (d) fixing of fish purchase prices by the Ministry of Fisheries and (d)
other bureaucratic impediments such as controls on the use of NECFISH's bank accounts and various
requirements imposed by the Ministry of Finance in relation to the utilization of and accounting
practices for local currency funds. The effect of these problems was to reduce the ability of the
enterprise to operate in a commercially effective manner.
5.7     Training was provided for the plant workforce at Bossaso, fish purchase and credit staff and
fishermen. This enabled production at the plant to be built up in a short time. Control, monitoring
and reporting systems for fish purchasing, fuel and gear sales and credit sales of fishing boats were
established. The staff to operate the systems were recruited and trained. Training of fishermen was
done by the Masterfisherman. But the low sales of equipment under the credit did not suggest that
new fishing methods had been adopted to any extent.
5.8     The project closing date was extended twice to April 30, 1990. Total project cost was
estimated at US$22.4 million equivalent, 13 percent over appraisal estimates. While the offshore
component was less than estimated, the inshore component was almost twice as high as the original
estimate (Table 4).
6. Project Results
6.1     The offshore component was successful in providing information that determined the
feasibility of large scale offshore fishing in the area. Although the results were negative, the objective
was met. Results showed that purse seining was not a feasible method of harvesting commercial
quantities of either large or small pelagic in the project area. Most schools of fish were small and
scattered. Large pelagic were generally susceptible to purse seining for only three months (October-
December) each year. Small pelagic were below required levels either for food fish or for fish meal
and oil, and world prices were poor for these fish species. Other fishing methods were used, such
as trawling, long lining, gill netting and jigging, but the catch rates showed that commercial offshore
fishing was not feasible in this area.



-6-
6.2     As for the inshore component, the failure of transporting catches on a fresh fish basis
increased capital and operating costs to the extent that its financial rate of return was negative. A1
Based on experimental fishing, process.ng and marketing results, consultants prepared a feasibility
study for the future of the inshore facilities. It concluded that the facilities were not financially viable
unless additional investments were made to increase levels of throughput and utilization of facilities.
It prepared financial analyses of several options for additional investments and found that they could
have acceptable internal rates of return if the full costs of the pilot project were written off as sunk
costs. The profitability of the operations would also depend on a significant lobster throughput. The
Bank and DANIDA thought that it was premature to proceed with the development of such
operation and a corresponding follow up project because of the still very limited operational
experience in inshore fishing, the uncertainties surrounding the institutional/ownership structure of
the operating company and the justification and feasibility of continued exclusive public sector
financing.
6.3     In consideration of these issues, the Government and NECFISH proposed a Transitionary
Phase of one or two years. The project closing date therefore was extended twice to April 30 1990.
The scope of activities during the extension period would be focused on: (1) the gradual expansion
of production by utilizing essentially the existing facilities, and (2) working towards transforming
NECFISH from an agency administering exploratory activities into a commercially self-sustaining
enterprise, by adopting appropriate organizational and management structure and seeking additional
financial and management resources through mixed ownershipfjoint venture arrangement. However,
at project completion, a suitable institutional/policy framework for the company was not defined, and
the efforts of project management were not successful to transform NECFISH into a commercially
self-sustaining enterprise.
7. Sustainability
7.1     The inshore facilities as at the end of the project were not sustainable. A study carried out
with DANIDA and IDA technical assistance concluded that several conditions were necessary for the
operations to become viable. It recommended that a foreign commercial company be invited to assist
in the operations of the facilities. Such company should have direct access to fish markets and to
refrigerated reefer transport in the area, have experience in dealing with small scale fishing operations
and marketing of tropical fish and offer a support package to assist small scale fishermen. Two joint
venture candidates were identified, but since the country was thrown into a state of civil war in 1990,
nothing has materialized.
7.2     There is no question of sustainability for the offshore component, since all operations have
come to an end. There is, however, a need to preserve the data generated by the fishing trials.
When the Bank resumes operation in Somalia, this issue should be taken up with the Government.
The trials have yielded a wealth of information on fishery resources in the area. A record of the
results would avoid future duplication of such efforts.

-7-
& Bank Performance
8.1     The Bank was correct in intending to refrain from committing large capital investments
before finding out the availability of resources in the area. However, it failed to resist GOS pressures
to include an inshore program aimed more at area development instead of a pilot program for testing
the technology for artisanal fishing. The appraisal mission was candid in discussing project risks,
including the logistical problems associated with the area's remoteness and Government interference
in the operations of NECFISH. However, it did not discuss the possibility that the results of the
trials would be negative. At the end, there was considerable Government pressure for the Bank and
donors to continue support for NECFISH even when the operations were not lucrative.
8.2     Bank supervision in 1985 (4.4 staff weeks) was particularly low but picked up in subsequent
years, though the ratio of supervision time to preparation/appraisal remained a low 1:3. Some
supervision missions weie staffed with fisheries specialists. Their input was found useful by NECFISH
management and contributed substantially to the project's successful implementation. Bank
supervision missions also worked hard to bridge the financing gap and modify the schedule of
activities so that the momentum of initiatives was not lost while new financing was being finalized.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1     The Borrower's objective of developing the country's poorest region was justifiable.
However, in view of the uncertainties concerning the resources and the appropriate technology, the
scale of operations it pushed for was incompatible with the exploratory nature of the project. During
implementation, GOS's interference in NECFISH's affairs affected its effect on NECFISH's ability
to operate commercially. Despite these problems and the lack of experience, NECFISH implemented
the project basically as designed.
10. Project Relationship
10.1    The relationships between the Bank and the Borrower appear to have been agreeable with
both sides willing to accommodate the other's wishes for changes in the project when these became
necessary. The close cooperation between the Bank and NECFISH was exemplary. The relationships
between NECFISH, the Govemment and the consulting techriical assistance staff were generally
smooth. Towards the end of the project, DANIDA took issue with the Bank for not maintaining
sufficient interest in the project until a joint venture had been negotiated. This was subsequently
remedied by a ioint mission, where agreement was reached with GOS on a plan of action.
11. Consulting Services and Studies
11.1    The project financed the posts of the general manager and the financial controller of
NECFISH. Consultants' services for planning, execution and analysis of the offshore exploration/pilot
program, as well as the implementation of the inshore fisheries program were financed by the project.
It was recognized at appraisal that project implementation would be heavily dependent on the use
of expatriates, because qualified Somalis were not available. Except for the difficulties with the initial
consultant team manager for the offshore component, technical assistance was effective.



-8-
11.2    The project financed a corporate feasibility study under the Project Preparation Facility.
llie concept and design which emerged from the study recommended having legally separate but
integrated private sector Somali companies develop the exploitation of the North Somali fish
resources. Towards the end of the project, a final feasibility study was conducted. It summarized the
findings of the pilot components, evaluated their viability and proposed options for future
development.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1    The SAR was well understood by all parties concerned and was useful in monitoring project
progress throughout. The consultants retained by tb- . rower produced reports regularly. These
were complemented by detailed reports commiss;-..ed by,. ANIDA.
13. L}ssons Learned
13.1    The lessons learned are summarized as folows:
(a) It was wise to carry out pilots before rushing into large investment projects;
(b) A pilot project should include the minimum investments for testing out technologies.
While the offshore component was correctly designed, the size of the inshore program
was incommensurate with its pilot nature.  When the technology failed, the
Government was landed with a network of unprofitable facilities.
(c) After an institution has been set up, there is often vested interest within the
Government to maintain the status quo. While the Bank saw the establishment of
NECFISH as a transitional development to private sector involvement, the Government
resisted relinquishing control and restructuring the enterprise.
(d) Project results show that offshore fishing in the project area is unlikely to be profitable.
Tnshore fishery has demonstrated potential but a number of issues need to be resolved,
such as the technology for transporting fish and catching high value species, the
involvement of the private sector and the transformation of NECFISH into a
commercial enterprise. When the Bank resumes lending in Somalia, these issues should
be looked into carefuDly in our future involvement in this sector.

Comment
The official credit closing date was extended three times by 2-1/4 years to April 30, 1990 in
order to complete civil and installation works for shore facilities, to allow for completion
of the inshore exploratory program, and to transform NECPISH into a commercially self-
sustaining enterprise, or to find a suitable joint venture partner. However, the credit
account could not be formally closed due to the civil war in the country.
