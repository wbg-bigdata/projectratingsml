MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS TO INDIA AND STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL FINANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed Bank loans
of US$310.0 million to India and US$50.0 million to the Steel Authority of
India Limited (SAIL) with the guarantee of India, is submitted for approval.
The proposed Bank loans would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate to help finance an Industrial
Finance and Technical Assistance project.
2.      Background.  Manufacturing in India accounted for about 17% of GDP
and about 732 of exports in FY86, employing approximately 25Z of the
country's organized labor force. During the Sixth Five Year Plan (FY81-85),
the performance of manufacturing was disappointing as growth in manufacturing
gross value added averaged only 4.3% p.a. in real terms and manufactured
exports expanded only 2.8% p.a. The Government has recognized the need for
reform in industrial policies and has begun to place greater reliance on
price signals and market forces. In particular, the new policies have
emphasized greater domestic competition through delicensing and reduction of
Government controls, and improved export competitiveness through exchange
rate management and greater access by exporters to imported inputs at world
market prices. There is evidence that the reforms to date are having posi-
tive effects. Average annual manufacturing output growth accelerated to
almost 9% p.a. in real terms in the last three years and growth in manufac-
tured exports reached 9.3% in FY86 and 11.8% in FY87.
3.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed Industrial Finance and
Technical Assistance Project would support the substantial progress in policy
reform made over the past three years and the concomitant adjustments in both
the industrial and financial sectors. As the Government becomes less
involved in determining industrial capacity for the Indian market through the
licensing system, the responsibility for selecting industrial projects falls
more on the financial system, especially the development finance institutions
(DFIs), creating a need for them to improve appraisal and risk assessment
capabilities. Increased competition is also causing a shake-out of less
efficient firms with potentially adverse implications for the portfolios of
financial institutions, requiring improved project supervision and stricter
portfolio management. Finally, it has become increasingly apparent that
industries in key subsectors are in need of restructuring in order to bring
industrial production costs and product quality closer to international
standards.
4.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project would assist the Government
in dealing with the adjustment process in both the financial system and the
industrial sector. It would provide: (a) financial and technical support to
the two largest DFIs, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and the
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI), to help
them meet their requirements for long term resources and to strengthen their
capacity to appraise projects effectively in a less regulated environment and
to cope with the more difficult portfolio management problems stemming from
the adjustment process; and (b) technical assistance to the major Government
steel company, SAIL, to enable it to prepare through appropriate studies the
physical restructuring of its operations in order to be able to produce steel
at lower costs to downstream users in the domestic economy. The proposed
loans would be the first to support the direct lending of IDBI and to support
SAIL, but would continue the Bank's long standing association with ICICI.



-2-
5.      Project Description.  The proposed project would provide:
(a) US$200.0 million to IDBI and US$100.0 million to ICICI for on-lending to
to medium and large industrial enterprises to finance economically and finan-
cially viable projects (the US$300.0 million represent approximately 1.2%
of the two DFI's total resource requirement for the period 1988-1992, and 13%
of their foreign exchange requirements for the same period);
(b) US$5.0 million each to IDBI and ICICI for technical assistance to support
their institution building programs through development of staff training
programs in India and abroad; implementation of computerization programs
necessary to improve management information, credit decisions and portfolio
management; and consultancy services to upgrade the quality of management and
technical advice provided by the DFIs to their clients and associated
institutions; and (c) US$50.0 million for technical assistance for steel
sector restructuring, to finance consultancy assignments, training
activities, productivity studies and technical assistance related equipment
to help SAIL improve its operational efficiency. The total cost of the
prcject is US$868 million with an estimated foreign exchange component of
US$365 million (42%). The possibility is being explored of obtaining 450 mil-
lion yen (US$ 3.3 million equivalent) from the Japanese Cofinancing Grant
Facility with the Bank. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of the project's key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively, and a map
is also included. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7058-IN, dated March 2,
1988, is attached.
6.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed: (a) to relend to IDBI and
ICICI proceeds of the $310 million loan under terms and conditions specified
in subsidiary loan agreements (to be signed before loan effectiveness) at an
interest rate of 11X p.a., and to allow the DFIs to charge a final rate of
14% p.a. to subborrowers, with the foreign exchange risk borne by the
Government; and (b) to review the relending rates periodically in relation to
changes in inflation (present and projected inflation rates are 61 p.a.) and
other market conditions and adjust the relending rates as necessary to ensure
that the rate applicable to new subloans remains positive in real terms,
reflective of market conditions and sufficient to provide a reasonable spread
to the DFIs.
7.      IDBI and ICICI have agreed to:  (a) conduct their activities in
accordance with the policy, strategy, and collection statements, approved by
their respective boards, which cover a wide variety of issues including
institutional objectives, financial projections, and measures to improve
appraised standards and portfolio management; (b) maintain a maximum
debt:equity ratio of 12:1 and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2:1;
(c) utilize lending procedures and sub-loan Bank eligibility procedures
acceptable to the Bank, including a maximum limit on amount of proceeds from
the Bank loan for a single enterprise of $20.0 million, minimum economic and
financial rates of return on subprojects of 12% and 15% respectively, maximum
subloan maturities of 15 years including a maximum of three years of grace
and free limits of US$6.0 million for IDBI and ICICI with the first ten
subloans of IDBI subject to prior Bank approval; and (d) submit to the Bank
for comment three months before the beginning of eack fiscal year their
annual training programs and the list of candidates for foreign training
programs. SAIL has agreed to: (a) carry out its technical assistance
program in accordance with an implementation program agreed with the Bank;



-3-
and (b) submit to the Bank for comment the list of candidates for foreign
training programs.
8.      Benefits.  The proposed project would provide operational support
to the on-going dialogue on industrial policy reform in India and assist in
the adjustment process as it affects both the DFIs and the industrial sector.
The technical assistance programs and the policy, strategy and loan collec-
tion statements that were prepared in the context of appraisal of the Project
would support the DFrs in improving the quality of appraisals and the manage-
ment of risk and portfolio in the more difficult environment which is emerg-
ing as part of deregulation. The loan would provide needed term financing to
the DFIs and finance about 80 subprojects, resulting in investments of about
US$750 million.  The subprojects financed are expected to generate about
28,000 new full-time work places at an average cost per job of US$26,785.
9.      The Steel TA component would assist SAIL in complementing its
restructuring programs, aimed at lowering steel prices. This achievement
would benefit downstream users of steel, a group which, directly or
indirectly, includes almost all segments of the economy.
10.     The project would also have positive effects on the environment as
the DFIs have incorporated strong environment protection objectives in their
policy statements and the technical assistance to SAIL would help it comply
with the Government' s environmental standards.
11.     Risks.  The quality of the portfolio of the DFIs could deteriorate
further as a result of the more competitive environment and the effect of
possible future exchange rate adjustments on the repayment capacity of
enterprises which have borrowed abroad. The technical assistance programs
and collection strategies provided for under the Project would reduce this
risk.
12.     The risks on the steel technical assistance component are minimal.
SAIL is committed to the technical assistance program, is expected to have
sufficient internal cash generation to finance its share of the costs of the
technical assistance program and has made adequate arrangements for the
management and staffing of the various studies.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the oroposed loans.

1/  IDA Credit amounts for SDR-denominated Credits are expressed in terms of their
US dollar equivalents, as established at the time of Credit negotiations and as
subsequently presented to the Board.
2/  Undisbursed amounts for SDR-denominated IDA Credits are derived from cumulative
disbursements converted to their US dollar equivalents at the SDR/US dollar exchange
rate in effect on September 30, 1987, while original principal is based on the exchang(
rate in effect at negotiations. This accounts for the fact that in some cases, the
undisbursed balance as shown in US$ equivalent is higher than the original principal.
