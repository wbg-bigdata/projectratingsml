APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the rehabilitation and modern-
ization of the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Senegal (Regie). The objectives
are to enable the Regie to retain its vital role in the transport sector and
to reestablish its financial viability. The proposed loan/credit of US$9.6
million equivalent (loan US$6.4 million and credit US$3.2 million) would be
the second lending operation to Senegal for railway purposes.
ii.       Despite increased use of road transport, especially for agricul-
tural produce, the railway still carries about two-thirds of the country's
freight traffic and remains the most important means of land surface trans-
port. Eighty percent of freight traffic is either block train, bulk or cap-
tive traffic for which the railway will continue to provide the most economic
transportation. The railway system extends up to Bamako and provides Mali
with a low cost access to foreign markets. Under these circumstances, the
railway is expected to retain its key position in the region's transport
system. However, due to growing highway competition, high labor cost, and
inadequate operating efficiency, the financial situation of the Regie is
critical.
iii.      The results of the first railway project under Credit 96-SE have
been rather disappointing. The Regie's performance in physical terms im-
proved more slowly than anticipated but the physical targets have now been
reached about three years behind schedule. However, due to a sharp decrease
in groundnut traffic and an unexpected overall economic stagnation in Senegal
and Mali, the financial targets could not be achieved. The Regie continued
operating at a loss and its rate of return on net fixed assets remained nega-
tive, compared with a forecast of 4% for 1969/70, according to the 1966 ap-
praisal. Other commitments in the Credit Agreement were fulfilled only par-
tially, or not at all, particularly transport coordination, reduction in num-
ber of staff, and control of wages and salaries. The situation should improve
greatly with the implementation of the proposed investments and the supplemen-
tary action plan.
iv.       The Regie has an unsatisfactory liquid position resulting essen-
tially from large Treasury overdraft upon which it had to rely in recent years
in order to meet its cash requirements. Since it is unlikely that the Regie
will be able to reimburse the Treasury overdraft within a reasonable period,
the Bank recommended, and the Government agreed, that a debt clearing and
rescheduling operation should take place. Confirmation that all the Regie's
short-term debt to the Government as of December 31, 1971 be rescheduled
into medium-term debt effective July 1, 1972, followed by a reconversion,to be
effective July 1, 1973, of half of all the Regie's debt to the Government
as of December 31, 1971 into equity, and the remaining half into long-term
debt is a condition of loan credit effectiveness.



- ii -
v.        Pending completion of the Fourth Four-Year Plan (1973/74-1976/77),
to be prepared in 1972 as stated in the agreed Plan of Action, the Regie
and the Bank Group have prepared a project consisting of track renewal work,
rehabilitation of the Thies workshop, modernization of rolling stock and
technical assistance; it is to be completed within three years. This project,
which will be incorporated in the future Four-Year Plan, is designed to carry
on the physical rehabilitation of the Regie's equipment and to improve its
management, operations and finances. The total cost of the project is about
US$12.3 million equivalent, including contingencies. The proposed loan/
credit of US$9.6 million equivalent would cover the cost of the foreign ex-
change component of all items except six diesel locomotives already financed
by French suppliers' credit and the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), and
74% of the local currency costs of equipment and works.
vi.       In order to secure the maximum benefits from the modernization
and rehabilitation program, the Regie will need to retain technical assis-
tance and intensify staff training.
vii.      Government initiation of comprehensive transport and investment
planning forms an important part of the proposed project; up to now, lack
of qualified personnel has prevented satisfactory progress in this area.
viii.     The economic rate of return of the two major items in the project,
track renewal and workshop rehabilitation and modernization, is estimated,
respectively, at 17% and 18%. The financial benefits derived therefrom will
also be substantial. These, and the anticipated traffic level, are expected
to enable the Regie to eliminate operating deficits by 1974/75. By 1975/76,
the rate of return on net fixed assets in use is estimated to reach 2%, a
rate considered reasonable under the circumstances. The operating ratio
will be reduced to about 90%.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank Group operation of US$9.6 mil-
lion, consisting of a Bank loan of US$6.4 million and an IDA credit of
US$3.2 million. The proposed loan would be made to the Regie for a term of
25 years, including five years of grace. The proposed credit would be made
to the Government of Senegal and relent to the Regie on the terms and condi-
tions of the proposed Bank loan.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Senegal and the Regie des Chemins de Fer du
Senegal (Regie) have asked the Bank Group to help finance a project designed
to carry on the physical rehabilitation of the Regie's equipment and to im-
prove its management, operations and finances, pending the completion of the
Fourth Four-Year Plan (1973/74-1976/77). The project, expected to be com-
pleted within three years, consists of track renewal work, rolling stock and
motive power, workshop rehabilitation, technical services and training of
Regie staff. Total cost of the project is estimated at CFAF 3,169.5 million
(US$12.31 million equivalent). Toward this, a Bank loan of US$6.4 million
and an IDA credit of US$3.2 million are proposed to cover the major part of
the Regie's foreign exchange and 74% of its local cost requirements. As an
important part of the project, a Plan of Action has been agreed upon with
the Government and the Regie; the most important features of the Plan are
mentioned in this report and are summarized in an annex for easy reference.
1.02      This would be the second Bank Group lending operation to the Regie
since Senegal became independent; the first amounted to US$9 million equiva-
lent, of which three-fourths has been spent and the remainder will be fully
disbursed in June 1972. Prior to independence, a Bank loan was made (Loan
100-FR, 1954) for US$7.5 million equivalent to the Office Central des Chemins
de Fer d'Outre-Mer (OFFEROM) for dieselization.
1.03      Senegal Railways was created as a State-owned autonomous entity
in August 1960 out of that part of the former Dakar-Niger Railways situated
in the Republic of Senegal. Dakar-Niger Railways, serving what has now
become Senegal and Mali, was run by a single management with headquarters
at Thies, Senegal. Senegal Railways, while continuing to maintain its head-
quarters and workshops at Thies, inherited a share of the properties and net
assets of the former Dakar-Niger Railways, representing 62% of the total.
The remaining 38% became the Mali Railway, operating under independent con-
trol and management. From September 1960 until July 1963, all railway traf-
fic was discontinued between Senegal and Mali.  In 1966, the Association
granted a credit of US$9.1 million (95-MLI) for the development of the Mali
Railway and is now considering the appraisal of a second project to finance
part of its 1973-1976 railway program.
1.04      International traffic is regulated by an Agreement between the
Senegal and Mali Governments and by a Convention between the Senegal and
Mali Railways. The Convention provides for the handling of traffic and oper-
ations across the border, exchange of rolling stock, and common tariffs.
The Convention generally provides an adequate and practical basis for the
regulation of international traffic. International traffic is also facili-
tated by a Customs Agreement between the two countries, providing for tax-
free passage of Mali goods in Senegal. Cooperation between the two railways
is satisfactory, but the Regie has high receivables from the Mali Railway,
mainlv for frelght car rentals and maintenance services. The Association



- 2 -
has received confirmation that the Senegal Covernment has agreed to the pro-
posal made by the Mali Covernment to settle this debt in full through install-
ment payments up to mid-1974.
1.05      The Regie's performance has improved more slowly than anticipated
under Credit 96-SE. The physical targets have almost been reached, some
three years behind schedule, but progress toward achieving the financial
targets has lagged. The Regie was unable to contain the increase of ex-
penses to the expected rate, and growth of revenues from national and inter-
national traffic did not materialize as projected, due to a virtual economic
stagnation in both Senegal and Mali, and a sharp decrease in Senegal's grotend
nut production. Economic missions to Senegal and Mali reported, however,
that both economies are on an expansionary course again and are expected
to sustain it. 1/
1.06      The project fits well into the development strategy of the trans-
port sector advocated by the Government and the Bank Group, of modernization
and rationalization of existing facilities, feeder road construction and
improvement of transport and investment planning in the transport sector to
provide the economy with an adequate transport network.
1.07      This report is based on (a) findings of an appraisal mission to
Senegal in September 1971, consisting of Messrs. J. Brechot (engineer),
D. liavlicek and T. Nkodo (economists), and C.T. Vu (financial analyst);
and (b) data provided by three consultants' reports 2/.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Trends
2.01      In 1969, Senegal's per capita domestic product was estimated at
US$194, which is relatively high for West Africa 3/. However, since 1969,
Senegal has had a slow rate of economic development, hardly exceeding popu-
lation growth. GDP in constant prices increased by 2.6% per annum between
1961 and 1965, and only by 1.5% between 1966 and 1970. This economic stag-
nation, which also adversely affected the growth of the transport industry,
can be explained by many factors, the most important of which are:
(a) the dislocation of French West Africa in the early 1960's
with the advent of independence for the former colonies;
Dakar, and Senegal in general, had a central position in
1/   Report No. AW-15a, 1970 (Senegal) and Report No. AW-30a, 1971 (Mali).
2/   Etude d'Entretien Routier - Societe Louis Berger (USA), (1971); Prix de
Revient et Politique Tarifaire - SOFRERAIL (France), (1971); and Etude
de Reorganization des Transports de l'ONCAD - ITALCONSULT (Italy),
(1971).
3/   GDP per capita in Senegal is third in West Africa after that of the
Ivory Coast (US$280 in 1968) and Liberia (US$263 in 1969).



- 3 -
the administrative and economic organization of the
colonial territory, which was adversely affected by
independence;
(b) the loss of preferential prices for groundnuts in the French
market in 1967-1968, the adverse weather in recent years and
a restrictive Government policy with respect to the compensa-
tion of groundnut producers, which resulted in a decline of
production; and
(c) the acute rural exodus and the growing unemployment in the
towns.
2.02      The Government has now taken energetic measures to diversify agri-
cultural production and to restore confidence to farmers by raising producer
prices and paying various production and planting bonuses. The last economic
mission to Senegal (Report No. AW-1Sa) forecast an annual growth rate of 5.5%
p.a. for GDP in constant prices. This increase in the growth rate is explained
by the expected recovery in groundnut production, to be brought about by an
increase in the Government purchase price and the reorganization of the ground-
nut marketing system, as well as the favorable trends in the production of
other agricultural products and Government's policy of improving rural infra-
structure (see also para. 2.03). These measures are also expected to increase
demand for transport.
B.   The Transport Sector
(i) Development Strategy
2.03      Transport accounted for 6% of GDP in 1968.  During the first and
second development plans, 1961-1964 and 1965-1968, transport ranked high in
public investments, representing, respectively, 26% and 28% of total expend-
itures, with the major emphasis on roads and bridges. However, because of
the small size of investments in feeder road construction and improvement,
the expansion of the road network had little effect on agricultural produc-
tion. Government recognized this weakness in its development policy and
shifted its emphasis in the third development plan (1969-1972) to improving
the quality of rural transport infrastructure through increased construction
of feeder roads.
2.04      Investment in railways during the first and second development plans
amounted to CFAF 3.9 billion, representing 21% of total public investments in
transport infrastructure. This amount was used essentially for track renewal
and rehabilitation, the purchase of rolling stock and additional equipment to
meet higher levels of traffic, and the improvement of safety and operational
efficiency.
2.05      Government strategy in the transport sector is aimed at moderniza-
tion and rationalization of existing facilities, construction of feeder roads,
and improvement of transport and investment planning. Bank lending in the
sector since independence (1960) has been US$9.0 million in 1966 (Credit 96-SE)
for a railway rehabilitation and modernization program, US$4.0 million in 1967



-4-
for Dakar Port (Loan 493-SE) and US$2.1 million for feeder road construction
and technical assistance (Credit 198-SE). Another highway project for the im-
provement of road maintenance is now under preparation. Possible Bank Group
participation in the improvement of Dakar airport is being appraised.
(ii) The Transport System
2.06      The railway is the most important freight carrier in Senegal, ac-
counting for an estimated 65% of total freight traffic in 1970. The bulk of
this traffic is concentrated in phosphates, groundnuts and transit traffic
for Mali. Passenger traffic has declined substantially with the expansion
of the road network and the vehicle fleet. A full discussion of railway
traffic is presented in paragraphs 3.13 to 3.18.
2.07      Senegal's railway provides the landlocked Malian economy with its
main route to the sea. It is estimated that 36% of Mali's exports and 63%
of its imports pass through Dakar. These percentages are expected to in-
crease over the next five years as a result of transport coordination
measures adopted by the Malian Government. The international traffic rep-
resented 43% of the Regie's traffic and more than 52% of the Regie's traffic
revenues in 1969/70.
2.08      Senegal's road network totals over 9,000 km, of which 2,000 km are
paved. This network is concentrated in the coastal regions and the groundnut
areas, and the main roads partly parallel the railway lines. The vehicle
fleet increases on the average by 5.5% p.a. In 1968, there were about 53,000
vehicles in Senegal 1/, an increase of 32% over 1963.
2.09      River transport and coastal shipping are presently insignificant
in the country's transport system. Until now, Senegal has made little us
of the Gambia river in Gambia, although the navigable upstream branches of
this excellent waterway reach deep into Senegal's interior region. Senegal's
foreign trade is mainly concentrated in the Dakar port; the three main second-
ary ports are Ziguinchor on the Casamance river, Kaolack on the Saloum river
and St. Louis on the Senegal river.
2.10      Dakar has one of the main international airports in West Africa.
Domestic air passenger and freight traffic is insignificant. A dozen out-
lying towns are served by the national airline, Air-Senegal.
C.   Transport Policy and Coordination
2.11      Under Credit 96-SE (1966), Government agreed to move toward less re-
strictive transport policy and overall transport coordination. The long-term
objectives covered, inter alia, (a) the establishment of a non-discriminatory
transport policy and other Governmental policies affecting the transport sec-
tor; (b) the adoption of measures to ensure the adequacy of road user charges;
(c) the implementation of a cost-related and competitive pricing policy for
1/   Excluding diplomatic administrative and military vehicles.



- 5 -
the Regie; and (d) the use of economic criteria for public investment or dis-
investment in transport facilities. However, transport planning, policy mak-
ing and coordination are dispersed among the Ministry of Planning, the Minis-
try of Finance and the Ministry of Public Works, Urbanism and Transport, and
the transport sector is still hampered by a highly restrictive regulatory
system. Additionally, transport coordination and planning of public trans-
port investment on the basis of economic criteria suffers from a lack of
adequate data, particularly for road transport, and from a shortage of quali-
fied planning staff.
2.12      Present regulations of road traffic do not appear to be in line
with Government's stated transport policy objectives (para. 2.11). Entry
into goods transport is restricted by a stringent licensing policy. Road
user charges are estimated to be significantly higher than the costs of
providing and maintaining the roads. Since 80% of the Regie's traffic is
either block train bulk or captive traffic (paras. 3.13 to 3.18), there is
little danger of an uneconomic distribution of traffic between road and
rail, but high road user costs may have hampered the growth of generated
road traffic.
2.13      An attempt by Government in 1967 to solve the problem of rational
allocation of traffic through a committee 1/ representing the transport modes,
their main customers and Government was not successful because the committee
had no authority to deal with the difficult issues of distorted transport
prices and restrictive licensing of road transport. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with Government that, by a date not later than December
31, 1972, the Direction des Transports in the Ministry of Public Works, Urban-
ism and Transport will be responsible for formulation and implementation of
transport policy planning and coordination in close cooperation with the other
Ministries concerned. To assist in implementation of the policy objectives
outlined in paragraph 2.11, technical assistance is needed for (a) training
of planning staff; (b) improvement of data collection; (c) investment plan-
ning; (d) reviewing the effects of the regulatory system and other relevant
policies; and (e) studying the rationality of road user charges. During
negotiations, assurance has been received from Government that technical as-
sistance of two experts experienced in transport economics will be secured
for a period of about two years for the areas indicated above under terms of
reference to be agreed upon by the Bank Group. Tentative terms of reference
are included as Annex 1. Agreement has also been reached that the experts
will report to the Direction des Transports.
D.   Coordination of Groundnut Traffic
2.14      In 1965/66, it was agreed with the Association that Government,
through its agricultural agency, OCA (Office de Commercialisation Agricole),
would annually allocate 400,000 tons of groundnuts to the Regie. This was
resorted to because it was clear that anomalies in the market meant that
pricing did not result in distribution of groundnut traffic in accordance
1/   Comite Directeur des Transports du Material et des Produits Agricoles,
created by Decree No. 67-1119 of October 13, 1967.



- 6 -
with economic costs. Experience of the last five years showed that the
agreement failed because: (a) due to climatic and market conditions, ground-
nut production declined sharply since the peak harvest in 1965; (b) measures
to spread shipment of groundnuts evenly over a longer period did not have
the desired results because of inadequate storage facilities and organiza-
tional difficulties; and (c) the OCA (now ONCAD) 1/ failed to enforce road/
rail groundnut allocation.  Furthermore, rigid enforcement of the agreement
would not have brought about better cost-based transport coordination be-
cause the reduction of groundnut production changed the optimal economic
distribution of groundnut traffic in favor of road transport. Government
became increasingly concerned about this unsatisfactory situation and, in
1970, appointed consultants, ITALCONSULT, 2/ to determine, within the
framework of the overall reorganization of ONCAD under a Bank Group agri-
cultural project (Loan 548-SE/Credit 140-SE, 1969), the optimum distribution
of groundnut traffic between road and rail. However, due to a lack of ade-
quate cost data on road transport, the consultants initially used road and
rail tariffs as a criterion for the distribution of groundnut traffic.
2.15      For the reasons outlined above, allocation of traffic through the
price mechanism does not sufficiently ensure economic efficiency. Therefore,
at the request of the Association, Government confirmed during negotiations
that distribution of groundnut traffic between road and rail would be
determined annually in advance by ONCAD and the Regie, taking into account
the recommendations of the Comite Directeur des Transports du Materiel et
des Produits Agricoles, based on the forecast production of groundnuts
and on respective transport costs and service characteristics. 3/ The new
method of allocation of groundnut traffic hasboome effective with the
1971/72 groundnut harvest. In addition, the Regie plans to compete more
effectively with road transport through a scheme of more flexible tariffs
and improvements in the quality of service. Government's and the Regie's
measures are considered adequate to ensure distribution of groundnut traffic
between road and rail on a cost and market-oriented basis.
3. THE RAILWAYS
A.   Organization
3.01      The Regie is owned by the Government and regulated by a Presidential
Decree of October 1967. It is under the authority of the Minister of Public
Works, Urbanistn and Transport and is administered by a Board consisting of 18
members, including the Chairman nominated by the Minister of Transport. Eleven

- 7 -
members of the Board are Government representatives, the remainder representing
the Chambers of Commerce and Industry (3), the Trucking Industry (1), the
National Assembly (1), and railway personnel (2). The Director of Financial
Control and the Comptroller of Financial Operations, attached to the Presidency,
attend the Board meetings in a consultative capacity.
3.02      Except for the operating and capital budgets which, in addition to
review and endorsement by the Board, require specific approval of the Minis-
ters of Transport and Finances, the Board has overall authority for railway
administration. Its powers are delegated to the Chairman, subject to his re-
porting at least bi-annually to the Board at statutory meetings. The Chair-
man must also submit to the Board the investment programs, personnel policies
and borrowing operations. The Board may delegate part of its authority to a
Permanent Committee consisting of eight members.
3.03      The Manager, who is the chief executive officer of the Regie, is
appointed or dismissed by Presidential decree; he is responsible to the Board,
whose meetings he attends. The Manager agrees that he should be assisted by
a Deputy in the future; selection and training of a suitable individual was
discussed during negotiations. Annex 2 shows the present organization chart
of the Regie. The organization, similar to that of many other railways, is
satisfactory.
B.   Accounting
3.04      The Regie's accounting is maintained by the Central Accounting
Agency (ACC) 1/ under the control of the Ministries of Finance and Transport.
The chief accountant of the Regie, appointed or dismissed by a joint deci-
sion of the Ministers of Finance and Transport, acts as liaison officer
with the ACC. This organization, which serves some 18 public agencies,
provides a tight Government control over the finances of the Regie but
does not hinder the railway management, except for some delays due to its
heavy workload.
3.05      The accounting staff of the Regie is competent and capable of pro-
viding the management with all necessary financial information. However, the
accounts, as they are now being presented according to a "commercial" account-
ing method, do not give a detailed breakdown of income and expenses by sources
and by types of railway operations. It has been agreed during negotiations
that the Regie will accompany its existing accounts with a detailed breakdown
of revenue by sources and costs by major categories. To this end, the base of
a cost accounting system is needed and the Regie has agreed to include such
a provision in the terms of reference for the costing study consultant
(Annex 9).
3.06      Financial reporting is often late.  Following repeated request by
the Association, an independent auditing firm, the same one accepted by the
Bank for the audit of the port of Dakar's accounts, was appointed in April
1971 to examine the Regie's accounts from 1966/67 onward. Part of the work
has been completed and the submission of audit certificates up to and
including 1970/71 is a condition of effectiveness of the loan/credit. The
Bank's auditing requirements have been discussed during negotiations and
1/   Agence Central de Comptabilite.



- 8 -
agreement has been reached on the scope, form, and timing of future audit
reports,to be submitted no later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year.
C.   Management and Administration
3.07      Many managerial officials lack practical railway experience; how-
ever, they generally display keen interest in their work and should, through
continued effort, reach the required level of efficiency. There are some
inadequacies at the supervisory and foreman levels due to insufficient train-
ing and, sometimes, premature replacement of French technical assistants by
Senegalese lacking railway experience.
3.08      Technical assistance and training of staff are necessary to im-
prove operation of the railways. At the management level, the Regie needs
to be strengthened in the operating field and in the organization and ad-
ministration of the Thies workshops. Provision has been made in the proposed
loan/credit for the financing of the services of one expatriate operating ad-
viser attached to the General Manager for one year, and one expatriate work-
shop expert for a two-year period (para. 4.09). Terms of Reference (Annexes
3 and 4) were discussed and agreed upon with the Regie during negotiations.
At the lower staff level, agreement was also reached during negotiations on
the following measures:
(a)  intensification of the training program in order to provide
adequate supervisory and technical skills, and
(b)  establishment of a long-term program for the gradual
replacement of French technical assistants by Senegalese
counterparts.
3.09      A railway planning unit, established in 1970 to formulate and
coordinate the Regie's medium and long-term planning in such areas as traffic
forecasting, marketing, investment planning, costing, and pricing, is perform-
ing satisfactorily. However, some outside assistance will still be needed
for the establishment of a new, cost related competitive pricing system (para.
4.09 and Annex 9).
D.   Manpower, Productivity, and Wages
3.10      Total personnel (excluding temporary track workers) as of June 30,
1971 was as follows:
Technical Assistants          44
Permanent                  1,907
Auxiliary                  1,481
Total      3,432



-9-
This is 18% less than in 1965. Productivity, at 171,000 traffic units 1/ per
employee, is satisfactory in relation to African conditions and traffic den-
sity, and shows an increase of 26% since 1965. However, considering tiie
type of operation (mainly bulk train traffic), the Regie should be able to re-
duce the staff further and increase productivity to about 233,000 traffic
units by 1975/76 (Annex 8). On the other hand, the Regie suffers from high
personnel costs inherited from pre-independence days. The remuneration of
permanent staff is notably higher than that of other Senegalese employees
in similar categories and this results in a high level of direct personnel
expenditures, 2/ some 71% of the total working expenses. These matters
were the subject of a covenant in the Credit 96-SE Project Agreement; how-
ever, neither objective (staff reduction and limitation of increases in
wages and salaries) was reached (Annex 5). In view of the Regie's deficits,
a particular effort should be made to improve the situation. During negotia-
tions, the Regie agreed to reduce its staff by attrition and limitation of
recruitment according to a five-year program, in accordance with which direct
personnel expenditures should not exceed 64% of total working expenditure by
1975 (Plan of Action, Annex 8).
E.   Railway Property
3.11      A brief description of railway track, structures, equipment and
other property is presented in Annex 6. Property as a whole has been lack-
ing proper maintenance except for telecommunications network and signalling,
which are in good condition. However, track is being improved and the pro-
posed rehabilitation of the motive power and rolling stock workshops at
Thies will ensure adequate maintenance.
F.   Operations
3.12      Table 1 gives a summary of operating statistics from 1966/67 to
1970/71; performance is below attainable standards and the Regie should
seek improvement. Reference is made to the proposed Plan of Action (Annex
8) which sets detailed time-phased objectives for improvement of operations.
To assist the General Manager, provision has been made in the proposed
loan/credit for the financing of the services of a high-level operating
expert for one year (para. 3.08). Passenger-km have decreased while passen-
ger train-km lhave increased; seat utilization coefficient was 68% in second
class and 24% in first class. The situation is somewhat better in the case
of railcar service using recently acquired stock. Average freight car-km
per car in service per day is only 70 km, which is low. Average freight car
turn-around is satisfactory for phosphate traffic, which is bulk short dis-
tance traffic, but unsatisfactory for national and international Mali traffic,
respectively 5-1l2 and 2-1/2 trips per month. Availability of diesel engines
was about 70%, a substantial improvement over past years but still too low.
1/   Ton-km plus pass-km.
2/   Defined as total personnel expenditure minus pensions, cost of training,
transport of personnel, medical services and other fringe benefits.



- 10 -
Availability of railcars was also 70% with a daily average run of about
495 kr,. The proposed rehabilitation of the workshops should improve the
utilization of rolling stock. Delays, accidents and on-line breakdowns o-
failures are high due to the poor condition of the sections of track still
to be renewed and of some over-age rolling stock, poor discipline and in-
sufficient training of station staff and engine drivers. The Regie is aware
of the situation and has begun a professional training program.
(.   Traffic
(i) Freight Traffic
3.13      Freight traffic on the Senegal Railways can be divided into four
groups:
1970/71
Thousands                   Millions
of tons           %       of ton-km          X
1.   Phosphates                  1,234           69.2         134            40.6
2.   Groundnuts                     117           6.6          22             6.7
3.   "Other" National               204          11.4          33            10.0
4.   International                  228           12.8        141            42.7
Total                 1_783           100.0         330           100.0
Details of freight traffic statistics for the years 1963/64-1970/71 and fore-
casts for the years 1971/72-1976/77 are discussed in Annex 7 and Table 2.
Over the last eight years, freight traffic increased at an annual growth
rate of 5.0%. The same growth rate was found for traffic in ton-km, which
increased from 256 to 330 million. For the period 1971/72-1976/77, freight
traffic is expected to increase by 4.3% annually to 2.3 million tons, and
by 5.2% annually in terms of ton-km to 445 million ton-km.
1976/77

- 11 -
3.14      Phosphate traffic consists of aluminumi phospha*tle from doipozldu
near Thies (Lam Lam) amounting to about 120,000 tons (11 miiillion ton-kin)
p.a. and the larger calcium phosphate deposits of Taiba which amount to
about one million tons (110 million ton-km) p.a. Traffic of aluminum
phosphates is expected to remain stationary, whereas Taiba traffic is fore-
cast to increase by 4.9% p.a. because of a strong increase in demand for
calcium phosphates. Phosphate traffic accounted for about 20% of the Regie's
revenues in 1970/71. Contract rates for Taiba phosphate traffic were in-
creased by 8% in April 1972.
3.15      Groundnut traffic reached a peak of 282,000 tons (47 million
ton-kiii) in 1965/66 and declined to 117,000 tons (22 million ton-km) in
1970/71 due to a reduction in groundnut production (para. 2.01) and other
reasons outlined in paragraph 2.14. Groundnut traffic is expected to in-
crease again to about 250,000 tons (50 million ton-km) by 1975/76. This
increase can be attributed to (a) increased production of groundnuts brought
about by a more market-oriented Government agricultural policy (para. 2.02),
(b) a more flexible competitive pricing and marketing policy of the Regie,
and (c) a more economic distribution of groundnut traffic between road and
rail (para. 2.14). The Regie's revenues from groundnut traffic amounted to
16% of total freight traffic receipts in 1970/71, and are expected in the
future to regain their previous share of about 20% of total traffic receipts.
3.16      Other national traffic consists of all other commodities carried by
the Regie, including "less-than-carload" traffic. In 1970/71, a total of
200,000 tons (33 million ton-km) was carried, amounting to about 11% of
total freight revenue. Forecasts of this traffic, based on the expected
growtli of GDP, show an increase of about 3.5% p.a.
3.17      International traffic through the ports of Dakar and Kaolack to
Mali has gained increasing importance for the Regie, in terms of both
traffic volume and revenue. In 1970/71, the Regie's traffic to and from
Mali amounted to 43% of total ton-km and 51% of total freight traffic
revenue (CFAF 1.6 billion), up from 37% and 45% respectively in 1963/64.
International traffic is vital for both the Senegal and the Mali Regies,
representing more than 80% of the Mali Regie's total traffic and 70% of
its total receipts. Forecasts of Mali traffic are based on the Mali Regie's
traffic projection supplemented by a sectoral analysis of Mali's main traf-
fic generating sources and the country's prospective import needs. Inter-
national traffic is expected to increase by 5% p.a. in terms of tons and
5.3% p.a. in terms of ton-km.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.18      Between 1963/64 and 1969/70, national passenger traffic remained al-
most constant, averaging just over 3.5 million passengers and 270 million pass-
km per year. Analysis indicates a high price and income elasticity of demand
in passenger traffic and, consequently, a high vulnerability of the Regie's
passenger traffic to low priced bus competition (Annex 7). In 1970, passenger
traffic declined by 21% (passengers) and 9% (pass-km) respectively, largely
because of a fare increase of some 10% and the drop in domestic production,



- 12 -
particularly in the agricultural sector. Passenger traffic is expected to
recover slightly in 1971/72 due to a repeal of the fare increase mentioned
above, improved quality of service (para. 6.08) and an expected recovery of
agricultural production. The forecast takes into account an increase in the
average journey length (Table 2).
11.  Branch Lines
3.19      The Regie's system comprises about 370 km (35% of the system) of
low traffic density lines. 1/ Traffic density ranges between 7,000 tons and
131,000 passengers p.a. (1969/70) on the Louga-Linguere line to 90,000 tons
and 769,000 passengers p.a. on the Tivaouane-Louga section. While a tenta-
tive analysis of marginal costs of these lines suggests that they are not
uneconomic, it seems that they make an inadequate contribution to overhead.
During negotiations, assurance has been given that the railways' planning
unit will conduct detailed studies on the lines' economic and financial
viability until mid-1973, and, subsequently, Government and the Regie will
agree with the Bank upon the appropriate course of action. Agreement with
Governmnent has also been reached during negotiations that in cases where
Government should insist on keeping unprofitable lines in operation for
social, political or other reasons, the Regie will be reimbursed for the
financial savings that would have been possible by closing the lines (Plan
of Action, Annex 8).
4. THE PROJECT
A.   The Third Four-Year Plan (1969/70-1972/73)
4.01      A railway Plan covering the four-year period 1969/70-1972/73 has
been prepared by the Regie and agreed upon by the Government. However, be-
cause of the unavailability of funds, only a small part of the proposed
investment was made in 1969/70 and 1970/71. Some investment in rolling stock
and motive power was made possible in 1971/72 under FAC grants and CCE loans;
some other investments in track renewal works were financed with the savings
under the previous Credit 96-SE. Remaining proposed investment, amounting
to CFAF 3,U19 million (about 62% of the total amount of the Plan), and
concerning mainly track renewal, rolling stock and motive power and work-
shop rehabilitation, was shifted into 1972/73. The Plan, as it now stands,
appears obsolete and of no practical use as a basis for a new project.
B.   The Project and the Loan/Credit
4.02      The proposed Plan of Action (para. 4.16) provides that a detailed
Fourth Four-Year Plan 1973/74-1976/77 will be prepared in 1972. Pending
completion of this Plan, a project (Table 3) consisting of the same items
that were shifted into 1972/73 of the Third Plan (para. 4.01) plus techni-
cal services and training, has been prepared by the Regie and the Bank
1/   Tivaouane-St. Louis (170 km); Louga-Linguere (128 km); Diourbel-Touba
(47 km); Guinguineo-Kaolack (21 km).



- 13 -
Group; this project, which is expected to be completed within three years,
will be incorporated in the future Four-Year Plan and forms the basis for
the proposed loan/credit.
4.03      The total cost of the project is estimated at about CFAF 3,169
million (US$12.31 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of
CFAF 1,742 million (US$6.8 million equivalent). In view of the Regie's
tight financial situation, agreement was reached with the Regie that, ex-
cept for small, miscellaneous equipment estimated at about CFAF 170 million
(para. 6.15), investments should be limited to the project during the years
1972/73-1974/75, unless the Bank Group agrees otherwise. A breakdown of
the project and of the expenditure suitable for finance under the proposed
loan/credit is given below:

- 14 -
4.04      The proposed loan/credit of US$9.6 million will meet about 77% of
the t:otal cost of the project. It will finance 83% of the foreign exchange
(the six diesel locomotives will be financed jointly by French suppliers'
credit and the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)) and 74% of the local
cost (Table 4).
4.05      The six diesel locomotives, similar in type and power to locomotives
in service, are intended to replace over-age diesel locomotives and will be
equipped with devices for running in "multiple unit". These locomotives of
medium power (1200 hp) will give more operating flexibility than fewer high
power engines.
4.06      Track renewal over 175 km of the main line is part of the ongoing
project of rehabilitation of the track from Dakar to the Mali border. About
243 km have already been renewed or are being renewed under the previous cre-
dit.  After completion of the proposed additional 175 km, 226 km will remain
to be renewed up to the Mali border. Track renewal with 36 kg/m rail, long
welded rails and concrete sleepers will ensure greater safety and improve
efficiency. Track renewal represents some 71% of the proposed loan/credit.
4.07      The Thies rolling stock and motive power workshops are inefficient
and need modernization. The layout is inadequate, requiring construction of
some new buildings, removal of others, installation of proper handling equip-
ment and replacement of over-age machine tools. The proposed new layout has
been carefully designed and is satisfactory. Workshop rehabilitation repre-
sents 14%, of the proposed loan/credit.
4.08      Modernization of rolling stock (freight cars) consists of replac-
inv plain bearing axle-boxes with roller bearing axle-boxes; 652 bogies are
to be modernized and the provision in the proposed loan/credit will permit
modernizing about 50% of the total stock. The use of roller bearings will
reduce: (a) maintenance costs and the number of staff employed in the work;
(b) occurrence of hot boxes with subsequent train delays and derailments;
and (c) tractive effort, thus saving fuel.
4.09      Provision for technical services and training is intended to fi-
nance the services of (a) an expert in train operation, for one year, to in-
vestigate the shortcomings of train operations and recommend improvement
(Annex 3); (b) an expert in workshop management, for two years, to assist
in the physical rehabilitation of the Thies workshop and to organize the
proper functioning of the workshop and the training of staff (Annex 4); and
(c) training abroad of Regie senior staff. Furthermore, provision has been
made for an expert from SOFRERAIL for about seven months to supplement its
report on costing with a study covering tariff regulations and training of
staff together with a reorganization of the Commercial Department. Terms of
Reference for this costing expert were discussed and agreed upon during nego-
tiations (Annex 9).
4.10      The cost estimates for track renewal, the main item in the project,
are based on prices quoted recently for the renewal of the additional 39 km
under Credit 96-SE. Cost estimates for the workshop rehabilitation, the sec-
ond mails item in the project, are based on proposals received recently by the



- 15 -
Regie from local enterprises.  A price contingency allowance of about 5% has
been added to local costs. A price contingency of about 8% has been added to
meet possible increase in the cost of imported materials (mainly steel), ex-
cept for the four diesel locomotives already ordered.
C.   Financing of the Project
4.11      The following table summarizes the financing plan of the project:

D.   Lxecution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.12      The Regie is competent to carry out the project.  Track renewal will
be performed by Regie forces which are now well trained and do good work; in
addition, workshop modernization will be supervised by the expert to be en-
gaged under the proposed loan/credit.
4.13      Preferential trade arrangements exist between Senegal and members
of the European Economic Community. They are, however, irrelevant for pro-
curement procedures under the project because the Government has exonerated
the Regie from taxes and duties levied on import of goods financed under
Credit 96-SE and confirmation was given during negotiations that the Govern-
ment will continue this policy.
4.14      All imported items (rails, fastenings, rolling stock, steel struc-
tures, etc.) will be acquired through international competitive bidding.
Regarding cement, mostly needed for the manufacturing of ties by the Regie,
international competitive bidding will also apply, and a preference of 15%
will be given to local suppliers. Regarding ballast, sand, and aggregate,
it is reasonable to assume that they will be procured locally (through com-
petitive bidding), as it is most unlikely that foreign suppliers will show
interest; electric welding of long rail is performed in the Regie workshop
with its own equipment.
4.15      Disbursements will be made on the CIF landed cost of imported equip-
ment and materials as well as on the foreign cost of technical services and
training, and on 74% of the cost of locally acquired goods and services. The
estimated quarterly and annual rates of disbursement of the proposed loan/
credit are given in Table 5. The disbursements will extend through FY 1974/
75. It is proposed that if there are any savings in 3ank Group financed items
of the project, they be used to finance the foreign exchange costs and, possi-
bly, part of the local cost (74%) of continuing items in the plan, subject to
review and agreement with the Bank Group.

L.   Action Supplementary to the Project
4. J6      In order to achieve the full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76, a sup-
plementary Plan of Action has been proposed by the Bank Group. This Plan out-
lines measures which the Regie should adopt to improve operations, reduce
staff, introduce a cost related competitive pricing policy and simplified
tariffs, study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable, and
prepare, in 1972, the Regie's Fourth Four-Year Investment Plan 1973/74-1976/77.
Thc majority of the lines of action included in this Plan are discussed in thc
relevant sections of this report and the whole Plan is reproduced as Annex 8.
During negotiations, agreement on this document was reached with Government
and the Regie.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Track Renewal
5.01      Some 400 km of track remain to be renewed on the main line from
Dakar to Kidira (644 km) on the Mali border. This line serves Mali as the
main link to the Atlantic and is a valuable foreign exchange earner for
Senegal. The track has passed its useful life, and severe speed restrictioas
have been imposed for safety reasons. Accidents, however, still are frequent.
The envisaged track renewal, designed to strengthen the backbone of the Senegal
railway system, was started during the Second Four-Year Plan and partly fi-
nanced by Credit 96-SE. If the track renewal program were not carried out,
the line could be kept in operation only for another eight years, at increv3--
ing maintenance and accident cost, reduced line capacity and a substantial
loss of traffic and income to the Senegal economy 11. The economic analysis
given below includes the acquisition of six diesel locomotives to replace
over-age locomnotives now running on this line and the completion of track
renewal of the line up to the Mali border, which is planned to be achieved
in about five to six years.
5.02       In the economic evaluation, three possible alternatives were con-
sidered against immediate renewal of the track: (a) complete deterioration
of the line (estimated at eight years); (b) continuation of traffic on the
old line and renewal after its complete deterioration; and (c) improving the
road to Kidira.
5.03      The economic benefits of the track renewal with respect to alterna-
tive (a) can be derived from savings in track and rolling stock maintenance,
reduced accidents, improved rolling stock utilization, and reduced fuel con-
sumption for that traffic still on the line for the remainder of its useful

Mali's alternative outlet to the Atlantic, shows the Dakar-Bamako route
to be more economic for most of Mali's traffic.

lifetime. For the traffic which is lost to the economy during the period
of increasing deterioration and thereafter, the benefit is measured by the
net value added per unit-km. The economic rate of return would be about 22%.
5.04      In the case of alternative (b), the project would yield the same
type of benefits as alternative (a) for the first eight years until the line
is completely renewed. Thereafter, no substantial additional benefits are
assumed. The internal economic rate of return would be about 17%.
5.05      Alternative (c) takes into account the possibility of partly up-
grading the existing road up to Tambacounda and constructing a new road up
to the Senegalese border 1/. Even if only marginal operating and maintenance
costs are considered and road construction cost is excluded from the economic
evaluation, the track renewal of the whole line would yield an internal eco-
nomic rate of return of 25%.
5.06      Analysis suggests that the timing of the investments is also satis-
factory, with a first year benefit of about 12%. Therefore, it can be con-
cluded that the investment in track renewal is economically well justified.
B.  Wokshop Modernization
5.07      The present inadequate layout of the workshops and their obsolete
machinery cause delays in servicing and repair of rolling stock of about
double the time considered normal technical standard. This adversely affects
the utilization and, thus, the earning power of the rolling stock. The pro-
posed workshop investment, at a total cost of CFAF 453 million (including
technical assistance), would finance high priority items of the workshop
modernization such as improved layout of buildings, new handling equipment
and machine tools.
5.08      The economic benefit of the workshop modernization program would
come from the reduction in unit maintenance cost of about CFAF 70-80 million
a year. The possible reduction in unit maintenance cost would yield an in-
ternal rate of return of about 18-24%. The rate of return is understated
because it does not account for the possible increase in utilization of roll-
ing stock which, for lack of adequate data, could not be quantified.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      The Regie has been operating in financial difficulties since its
creation in 1960. The main reasons have been low revenues due to a low traffic
volume, coupled with inefficient operations resulting in high operating costs.
In 1966 a general rehabilitation and modernization program was started, large-
ly financed by Credit 96-SE. It aimed at improving the Regie's operations and
1/   This understates the work to be done because it does not take into ac-
count the necessary construction of a road from Kidira to Bamako (490 km).

restoring its financial viability. The implementation of the program was
delayed, but the physical objectives have now been achieved, about three years
behind schedule. However, the financial targets could not be reached, primar-
ily because of an unforeseen sluggishness of economic development, and in
1969/70 the Regie's losses amounted to about CFAF 280 million, as compared to
the CFAF 340 million loss in 1965/66 when the rehabilitation first began. As
a result, the Regie's rate of return on net fixed assets in use remained nega-
tive, compared with a forecast of 4% for 1969/70 according to the 1966 appraisal.
B.   Past Earnings
6.02      General statistics on the Regie's operations from 1965/66 to 1969'1,"7
with provisional data for 1970/71, are given in Table 6. The Regie's finan-
cial performance during the last five years, compared with projections made
in the appraisal report for the first railway project, is given in Table 7

6.03      Operating revenue during the period remained at about the same level
of CFAF 2.5 billion (US$10 million equivalent) a year, whereas projections made
in 1966 assumed that operating revenue would increase by about 50% over the



- 19 -
period. The sharp decrease in groundnut traffic (para. 2.14) and the unexpect-
ed overall economic stagnation in Senegal and Mali account for a large part of
the discrepancies between projections and realizations; however, experience
suggests that the projections made in 1966 were generally optimistic. Although
the Regie was somewhat successful in containing operating expenditures, it con-
tinued to operate at a loss during the whole period.
C.   Present Financial Position
6.04      Comparative balance sheets for the Regie are given in Table 8.  They
show that, as of June 30, 1970, the Regie had total assets of CFAF 13.8 billion
(US$54 million), of which net fixed assets amounted to CFAF 11.9 billion; the
current ratio was 0.6 and the debt/equity ratio 22/78. The Regie has an
unsatisfactory liquid position resulting essentially from large Treasury
overdraft on which it has had to rely over the years to cover its deficits
and meet its cash requirements. Since it is unlikely that the Regie would
be able to reimburse the Treasury overdraft within a reasonable period along
with all other debts outstanding to the Government, it was agreed during
negotiations that the Regie's debt to the Government be subject to the
following clearing operation:
(a) effective as of July 1, 1972, rescheduling of all Treasury
overdraft and any other short-term debts of the Regie to
the Government outstanding as of December 31, 1971 into Trea-
sury advances maturing in one year;
(b) after ratification by the Parliament and effective as of July 1,
1973:  (i)  conversion of about CFAF 1.95 billion, or half
of all the Regie's debt to the Government, except
proceeds from Credit 96-SE, outstanding as of
December 31, 1971 into equity; and
(ii) rescheduling of the remaining half of all the
Regie's outstanding debt to the Government as
of the above-mentioned date into long-term
debt, free of interest charges and repayable
over fifty years with a ten-year grace period.
Projections of the Regie's future financial position reflect the above opera-
tion, which will improve the Regie's liquid position and provide it with
additional borrowing capacity when continuation and completion of the current
rehabilitation program will require more external financing. Copy to the Bank
of a letter of confirmation by the Government to the Regie on the above
operation is a condition of loan/credit effectiveness.
6.05      The debt of the Mali Railway, mainly for freight car rentals and
maintenance services, has remained high over the years because the Mali
Railway itself has not been paid by the Mali Government and other Government
agencies for services rendered. The Association has received confirmation
that the Senegal Government has agreed to the proposal made by the Mali
Government to settle this debt in full through installment payments up to
mid-1974.

D.   Rates, Fares, and Costs
6.06      A recent traffic costing study 1/ revealed that the Regie's freight
rates cover the marginal cost of transporting specific traffics under con-
sideration and contributed CFAF 971 million to overhead in 1969/70 (Table 9).
However, there is room for a simplification of the tariff structure, which
would lead to increased revenue from freight traffic. In setting freight
rates, the Regie applied the traditional concept of covering the fully
distributed costs of traffic which, in the case of Senegal, tends to expose
to wasteful competition some traffic for which the railway is best suited.
This policy, in conjunction with other factors, may have contributed to the
decline in the important groundnut traffic, which accounts for about 10% of
the Regie's total traffic (in terms of ton-km) and 20% of its revenues.
During negotiations, assurance has been given by Government and the Regie
that a more flexible and competitive pricing policy will be adopted and im-
plemented by the Railways. Furthermore, the SOFRERAIL report on costing
will be supplemented by a study covering adequate tariff regulations, train-
ing of staff and reorganization of the Commercial Department of the Regie
(para. 4.09).
6.07      More than 80% of the Regie's freight traffic, producing about 90%
of total freight revenue, is carried at negotiated rates. Average revenue
per net ton-km has remained fairly constant, ranging from CFAF 5.1 to 5.2
(USJ1.85-1.89) per ton-km. Considering the Regie's deficits (para. 6.02),
some selective rate adjustments, e.g., in the tariff for Taiba phosphates,
are required. During negotiations, assurance has been given by Government
and the Regie that, by the second quarter of FY 1972/73, the overall aver-
age revenue per ton-km will be increased to CFAF 5.5 through selective rate
adjustments and a modification of the tariff structure, following the recom--
mendations of consultants, SOFRERAIL (Annex 8). This level is considered
the maximum possible in the given competitive environment.
6.08      Passenger fares are low and make an insufficient contribution to
overhead, although average revenue per passenger increased by about 15% in
the period 1963/64-1970/71. In 1969/70, passenger revenues contributed only
CFAF 18 million to overhead (Table 9). Further increases, however, are pre-
cluded by (a) severe bus competition in the heavily populated areas of the
Dakar-Thies-St. Louis region and (b) the high price elasticity of demand
of the Regie's clientele and its dependence on groundnut marketing prospects.
Therefore, the Regie must find means for further cost reductions. To this
end, diesel locomotive trains will increasingly be replaced by railcars,
with an expected reduction in marginal cost per pass-km for national passenger
traffic of 50% at no additional investment cost. The economies can be achieved
entirely through improved maintenance of the existing railcars, made possible
by the intended workshop modernization, and better train scheduling. In
addition, the Regie's operating performance is expected to be improved by
the services of an expatriate operating expert proposed in the project (para.
3.08).

E.   Future Earnings
6.09      Forecasts of the Regie's revenues and expenditures up to 1975/76
are shown in Table 7. The underlying assumptions are given in Table 6 and
the attached appendix. Provisional data available for 1970/71 show a
slight decline in revenue reflecting the persisting economic stagnation in
Senegal. This trend, however, is expected to reverse from 1971/72 onward
based on the following expectations, which are considered reasonable:
(a) increased traffic, induced by a more vigorous growth
of the economy (para. 2.02);
(b) a rise in international traffic to and from Mali; and
(c) a selective tariff increase in the second quarter of
1972/73 (para. 6.07).
6.10      In the projections of the income and expenditures related to the
Regie's operations, no consideration has been given to the eventual closure
or subsidization of uneconomic branch lines. On the other hand, assumption
was made that the Regie will improve its current billing procedures. All
aspects considered, growth in operating revenue from 1970/71 to 1975/76 will
average about 7% per year, which is satisfactory. On the expenses side,
personnel costs are expected to be reduced through a containment policy
(para. 3.10) agreed upon during negotiations. Other operating costs, based
on past data, including fuel, lubricants and materials, have been allowed
to increase in proportion to traffic volume, with an additional increase
of 5% per annum to cover inflation.  This rate of inflation is assumed to
affect the prices of imported fuels and materials up to 1973/74.  There-
after, it is assumed that increased efficiency in operations and mainte-
nance resulting from the execution of the project will partly compensate
for inflation and reduce its effect to 2-1/2% per annum.  The same assump-
tion, which is considered realistic, has been made concerning miscellaneous
charges. With working costs thus growing at a lower rate than increases in
revenue, the working ratio should decline from 96% in 1970/71 to 71% in 1975/
76. The operating ratio should also improve from 110% to 91% in spite of
higher depreciation allowances from 1971/72 onward as recommended by SOFRERAIL.
Table 10 gives the details of projections of depreciation provisions used in
this report based on a more realistic, new revaluation of assets and depre-
ciation scheme made by SOFRERAIL. The revaluation of assets and the computa-
tion of depreciation at the rates recommended by the consultants SOFRERAIL
in their report entitled "Prix de Revient et Politique Tarifaire", October
1971, has been agreed upon during negotiations. As a result, revenues and
expenses are expected to evolve approximately as follows:

1974/75     3,241        2,437         642           162        302       (140)
1975/76     3,322        2,375         659          288         308       ( 20)
6.11      The above table shows a gradual improvement of the Regie's finan-
cial performance. An operating deficit of CFAF 233 million in 1970/71
should turn into an operating revenue of CFAF 288 million in 1975/76. These
figures are computed without considering the possible closure of branch lines
which would result in additional savings. Also, despite the assumed rate of
inflation of 5% per year, the projections do not envisage tariff increases
after 1972/73. As a result, the Regie should have room for further tariff
adjustment in later years. With long-term debt rising to cope with capital
investment requirements, interest charges will also increase sharply and the
Regie is expected to continue to operate with a deficit, after interest
charges through 1975/76; the gap is, however, narrowing from CFAF 356 million
in 1970/71 to CFAF 66 million in 1975/76. The corresponding rate of return
on average net fixed assets in use will be 1.8%. During negotiations, it has
been agreed that the Regie will, as part of its Plan of Action, achieve operat-
ing ratios of no more than 100% in 1973/74, 95% in 1974/75, 91% in 1975/76,
and thereafter a rate of return of at least 2%. Such targets are considered
realistic; however, the Regie should aim at higher rates of return in subst.-
quent years.
F.    Financing Plan
6.12      A detailed cash flow forecast up to and including 1975/76 is shown
in Table 11. Funds required by the Regie and the sources of such funds dur-
ing the tlhree-year disbursement period of the project (July 1, 1972 to June
30, 1975) may be summarized as follows: 1/

Total sources                     3,682         14.4         100
6.13      The above summary shows that the Regie would be able to finance
about one-fourth of its investment requirements with its own resources.
This rather low contribution is acceptable in view of the difficulties en-
countered by the Regie in increasing its internal cash generation. Indeed,
the achievement of this low contribution is dependent upon the realization
of the forecast increases in revenues (due in particular to the projected
tariff increases) and cost savings discussed in paragraphs 6.09 and 6.10.
It is also based on the assumption that the clearing and rescheduling of
all the Regie's debts to the Government, as of December 31, 1971, with the
exception of the proceeds from Credit 96-SE (para 6.04), will have taken
place, and that satisfactory arrangements will be made for the repayment
by the Mali Regie and its transit agents SOCOPAO of their current debts to
the Senegal Regie (para. 6.05).
6.14      Because of the expected low level of its cash generation in the
next three years, the Regie will have to rely heavily on borrowings, repre-
senting two-thirds of total sources of funds. The projections assume that
the proposed Bank loan of US$6.4 million to the Regie will be repaid in 25
years, including five years of grace, and will bear interest at 7-1/4% p.a.,



- 24 -
and that the proposed credit of US$3.2 million to the Government will be re-
lent to the Regie on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. Firm
arrangements have already been made for the CCCE loan which, together with
the grant from FAC, is financing the six diesel locomotives included in
the project.
6.15      In addition to the proposed project, the Regie is expected to incur
capital expenditure of about CFAF 170 million (US$0.7 million equivalent) dur-
ing the project period, mainly for the purchase of miscellaneous equipment.
6.16      The financing plan is satisfactory.  However, in the event of a
shortfall in the Regie's internal cash generation or of a project cost over
run, the Government has agreed to provide such funds as may be needed to
complete the project.
G.   Future Financial Position
6.17      Forecast balance sheets of the Regie up to 1975/76 are shown in
Table 8. The Regie's liquidity position would be satisfactory. However,
in the event of a shortfall in the Regie's revenues or of an increase in
its expenses, the Government should provide the Regie with adequate funds
to enable it to meet its working expenses, service its debt and maintain
an adequate working capital. This was agreed in principle by the Government
and has been confirmed during negotiations.
6.18      The Regie's debt/equity ratio is expected to increase gradually
from 18/82 on June 30, 1970 to 35/65 on June 30, 1976. During the next
four years, the Regie's debt service coverage would be amlple (varying from
1.8 to 2.0), mainly because repayments of debt incurred for the proposed
project are not scheduled to start during that period. Maximum future
debt service requirements will reach the level of CFAF 600 million by 1977/78,
while net cash revenue is expected to surpass the same level by as early as
1973/74. During negotiations, it has been agreed that no further debts other
than those assumed for the project would be incurred by the Regie without the
prior approval of the Bank, unless its net cash revenue is at least 1.5 times
its maximum future debt service requirements.
7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of
thie Republic of Senegal and the Regie on the following principal items:
(a) technical assistance to Government in the field of transport
planning and coordination (para. 2.13);
(b) financial targets for fiscal years 1973/74, 1974/75, 1975/76
and thereafter (para. 6.11);
(c) debt limitation arrangements (para. 6.18);



- 25 -
(d)  adjustment of personnel expenditure (Plan of Action, Annex 8,
para. 2); and
(e)  revision of tariffs leading to an overall increase in average
revenue per ton-km of CFAF 5.5 by the second quarter of fiscal
year 1972/73 (Plan of Action, Annex 8, para. 3).
7.02      The following items shall be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed loan/credit:
(a)  submission of audit certificates for the accounts from the fiscal
years 1968/69, 1969/70 and 1970/71 (para. 3.06); and
(b)  confirmation of the clearing and rescheduling by the Government
of all the Regie's debts with the Government, as of December
31, 1971 (para 6.04).
7.03      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.4
million and an IDA credit of US$3.2 million equivalent. The proposed loan
would be made to the Regie for a term of 25 years, including five years of
grace. The proposed credit would be made to the Government of Senegal and
relent to the Regie on the terms and conditions of the proposed Bank loan.
A Guarantee Agreement will be concluded between the Republic of Senegal and
the Bank.

Underlying Assumptions
(A) Work done
The basic assumptions underlying freight traffic forecasts are
explained in Annex 7.
The number of train/km is obtained by dividing traffic in ton/km
(pass/km) by the average net load per train (average number of passengers
per train)
(B) Labor Statistics
These statistics were computed under two major assumptions:
if there will be no replacement hirings for retiring staff and If real
wages will remain constant throughout the period 1971/72 to 1975/76, as
agreed with the Regie and the Minister of Transport. Traffic units per
man employed is obtained by dividing total traffic (ton/km + pass/km) by
the number of employees during the year.
(C) Indices
The consumer price index is expected to increase by a rate
equal to the average rate of increase for the last ten years, i.e. 0.8%
per annum.
Productivity per man employed is obtained by dividing traffic
units per man employed by that of the base year, i.e. 1965.
(D) Staff Costs
These indices are obtained by dividing total staff costs
(number of employees x cost per employee) by the corresponding
operating revenue, operating expenditure and working expenditure obtained
from the income account table.
(E) Freight Traffic
We assume an increase in the average net trainload, resulting
essentially from the application of a new policy designed to encourage
full carload shipping.
Average revenue per train/km is equal to average net trainload x
average revenue per ton/km.
(F) Passenger Traffic
Average revenue per train/km is equal to average number of passenger
per train x average revenue per pass/km.



APPENDIX
toTABLE 6
-2-
(G) Fuel, lubricants and Other Materials
These are the Regie's variable costs. Forecasts were made
by multiplying the average cost per train/km by the forecast figure
of train/km.
(H)  Fixed Assets  are here computed as the average of net fixed assets at
the beginning and at the end of each fiscal year.
(I) Turnover
This ratio is obtained by dividing operating revenue by net fixed
assets (see above).
(J) Return on Inyestment
This figure is obtained by dividing net operating revenue
by net fixed assets.

Notes
V  Ref: Annual Reports and Financial Statements of Regie.
Total Operating Revenue = Regie's Produits d'Exploitation (Acot. #70) - Recettes Accessotres du Trafic - Cessions de Fabrication pour Tiers;
(cf. Details on "Produits" in Balance Sheet Book).
3/  Personnel Costs = Regie's Frais de Personnel (Acot. #61) + Transport & Deplacements (Acct. #64) + Frais Divers de Gestion (Acot. #66) - 60%
travaux faits par Regie (Acot. #78); because these "Travaux faits par Regie" do not correspond to a revenue or costs from operation, but
rather an increaoe dono to fixed assets, as capital spending.  See Annual Report of 1967/68 as base of computation.
4/ Material and Other = Regie's Stock debut - Stock Final (Acot. #30) + Achats (Acct. #60) + Tmpot & Taxes (Acct. #62) + Travaux & Fournitures
(Acot. #63) - 40% Travaux faits par Regie (Aect. #78) see notes above.
i/  Amortization + Provision for Renewal = Regie's Dotations aux Amortissements & Provisions (Acot, #68) also refer to "Immobilisation"in
Dalance Sheet Book for explanations.
6/ Depreciation on a new Sofrerail sugiested base.
7/  Regie's budgeted figure, reflecting an increase in salary, and in administrative costs attributed to personnel (See note 3).

on May 1, 1970. New tariff adjustments are not recommended
at this stage.

SENEGAL RAILWAYS
Brief Description of Railway Property
1.   Track and Signalling
The Senegal Rallway system (1,032 kIn), a part of the former Dakar-
Niger Railways, was constructed between 1885 and 1924. It is laid in meter
gauge and is mainly single track, with the exception of the 70-lma section
from Dakar to Thies, which is double track. The Railway traverses flat
country with no important rivers. Track is in poor condition for the most
part except for the approximate 260 km being renewed with Association's
financing (Credit 96-SE).  With a view to reducing maintenance cost, the
Regie has adopted the modern technique of long welded rails and concrete
sleepers. Light rails (20-26 kg/m) are gradually replaced by heavier rails,
where justifled by the level of traffic.  Signalling and train control equip-
ment is of simple design, meeting the operating requirements adequately.
Modernization of signalling on some sections, such as automatic block system,
was included originally in the Four-Year Plan, but deferred later as not
justified.
2.   Office Buildings and Stations
The administrative headquarters of the Railway are at Thies, as are
workshops, training school, rail welding and sleeper plants, with ancillary
residential and social facilities for headquarter's personnel. Office build-
ings and some stations are in rather poor condition due to lack of proper
maintenance.
3.   Motive Power and Rolling Stock
Details of locomotives and rolling stock as of September 1971 are
shown on pages 3 and 4 of this annex. The main components, in summary, are
as follows:
31 mnln llne diesel locomotives
23 diesel shunting locomotives
13 diesel railcars
113 passenger cars, trailers and vans
727 freight cars
The Regie has ordered four RB 1200 hp diesel locomotives, a type which meets
the requirements well, and three diesel shunting locomotives to replace over-
age units. Five new air-conditioned railcars were delivered in 1970. Avail-
ability of existing diesel locomotives and railcars, at 70.2 and 70.3 respec-
tively, is unsatisfactory due to low efficiency of the workshops, frequency
of accidents and carelessness of drivers. Rehabilitation of the workshops,
improved organization of the workshops and training of drivers should help
remedy the situation.



A nTEX 6
Page 2
.ost of the 113 passenger cars, with the exception of the trailers,
are over 20 years old and their condition is rather poor. No replacement is
envisaged, since the policy of the Regie is to develop railcar and trailer
services which, it is believed, are likely to attract, and retain, passenger
traffic.
Out of a total of 727 bogie freight cars (revenue traffic), 200
are over 40 years old with average load capacity of 25 tons. New freight cars
being ordered are of modern design with high average load capacity of 30-35
tons and/oi 40 m3 of usable surface. At the same time, the Regie has started
a program of modernization of some 326 bogie freight cars by replacing exist-
ing bearing axle-boxes with roller bearing axle-boxes. This will reduce main-
tenance cost and frequency of axle-box heating, and will allow for higher
speeds. The proposed loan/credit would finance about 50% of the program.
4.  Workshops
There is a central main workshop at Thies whose principal function
comprises the periodic maintenance of diesel locomotives, coaches and freight
cars, and the repair of damage to rolling stock and motive power folJowing
accidents. This workshop occupies a sufficient area, especially since the
Regie stopped the repair and maintenance of Mali traction, which is now being
performed in Bamako. However, the general layout at Thies is inadequate, and
there is a lack of transfer equipment, such as traveling cranes and car trans-
fer tables. The proposed loan/credit would finance (a) the reconstruction or
extension of various shops, (b) the acquisition and installation of suitable
handling enuippment, and (c) the replacement of a few over-age machine tools.

Freight and Passenger Traffic Forecasts
A.   Freight
This annex explains in some detail the Regie's major traffics and
the methods used by the mission for the freight traffic forecasts.
1.   Phosphate Traffic
Phosphate traffic is expected to increase from 1.2 million tons
in 1970 to 1.5 million tons in 1975. Demand for aluminum phosphates from
Thies is not expected to rise. Thus, the management forecasts total sales
of 125,000 tons annually for the next five years. Favorable conditions in
the international market for calcium phosphates have led the Taiba producer
to forecast a large increase in its exports, depending on the Regie's capac-
ity to provide shunting locomotives; the Taiba company owns the wagons. The
mission has adopted the lower forecasts made by the Regie although these
projections may turn out to be conservative. Phosphates are carried at
long-term contract rates.
2.   Groundnut Traffic
Forecasts for 1971-1975 are based on regression analysis with data
covering the period 1961-1970. On the basis of statistical tests, the most
satisfactory results were obtained when using traffic in tons as the depen-
dent variable and groundnuts commercialized production as the independent
variable. This equation explains more than 90% of the total variance in
the Regie's groundnut traffic. The forecasts up to 1975 were then made using
the estimates of commercialized production prepared by ITALCONSULT for ONCAD.
Groundnut traffic is expected to rise from as low as 117,000 tons in 1970 to
250,000 tons in 1975 due to the expected recovery in groundnut production.
Traffic forecasts in ton-km have also taken account of the Regie's planned,
more competitive pricing policy and the expected increase in the average
length of haul as the center of groundnut production shifts further south.
3.   "Other" National Traffic
Because of the small volume of the items, and the lack of satis-
factory data, no attempt was made to disaggregate this traffic.
The traffic forecasts presented in Table 2 are based on regression
analysis, using GDP in constant prices as the independent variable. The data
used cover the period 1964-1970, thus excluding the previous years which were
unusually high. Variations of GDP in constant prices (1959) explain about 92%
of the variance of traffic in tons. The forecasts shown are based on the con-
servative assumption of a 2.5% per annum growth rate for GDP in constant
prices, a growth rate far below the 5.4% forecast by the last economic mission



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(Report No. AW-15a). On this basis, "other" national traffic is expected to
increase to 208,000 tons in 1975. It was also assumed that the average
length of haul will rise to 184 km, the average figure for the period 1964-
1968 when better economic conditions prevailed in Senegal.
4.   International Traffic
The forecasts for international traffic were prepared by Mali Rail-
ways. These projections, based on a comprehensive analysis of imports, ex-
ports, consumption and production, are considered realistic.
B.   Econometric Model for Forecasting Passenger Traffic
1.        The multiple regression model developed for this analysis uses
as explanatory variables marketed groundnut production 1/ and average reve-
nue per passenger-km in constant prices. The model is expressed in the
following form:
a +JL(GP) +/3 (AR)
where:  PK = Total national passenger traffic in passenger-km
a = Structural constant
GP - Marketed groundnut production in constant prices
AR = Average revenue per passenger-km in constant
prices
- Elasticity of PK to GP
3 = Elasticity of PK to AR
2.        The data used cover the years 1962/63-1970/71:
PK                 GP                 AR
Year           ('000)         (million CFAF)         (CFAF)
1962/63          2,907             16,340              2.334
1963/64          2,900             17,125              2.320
1964/65          2,770             18,488              2.440
1965/66          2,710             20,959              2.460
1966/67          2,670             15,191              2.440
1967/68          2,570             14,345              2.400
1968/69          2,700             10,551              2.310
1969/70         2,590              11,400              2.420
1970/71          2,350              9,834              2.580
1/   Marketed groundnut production rather than GDP has been chosen because
it is the most important cash crop (75% of total exports in 1969/70)
in Senegal.

3.        The following results were obtained:
(i) a = 5,803
aC = 0.0244
t  - -1.4439
(ii) The coefficients are statistically significant.
The multiple correlation coefficient is: r - 0.94
There is a 95% degree of confidence that the forecast passenger
traffic will vary approximately within limits of t6% of the forecast data.
The above data, together with supplementary information supplied
by the Regie, were used for the forecast of passenger traffic (Table 2).

SENEGAL RAILWAYS
Plan of Action for the Begie
1.   Introduction
The physical and financial rehabilitation of the Regie has been
of concern to the Borrower.
It is the aim of the Borrower to enable and assist the Regie to
carry out the physical rehabilitation of the Railways and to achieve a
sound financial position that will permit the Regie, out of internally
generated funds, to meet all of its operating expenses (including adequate
maintenance and depreciation) and debt service obligations, and to make a
contribution toward its investment needs. The Borrower and the Regie in-
tend to implement the following measures with the objective of enabling
the Regie to continue to fulfill its appropriate economic role in an in-
creasingly competitive environment and to achieve financial equilibrium.
2.   Adjustment of Personnel Ex2enses
(a) The Regie recognizes that the proportion of direct personnel
expenses to total working expenses is out of line with that experienced in
similar railway systems. Therefore, the Regie will devise a five-year per-
sonnel program (1972/73-1976/77) which will lead to a gradual reduction of
the proportion of direct personnel expenses to total working expenses, to
about 64% by the Regie's fiscal year 1976/77.
(b) For purpose of the above, "direct personnel expenses" means
total personnel expenses less pension payments, the cost of training, trans-
port of personnel, medical services and other fringe benefits, and "working
expenses" means all operating expenses less depreciation and interest on
deb t.
3.   Tariffs and Rates
(a) The Regie will set rates and fares in such a way that no rate
or fare shall be set below the incremental cost of providing the relevant
service, or so high as to divert to or fail to regain from other modes of
transport any traffic which the railways are able to carry at the lowest
economic cost.
(b) The Regie will introduce modifications to its existing tariff
system in accordance with the recommendations of the Regie's consultants
SOFRERAIL in a report dated October 1971, and will introduce selective rate
adjustments in its tariffs leading to an overall increase in average revenue
per ton-kilometer from about CFAF 5.0 to not less than CFAF 5.5 by the second
quarter of the Regie's fiscal year 1972/73.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
4.   Uneconomic Branch Lines
(a) It is reccgnized that the Regie has branch lines of low
traffic density which appear to make an inadequate contribution toward
the overhead expenses relative to such lines. The Regie will undertake
a detailed study with regard to the economic and financial viability of
its branch lines referred to below, in order to determine whether satis-
factory financial results can be obtained by rationalizing services, or
if this is not possible, by partially or totally eliminating some services,
some stations or an entire line. The lines to be studied are the following:
Tivaouane       -  St. Louis
Louga           -  Linguere
Diourbel        -  Touba
Guinguineo      -  Kaolack
(b) Promptly after completion of such study but in any event by
a date not later than June 30, 1973, or such later date as shall be agreed
to by the Association, the Regie will enter into consultation with the
Borrower and the Association regarding the possible elimination of services,
stations or lines found to be uneconomical or financially non-profitable.
(c) Should the Borrower deem it necessary for the Regie to main-
tain non-profitable lines, stations, or services after June 30, 1973, the
Borrower will reimburse the Regie's losses in respect thereof. A methodology
will be determined and mutually agreed upon between the Regie, the Borrowe-
and the Association leading to the identification of such losses and the terms
of reimbursement.
5.   Depreciation
Except as the Association shall othenwise agree, the Regie will:
(i)  complete the revaluation of its fixed assets by June 30,
1973, in accordance with the recomendations of the Regie's
consultants in a report entitled "Prix de Revient et
Politique Tarifaire" dated October 1971;
(ii)  calculate depreciation of its fixed assets on the basis of
such revaluation and in accordance with the rates of deprecia-
tion recommended by the Regie'5 consultants in Annex 3 of the
report referred to in paragraph (i);
(iii)  incorporate such depreciation in its accounts for its fiscal
year 1972/173 and thereafter; and



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(iv) revise the value of its fixed assets, and recalculate
depreciation from time to time, in accordance with sound
and consistently maintained methods of valuation accept-
able to the Association.
6.   Operations
(a) The Regie will, on the basis of the recommendations of its
consultants, take all necessary steps to improve its operating efficiency
and to achieve the following targets by its fiscal years 1973/74 and 1975/
76:
Specific Operating Objectives                     1970/71  1973/74  1975/76
Locomotive-km per day per locomotive               286       290       290

Wagon-km per day per wagon in stock                  70       80        90
Availability of diesel locomotives (%)               70       80        85
Availability of freight cars (%)                     80       85        85
Availability of railcars (%)                         70       85        95
Average load of freight car (other                   18       23        28
than phosphate and service) in tons
Freight car turnaround (times per year):
National traffic                                66        80        96
Mali traffic                                    30        40       50
Staff productivity (Traffic units                   171      203       233
per '000 employees)
(b)  The Regie will establish a system of control to be agreed
with the Association that will permit prompt evaluation of progress in the
physical and financial rehabilitation of the Railways and in the attainment
of the targets rr'erred to above.
7.   Operating Targets
(a) The Regie will, from time to time, take all necessary steps
to achieve an operating ratio of not more than 100% in its fiscal year 1973/
74, 95% in its fiscal year 1974/75, and 91% in its fiscal year 1975/76.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
(b) For purposes of the above, "operating ratio" means total
operating and administration expenses, taxes (if any) and adequate mainte-
nance and depreciation but excluding interest and other charges on debt,
divided by gross operating revenue accruing from the Regie's services.
8.   Railway Investment Program
The Regie will prepare in consultation with the Borrower and the
Association and by a date not later than June 30, 1973, or such later date
as shall be agreed to by the Association, an investment program covering the
period of the Fourth Four-Year Investment Plan 1973/74-1976/77, based on
sound technical, financial and economic criteria aimed at continuing and
completing the physical and financial rehabilitation of the Railways ini-
tiated during the Second and Third Four-Year Investment Plans 1965/66-
1968/69 and 1969/70-1972/73.

accountancy, cost, and statistics for guidance and reference in,his work.
411      4.  The classification of fixed assets into major categories and
fheir revaluation on the basis of the replacement costs would require up to
three man-months. On this assignment, the Consultant will:
(a) classify fixed assets into two groups:
(i) non-depreciable fixed assets, such as land; and
(ii) depreciable fixed assets, such as buildings, way
and works, rolling stock, telecommunication
equipment, etc.;
(b) revalue the assets individually where convenient and appro-
priate, or by major categories, showing:
(i) gross value of the depreciable fixed assets based
on their costs of replacement; and
1/   International Union of Railroads.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(ii) net value of these depreciable fixed assets resulting
from the above gross value less accumulated deprecia-
tion based on replacement costs. The depreciation is
to be calculated on the average useful life of each
asset of category of assets.
5. In dealing with the classification and revaluation of fixed
assets, the Consultant may treat the depreciable assets in two separate
groups:
(i)  those where it is appropriate to charge depreciation
by reference to the useful life of the assets; and
(ii) those where it is appropriate to provide for replace-
ment by means of a renewals fund. This method may be
of particular relevance to rails and sleepers.
6. If two groups are considered appropriate, the Consultant should
calculate an appropriate charge for annual contribution to renewals fund and
indicate the method by which the annual contribution should be revised from
time to time.
III. Reports
The Consultant shall prepare the following reports in French and
English:
(a) Monthly Progress Report giving a statement of all work
performed and a summary of interim findings;
(b) A final report at the completion of Phase I; and
(c) A final report at the completion of Phase II.
IV.  Data and Facilities to be provided by the Regie
The Regie will provide the Consultant with all necessary availa-
ble data. In particular, the Regie will collect, prior to the arrival of
the Consultant, data concerning (a) full carload traffic and (b) transport
costs and conditions governing the main freight traffic and passenger traffic,
subject to road competition. The Regie will assign qualified counterpart(s)
to work with the Consultant either full time or from time to time as shall
be required.
