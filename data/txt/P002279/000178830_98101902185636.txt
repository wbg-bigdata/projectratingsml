REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REGIE DES CHEMINS DE PER DU SENEGAL WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL AND A CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR THE SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
t.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Regie des Chemins de Per du Senegal (Regie) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$6.4 million and a credit to the
Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$3.2 million to help finance the
second railway project. The loan would have a term of 25 years including 5
years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The credit would
be on standard IDA terms. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the
Regie for 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum. The French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (Caisse
Centrale) and the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) would participate in
financing the project to the extent of US$1.3 million equivalent.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        Senegal covers an area of 77,000 square miles, and has a population
of about 4 million. The climate is sahelian in the north, gradually becoming
Guinean towards the south. Soils are generally light and poor. Agricultural
potential is limited by low rainfall, distributed over only three to four
months per year. In the northern half of the country, where the bulk of the
population lives, millet and groundnuts are about the only crops that can be
grown without irrigation. Irrigation is possible along the Senegal River
but would be very expensive. In addition, there is some potential for live-
stock raising in most parts of the country. In the south and southeast, the
rural potential is somewhat greater (rice, cotton, fruit), but lack of feeder
roads and other infrastructure has so far hampered development there. Senegal
developed its industrial sector, which now accounts for about 16 percent of
GDP, earlier than other West African countries. It is generally agreed that
the industrial labor force is one of the best in Africa.
3.        A report on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of Senegal"
(AW-15a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1970. A Bank
economic mission visited Senegal in February-March 1972 to assess the country's
current economic situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the
preliminary findings of that mission. Country data are given in Annex II and a
map in Annex IV.

Past Developments
4.        During the 1960's, the first decade after independence, GDP growth
(2.5 percent per annum) hardly exceeded population growth; per capita income
stagnated at around $200. Two factors were responsible for this situation.
5.        First, with independence Senegal lost its privileged position as
the center of French West Africa. This resulted in the loss of important ex-
port markets for manufactures, as domestic industries developed in other
West African countries. At the same time, demand for services and locally
produced goods was depressed, following the departure of most French civil
and military personnel. Stagnation in agriculture further accentuated the
already difficult internal market situation for manufactured products.
Senegal has not yet been able to offset the loss of markets in Africa by
increasing exports to non-African countries. A number of obstacles made
the transition from African-oriented to world-oriented exports difficult:
(i) high tariff barriers and resulting inefficiencies; (ii) limited size of
the local market which does not permit economies of scale; and (iii) mono-
polistic organization of production resulting in high profit margins and
costs.
6.        Secondly, the difficult process of adjusting to the new political,
economic and administrative dimensions was seriously jeopardized in the sec-
ond half of the 1960's when groundnut production fell by 50 percent due to
a combination of bad weather and falling export prices. This was critical
in an economy in which groundnuts account for almost half of agricultural
output and 15 percent of GDP. At the same time, production of major food-
crops stagnated at a level insufficient to cover local demand.
7.        In these circumstances, Government finances deteriorated through-
out most of the 1960's. Public savings slowly but continuously declined to
virtually zero by 1968/69. Revenues stagnated, in spite of a substantial
tax effort, because of the decline in imports, the most important tax base.
Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP was quite an
achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately, at some 3
to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
8.        After 1968/69 better tax collection and substantial surpluses of
the groundnut stabilization fund following rising world market prices led
to a recovery of public savings in 1970/71, when they represented some 7
percent of current revenues. Yet locally financed public investment con-
tinued, as it had throughout the 1960's, to exceed savings by a wide margin,
resulting in a complete depletion of Treasury deposits by mid-1971. Rising
deficits of public enterprises have in recent years contributed heavily to
the Treasury's liquidity squeeze. This is particularly constraining within
the framework of the West African Monetary Union where the possibilities of
credit expansion are very limited.
9.        Senegal has been benefitting from a high inflow of foreign aid,
mostly on concessionary terms. About 65 percent of the public capital pro-
gram has been financed by foreign aid which averaged US$25 million per year



-3-
between 1966 and 1970. This corresponds to US$6.5 per capita annually, main-
ly financed by the European Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30
percent). The World Bank Group and Germany contributed, respectively, 13
and 10 percent of the total. Foreign aid concentrated on infrastructure and
on directly productive projects in the rural sector. Of importance was tech-
nical assistance, mainly in education, which amounted to US$29 million an-
nually. Seventy-five percent of this was financed by the French Government.
10.       An important constraint to more rapid economic growth has been the
inadequacy of Government planning and project preparation. The Plan has re-
mained a list of projects and pre-projects prepared by the technical minis-
tries, and the Secretariat for Planning suffers from a shortage of qualified
personnel at all levels. A team of four experts from the UN is expected to
join the Secretariat for Planning in the near future to help draw up the
Fourth Plan (1973/74-1976/77). This reinforcement will still leave some
critical positions understaffed.
Prospects
11.       Prospects for the coming years are brighter.   Following a 30 per-
cent producer price increase, other supporting Government measures (e.g. a
planting bonus to farmers, cancellation of old debt) as well as more favor-
able weather, groundnut production increased by about 60 percent in 1971/72.
This has been instrumental in triggering economic recovery and creating for
the first time in several years an atmosphere of optimism in Senegal. At the
same time, several projects, mainly for the production of rice, cotton, and
more recently, vegetables have made good progress, and will allow Senegal in
the longer term to broaden its agricultural base. It is estimated that rice
production could grow at more than 15 percent a year in the next six years
while cotton production might well double between 1971/72 and 1974/75. The
livestock sector has already started to recover from the 1968 drought; pros-
pects for meat exports through the introduction of feeding ranches are en-
couraging.
12.       In spite of the obstacles described in paragraph 5, industrial pro-
duction increased by 6 percent in 1970 and by 11 percent in 1971 (excluding
groundnut processing) mainly in textile, shoes, and building material. This
trend is expected to continue as long as purchasing power remains high follow-
ing the recovery of groundnuts. Moreover, two sectors, fishing and tourism,
have greatly helped to offset the 1968-1970 recession in agriculture and are
expected to continue to expand rapidly in the coming years. Fish production
has increased by 30 percent in 1971, while expansion of tourism was hampered
by the lack of adequate hotels. This should change during the coming season,
when hotel capacity will increase by 75 percent.
13.       However, diversification will at best be a lengthy process.    For
many years to come Senegal's economic fortunes will continue to be closely
associated with groundnuts and the vagaries of weather and world market
prices. The immediate outlook for groundnuts seems bright. A bumper crop
is expected for 1972/73 and possibly also for 1973/74, which may reach the
1965 record production of 1.1 million tons. Medium and longer term prospects,



-4-
however, depend largely on the future trend in world market prices.    Since
the beginning of 1971, groundnut prices have fallen by some 16 percent, but
are still some 50 percent above the 1967 level. Even if world market prices
further decline, it should be noted that present producer prices are suffi-
ciently low to absorb another 15 percent decline without eliminating govern-
ment revenues from groundnut exports.   Thus, except in the case of a very
substantial decline in groundnut prices, GDP growth over the next five years
should be much higher than'over the last decade, possibly reaching as much
as 4-5 percent per year.
14.       Such acceleration of economic growth is essential to help-improve
public finances." Since tax rates are already relatively high, the urgently
needed revenue increases will have to come from a combination of better col-
lection and economic growth.   In addition, the Government is determined,to
keep the necessary expansion of current expenditures to a minimum.    Probably
the most promising way to generate more resources for investment within the .
public sector is to improve the financial performance of public enterprises,'
thus eliminating their substantial drain on the Treasury in recent years.
The combination of these measures ought to result in some increases in public
savings. However, no spectacular results can be expected in the short-run
and Senegal will remain heavily dependent on foreign aid.
15.-      It is estimated that the resource gap will increase rapidly to
reach an annual average of over US$50 million for the period 1971-1975 as
against US$33 million in 1966-70. France and the EEC-are expected to con-
tinue to finance about one half of the resource gap, and the share of the
Bank Group would increase from 9 percent in 1966-70 to about 20 percent in
1971-1975.
16.       The terms of foreign aid have hardened substantially; the propor-
tion of grant aid declined from 85 percent in 1965/66 to 65 percent in 1968-
1970 with a low of 51 percent in 1970. In view of the difficult financial
situation of Senegal, it is crucial that this proportion does not further
deteriorate and that foreign 'aid makes an appreciable contribution to local
cost financing.
17.       The need for foreign aid to remain on concessionary terms is under-
lined by the balance of payments outlook. During 1971, the foreign trade
situation deteriorated markedly with exports covering hardly 55 percent of
imports (as compared to,70-80 percent during the last five years). This trend
was the result of very special circumstances: an exceptionally low groundnut
crop in 1970; high'1971 imports, in anticipation of the good 1971 crop; extra-
ordinarily high foreign aid disbursements. These circumstances are not ex-
pected to be repeated during the coming years. Nevertheless, even discount-
ing a sharp fall in groundnut prices, balance of payments projections in-
dicate little--if any--surplus over the coming years, while falling groundnut
prices would no doubt increase balance of payments deficits.   Thus, while '
Senegal should obtain its foreign assistance on,'DA terms, the present and
foreseeable low'foreign debt service ratio (4-5 percent of exports) indicates
that there is some' limited margin to borrow on Bank terms.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       Bank Group lending for projects in Senegal is planned to quadruple
from US$13 million in 1964-68 to US$55 million in 1969-73. As a result, the
Bank Group has now become one of the major lenders to Senegal providing roughly
one fifth of official external capital requirements.
19.       The proposed loan and credit would be the ninth Bank Group opera-
tion in Senegal. Total lending to date has been US$28.1 million (net of
cancellations) in the form of six credits and two loans. Disbursements have
proceeded satisfactorily except in the case of the first agricultural credit
(paragraphs 6, 21) and the first railway credit (paragraphs 39-42). It is
expected that the agricultural credit will be fully disbursed by December
1972, and the first railway project completed in June 1972. Annex I con-
tains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of April 30, 1972.
20.       In line with the Government's development objectives, Bank Group
assistance to Senegal will continue to consist in helping the Government in
(a) broadening and strengthening the economic base; and (b) improving the
utilization of human resources and strengthening public institutions.
21.       Regarding the first objective, past lending in agriculture has been
aimed mainly at improving the productivity and efficiency of groundnut produc-
tion and marketing as well as extending production to new crops and new re-
gions. The First Agricultural Credit (FY1969) suffered at first from the
sharp fall in groundnut production. As a result, disbursements were slow.
However, the Bank's continuous presence and supervision helped the Govern-
ment to take strong action in 1970, which was one of the factors leading to
the recent recovery of production. Since the credit is expected to be fully
disbursed by the end of 1972 and in order to complete the institutional im-
provements which it began, a follow-up operation is being prepared. Two
credits were approved during FY1971 (Casamance rice, Terres Neuves) and
another (Delta rice, FY1973), which will help to diversify agricultural
production, has already been appraised. Preparation of further projects
for vegetables and livestock development will be initiated soon.
22.       While agricultural diversification is thus progressing, it is not
likely to provide the full answer to Senegal's development problems over the
years to come. Diversification of manufacturing production is a possibility.
But for the reasons stated in paragraph 5, it has not yet made much headway.
The Bank Group's only involvement has been IFC participation in a fertilizer
plant near Dakar (Societe Industrielle d'Engrais au Senegal). The Government
has recently submitted to the Bank a proposal for a supertanker repair pro-
ject (total cost about US$90 million) which may provide an opportunity to take
advantage of Dakar's location and existing industrial infrastructure. The
proposal is being studied. Probably more important in the near term than
manufacturing are possibilities in tourism. Major emphasis will be given
to tourism in the Government's Fourth Plan (1973-1977). So far, the only
Bank involvement in this sector is the recently appraised Dakar airport



-6-
project (FY1973), the justification of which will depend in part on increased
tourism. However, further projects in this sector suitable for Bank Group
financing can be, expected as the project content of the Fourth Plan is firmed
up.
23.       As to the second objective, the Bank Group is assisting the Govern-
ment in several ways.  First, during FY1971 a credit was approved for techni-
cal and agricultural education which will soon be followed by a larger general
education project. A substantial education component is also attached to
the Dakar site and services project, which is to be presented to the Executive
Directors at the end of June.  Second, several of our past and proposed oper-
ations are directly aimed at improving the financial, technical and managerial
viability of public, entities. The first railway credit of 1966 falls into
this category.. By increasing and modernizing the capacity of the Regie des
Chemins de Fer du Senegal (Regie), the project was designed to put the Regie
on a sound technical and financial footing. As described in paragraphs 39-41,
this objective has not yet been fully met. However, the transforming of the
railway into a viable institution remains an urgent task, given its role as
the most important freight carrier in Senegal and as a vital link for land-
locked Mali. The proposed second railway project is expected to provide the
basis for this rehabilitation. A further example is the first port project
approved in 1967 which has been instrumental in transforming the Dakar Port
Authority into a technically and financially successful operation and an im-
portant contributor to public savings. Similarly, the recently appraised
telecommunications project (FY1973) will substantially increase capacity and
thus provide the basis for a more efficient and profitable operation of the
telecommunication authority. Bank Group involvement in the site and services
project is also, but not exclusively, motivated by the need to utilize scarce
resources more efficiently. It will allow the Government to provide housing
infrastructure and facilities at much lower cost-and satisfy the needs of a
much larger segment of total urban population than under traditional housing
programs.
24.       The tanker repair project is a good example of the advisory role
the Bank can assume in Senegal. The Government asked the Bank to take the
lead among the potential lenders in assessing the economic and financial
viability of this- project based on preliminary studies and to suggest the
further studies needed to complete the preparation of the project. Given
the complexity and the novelty of the project, the Bank is hiring consul-
tants to assist Bank staff in this work. Another area where the Government
has asked for Bank advice is with regard to the institutional arrangements
for the power sector. The Government is close to reaching agreement with
the French company on a compensated takeover which will pave the way for
the.Bank to go ahead with a proposed power loan (FY1973). Finally, our
discussions with the Government have also been most fruitful on general
policy matters.



-7-
PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       Dakar is the natural point of entry for goods destined for Mali
and Mauritania and roughly one third of the freight carried by the railways
represents transit traffic to these countries. At the same time Dakar is
an important stopover point in the South Atlantic air traffic and is on
major international shipping routes.
26.       Accordingly, transport has consistently ranked high among the Govern-
ment's investment priorities since independence.   The First, Second and Third
Four-Year Plans allocated roughly 25, 30 and 15 percent respectively of the
public capital program to transport. Roads accounted for roughly half of the
total, railways for one fifth, the rest being split between ports and airports.
As a result, today Senegal possesses a relatively well-developed transport
system including some 4,000 km of all-weather roads, 1,200 km of railways,
and a modern deep-water port and airport at Dakar.
27.       Thus, while a great deal of emphasis has already been given to
transport, four issues remain to be resolved if it is to play its proper
role in Senegal's development.
28.       First, the neglect of feeder roads is becoming a serious handicap
to agricultural development. This is particularly pressing in the Casamance
and Senegal Oriental as the "frontier" of agricultural development is expand-
ing into these regions. The Bank's Terres Neuves I and forthcoming second
highway projects contain substantial feeder road elements for those areas,
but more will be needed.
29.       Secondly, there is the general need to provide transport infrastruc-
ture for the opening-up of the eastern and southeastern provinces. Fertile
land is available in these regions and could help to relieve the groundnut
basin around Dakar, where population pressure is high and overcropping occurs.
Some spontaneous and unorganized migration is already taking place towards
these provinces. The Terres Neuves I project is providing the framework for
orderly migration. The proposed railway project, on the other hand, would
substantially increase the capacity of the main transport link with the
Dakar area.
30.       Third, with groundnut traffic running at only half its normal level,
transport capacity in the recent past has just been adequate. However, with
the recent sharp increase in groundnut production serious delays have already
occurred. Since, at the same time, the road transport fleet has not been ade-
quately replaced and is now partly obsolete, Senegal is likely to face serious
transport bottlenecks, unless an important effort is made in the coming de-
cade to modernize transport services and improve their efficiency, and to
further upgrade the transport infrastructure.



-8-
31.       Fourth, road/rail competition is not a major issue in Senegal as
long as 80 percent of the Regie's traffic is in bulk freight more econom-
ically shipped by rail, or captive international traffic. But, there
are other transport coordination problems such as pricing, entry restric-
tions and investment planning which deserve more attention. The Government
agreed to (a) employ consultants to advise on these matters and (b) strengthen
the institutional framework for decision-making on transport coordination.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Railway Project Senegal"
(PTR-112) is being circulated separately to Executive Directors. A Credit
and Project Summary is provided at Annex III.
The Project
33.       The objective of the, proposed project, which will cover the bulk
of the railways' investment needs foreseen for the Fourth Four-Year Plan
period (1973/74-1976/77), is to carry on the physical rehabilitation of
the Regie's equipment and improve its management, operations and finances.
It would be the second Bank Group lending operation with the Regie since
Senegal's independence; the first made in 1966 amounted to US$9 million
equivalent. Prior to independence, a Bank loan of US$7.5 million for die-
selization was made to the Regie's predecessor, the Office Central des
Chemins de Fer d'Outre-Mer. Negotiattons took place in Washington from
May 10-15, 1972. The Senegalese Delegation was headed by the Minister of
Planning, Mr. Ousmane Seck.
34.       The project consists of the following items:
(a). Renewal of 175 kilometers of track as part of the ongoing
program to renew the main line between Dakar and the Mali
border; about 243 kilometers have been already renewed and
after completion of this project item, 226 kilometers will
remain for renewal. This item represents 71 percent of
total project cost.
(b) Rehabilitation of, and equipment for, the railway's work-
shops in Thies. The workshop layout is inefficient, re-
quiring removal of some existing buildings, construction
of some new buildings,. installation of proper handling
equipment and replacement of over-age machine tools (14
percent of total cost).
(c) Modernization of rolling stock (freight cars), by the in-
stallation of modern roller bearing axle boxes on 50 percent
of the bogie freight car stock.   The use of roller bearings
will reduce maintenance and personnel costs, frequency of
axle-box heating and will allow higher speeds (2 percent of
total cost).



-9-
(d)  Six 1,200 horsepower diesel locomotives which are being
financed jointly with French suppliers' credit and a grant
from PAC (10 percent of the total cost).
(e) Provision for training and technical assistance (1) at man-
agement level to improve train operation; (ii) to improve
workshop management and to implement a new freight tariff;
and (iii) to the Government for transport coordination to
help train personnel, carry out investment planning, review
the regulatory system and other relevant systems bearing on
the transportation industry (4 percent of total cost).
Cost and' Financing
35.       The total cost of the project net of taxes is CFAF 3,169 million
(US$12.3 million) with a foreign exchange component of CFAF 1,742 million
(US$6.8 million equivalent). The proposed IDA credit of US$3.2 million
equivalent and Bank loan of US$6.4 million equivalent would finance 77 per-
cent of the cost of the project. The remainder would be financed as fol-
lows: a credit from Caisse Centrale (US$0.7 million or 6 percent), a grant
from FAC (US$0.6 million or 5 percent), and the Regie's own resources (US$1.5
million or 12 percent). The Bank Group operation would finance 83 percent
of foreign exchange costs and 74 percent of its local costs. The proposed
cost sharing reflects Senegal's limited domestic resources and the consequent
need for foreign lenders to finance a substantial part of total costs.
36.       While the loan would be made directly to the Regie, the proceeds
of the credit would be relent to the Regie at 7-1/4 percent annual interest
to be repaid in 25, years, including a grace period of five years.
Project Entity
37.       The Regie was created as a state-owned autonomous entity in August
1960 out of the part of the former Dakar-Niger Railways situated in the Re-
public of Senegal. Dakar-Niger Railways, serving what has now become Senegal
and Mali, was run by a single management with headquarters at Thies, Senegal.
The Regie, while continuing to maintain its headquarters and workshops at
Thies, inherited a share of the properties and net assets of the former Dakar-
Niger Railways, representing 62 percent of the total. The remaining 38 per-
cent became the Mali Railway, operating under independent control and manage-
ment.
38.       The Regie is under the authority of the Minister of Public Works,
Urbanism and Transport and is administered by a Board consisting of 18 mem-
bers, including the Chairman nominated by the Minister of Transport. Except
for the operating and capital budgets which, in addition to review and en-
dorsement by the Board, require specific approval of the Ministers of Trans-
port and Finance, the Board has overall authority for railway administration.



- 10 -
Performance under the First'Railway-Project '(Credit 96-SE)
39.       The 1966 project involved the relaying of track, the doubling of
the Dakar-Thies line, the purchase of locomotives, rolling stock, spare parts
and equipment, and the provision of'consulting services.   All project items
have now been delivered, with the exception of a few spare parts for motive
power, and material for the renewal'of 39 additional kilometers of track,
financed with savings under the credit, for which contracts have been placed.
The project is due to be completed in June 1972, about three years behind the
original schedule.,
40.       The financial performance of the Regie during the first project
fell considerably short of expectations, principally because traffic did
not increase as expected at the time of appraisal. Thus freight carried by
the Regie increased from 1.67 million tons in 1965/66 to 1.78 million tons.
in 1970/71, .rather"than to 2.76 million tons as projected. As a result,
gross annual revenues stayed more or less constant at about CFAF 2.5 mil-
lion instead of increasing to CFAF 3.7'million. The'decline in Senegal's
groundnut production from-1 million tons in 1965 to 400,000 tons in 1970
meant that the allocation of 400,000 tons'of'-groundnuts to the Regie,'as
agreed at negotiations, was impossible. 'At the same time, the Regie's ef-
fort- to cut personnel costs':was largely offset by an increase in its mate-
rial costs. As a,result, the-Regie is still operating at a loss as compared
to a target rate of return for 1969/70 of 4 percent on investment' as agreed
in 1966.
41.       The shortfalls in the Regie's performance under Credit No. 96-SE
must be viewed in the light of the Senegalese and Malian economies' failure
to move ahead as rapidly as expected. Thus the recent economic recovery in
both countries will make it easier to rehabilitate the railways, which re-
mains an urgent task, given the Regie's role as the most important freight
carrier' in Senegal and as a vital link for the land-locked economy'of Mali.
42.       But more will be needed to achieve this objective.   Based on the
experiences under the first project,' a plan of action has been formulated
providing the Regie with the operational, financial and technical guidelines
to improve its efficiency. This plan, to which the Government and the Regie,
agreed during negotiations, defines measures 'to reduce personnel costs, in-
crease tariffs and eliminate uneconomic lines (Schedule 4 of Credit Agree-
ment). Another essential feature of the second project would be to provide
a much larger element of technical assistance to help train Senegalese staff
at all technical and managerial levels. The second project-projects an
operating. surplus (before'interest payments) in 1975/76 equivalent to a rate
of return on net fixed assets of 2 percent.
Project Execution,
43.       The Regie would be responsible for executing the project. With
the help of the technical assistance in management, the Regie will be able
to carry out the project. Its track renewal personnel are now well trained
and perform satisfactory work, and the workshop modernization will have the



benefit of technical assistance. The planning unit, established in 1970,
is operating satisfactorily; the project will provide assistance in imple-
menting a new freight tariff structure. While the Regie was not able to
meet all the targets agreed in 1966 for reducing the excessive numbers of
staff and increasing productivity, considerable progress has been made.
Thus, since 1965, the number of employees has decreased by 18 percent. On
the other hand, the Regie, which inherited high personnel costs from pre-
independence days, was not successful in preventing increases in wages and
salaries paid to its employees until the wages and salaries paid to government
employees reached the same level, as agreed with the Association in 1966. As
new targets, the Government has agreed to the reduction of the ratio of direct
personnel expenditures to total working expenditures from 71 percent in 1969/
70 to 64 percent by 1976/77.
Financial Position
44.       For the period 1971-75, freight traffic is expected to increase by
about 4 percent annually, that is, from 1.78 million tons in 1970/71 to 2.24
million tons in 1975/76. The biggest rise is expected in groundnut traffic
which should more than double to 250,000 tons in 1975/76 in view of the Gov-
errment's market-oriented agricultural policy, which in 1971/72 has already
resulted in a doubling of groundnut output, and the more flexible pricing
and more aggressive marketing policies to be adopted by the Regie. Only a
slight increase (some 2 percent over five years) is expected in passenger
traffic.
45.       An important measure to Lncrease freight traffic is the simplifica-
tion of the tariff structure. First, a more flexible and competitive pricing
policy for groundnut traffic will be adopted. Second, selective rate adjust-
ments, particularly for phosphates, are designed to achieve, together with
the first measure, an increase in the average revenue per ton-kilometer from
presently CFAF 5.0 to CFAF 5.5 by the beginning of 1973. The Government has
agreed during negotiations to modify the tariff structure along these lines.
46.       Gross revenues of the Regie are expected to increase by some 7 per-
cent per annum from CFAF 2.4 billion (US$9.4 million equivalent) in 1970/71
to CFAF 3.3 billion (US$12.9 million equivalent) in 1975/76. These increases
are expected to result from the projected increase in traffic, improved bill-
ing for phosphate and freight tariff increases from 1972/73. Operating costs,
on the other hand, are expected to stay constant at about CFAF 2.4 billion in
spite of forecast increases in material costs so that, even after allowing
for substantially higher depreciation, the Regie should by 1975/76 produce a
net operating surplus of CFAF 288 million (US$1.1 million equivalent), in
place of its present persistent operating deficits. Such a surplus would be
equivalent to a rate of return of about 2 percent on the value of average net
fixed assets in use, and this target was agreed during negotiations. Interest
charges on long term debt, however, will steadily increase, and the Regie will
continue to operate with a net overall deficit, after interest charges are
paid, through 1975/76, though the gap will narrow from CFAF 356 million
(US$1.4 million equivalent) in 1970/71 to CFAF 20 million (US$0.1 million
equivalent) in 1975/76.



- 12 -
47.       Part of the Regie's financial difficulties are the result of a
substantial unsettled debt of the Malian railways which dates back to pre-
independence times. The Association has received the assurances of the Mali
Government that this debt will now'be 6ettled.  The Senegalese Government has
accepted the terms and conditions of the Malian offer to settle this debt.
The written confirmation by the Senegalese Government of this agreement
would be a condition of effectiveness of the'proposed loan and credit.
48.       The Regie's current liabilities considerably exceed its current
assets. As of June 30, 1970, current liabilities of CFAF 3.0 billion
(US$11.8 million equivalent) compared with current assets of CFAF 1.87 (US$7.3
million equivalent).  The principal item in the current liabilities consists
of short-term advances from the Treasury which as of June 30, 1970 amounted
to CFAF 2.26 billion (US$9.0 million equivalent) and were roughly equal to
the accumulated deficit of the Regie. There is little prospect of the
Regie repaying the Treasury advances within a reasonable period of time.
The Government has therefore agreed to convert by July 1, 1973 the Regie's
accumulated indebtedness to the Government (estimated at CFAF 3,400 million
as of December 31, 1971) as follows: 50 percent into equity contribution
to the Regie and 50 percent into long-term debt, free of interest charges
and repayable over 40 years starting in 1982/83.
Procurement and Disbursements
49.       Procurement of materials financed by the Bank Group will be on the
basis of international competitive bidding except in the case of aggregate
sand and ballast, which will be procured through local competitive bidding.
Bid comparisons will be made on the basis 'of the CIF landed price. In the
case of procurement of cement, mostly needed for the manufacturing of ties
by the Regie, international'competitive bidding will also apply, but the
local supplier will be allowed a preference of 15 percent in lieu of the
7present tariff of 64 percent. Procurement for the six locomotives financed
by FAC and Caisse Centrale will be on the basis of a negotiated contract with
a French supplier.
50.       Disbursements will be made on the CIF landed cost of imported
equipment and materials as well as on the foreign cost of technical services
and training, and on 74 percent of the cost of locally acquired goods and
services. Disbursements will extend through FY1974/75. If there should be
any savings in Bank Group-financed items, they should be used to finance the
foreign exchange costs and possibly part of the local cost of further items
under the Regie's investment plan subject to agreement with the Bank Group.
Benefits
51.       Some 400 km'of track remain to be renewed on the main line from
Dakar to the Mali border'(644 km).  This line serves Mali as the main link
to the Atlantic. Th'e track has passed its useful life, and severe speed re-
strictions have been imposed for safety reasons. Accidents, however, are
still frequent. The envisaged track renewal, designed to strengthen the back-
bone of the Senegal railway system, was started during the Second Four-Year



- 13 -
Plan and partly financed by Credit 96-SE. If the track renewal program were
not carried out, the line could be kept in operation only for another eight
years, at increasing maintenance and accident cost, reduced line capacity and
a substantial loss of traffic and income to the Senegal economy. It is also
essential to increase capacity and reduce cost for Mali's exports and imports,
which presently to a significant extent have to be diverted to the much
costlier route through Abidjan. The economic rate of return for track re-
newal was estimated at about 22 percent.
52.       The present inadequate layout of the workshops and their obsolete
machinery means that servicing and repair of rolling stock take double the
time considered normal. This adversely affects the utilization and thus the
earning power of the rolling stock. The reduction in unit maintenance cost
of about CFAF 70 to 80 million a year, or roughly 3 percent of the Regie's
total expenditures would represent an economic rate of return of about 18
to 24 percent.
53.       An important benefit of the project would be that it would make
the Regie a financially viable public enterprise. Instead of the pervasive
operating deficits amounting to some CFAF 240 million in recent years, the
Regie is expected to make an operating surplus of CFAF 288 million once the
project is completed in 1975/76. The resulting reduction of the overall
deficit, after interest charges, from CFAF 356 million in 1971 to some CFAF
65 million in 1976, will represent a significant contribution to the overall
improvement of public finances.
