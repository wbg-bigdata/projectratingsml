REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SECOND PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $67 million to help
finance a proposed second ports project. The loan would have a term of
17 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.5% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Korean
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158 dated March 4, 1977./l
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex 1.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        During the last few years, the external economic environment has
been subject to unexpected, sharp and sudden changes which seriously affected
economic activity in Korea and, more particularly, its external trade and pay-
ments situation. The boom in world trade led to increases in the volume of
Korean exports of 46% and 54% in 1972 and 1973 respectively. But in 1974,
the quadrupling of oil prices combined with a sharp rise in the prices of
foodgrains and capital goods led to a deterioration of 18% in the terms of
trade. At the same time, the deep recession in the industrialized countries
caused a slackening in the growth of exports to some 9%. The pur-
chasing power of exports, which had expanded by over 46% each year in 1972
and 1973, actually decreased by nearly 11% in 1974. During 1975 export
volume grew by a remarkable 20%, assisted by the devaluation of the won in
December 1974 and a very vigorous drive to expand and diversify markets. How-
ever, part of this gain was offset by a further deterioration of 10% in the
terms of trade.
4.        The Korean Government set two major economic targets for 1976.
They were to restrain inflation to 10% and to reduce the balance of payments
current account deficit substantially from $1.9 billion in 1975 to $1.4 bil-
lion. Preliminary indications are that the former goal was achieved and the
latter substantially surpassed.   Wholesale prices which had increased by
nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end of 1975 are estimated to have
increased by around 10% in 1976, primarily because import costs (which more
than doubled between 1972 and 1974) apparently decreased by about 1% in 1976;
moreover, the growth in domestic credit was limited in 1976 to 21% (compared
with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively).
5.        Primarily, as a result of the recovery in the OECD countries,
Korea's exports appears to have increased in 1976, by about 44% in volume and
there was an improvement of 13% in the terms of trade. While part of this

visited the Republic of Korea in June/July 1976.

- 2 -
increase in exports may have been supplied by a drawing-down of inventories,
it is evident that it could not have been achieved without substantial
additions to production capacity in the last couple of years. A remarkable
feature of Korea's economic management through the crisis of 1974 and 1975
was that fixed investment continued to grow at an average of 11% per annum in
constant 1970 prices, raising its ratio to GNP from 24.3% in 1973 to 25.6% in
1975.
6.        The real growth of GNP in 1976 is estimated at 15.2% as compared
with an average increase of 8.5% in the two previous years. This was the
result primarily of buoyant exports, but the extraordinary growth in agricul-
tural output was also a significant factor. Value added in agriculture grew
at over 7% in each of the last two years. While weather conditions were
favorable over the past three seasons, there has also been a real improvement
in yields as a result of better technology and the more effective use of the
various inputs.
7.        Although there was a large increase in the outstanding external debt
during the Third Plan period (1972-76), the real burden of external debt has
in fact declined. The ratio of debt service payments to exports (of goods and
nonfactor services) declined from an average of 21% in the early 1970s to an
estimated 11% at the end of 1976. Total outstanding debt is estimated at
about$7 billion in medium- and long-term maturities and an additional $2 bil-
lion in maturities of less than one year. Debt service payments are estimated
to have been nearly $1 billion in 1976, which was well within Korea's repay-
ment capacity.
8.        It would appear that Korea achieved several of the objectives it
set for itself in the Third Plan, despite the balance of payments difficul-
ties experienced in 1974 and 1975 and a generally less favorable international
economic environment than had been expected. The rate of growth of GNP was
around 11% per year compared with the original target of 8.6%. Considerable
progress has also been made in expanding the manufacturing sector. However,
progress in reducing reliance on foreign savings and in restraining inflation
fell short of expectations. Furthermore, even with employment growing at 4%
per annum during the Third Plan period, there has been little improvement in
the unemployment situation. Although over two million jobs were created
during the Third Plan period, they were barely sufficient to keep pace with
the growth in the labor force; the open unemployment rate in the urban areas
remains at about 7%.
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
9.        The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) has afforded an oppor-
tunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiency" and "greater equity and social development."
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. The Plan projects that the current
account deficit will be eliminated during the next few years. National sav-
ings are expected to finance as much as 95% of total investment as compared
with about 72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76). However, these projections



-3-
may prove overly optimistic. The domestic savings target appears somewhat
ambitious, while the projected investment requirements may turn out to be too
low.
10.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.    Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean scheme of
things. The main emphasis is: (a) on providing adequate employment oppor-
tunities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent aggravating the
unemployment problem; and (b) on achieving a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of growth. Rising employment is the most important instrument for
achieving an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. This is all
the more so because, despite the success in reducing the rate of growth of
population to around 1.7% per annum, the labor force continues to grow at
over 3% per annum because of the baby boom following the Korean War in the
early 1950s. Health outlays will increase as a proportion of total invest-
ment with special stress on preventive care and an innovative health deliv-
ery system to service low income families, especially in the rural areas.
Rural incomes are expected to increase as a result of a further improvement
in agricultural terms of trade and increased opportunities for nonfarm employ-
ment, primarily through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and small indus-
tries development. The quality of life in the rural areas is to be further
enhanced by the provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
11.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in the
basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has followed
so successfully since the mid-sixties. GNP is expected to rise at 9.2% per
annum, fueled by the growth of 16% per annum in the volume of manufactured
exports. The manufacturing sector, which now contributes 32% of GNP, is
expected to provide 54% of the increase in GNP during the Plan period,
increasing at 14.3% a year. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 27% to about 42% in 1981,
with the manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total exports compared
with 85% in 1975. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in effi-
ciency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage will gradually shift
towards manufactures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which
require relatively more skilled labor. It is also necessary to achieve some
import substitution in steel and chemicals to ensure an adequate supply of
intermediate inputs for the export industries. These changes in the indus-
trial structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms for
the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate indi-
genous technology.
12.       The Plan targets for exports are challenging but appear to be
attainable, given the extraordinary drive of the Korean exporters, a con-
tinuation of the present level of export incentives and the assumption that
the economies of the OECD countries will grow at an average rate of around
5% annually during the Plan period.
13.       Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the
mobilization of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is
expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization of
private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the move-
ment of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. The terms of trade are



-4-
projected to be fairly stable through the Fourth Plan period and a rate of
inflation of the order of 10% a year is foreseen. The Government has taken
measures designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be gener-
ated by these developments to an increasing extent into the financial sys-
tem, and, thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In
addition to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of
savings, the measures include the imposition of a capital gains tax at the
rate of 50% on undeveloped land, and 30% on nonprincipal household dwellings.
Funds that went into real estate are now flowing into the securities market
where the after-tax yields are more attractive. At the same time, direct
measures have been taken to force corporations to "go public," thus increas-
ing the supply of corporate securities. Steps are also being taken to
increase the variety of financial securities in terms of maturities, yields
and conditions that would constitute an attractive package to investors.
14.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings are
being supported by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surchage imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value-added tax intro-
duced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban consumers through
the Grain Management Fund and the Fertilizer Fund is being reduced. The
increased resource mobilization and the strong restraint on most current
expenditures will result in substantial budgetary current surpluses which
could be used to finance capital expenditures.
15.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.    The con-
tinued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light of the
need to create additional employment for the growing labor force. Further-
more, the predominant role the export sector is expected to play is appro-
priate in view of Korea's limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the
manpower and the entrepreneurial capacity to implement the Plan's investment
program. The Plan strikes a reasonable balance between the various objec-
tives of increasing employment, maintaining a minimum growth of per capita
incomes, strengthening the balance of payments and making progress towards
diversifying the industrial structure so as to sustain export growth in the
1980s.
16.       The main impediment to the successful implementation of the Plan
is likely to be the difficulty that Korea may encounter in raising the
necessary resources. As indicated above, Korea's ability to meet its invest-
ment requirements from domestic savings may fall short of the Plan projec-
tions, while a sizeable continuing inflow of external capital will also be
necessary to help meet the burden of amortizing the external debt. It is
estimated that Korea may need to borrow an average of $2.5 billion per annum
over the next several years, and its ability to obtain foreign capital in
adequate amounts and in reasonable terms will continue to be a challenge.
The servicing of the debt should not pose serious difficulties given the
present debt servicing ratio and the prospects for continued export growth
provided that the proportion of external debt incurred on shorter term and at
high interest rates is not excessive. On the assumption that Korea can
obtain the required inflow of capital on reasonable terms, the debt service
ratio which now stands at around 11% is expected to decline slowly to just
under 10% at the end of the decade and remain at that level during the 1980s.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       As of January 31, 1977, Korea had received 30 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, amounting in total to $1,255.3 mil-
lion in loans and $106.9 million in credits (taking into account cancellations
and the refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
18.       A substantial part ($491.2 million) of Bank financing has been for
the transort sector. $194.5 million has been lent for agriculture projects.
The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received $150 million,
the Korea Development Bank (KDB) $142.5 million, and the Medium Industry Bank
(I4B) $30 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. A total
of $80.3 million has been provided for three education projects; $25.0 mil-
lion for a tourism project; $15.0 million for a secondary cities project;
and $60.0 million for a rural infrastructure project. In addition, two pro-
gram loans amounting to $175.0 million have also been granted to Korea.
19.       As of January 31, 1977, $534.1 million of the total Bank lending
remained undisbursed on effective loans and credits, mostly from commitments
in the past 18 months. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits, and IFC investments as of that date and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As indicated in the notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory.
20.       Excluding one project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had
by January 31, 1977 entered into 16 commitments totalling $69.3 million
(net of participations and cancellations). On March 22, 1977, the Board
approved an investment of up to $15.37 million in the Korea Development
Leasing Corporation (KDLC), of which up to $10.0 million will be sold to
participants. Under preliminary consideration are projects in cement dis-
tribution, special steels and construction materials.
21.       The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and rural
development is reflected in the Bank's lending program for FY77. The Miho
Watershed Area Development Project, the Second Agricultural Credit Project
and a project encompassing the second stage of the development of the Yong
San Gang basin have been approved by the Executive Directors during this
fiscal year.
22.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural sectors
and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent infrastructural
development. Although the transport sector will be given less emphasis than
in the past, the investments required are large, and thus there is consider-
able support for this sector in the proposed program.
23.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt (dis-
bursed) outstanding at the end of 1975 was about 8.7%, and the share of debt
service was of the order of 4.6% at that time. These ratios are expected to
increase to around 18% and 11% by the end of the present decade.



- 6 -
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
24.       The fundamental changes in Korea's economy in the past decade
were accompanied by significant changes in the transport sector. The
railways, which had been rehabilitated following the Korean War and remained
for many years the only means of large-scale movement of goods and passen-
gers, has lost its preponderant position, although it still remains an
important mode of transport particularly for bulk commodities. A diversi-
fied road transport system has been developed and paved roads more than
quadrupled during the decade. The share of coastal goods transport in total
traffic has also increased markedly, primarily due to the movement of oil
products. The country's export drive and reliance on foreign trade has led
to a six-fold increase in the volume of port traffic and an eight-fold
increase in Korea's international fleet.
25.       The Bank Group, through its association with the Government's efforts
to modernize and expand the transport sector dating back to 1962, has played
an important role in these developments. Some $220 million has been provided
for five railway projects designed to increase its capacity and improve its
operations; three loans totaling $191.5 million have been made for highway
construction and paving of high priority sections of the national network and
for a countrywide maintenance organization; and a loan of $80 million has been
provided for the expansion of facilities at Busan, the country's premier port,
and at Mugho, primarily for improving coal handling facilities.
26.       As Korea's economy continues to grow and the pace of industrializa-
tion intensifies, there will have to be a corresponding expansion of transport
facilities. The internal transport system will have to cope with the movement
of much large volumes of widely used bulk commodities such as coal, cement,
iron and steel, and fertilizer. The industrial complexes which are burgeon-
ing on the south and southeastern coast and are planned in the southwest will
require the import of large amounts of raw materials and the transport of
intermediate products between plants. Some of these plants are likely also
to export large volumes of their output. In addition, a more diffuse
pattern of growth in nonbulk freight traffic and passenger traffic is
expected to result from the general growth of the economy.
27.       The Government has taken steps to improve transport coordination,
particularly through the establishment and operation of a Transport Coordi-
nation Office (TCO) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation.
Its main functions are to collect data and assist in the formulation and
review of transport policies, especially those related to pricing and regu-
lation. The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) has also afforded an
opportunity to formulate and review investment proposals related to the
transport sector on a more systematic basis than hitherto. Traffic trends
were analyzed in detail and the proposed investments are based on the assump-
tion that Korea's economy will continue to grow at about 9% per annum and
that the deepening of the industrial structure will intensify; they amount to
about W 2,800 billion and represent just over 14% of the total investment
called for in the Plan. The modal allocation compared with that undertaken
during the Third Plan is as follows:



- 7-
1972-76                         1977-81

Railways                 284          585     15          402         829     14
Road transport           871        1,795     47        1,226       2,527     44
Ports and shipping       513        1,058     28          996       2,052     36
Aviation                 138          284      7           59         122      2
Urban systems             50          203      3           101        208      4
1,856       3,825     100        2,784       5,738    100
The Fourth Plan allocation of total investment to the transport sector is
about the same percentage as in the Third Plan period, but represents an
increase of 50% in real terms. About half of the investment will be under-
taken by the public sector (mainly for highways, railways and ports) and the
other half by the private sector, in vehicles and ships. In broad terms, the
investment program appears to respond satisfactorily to the growing demand
for transport facilities and the intermodal allocation of investment reflects
the changing composition of demand, although some questions regarding some of
the specific investment projects remain; the Government intends to subject
these to a more detailed scrutiny to ensure that their objectives are met
in the most economical manner.
28.       The past and planned evelopment of the various transport modes
has been influenced by: the nature of Korea's terrain (about two thirds of
the country is hilly); the concentration of economic activity and population
around the Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas; the location of the country's major
coal deposits, limestone and cement plants in the northeast; a long coast-
line along which industrial activity is increasing; and the economic depen-
dence on the export of manufactured goods and imports of bulk raw materials.
The major features of the transport system (illustrated in the attached
Map I) are summarized below.
Highways
29.       There was virtually no highway system in Korea 20 years ago.    Only
a few kilometers of interurban roads were paved and many villages were with-
out road connections to the rest of the economy. The present highway system
is still inadequate to cope with the rapid growth of road transport, despite
the Government's efforts since 1968 to catch up with the backlog of necessary
improvements. Only 44% of the national highways and 19% of other roads are
paved. This situation will require a continued high level of investmern.
Railways
30.       At the end of 1975, the Korean National Railroad (KNR) operated
3,068 route-km of standard gauge, of which 529 km were double track. Elec-
trification of some 321 km of industrial lines from Seoul to the northeast



- 8 -
coast (carrying mostly mineral traffic) was completed in October 1975. Also,
about 100 km of suburban lines have been electrified, and a subway in the
Seoul area was opened in 1974.
31.       The railway is expected to retain its share of the bulk commodity
movements, presently representing about 80% of its freight traffic, in line
with its operational improvements and the acquisition of additional rolling
stock. Continued competition from other modes is expected for the remaining
20% of general freight traffic and for passenger traffic, although the railway
is likely to retain a significant amount of such traffic.
Ports and Shipping
32.       Freight traffic through the ports has increased from about 11 million
tons in 1965 to about 70 million tons in 1975. This sharp increase resulted
in serious port capacity problems, particularly at Busan, the largest port,
which handles 20% of the country's external trade. Incheon, the nearest port
to Seoul, is being expanded, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), through the addition of 20 deep-water berths, including 5 container
berths, within an impounded basin. The project has been under implementation
since 1974, although two berths, the breakwaters and some ancillary works will
not be completed until later this year. However, the facilities are substan-
tially underutilized and are expected to remain so for many years because
transport costs to and from the Seoul area and other poles of industrial
activity, such as Daejeon and Ulsan, are higher via Incheon than via Busan.
33.       Construction of the First Port Project (Loan 917-KO, cf. Annex II),
involving works at Busan and Mugho, is proceeding satisfactorily and it is
expected to be completed on schedule in mid-1978. However, following the oil
price increases of 1973/74, the project experienced serious cost overruns.
The total project cost is now expected to be $49 million (41%) higher than
estimated at the time of project appraisal, including about $35 million in
foreign exchange.  The Government signed a Loan Agreement on March 8, 1976
with the Saudi Fund for Development, which will provide up to $35 million
equivalent towards the foreign exchange cost overrun. As required by the
conditions of Loan 917-KO, the Government established, in March 1976, the
Korea Maritime and Port Authority (KMPA) and, at the same, set up port
administrative units at all first-class ports, including the project ports.
34.       In addition to the ongoing Bank-financed project at Mugho and Busan,
the Government began, in 1975, construction of major port facilities costing
about $200 million, at Bugpyeong, Pohang and Onsan on the east coast, and at
Samil on the south coast. These facilities were designed and are being con-
structed by the Ministry of Construction (MOC) as integral parts of the site
preparation and infrastructure for a number of industrial plants: Bugpyeong
will handle bulk cement; Pohang inbound iron ore, coal, limestone and scrap
steel, and outbound steel products from the expanded Pohang steel mill; Onsan,
inbound petroleum products for these plants; and Samil, imports of raw mater-
ials for, and outbound products from, a fertilizer plant and petrochemical
complex.



- 9 -
35.       Korea's share in the merchant shipping serving its external trade
is increasing and over the last three years about 38% of the country's total
foreign trade tonnage has been carried by Korean vessels. The important role
of coastal shipping is largely due to the country's geography and the Govern-
ment's development of industrial complexes at Pohang, Onsan and other coastal
sites.
Aviation
36.       Domestic passenger traffic carried by air is growing rapidly, but
still amounts to only about 1% of the total. Domestic air freight traffic is
negligible. Domestic routes are served by the privately-owned Korean Airlines
(KAL), which also operates a number of international flights. There are inter-
national airports at Seoul and Busan.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Port Project" (No. 1354a-KO
dated March 25,1977) is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III. Supplementary Project Data are given in
Annex IV. Negotiations were held in Washington from February 17 to March 10,
1977 with a Korean delegation led by Mr. K.D. Park of the Economic Planning
Board.
38.       The objectives of the proposed project are to continue the develop-
ment of Busan Port, which began under the First Port Project, to an extent
which will meet the demand for increased capacity needed to handle the large
and fast growing external trade of Korea through about 1985. Project formu-
lation was based on a port development study financed under the First Port
Project. The main elements of the Project are summarized below:
(a) Civil Works
(i) a 700 m extension of the common-user container berths being
financed under Loan 917-KO and a 335,000 sq m expansion of
the stacking area provided under that project;
(ii) dredging to provide an alongside depth of 12.5 m;
(iii) the construction of an access road inside the port limits;
a guard house; and an 8,000 sq m container freight station;
(iv) ancillary works and utilities; and
(v) the rehabilitation of two piers, the central wharf, and
a lighter wharf.
(b) Mechanical Equipment
Procurement of container cranes and mobile container handling
equipment.



- 10 -
(c) Floating Craft
Procurement of two tugboats.
(d) Engineering Consultant Services
To carry out detailed design and supervision of construction and
procurement of the above.
(e) Technical Assistance and Training Program
To assist in four areas of port operations: cargo handling (includ-
ing the handling of containers); maintenance; port planning; and
accounting.
Cost and Financing
39.       The estimated total project cost is $112 million equivalent of
which an estimated $70 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed
loan of $67 million would finance most of the foreign exchange cost, the
balance comprising local currency, amounting to $42 million equivalent, and
the remaining $3 million equivalent of foreign exchange, would be provided
by the Government.
Facilities at the Port of Busan
40.       Busan (see Map II attached) has a natural harbor protected by
breakwaters; its northern section handles commercial shipping, whereas the
South Harbor services fishing vessels and other small craft. The entrance
channel is being deepened under the First Port Project to enable it to take
ships of 60,000 dwt as compared with its present capacity to handle ships of
40,000 dwt. Berthing facilities presently consist of about 4,100 m at four
piers and a central wharf. Adequate privately-owned lighters are available
and the port has four shiphandling tugs. Containers are handled with the
ships' own gear and a recently installed container crane. There is ample
transit shed space, some of which is being modernized under the First Project,
and open storage space to meet present needs. Berthing facilities are being
substantially extended under the First Port Project. Details on the facilities
to be constructed under the proposed project are given in Annex III.
41.       With the completion of the proposed project, Busan will have
reached the limits of its physical capacity. Therefore, it will be necessary
to examine other sites for development to meet port expansion needs in
Southeast Korea beyond about 1985 and the Government intends to conduct a
study for this purpose.
42.       The roads giving access to Busan Port pass through the city's
central business district where traffic congestion is posing some difficul-
ties. The incremental traffic generated by the proposed project is not
expected to aggravate the problem. However, the growth of general city
traffic may result in increasing transport costs on goods moving in and out
of the port, and ultimately could become a constraint on the use of the
port. In order to prevent this, the Government is constructing a road



- 11 -
connecting the port area with the Seoul-Busan expressway; this is to be com-
pleted by December 31, 1979 (Section 3.06(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Furthermore, the Government has agreed to undertake a study of city-wide
transport and land use which will provide medium-term solutions to the city's
congestion, and assess their feasibility. The Government will consult with
the Bank on the study's findings and implement its agreed recommendations
(Section 3.06(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Implementation
43.       The proposed project will be executed by the Korea Maritime and
Port Authority (KMPA), which was established on March 19, 1976 (following a
15-month study by consultants financed under the First Port Project) to
administer the construction and operation of Korea's 19 first-class ports
(the 24 second-class ports and numerous minor local ports are operated by
local government authorities). KMPA administers the ports under its juris-
diction through ten District Port Authorities (DPA). Key personnel were
appointed in April 1976, and staff has also been transferred from various
Government ministries to help KMPA discharge its functions. The construction
of "industrial ports," which form part of industrial complexes, is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Construction (MOC) but KMPA assumes respon-
sibility for their operation when construction is completed. While this is
considered a reasonable division of responsibility, KMPA should be consulted
regarding the planning of such ports. The Government has agreed to establish
an Inter-Ministerial Committee, on which KMPA shall be represented, to review
MOC's proposals for industrial ports, and will take appropriate action to
ensure that the views of KMPA are considered before approval of port develop-
ment is granted (Section 5.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
44.       At present, KMPA's finances are controlled through the Government
budgetary system which is rigid and overspecific in regard to expenditures
undertaken by the agency. These arrangements place constraints on the effec-
tive management of KMPA as a business enterprise since financial control is
exercised through expenditure limitation rather than operation performance.
Furthermore, the control of expenditures is vested in bodies outside KMPA,
and the introduction of commercial accounting procedures is impeded by the
necessity of following Government accounting practices. A major objective of
the First Port Project was to ensure that KMPA was given sufficient financial
autonomy and that the ports under its jurisdiction were financially self-
sufficient and operationally efficient. Also, commercial accounting procedures
were regarded as essential in determining the operational efficiency of these
ports. KMPA has not yet been given the requisite degree of financial autonomy,
but the Government has agreed to vest it with an adequate degree of financial
autonomy, including the power to establish a commercial accounting system, by
January 1, 1979 (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
45.       KI4PA's role in cargo handling operations was examined during
appraisal of the First Port Project and it was concluded that the operation
of numerous private licensed operators at all piers led to inefficiencies.
The organization of cargo handling was studied by consultants financed under
the First Port Project. Their recommendations have been discussed and agreed



- 12 -
with the Government and a timetable has been set for the implementation of a
series of measures to reduce the number of Terminal Operating Companies (TOC)
to one at each pier or specialized bulkhandling facility, with KMPA assuming a
more active supervisory responsibility including the improvement of cargo
movements within the Customs area (Sections 5.05 - 5.08 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
46.       Apart from the matters mentioned above, KMPA is operating satisfac-
torily. Its organizational structure is sound and it is expected, to execute
the proposed project efficiently with the help of consultants. However, the
assumption by KMPA of a more active role in cargo handling operations and the
implementation of a commercial accounting system will necessitate recruitment
of additional technically qualified staff. Present salaries for certain cate-
gories of personnel are inadequate because KMPA's salaries are currently tied
to civil service pay scales. In order to attract and retain qualified staff,
the Government has agreed that it would allow KMPA to provide appropriate
emoluments for its staff (Section 3.02 (a) (ii) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
47.       The project would be executed under three civil engineering con-
tracts and two procurement contracts for mechanical equipment and tugs. All
contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines. A preferential margin of 15%
of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports or the customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers of mechanical equipment and
floating craft in the evaluation of bids.
Disbursement
48.       Disbursement for the project civil works would be on the basis of
55 percent of total costs, excluding customs duty, representing the estimated
foreign exchange component. For consulting services (82 man-months), 100% of
the cost of foreign consultants and 80% of the cost of local consultants
would be disbursed; for technical assistance and training (36 man-months),
100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures would be disbursed;
and for procurement of mechanical equipment and tugboats, disbursement would
be on the basis of the actual foreign exchange cost.
Financial Evaluation
49.       As already stated, KMPA does not at present enjoy an adequate
degree of financial autonomy. As a consequence, no financial analysis or
forecasts pertaining to it were made since the necessary data were not
available. However, the Busan District Marine and Port Authority (BDMPA),
one of the ten District Port Authorities through which KMPA administers the
first class ports, having jurisdiction over the proposed project as well as
the First Project, maintains separate accounts on a cash basis which consti-
tute an adequately reliable record for appraisal purposes.
50.       The financial objectives of the project are to (i) ensure the
viability of KMPA in fiscal 1979 and thereafter; and (ii) enable BDMPA to
establish a cost-based tariff system and generate sufficient internal cash



- 13 -
resources to provide a reasonable contribution towards the cost of the
project and minor additional capital assets.
51.       In 1975, BDMPA's net operating revenue of W 1.3 billion represented
a return of 6% on average net fixed assets in use. The development of port
charges and net revenue over the four years ending in 1976 has been satisfac-
tory. Notwithstanding the rapidity with which costs have increased, as a
result of wage and price inflation, port tariffs have increased even faster,
although they remain comparatively low. Financial forecasts for the 1976-82
period show that, on completion of the First Port Project in 1978, operating
costs will rise more than four-fold over the level projected for 1977 due
largely to: increased depreciation; rising charges for maintenance on account
of the cost of running new bulk-handling equipment; and port administration
expenses. To compensate for this rise in anticipated expenditures and enable
BDMPA to finance a reasonable part of the cost of the proposed project from
internally-generated funds, the Government has agreed (i) to establish at
Busan a cost-based tariff system and a uniform tariff for containers; and
(ii) to set and collect charges from cargo handling companies at a level
sufficient to recover all costs related to servicing and maintaining the
container complex, piers and equipment used by the companies (Sections 4.03,
4.05 and 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). These measures will provide an
average return on net fixed assets in operation of at least 7% from 1978
(Section 4.07 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement) as opposed to the 6% figure
which applies under the provisions of the Loan Agreement pertaining to the
First Port Project. BDMPA is expected to be able to generate internally
resources equivalent to 29% of the project cost. The Government has also
agreed to make adjustments in port tariffs at other major ports to achieve
revenues at least equal to the aggregate amount of operating, maintenance,
loan interest and depreciation costs (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment). Further, to ensure that BDMPA maintains an adequate financial posi-
tion, the Government has agreed (i) that BDMPA will not be allowed to incur
new debt if its net revenue falls below 1.5 times the maximum debt service;
(ii) that BDMPA will be provided with such funds as are necessary over and
above its internally-generated cash to enable it to implement its expansion
program; and (iii) that expenditures on capital works at Busan other than
those on the two Bank-financed Ports Projects will be limited to a maximum of
$1.5 million per annum after 1978 until construction of the proposed project
is completed (Sections 3.01, 4.08 and 4.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). The
Government has also agreed that, when KMPA is granted an increased measure
of financial autonomy and acquires the power to incur debt, it will assume
loans to the Government in the same amount and on similar terms to those of
Loan 917-KO and the proposed loan (Section 3.03(b) of the draft Loan Agree-
ment). Since KMPA's earning requirements cannot be realistically estimated
until a commercial accounting system has been introduced at all KMPA's ports,
the rate of return that KMPA will earn in fiscal 1979 and thereafter would be
determined in agreement with the Bank after the commercial accounting system
is installed and in operation (Section 4.07 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
52.       Total traffic through Busan port has grown from 13.3 million
tons in 1973 to 16.8 million tons in 1975, and is estimated to have
reached about 19 million tons in 1976. Containerized cargo has grown even



- 14 -
more rapidly, increasing from 0.9 million tons in 1973 to 2.7 million tons
in 1975 and an estimated 3 million tons in 1976. This rapid growth in
containerized cargo has been achieved notwithstanding the present inadequate
port facilities. Completion of the First Port Project in 1978 will permit
the introduction of direct services by mainline container traffic. The pro-
posed project will be required by about 1981 to handle the further growth
of traffic efficiently. Consultants reviewed a number of alternative sites
in the vicinity of the present port of Busan and a number in the vicinity
of Masan, and concluded that the proposed project is the lowest cost alter-
native.
53.       The current rapid industrialization in southeast Korea is highly
dependent on imports of industrial goods and raw materials, and on export
markets for its products. This large and fast-growing external trade moves
largely through Busan. In addition, the port handles a substantial volume of
containerized goods originating in, or destined for, the Seoul area. Without
the proposed project, all this traffic would suffer heavy penalties, in the
form of higher transport costs, and southeast Korea's economic development
would be seriously retarded as a result. The economic costs are, to a large
extent, incalculable, but would certainly be very substantial. As a conserva-
tive measure of these costs, the economic evaluation of the proposed project
uses the cost of additional ship waiting time and the additional transport
costs on containerized cargo which would be incurred in the absence of the
project.
54.       Without the proposed project, it would be necessary to route all
Seoul container traffic via Incheon. Other container traffic together with
break bulk and bulk cargo (about 80% of total port traffic) would continue
to move through Busan. Such a rerouting of all Seoul containers would
require some additional investment at Incheon and would inevitably lead to
ship waiting time at the entrance to the port due to delays in passage
through the locks. The calculation of project benefits does not include
allowance for either of these factors. Even if the shipping companies
elected to ship all Seoul containers through Incheon, severe congestion
would still develop in Busan without the project. Berth occupancy would
increase steadily to 85% in 1982 and, by 1985, the port would be saturated.
Ship waiting time would increase correspondingly and, by 1985, would reach
about 2,800 ship days a year. The economic costs of the waiting time of
Korean ships (excluding, that is, the cost relating to foreign ships) are
estimated to increase from $1.3 million in 1981 to $9.7 million in 1985.
55.       If Seoul container traffic were directed through Incheon rather than
Busan, the cost of ocean freight plus road transport between Incheon and
Seoul would be about $12 per container more than the cost of ocean freight
to or from Busan, plus road transport between Busan and Seoul. The extra
cost would amount to about $1.8 million in 1981 rising to $2.3 million in
1985. These figures are based on the relatively high volume of 400 containers
in and out per vessel, and would increase if fewer containers per vessel are
handled. The proposed container freight station at Busan would reduce the
number of containers which would have to be transported to and from container
yards outside the port from 70% of the total, following completion of the
First Port Project, to 40%. This saving of transportation and double handling
costs is estimated at $48 per container, or about $4 million in 1981.



- 15 -
56.       The foregoing benefits yield an economic return of 17% on the
proposed project. The first year return at 8% is low but considered adequate
having regard to the fact that the penalties, in the form of higher ship
waiting time which would be incurred if Busan port traffic has been under-
estimated, are substantially greater than the penalties in the form of
surplus port capacity, which would be incurred if port traffic has been
overestimated. Delay in implementing the project could have very serious
consequences for the Korean economy.
57.       The principal risk in the forecast relates to the volume of con-
tainerized cargo, since the past very rapid growth is an uncertain guide
to future traffic trends. If the proportion of containerized general cargo
is less than forecast, the need for additional break bulk berths will arise
earlier than projected, as will the need for an alternative site to the
present port for future expansion. A higher forecast of container traffic
would have no effect on the scope of the project which, as already noted, is
the maximum size which could be constructed in the port of Busan. In the
unlikely event that the proportion of traffic which is containerized has been
overestimated, the benefits mentioned above would be reduced. However, this
would be partially offset by a reduction in ship waiting time. The higher
proportion of break bulk cargo that would be handled in lieu of containers
would reduce average cargo-handling productivity and, thus, increase port
congestion. The net effect on project benefits would be a maximum reduction
of 15%, resulting in a rate of return of 14% which is still satisfactory.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The Loan Agree-
ment conforms to the usual pattern of agreements relating to port projects.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex IV of
this report.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMEINDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION _I
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795     Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; US$33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283    and US$15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
The project,. located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. Works are expected to be completed in mid-1978, about
18 months behind schedule. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams and l4ter when rapid inflation outpaced the alloca-
tion of local funds. The dams have now been completed and good progress is
being made on other works. The project cost is estimated at about US$151 mil-
lion compared to US$88.6 million at appraisal, but because of increases in
rice and barley prices, the economic rate of return of 14% is close to the
appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 942      Seeds Project; US$7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date: December
31, 1978
The project consists of: (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm machinery for seed produc-
tion; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation of
a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irriga-
tion and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary
legislative and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and estab-
lishing an "Office for Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Preliminary esti-
mates suggest that project costs would be considerably higher than envis-
aged at appraisal. Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected at
appraisal but is expected to improve soon.
Loan No. 994     Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project;
US$13.0 Million Loan of June 7, 1974; Effective Date:
March 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project provides long-term funds to the Agriculture and
Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC) for onlending to subborrowers in the
private sector for the purpose of integrating onfarm production of fruits and

vegetables with modern hygienic processing facilities, using land that is
presently idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved are
mainly asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry and
peach. The Project is to be implemented over a four-year period, and AFDC
lending of project funds to subborrowers is being channelled through the
National Agriculture Cooperative Federation. The project became effective in
March 1975 at a time when Korea's export markets were adversely affected by
the worldwide economic recession. With the global economic upturn in 1976
and the consequent improvement in foreign demand for Korea's processed food,
investor demand for modernization and expansion of agricultural processing
facilities improved. Thus, significant progress in project implementation
has been achieved since November 1975. Project lending for processing facil-
ities, mushroom growing houses, and asparagus cultivation was initiated in
recent months, and loan demand is expected to pick up momentum in the coming
year. Onfarm development of oak mushrooms, which has been implemented on
schedule since the outset of the project, continues to progress satisfac-
torily.   However, in view of the absence of lending in 1975 for processing
facilities, which accounts for nearly 70% of total project costs, implemen-
tation of the project as a whole will be further delayed.
Loan No. 1193    Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
US$15.0 Million Loan of June 4. 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of: (a) the establishment of about 450
new dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of
the First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the
expansion of existing processing plants, the diversification of cheir
production, the establishment of two milk collection centers and fifty small
milk cooling units and the construction of a frozen milk products plant at
Yeongnam; and (d) the expansion of technical services for both farm develop-
ment and milk processing.
Loan No. 1216    Rural Infrastructure Project; US$60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T   US$40.0 Million Third Window; Effective Date: June 4, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project includes about 62 minor irrigation, 29 upland reclama-
tion, 11,000 fuelwood, 900 roads and bridges, 4,200 water supply, and 2,700
rural electrification subprojects. Technical assistance is provided for
upland reclamation and improvements to hydrologic services. Special evalua-
tion studies are also included. Project implementation is on schedule,
costs and disbursements are all close to appraisal estimates. The monitoring
and reporting systems have also been established and are functioning well.
Disbursements are at present over 40% of the total loan.
Loan No. 1319     Miho Watershed Area Development Project; US$29.0 Million
Loan of July 17, 1976; Effective Date: October 21, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The aim of the project is to increase agricultural production and
farm incomes on about 12,665 ha, and to benefit directly some 10,400 farm

families. The project consists of: (a) the construction of dams and canals
to irrigate 8,315 ha; (b) the conversion of 2,045 ha of cultivated upland to
irrigate paddy fields; (c) land consolidation on 4,600 ha of irrigated and
non-irrigated land; (d) the development of 495 ha for irrigation of upland
crops and 550 ha for orchards; (e) upland reclamation and bench-terracing of
1,200 ha of presently uncultivated land; (f) the improvement of about 80 km
of river channels; (g) the construction of about 150 km of village access
roads; (h) aerial photography, surveys and mapping; and (i) provision for
technical assistance, procurement of vehicles and a feasibility study for
a second-stage project of the Miho Watershed.
Loan No. 1328     Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$20.0 Million Loan
of September 21, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project provides medium- and long-term loans through the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) to about 7,900 farmers for (a) the
establishment of about 2,100 ha of apple orchards; (b) the construction and
equipping of improved silkworm rearing houses including improvement of exist-
ing mulberry plantings; (c) sprinkler irrigation to producing orchards of 2 ha
or more; (d) the construction and equipping of greenhouses for vegetable
production; and (e) the construction of on-farm fruit storage facilities.
Loan No. 1364     Yong San Gang Irrigation Project Stage II,/I US$95.0 Million
Loan of January 25, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The principal features of the project are: (a) construction of an
estuary dam across the mouth of the Yong San Gang, consisting of a 4,500 m
long embankment, a 240 m wide concrete sluice and a navigation lock; (b) con-
struction of a 4,000 m long sea dike; (c) construction of 16 pumping stations
to serve a total area of 20,700 ha, including the land to be reclaimed and
developed; (d) construction of about 315 km of main and secondary canals to
serve an area of about 15,200 ha; (e) reclamation of about 5,500 ha of tidal
land through land leveling and construction of canals, drains and farm roads;
(f) land development comprising land consolidation on 3,200 ha of existing
paddy, conversion of 3,250 ha of upland to irrigated paddy, development of
1,050 ha of upland for irrigation, and tertiary canals and drains on 4,400 ha
of existing paddy land; (g) construction in the project area of office build-
ings, warehouses, access roads and temporary pier required for the construc-
tion of the estuary dam; and (h) provision of the services of consultants to
assist in project implementation and preparation of feasibility studies
for future development stages of the Yong San Gang Basin.
Industrial Sector
Loan No. 905      Fourth KDFC Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of June 13,

Loan No. 1095     Korea Development Bank Project; US$60.0 Million Loan
of March 31, 1975; Effective Date: June 17. 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project provided funds to KDB to make subloans to finance direct
imports for subprojects principally in the manufacturing and transportation
sectors. Almost the full amount has already been committed to finance 31 sub-
projects, ahead of the time estimated at appraisal. Disbursements now amount
to over 75% of the loan amount, also ahead of the original estimate. KDB's
performance in using the loan has been highly satisfactory.
Loan No. 1145     Fifth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
US$55.0 Million Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective Date:
September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The loan covers about half the KDFC's foreign exchange
requirements through the end of 1977. The proceeds are used to finance
direct imports of machinery and equipment, and the foreign exchange component
of domestically produced capital goods and of civil works. About 75% of the
loan proceeds have already been disbursed.
Loan No. 1175    Medium Industry Bank (MIB); US$30.0 Million Loan of
November 26, 1975; Effective Date: January 28, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The project provides funds to MIB to make sub-loans to small
and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises over the next two years. The
Project is progressing satisfactorily. Disbursements are at present over
50% of the total loan.
Loan No. 1338     Second Korea Development Bank Project US$82.5 Million
Loan of which US$7.5 Million for the Korea Industrial
Leasing Company; of November 16, 1976; Effective Date:
March 23. 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project provides $75.0 million to be used by KDB to make
subloans and investments to finance direct imports for industrial subprojects
during the period 1977-78, the remainder of the loan, $7.5 million, would be
relent by KDB to its wholly-owned subsidiary KILC, which would use these
funds to acquire machinery, equipment, facilities and other property to be
leased to investment enterprises, during the same period, for use in its
leasing operations.

Education Sector
Loan No. 906      Second Education Project; US$23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394   US$20.0 million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides equipment for and extensions to 85 educa-
tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education.
The project execution is now about 12 months behind schedule. The principal
cause of delay has been slow equipment procurement owing to staff shortages
in the Office of Supply (OSROK). The Government is taking steps to overcome
the source of delay. All equipment lists have been approved; tenders have
been made for US$28 million, contracts have been awarded for US$11 million.
Total project cost remains at $75.8 million, about 8% above the appraisal
estimates. Disbursements are expected to reach US$20 million by the end of
FY77. Covenant requirements under the Development Credit Agreement are
largely met. The project is now expected to be completed by mid-1978, which
requires an extension of the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1096     Third Education Project; US$22.5 Million Loan of March 31,
1975; Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes under the Office
of Labor Affairs (OLA). After 15 months of execution, project implementation
is about 3 months behind schedule but considerable progress has been made.
Site layouts and sketch plans have been approved for 11 institutions and one
is already under construction. All sites have been acquired. Remaining
sketch plans have been prepared and construction will begin at ten institutions
in 1977. Progress in equipment procurement is satisfactory. No cost overrun
is anticipated at this time. The chief problem, about which the Bank has
requested Government action, is temporary lack of counterpart funds which may
delay project implementation. Both MOE and OLA project units are functioning
satisfactorily. Disbursements are expected to be made on schedule.
Tourism Sector
Loan No. 953     Kyongju Tourism Project; US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 4, 1974; Effective Date: May 6, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project forms part of the first phase of the planned development
of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose dam;
an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of the
water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city of
Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and telecom-
munication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or realign-
ment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure including storm water drainage,
environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course; a school
for training hotel personnel; and a feasibility study for the development of



ANNEX II
Page 8
tourism on Cheju Island. Final design for almost all project components is
complete and several contracts have been awarded. Execution of the works,
however, is progressing slower than originally scheduled mainly due to a
rather slow start, and delay in water exploration. It appears likely, there-
fore, that project completion will have to be extended by one year to the end
of 1978. Considerable efforts are being made by the newly established Kyongju
Tourism Agency to promote hotel investors' interest and an agreement with a
major international hotel company for construction of the first hotel is now
in the final stage of negotiations. About 30% of the loan has been disbursed
and disbursements are expected to accelerate in the months ahead.
Regional Development
Loan No. 1070    Secondary Cities Regional Project; US$15.0 Million
Loan of January 15, 1975; Effective Date:   August 18,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Construction on seven, out of nine subprojects, is
progressing on schedule. A contract for the eighth subproject will be awarded
shortly. Three housing sites, a city market and two access roads will be
completed by mid-1977. Consultants appointed to provide Technical Assistance
to Gwangju Regional Development Unit have started work. The project is
nearly a year behind appraisal schedule, mainly due to delays in fulfilling
conditions of effectiveness and establishing the Gwangju Regional Development
Unit. Total project costs are in line with the appraisal estimate of
$25.0 million.
Transportation Sector
Loan No. 769     First Highway Project; US$54.5 Million Loan of June 29,
1971; Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The construction of approximately 370 km of national highways
between Jeonju and Busan was satisfactorily completed in December 1973,
at a final cost of about 5% above the appraisal estimate. Feasibility
studies and detailed engineering have been completed for 1,400 km and 900 km
of national highways, respectively. A study of road maintenance and the
establishment of a pilot maintenance organization formed the basis of the
creation of a country-wide Highway Maintenance Organization which is being
carried out under the Second Highway Project. The Closing Date has been
extended by two years to permit completion of procurement of l; ghway mainte-
nance equipment, and staff training.
Loan No. 863      Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
November 22, 1972; Effective Date: February 26, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The main elements of the project are: electrificat-ion of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 km of line running 're- Seoul to

the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision of yard
facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improvement of
facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and rolling stock.
No major problems have been encountered; most of the loan proceeds have been
committed, and over 95% already disbursed. The Closing Date has been extended
by a year to December 31, 1977 to allow time for the completion of procurement.
Loan No. 917     Ports Project; US$80.0 Million Loan of June 27, 1973;
Effective Date: September 18, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Six civil works contracts and three equipment supply contracts
are already let and work is proceeding satisfactorily except at Mukho which
is slightly behind schedule. A contract has also been let for the grain
handling facility but no work has started. Three civil works and one equip-
ment contract are out for bids. This will complete all contracting require-
ments for the project. Overall the project is about 50% completed and at
this stage only the grain handling facility appears likely to be delayed
(about six months) beyond the May 1978 target date for completion. Total
cost is currently estimated to be US$160 million with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$107 million. The Loan provides US$80 million foreign exchange
and the overrun is being financed by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD).
The Korea Maritime and. Port Authority (KMPA) is being adequately staffed, but
there has been a delay in adopting operational and financial procedures
recommended by consultants appointed to advise KMPA on these matters.
Loan No. 956     Second Highway Project; US$47.0 Million Loan of January 25,
1974; Effective Date: April 4, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The works, consisting of construction, chiefly on new alignments,
of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of a
further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the high-
ways opened to traffic in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equivalent,
exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future projects
of about 1,000 km of roads were started in August 1975, followed by detailed
engineering which is expected to be completed in mid-1977. Delay occurred
in setting up a new nationwide highway maintenance organization but the
organization has now been established in accordance with decrees published
in June 1975. All the maintenance offices have been constructed and staffed
and equipment procured under the Loan. The Government has been requested to
increase the budgetary allocation to enable an adequate program of periodic
maintenance to be carried out. By the end of February 1977, disbursements
were above 97%.
Loan No. 1101    Fifth Railway Project; US$100.0 Million Loan of April 10,

December 31, 1978
The project will help the Korean National Railroad (KNR) continue
as a major carrier of freight and passengers by helping in: the upgrading,
modernization and expansion of track, rolling stock, motive power, and other

equipment; the improvement of the efficiency of operation; and the strengthen-
ing of its financial position. The main components of the Project are: an
increase in station and line capacity and improvements in signalling; acquisi-
tion of rolling stock, diesel and electric locomotives, spare parts and repair
facilities; track renewal and improvement; bridge strengthening; completion
of electrification of 71 km of industrial lines; and other miscellaneous
items. Contracts, financed by the loan, have been signed for procurement of
passenger and freight cars, wheel sets, spares for locomotives, rail, bridge
girders and track maintenance machinery, amounting to about US$75 million
equivalent. About 60% of the loan proceeds have already been disbursed. In
connection with this loan, the Government undertook to formulate a financial
recovery plan for KNR and to discuss it with the Bank. A mission which
visited Korea in October 1976 discussed this matter with the authorities
concerned.
Loan No. 1203    Third Highway Project; US$90.0 Million Loan of
February 3, 1976; Effective Date:   May 17, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The loan provides funds to help finance: (a) the construction,
chiefly on new alignments, including paving, of about 195 km of four national
highways, including supervision of the work by consultants; (b) paving and
improvement chiefly on present alignments, of nine national highways totalling
about 600 km, including supervision of the work by consultants; and (c) feasi-
bility studies by consultants of about 1,200 km of national and provincial
roads, to be followed by detailed engineering. Contracts for construction and
paving have been awarded and work is progressing on schedule. The Government
is currently drafting the terms of reference for feasibility studies.
