Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The project's primary objective is the construction of a commercially self-sustaining urban wholesale market for the greater Gdansk
area, complete with attendant physical infrastructure.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                                      Category   Cost Inl    %of
Conting.   Toa
(US mill.)
Development of Market Facilities and Site Infrastructure consisting of heavy earth moving,  physical  20.15  87%
construction of on-site roads, creation of parking lots for heavy and light vehicles, the
construction of off-site roads to the main highway and on-site infrastructure for sewage
treatment and public utility connections; civil works, including the construction of main
buildings for fruit, vegetable and provisions trading, two flower halls, covered trading bays,
offices, ancillary buildings and perimeter fencing; pre-start up expenses, working capital,
interest and other fees during construction.
Public Utilities and Services Infrastructure consisting of the laying of sewage piping to the   physical  2.90  13%
complex and connections to water, gas, and electricity utilities and to the local telephone
network. Access to an adjacent highway will also be completed. The development of much of
this service infrastructure in the vicinity of the site has been previously planned and does not
represent an incremental project cost. Voivod and municipality have entered into written
agreements with the wholesale market company for their respective responsibilities in this
regard.
Total       23.05      100
3. Benefits and target population:
The main economic benefits of the proposed wholesale market will include cost savings in search, bargaining and transportation;
improved quality produce and choice; reduction of product waste and the risk of adverse selection; improved market transparency and
trader competition; and the development of complementary services to traders and clients that will contribute to regional employment
and economic growth
The primary beneficiaries will be a large proportion of the 1.5 million consumers of the Gdansk-Gdynia-Sopot metropolitan area, who
will benefit from improved retail services that would be facilitated through the operation of the market, and local producers within an
area of 50-150 km of Gdansk , who will gain access to a much improved infrastructure for the disposal of farm surpluses.
Additionally, the proposed market will serve as a point of aggregation and distribution for exports to Scandinavia and Russia,
providing services to producers and traders from other regions of the country.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: five years (FY 98 -2002)
Executing agencies: The project would be executed by the Gdansk wholesale market company, whose corporate name is the
Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze S.A. (PHCRS), a company incorporated in Poland as a joint stock company in 1995.
It has competent management, demonstrated by its success in bringing the venture to the point of having a planning permit, over PLN
18 million of equity and several hundred private shareholders. Its board of directors, representing shareholders, takes an active part in
the formulation of company policy and in supervising operations. PHCRS will be responsible for the implementation of the
construction project with the assistance of civil engineering consultants. The company will work in close collaboration with the
public works department of the city of Gdansk, responsible for linking water and sewer services to the proposed construction, while
the city's environment department will oversee the pollution mitigation measures that have been included in design and construction.
Project coordination and oversight: The department of wholesale markets and commodity exchanges of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Economy (MAFE):
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The company will produce a standard annual report with accounts
audited by an independent certified public accountant.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The construction will be done under one turn-key contract with periodic progress
payments as contractually agreed, and based upon monitorable progress of physical works. Construction will be supervised by a
construction management company under contract to PHCRS.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project  [Document number and date of latest CAS report No. 16484-POL; April 14, 1997]
The proposed project would complement the Bank's role in Poland, as outlined in the existing CAS, by (i) sustaining private sector
growth, and (ii) managing the transformation of the state in support of the market economy. The first objective will be supported by
fostering private sector participation, and catalyzing private sector financing, in this key segment of the marketing infrastructure, inter
alia a core part of the strategy for successful EU integration. The second objective will be supported directly by the actual creation of
a new market institution that aids in boosting the competitiveness of the agriculture sector by reducing marketing costs and increasing
market transparency. An additional, in the context of contemporary Poland important, contribution is the creation of an estimated
2,000 new places of employment. Moreover, the proposed project will foster the devolution of development responsibilities to local
government, through its involvement in providing services infrastructure to the site.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The process of restructuring the Polish economy resulted in the breaking up of cooperative marketing structures and in a consequent
dispersal of trade transactions. The sector is now characterized by a lack of organization of producers, merchants and consumers.
There are few mechanisms for improving product and packaging quality, and the current state of organization of trade, of which the
urban wholesale markets are the focal point, does not favor market transparency. Some wholesalers have set up activities on the
periphery of large cities. The present conditions of these sites and their associated infrastructure is poor in both its technical aspects
and in the lack of institutional services. The proposed project directly addresses these technical and institutional issues in supporting
the construction of a modem, efficiently operating market and the creation of entry points to the wholesale marketing system for
producers, along with commercially viable services facilitating market entry.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Since 1990, the Bank has had a number of operations in the agriculture and forestry sectors in Poland, including an ASAL of $300
million, two agricultural credit projects of $100 million each and a forestry project of $146 million. Based on this involvement with
Polish agriculture and its institutions over the last six years, particularly in the context of the ASAL, the Bank has substantial in-depth
knowledge of the sector and of the environment in which marketing occurs. A sector-wide study that preceded the formulation of the
ASAL had identified early the need to establish and encourage market exchange facilities at the producer/ primary wholesaler and
processor levels, recognizing that such activities would require some public investment at state and local government levels, but
would also need to become self-financing.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection; Expansion and modernization of two existing primitive market
facilities has been rejected for lack of space and for being inappropriately located. The proposed site has been selected from several
alternatives for its superior location on the ring road surrounding the three city agglomeration of Gdansk, Gdynia and Sopot.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies. The Poznan wholesale market was
established in 1992 with monetary and technical assistance from a Swiss development related organization. It has exceeded
expectations with respect to volume and variety of throughput.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design: From an economic standpoint the Poznan wholesale market has been a
successfull venture since it has significantly contributed to reduction in the search and distribution costs of food stuff, particularly
produce, in its geographical area while simultaneously allowing more transparency of the market pricing for the producer. A major
problem has been that due to ownership structure and tenancy agreements, the market has been unable to adjust its fee and rental
schedule in step with inflation, creating a risk of fnancial failure in the long run.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership: The proposed borrower, the Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-
Spozywcze S.A., and its shareholders, have demonstrated their commitment by securing and contributing required equity financing
for the investment, by cooperation with Bank staff in the processing of the project and by securing pertinent notarized permits, land
deed documentation and other required official papers with the local government. Local government has demonstrated its
commitment to the project by appropriating funds for the construction of linking services infrastructure to the site of the proposed
market. The state, moreover, will provide a sovereign guarantee for the Bank's credit fnancing of construction.
12. Value added of Bank support: Institutionally, the Bank's involvement in the proposed project would lend considerable
credibility to the formation of a business partnership between public entity shareholders and private sector investors -- a business
venture whose potential risks the weakly developed capital market in Poland would have otherwise not been willing to accept. The
Bank's involvement would promote small shareholding, which would help shift the incidence of investment risk in ways that would
enable local capital markets to respond more flexibly to the financing requirements of privatization and private sector economic
growth.



Wholesale Markets Project 1                                                                                           4
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project files.)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4):
Cost-Benefit Analysis: ERR= 19%
(Represents most likely lower bound for expected market performance.)
The proposed project would introduce a number of benefits which are not            Sonstvity Analysis of Base ERR
easily quantifiable. Among them are reductions in search, transaction and
transport costs, reductions in product waste, imnprovements in product
choice and quality, improved  reliability of supplies to retailers and    35aI
consumers, improved market transparency and more competitive trader       3
participation. The cost-benefit analysis of the project establishes a lower   25%035%
bound for the projecfs economic rate of return by estimating the reduction  20%   c20%.30%
in current search and collection costs that can be achieved with the  l        X20%                            020%.25%
operation of the market. The analysis indicates that with relatively modest   l     10%  -        l Changi,n. 13B    0150.20%
expectations of market throughput and savings, the reduction in search and  |    _nvlnnt   1°%-5%1
collection costs alone can justify the project.  Even if total investment   2 °%        r            c 20%-1°%
costs were to exceed base estimates by 20 % and realized search cost         -         20% ".°%5%
savings were 20% less than expected, the continued justification of the  Change in Base
project would not depend on other unquantified benefits of improved
market efficiency being very large (although these benefits can and are  |
expected to be significant).
The base ERR falls to about 8% when benefits are 20% lower
and investment costs 20% higher than expected.
Fiscal Impact:
The project, as a viable commercial activity, is expected to generate annual corporate tax revenues exceeding zl 2.5 million in 1996
constant terms. A portion of these revenues will be remitted to the municipal government. Additional fiscal income will derive from
VAT assessments of trader transactions. Public funds for the development of the services infrastructure have been appropriated and
will not otherwise distress local government finances. The local government will recover the cost of these works through the assessment
of user fees for electricity, water and sewerage upon the proposed market and upon other nearby, on-going development that will share
the infrastructure to be installed.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5): FRR = 13.6% real return on total capital; greater than 100% real return on equity
The results of modeling of the expected financial performance of the Gdansk wholesale market company are displayed in the cash
flows, income statements, balance sheets and tables of financial ratios available in the project file, a summary of which is in Annex 5.
In general, the returns to the company are quite strong under a variety of financing arrangements. The total cost of the investment is
estimated at about US$23.0 million (PLN 89.4 in current zloty over three years, PLN 81.2 million at the ZIIUS$ exchange rate
prevailing at the time of negotiations), including prestart costs incurred before 1998. The financing plan assumed for this document is
one where the Bank provides financing of US$ 15.9 million as a long-term loan, representing about 69 percent of total costs. Local
sources provide the remaining financing, including US$ 4.2 million of shareholder equity (constituting 18 percent of the fnancing
required) and Voivod and municipality a combined US$2.9 million (about 13% of total investment costs). Of the total equity amount,
approximately PLN 6 million (about US$ 1.8 million) was raised prior to 1998 in cash and the value of land as equity contribution in
kind.
Annual gross profit margin is estimated at 78 percent. The discounted nominal return to equity is estimated at almost 128% percent,
which compares with 22-23 percent on savings deposits. The return on assets is expected to range between 20-23% over the loan
repayment period. Debt service coverage for the company is expected never to fall below 1.3 following the start of the loan repayment
(year 2003) and should rise above 1.5 soon after. In consequence, cumulative debt service coverage is expected to grow rapidly,
cushioning the effects of a significant real depreciation of the zloty, should one occur in the course of the repayment of the Bank loan. In
the medium  term, the company should manage to pay a respectable dividend and be in a good position to re-invest in further site
development within 8 -10 years.
15. Technical Assessment:
The detailed design of the market draws from the technical features of comparable European facilities and incorporates modern features
that anticipate compliance with EU regulations in advance of Poland's accession. Practically, planning for the project has also benefited
from the operational experiences of a similar wholesale market that opened in 1992 in the city of Poznan. The design complies with

pertinent requirements of Poland's Enviromnentai Law, the Law on Sanitary Inspection and the Law on Fire Protection. Technically, the
present design for the market is sound and will provide flexibility for the addition of future structural enhancements and market services.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies:
Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze S.A.: The president of the company has been a broker on the wholesale market in Berlin
for seven years in the '80s and is the initiator and promoter of the venture. The vice president has a distinguished career in several large
Polish companies with international operations and represented the interests of Polish food processors in the former Soviet Union.
During project preparation company management has shown the abilities and managerial talents that give confidence in their abilities to
exercise the considerable responsibilities entailed in construction and operation.
b. Project management:
The project will be managed by the executing agencies described and summnarily evaluated above.
17. Social Assessment: Not Applicable
18. Environmental Assessment:   Environmental Category                 0    A         Q  B         D  C
The project poses potential problems of traffic congestion and disposal of sewage and may have esthetic consequences for nearby
residential developments. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been made and is in the project files. Mitigation measures
recommended in the EIA have been included in the projecfs costs. In summary, these are: the municipality's commitment to move
forward previously planned construction of an interchange at the site and other road works, mitigating potential traffic congestion; the
development of on-site water treatment and the installation of a sewage system connecting into the system managed by the municipality;
and suitable landscaping. There are no resettlement problems. Nobody lives on the site, which PHCRS owns outright.

[Note: Information Sharing (IS); CONsultation (CON); and COLlaboration(COL).]
20. Sustainability: The project as a private business venture is likely to be sustainable in the medium term because of strong
commercial incentives for providing modem wholesale market facilities.The long-run sustainability of the market company will depend
upon the evolving nature of the agricultural marketing environment and its ability to position itself strategically in anticipation of events
affecting its operations, such as an expansion of Western European supermarket chains into Poland. The private and experienced
management of the company are the best guarantee that the market will sustain itself, indeed flourish, in a potentially turbulent
environment.

Objections from neighbors because of (i) expected heavy traffic of construction related vehicles through the neighborhood and, (ii)
potential nuisance of an operating wholesale market. The first point is addressed by construction of the site's access to the adjacent
highway prior to the start of construction proper, obviating the need for construction related vehicles to pass through the neighboring
suburb. Potential market nuisance has been addressed in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) and proposed mitigation measures
are included in project design.

Wholesale Markets Project I
Detailed Project Description
Development of Market Facilities and Site Infrastructure (DEM 35.4 million equivalent)
This would be the project's main component. It consists of:
2
*  Building a Fruit and Vegetable Hall of 10,000 M2 designed on the basis of a seller's stall of approximately 50 m2, anranged as
lockable units 7.5 meters deep by 6 meters wide (45m) with an allowable extension into the buyers' walkways of 2 meters,
providing an overall trading area of 57m2. The hall will have three main buyers' walks consisting of three structural bays at 24
meters, and will have a clear height of 6 meters. There will be exits at each end of the buyer's walkways, with lobbies separated from
the main hall by plastic doors to reduce energy requirements for heating/cooling. Extemnally, alongside the walls of the building, a
buyers' walkway will be marked on the road surface to prevent parking under the roof overhang.
*  Construction of a provisions Hall with the same dimensions and specifications as the fruit and vegetable hall since quantity and space
requirements of the traded goods is estimated to be similar. The trading units and their arrangement in the provisions hall will be be
the same as in the fruit and vegetable hall.
*  Building a flower hall of 5,000 m2 divided into two sections, one selling fresh flowers and one selling dried flowers and other flower
related products. The fresh flower hall willbe fully air conditioned with fixed metal grill stalls around the perimeter of 4.0 x 7.5
meters (30m2), and smaller open stalls in the center, each 4.0 x 5.5 meters (22m2), with dividing lines painted on the ground. Two
chilled rooms will be available for the storage of unsold goods. The dried flower hall will be equipped with metal framed units of 5
meters wide by 6 meters deep (30m2), arranged to form a circular walk around the space.
*  Construction of an office building of 2,000 m2 for use by the PHCRS administration, maintenance and security staff. The building's
ground floor accommodation will have direct access from outside for a bank, money exchange and post office. Customs and Excise
will be provided with a control office adjacent to the weighbridge, but additional administration facilities will be required. These
could be on the upper floor of the office building, as can the Hygiene Department and the Standardization Inspectorate.
*  Construction of ancillary buildings composed of (i) a canopy covering the road, (ii ) a toll booth with a two lane arrival equipped
with automatic barriers and manual facilities (iii ) an office located in the center of the road, where any necessary entrance fees will
be collected and departure checks can be carried out and (iv) a weighbridge with an inspection pit and customs control point.
*  Groundwork and infrastructure including all heavy earth moving, installation of on site water, sewage, electricity, gas and
telecommunications as well as construction of on-site roads, creation of parking lots for heavy and light vehicles as well as the
construction of the road to the main highway and fencing around the premises.
* Pre-startup expenses, working capital (both non-Bank-financed), fees and charges during construction (partially financed out of the
Bank loan).
Public Utilities and Services Infrastructure (DEM 5.1 million equivalent)
In support of the main component, the project will also undertake the following:
* Establishment of Surface Water Drainage system of which the responsibility for funding rests with the public utilities operator,
"Melioracje Gdanskie". Preliminary studies suggest that the entire site can be drained into the Prochowy stream to the south east,
and infrastructure requirements to be provided by the wholesale company will include new 1000 mm diameter pipework to the
existing culvert under the main dual carriageway, a distance of 500 meters, and cleaning out of this culvert. It will be necessary to
treat surface water where it has in any way been contaminated, and this wil require a treatment plant within the site boundary. This
will include run-offs from the hard surfaces where vehicle spillages may arise. It is estimated that there will be a total of 2,800 meters
of drainage pipework within the site, making a total of 3,300 meters altogether.
*  Installation of a pipeline with the possibility to connect into the existing sewage system to the east of the site. This will be the Osowa
to Oliwa drain. To achieve this it will be necessary to provide new 200 mm pipework for a distance of approximately 850 meters
beyond the site, and internal main pipework amounting to 1,810 meters, making a total of 2,660 meters of sewage pipework. The
cost for this will be the responsibility of the Wholesale Market Company.

*  Connection to drinking water system via new 150 mm and 200 mm diameter pipes connecting to two separate existing supplies to the
north-west and west of the site on the Osowa intake system. Costs of this new pipework will have to be borne by the Wholesale
Market Company. Ultimately a new 500 mm diameter ring main will be constructed by the water authority, and this will be linked
into the new site pipework by the authority when it will be completed.
* Connection of the wholesale market to a medium pressure gas supply line, 150 mm in diameter, already in place to the south of the
site. This supply also serves the new residential areas nearby, and will be adequate for the needs of the market. It is estimated that a
total of 810 meters of site distribution pipework will be required.
*  Interface with the public electricity network. The electricity operator has advised that it can provide 1,500kW of power fed from a
new 15kV sub station to be located on the site, drawing its supply by high voltage cable from an existing sub station to the west.
Additionally, smaller distribution sub stations will need to be provided throughout the site.
*  Interfacing with the public telecommunications network requiring a new exchange, dedicated to the center. An estimate has been
provided for a fully automated system providing 1000 numbers and including full distribution cabling network to each stall holder
throughout the site. The cost for this system is to be assumed completely by the Wholesale Market Company.

ERR (%):                                          18.8
Principal economic benefits include:
-- a reduction in the costs, incurred by retailers and fmal consumers, for searching and procuring supplies;
-- a reduction in the administrative costs of existing small wholesalers who will consolidate operations at the market;
- a reduction in consumer prices or improvement of value of expenditure through an expansion of consumer choice and/or improvements
in the quality of selection;
= an improvement in farmer incomes through production geared to higher quality and trading opportunities; and
-= income multiplier effects through an induced expansion of agricultural services for value-added production and trade.
Of these benefits, available data most easily permit an estimation of the first. The magnitude of other potential benefits are less readily
determined without further detailed surveys, prior and subsequent to the development of the market, but an attempt is made to bracket
their possible ranges in identifying key parameters on which they depend. The reduction of the transaction costs incurred by purchasers
(mainly retailers) searching for supplies is an adequate measure of the projecfs economic attractiveness.
Main assumptions are:
Reduced transaction costs and more regular supplies of cost-effective ranges of goods to retailers are translated into producer and
consumer surpluses.
A reduction in retailers' search and collection costs of zl 80-90 per ton of produce (zl 85 per ton is considered the most likely value).
Initially affected consumption, measured as market throughput, lies between 190,500 and 317,500 tons (equivalent to a market
throughput of 15-25 tm2 -- the most likely value corresponds to a base throughput of 20 tlm2).
The effects of rising incomes on consumer demand and market throughput are nil over time.
The price elasticity of demand for fruit and vegetables is -0.51.
Improvements in the reliability, range and quality of produce through the market will stimulate an expansion of retail trade (for the
analysis this expansion is restricted to a level that would just compensate for the reduction in revenue that retailers would realize in
passing on the benefits of the search and collection costs to consumers -- due to the inelasticity of demand for market produce).
An opportunity cost of land of zl 450,000/ha (US$135,000/ha) -- this value represents current expectations of the speculative ground rents
that would be received from areas on the site owned but not developed by the wholesale market company.
The standard conversion factor (SCF) is 0.9.
A period of analysis of 25 years.
The opportunity cost of capital (OCC) is 12%.
Switching values of critical items:
Investment costs: an increase of 28 percent over base estimates.
Annual operating costs: an increase of 37 percent over base estimates.
Initial market throughput: 16.6 / m2.
Search and collection savings: zl 731t.
Total annual benefits: a decrease of 17 percent below base estimates.
tThe financial analysis of the project concerns the performance and profitability of the Gdansk Wholesale Market Company; refer to Annex 5 for items from the
company's projected cash flow statement, income statement, funding statement, balance sheet and financial ratios.
2The project should help create employment opportunities in the region, reducing the need for income support.
3Project costings assume an average tax content of about 15 percent for the costs of construction materials and services. N.B. The Bank finances at a disbursement rate
that excludes taxes.
