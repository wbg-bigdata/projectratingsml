Proposed Wholesale Market in Gdansk
Environmental Impact Assessment
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Description
1.    The project is to build a contemporary wholesale market for perishable foodstuff
and flowers on the outskirts of the 'port city of Gdansk, complete with attendant
infrastructure. The market will replace two existing primitive facilities and will service, in
the first instance, the 1.5 million urban population of the three city agglomeration of
Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia. It will further serve as a source for exports to the East,
particularly to Kaliningrad, Belarus and Ukraine, for both Polish and imported products.
2.    The market will be constructed and operated by a limited liability company
incorporated under Polish corporate law. The expanding shareholdership now counts over
250 individuals, mostly traders and farners, as well as a number of public and private
institutions, including one bank. Both the city of Gdansk and the local Voivod (regional
authority) have committed to the timely construction of supporting infrastructure, notably
the supply of water and the evacuation of waste water, and the construction of access to
the adjacent ring road around the three city agglomeration.
Environmental Review and Assessment
3.    The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) took into account pertinent Bank
rules (OD 4.01), as well as current Polish legislation on the subject, amended last in 1995.
It focused on the following seven main environmental concerns and issues, and reached
the indicated conclusions:
a) Ground and soil characteristics including geologic assessment and current land
j=. The study finds no major environmental problems with the site of the
planned wholesale market since the soil is of low agricultural quality and
geological conditions are acceptable for the proposed structures. Nobody is living
on the site, hence there are no re-settlement questions.
b) Hydrological characteristics including ground and surface waters with particular
attention to streams and wetlands. The proposed location is within the basins of,
resp. a stream and a river. The water table is only a few feet below the surface
over a sizable area along the site's south westem border. Furthermore, there are
several hectares of wetland on the western edge of the site, which before the
construction of the existing highway were partially drained through a third stream.
Because of the relative fragility of the area and the proximity of a watershed, the



2 -
area is within the zone of indirect protection of the Radunia river as specified by
an ordinance the Gdansk Voivod of August, 1993. This decision defines
conditions under which treated sewage can be released; use of agricultural land;
design of emergency spillways, pumping stations and treatment plants; use of
chemicals, precautions to be taken for parking space in terms of hydrocarbon
collection, etc. As a result of the proposed construction, the soil will lose its
ability to soak up and filter water during rain periods and, hence, the flow of water
into rivers and retention basins will increase. Appropriate measures to maintain
the quality of the water must be taken in the form of retention and pre-treatmnent
ponds and ditches. (see the table with the costs of mitigation measures at the end
of this summary, for details)
c) Issues pertaining to landscaping and cultural heritage of the region. The impact of
the change of landscape from open agricultural land to a site with large halls and
parking lots will be significant. However, visual mitigation measures in the form
of tree lines and bushes should help make the general appearance of the site more
appealing. The location of the wholesale market in proximity of a landscape park
and a residential area will require specific mitigation measures minimizing the
impact of the market during construction and operation. (see also point f). There
are no known archaeological interests on the site or in its vicinity.
d) Issues related to air and noise pollution during the construction as well as while
the market is in operation. The increase in traffic due to market construction and
operation will have a significant effect on air quality, particularly under certain
weather conditions. This will be most evident during the period of construction
when not only traffic from and to the site will increase but when also heavy diesel
powered construction equipment will be used and dust producing activities such
as welding, cement mixing, and others will be undertaken. However, these
emissions are expected to remain below legal standards. The noise levels during
construction and after inauguration are expected to rise considerably as compared
with the current situation, first as a result of construction activities and later due to
market related traffic. Some of the noisiest activities must therefore be performed
during day time. Once construction is completed, noise levels should come down
but will not be subdued completely due to increased traffic as well as a result of
the use of cooling and ventilation equipment on the market.
e) Comparison of the existing land use and development plans of the area with that
under the proposed development. Earlier land use plans designated the area for
warehousing and storage associated with the shunting yard for a freight container
terminal from the Polish National Railroads. The proposed wholesale market is in
accordance with the current land use plan established by the city of Gdansk for the
area. However, a coalition of neighbors and other interested parties tabled
opposition against the market construction during the period of discussion of the
revised area development plan in the municipal council of Gdansk. When
ultimately voted upon in the council, the plan was approved with 49 votes in favor



-3 -
and 2 against. Following mandatory procedures, the Voivod's office subsequently
declared the process of planning and approval as followed by the municipality to
be in accordance with prevailing law.
f)  Issues relative to human health and stress due to construction activitv and increase
in traffic once market is in operation. Residents of a neighboring residential area
have expressed concerns about noise and air pollution. resulting from increased
traffic. To mitigate these problems the direct access road from the market site to
the adjacent highway will be constructed prior to the start of on-site activities of
market construction, obviating the need for construction related traffic to pass
through a residential area. Moreover, an earthen dike will be laid along the border
of the market complex facing the residential area. This dike will be planted with
trees and shrubs. Appropriate landscaping on the site and, particularly, on its
periphery will further alleviate stress on the inhabitants of adjacent residential
areas.
g) The potential for birds to endanger air traffic. The proposed market location is
close to the airport of Gdansk. Solid waste generated by the market's operations
might attract birds that, in turn, could come into the flight paths of planes
approaching or leaving the airport. To mitigate this potential danger, the market
will be equipped with closed containers and will operate a waste separation
system. Collected solid waste will be transported to the sanitary landfill of the city
of Gdansk.
Institutional and Regulatory Framework
4.    The market will be constructed under a turn key contract entered into after
Intemational Competitive Bidding by the "Pomeranian Wholesale Agri-Food Center
S.A.". The latter company will be assisted in construction supervision by a specialized
engineering company hired for that purpose. Initiating and completing construction on
the site will be subject to a municipal building permit, itself pre-conditioned by a permit
from the municipal environmental office.
Summary Mitigation Measures
5.    The EIA identified seven specific measures to be incorporated in project design,
and hence in investment, to mitigate the identified potentially detrimental effects on the
environment. The following table lists these measures, their costs as estimated in the EIA
and the costs ultimately budgeted for in the investment estimates:

Environmental Concerns          EIA Cost Estimates  Actually Budgeted Costs
water supply interface                 800,000                 669,240
sanitary sewage discharge               40,000                 686,070
rain water discharge system           4,000,000              3,835,680
landscaping                            300,000                 178,100
solid waste collection & disposal      250,000                 300,000
highway exit construction                                    3,066,680
access road construction                                       712,000
Total Costs                         5,390,000               9,447,770
I [n addition, PLN 304,000 per year have been included in the estimated operating costs of the market
Conclusion
6.     With the recommended mitigation measures, the construction and operation of the
proposed wholesale market does not have environmental consequences that would lead to
a recommendation to abstain from the proposed development. Present legal and
regulatory procedures have been followed by the pertinent local authorities; the proposed
development has received a vote of acceptance in the elected municipal council of
Gdansk, with an overwhelming majority. Obtaining the building permit, and ultimately,
permission to operate the market is contingent upon fulfillment of specific mitigation
measures.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Preface
The present "Environmental Impact Assessment of the Pomorskie Hurtowe
Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze in Gdarhsk" was carried out by PROEKO Ltd. in Warsaw
with the co-operation of Project-Design Office nEKO-KONSULT" in Gdanisk under the
Service Contract concluded with the British Agricultural Development Fund
represented by the British Embassy in Warsaw.
The objective of the Environmental Impact Assessment study of the proposed
investment project was to:
* identify environmental and spatial impacts caused by the construction process
and the operation phase of the wholesale market Centre located along the
Western Circular Road (Obwodowa Zachodnia) in the vicinity of Bamiewice;
* propose solutions for the project design allowing reduction of potential negative
environmental impacts during construction and operation of the facilities.
Basic documents for the preparation of this assessment study are:
* Feasibility studies for the wholesale markets in Gdanisk and Wroclaw. Final
Report: Wholesale Market in Gdarnsk, Halcrow, 1995;
* Prefeasibility studies for implementation of the project ,,Pomorskie Hurtowe
Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze w Gdanisku-Bamiewicach", Consult-Expert Gdarnsk,
1996;
* "General land use management plan of the City of Gdarisk" endorsed by the
Resolution No. LXV/484193 of the 24 June 1993, Spatial Development Planning
Office, Gdansk;
* Draft detailed local land use plan for the Bamiewice - Owczamia district, Spatial
Development Planning Department of the Gdatnsk City Authority, 1996.
The Environmental Impact Assessment of the proposed investment project
represents an element of the decision making procedure connected with the
necessity of obtaining a decision on conditions of building and development of the
site in accordance with the requirements of the Act on Spatial Development.

The study and recommendations therefore will constitute a base to apply to
the local municipal authority for the decision on conditions of building and
development of the site, which will need to be endorsed by the Voievod and sanitary
authorities.
2.2. Subject and objective of assessment
The subject of this study is the environmental impact of the Pomorskie
Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze S.A. in Gdansk located at the Bamiewice -
Owczamia district along the Western Circular Road (Figure 1).

The study is carried out for one location option, because the subject site for
the wholesale Centre has been purchased by the sponsor of the investment project.
The objective of the present assessment study is to:
* confirm the purposefulness of the investment project;
* analyse and assess the impact of the "no action "altemative, i.e. not carrying out
the project;
* identify and assess possible solutions of the project implementation which fulfil
the criteria of rationality;
* identify basic environmental and spatial circumstances for the implementation of
the investment project;
* identify the character, importance and scope of the potential impacts on nature,
land use, landscape and culture heritage connected with the construction and
operation of proposed facilities as well as their influence on the development of
transportation links of this part of the city;
* identify issues requiring further studies;
v determine opportunities for mitigating negative impacts;
 determine opportunities for reduction of potential accidental threats, including
accidental environmental threats;
e propose an environmental protection management system (phased);
* prepare an environmental monitoring plan;
* draw conclusions from the public participation process.
2.3. Scope of assessment
The scope of environmental impact assessment of the proposed investment
project is based on the formal requirements of the Service Contract, based on the
World Bank Operational Directive 4.01. of 3 October 1991, and the prescribed legal
requirements mentioned under item 3 of this report, with particular attention to the
Ordinance of the Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and
Forestry of the 13th May 1995 on Determination of Development Projects Harmful to
the Environment and Human Health and Environmental Impact Assessment Studies
(M.P. 52, item 284).

The scope is also deternined by:
* the character and scale of the investment project;
* the possibility of phasing (technology of construction, operation, structure,
location of   buildings, their size, site development, transportation and
infrastructure links, etc.);
* the circumstances determined by existing and planned land-use pattem in
surrounding of the development activity;
* resources and values of the natural environment in closer and further vicinity of
the project site;
* necessity of enclosure of requirements for cultural values protection;
* requirements for protection of landscape and visual values;
3 necessity of reduction of environmental threat risks resulting from break downs
and accidents;
* necessity of formulating recommendations and conclusions for designing,
construction and operation of the Centre.
2.4. Qualification of the investment project
In accordance with §3 item 8 letter 1" of the Ordinance of the Minister of
Environmental Protection and Forestry of the 13 May 1995 on the determination of
investment projects harmful to the environment and human health and environmental
impact assessment, the proposed investment project of the wholesale market centre
belongs to the category of investments which may aggravate the environment.
The decision on the building and development of the project site can be
issued for the investment project basing on the local land development plan and
requires approval of the Voievod and the State Provincial Sanitary Inspector as
required by Art. 40, par. 4, item 2 of the Act on Spatial Development of July 7th,
1994.
3. FORMAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE EIA STUDY
The Polish system of Environmental Impact Assessment, as amended in
1995, does not fulfil all the requirements of the European Union Directive 85/337
and does not comply with the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01. on

4. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INVESTMENT PROJECT
The investment project presents a response to the requirement for a network
of modem wholesale markets for fruits, vegetables and other food products. The
need to develop such facilities has been confirmed by analyses performed by the
Govemment of Poland, Commission of the EU and the World Bank, reflected in the
report "Agricultural Strategy for Poland".
The following are the objectives of the wholesale Centre:
* supplying the population of the Gdanisk region;
* distribution of products to the remaining parts of Poland;
* distribution of goods to the markets of Baltic countries and to countries of CIS.
The expected benefits are:
* stimulation and improved efficiency of intemational, Polish and local trade
resulting from the creation of a modem set-up of wholesale trade;
? stimulation of regional economy through the development of marketing
infrastructure, creation of new employment opportunities (market and related
sectors), increase of tax incomes;
- lower costs of distribution (increased distribution efficiency, rational use of time
and transportation means);
* lower marginal profits (not costs of products);
* increase of income from food products trade;
* lower losses and decrease in product quality in result of proper storage and
wholesale trade conditions;
* stabilisation of the food market (continuity and regularity of market supplies,
quality standards, marketing information, wider variety of products);
* improvement of trade conditions (efficiency, hygiene, order);
* possibility for acquisition of a wide range of high quality goods in one place;
* increase of turnover (and income) in result of demand concentration;
* increase in purchasing safety.

5.   LOCATION, DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONS
OF THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROJECT
5.1.  The project site
The site of the Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Handlu Rolno-Spozywczego is
located within the Gdansk - Bamiewice district, to the West from the Gdarisk
agglomeration, between the Rebichowo International Airport and the Osowa housing
district (Figure 2).
On the East, the site is neighbouring with the Westem Circular highroad No. 6
and the international road E28, which in future will constitute the commencement of
the planned Highway Al, connecting Gdansk with the gouth of the country. This
road facilitates good transportation with the entire domestic road system, and as
such provides adequate intemational links. It gives also a good connection between
the centres of the Gdancsk, Gdynia and Sopot cities as well as with the harbours of
Gdarisk and Gdynia (which are the furthest eastern ports on the Baltic Sea operating
year round). On the South the Centre's site borders with the railway branch leading
to the Rebichowo Airport.
The site borders on the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park. A landscape park is a
large-spatial form of nature protection. This area is protected due to its natural,
historical and cultural values. Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozywcze S.A. in
Gdahsk will be located in the protection zone of the Tr6jmiejski landscape Park It
should be stressed that the protection zone is not a protected area.
The area of Bamiewice, due to the Draft Local Land Use Plan, is appropriated
to a change of its function. This is a peripherial area of the city of Gdansk, which
borders with the Zukowo commune. In the South it borders with the housing estate
,,Osowa", and in the south-east with Wysockie Lake.
5.2. Investment project characteristics
The site belonging to the Centre is about 56 hectares in size. The project area
is divided into three parts:
A    40.19 hectares   where the office building, flower hall, vegetable and fruit
hall,           general foodstuff hall, fish hall, dairy products hall, meat hall,
and covered stalls located;
B    10.90 hectares   reserved for services facilities (financial reserve);
C     5.78 hectares   reserved for service facilities (i.e. hotels).

Development of the zone A will be implemented in two phases. During the first
phase, on an area of 12 hectares, the following facilities will be constructed:
* inside roads and parking;
* vegetable-and-fruit hall;
* general food product hall;
* flower hall;
* administration buildings;
* sheltered area for sales directly from vehicels.
During the second phase, the following elements are expected on an area
of 18 hectares:
 meat hall;
* diary hall;
- fish hall;
* expansion of the flower hall.
Since the Centre will house companies of different sizes, designing of
facilities is based on the principle of merging standard modules as the required. All
units will be equipped a the telephone line and energy supply, and will be connected
to the water supply and sewage systems. Refrigerated stores and racks will be
provided by merchants.
The layout and size of objects will follow the current practice and principles
for designing similar facilities for wholesale markets. For each type of commodities a
single covered market hall, with automatically closing gates, as a protection, has
been designed. Construction of three large and three smaller halls, as well as
covered stalls (depending on the needs) is planned.

The objects of the Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum  Rolno-Spozywcze must
comply with EU regulations. The regulations to be met are particularly harsh for
meat, fish and diary halls, which has caused the necessity to postpone their
construction to the second phase.
A detailed technical design of each hall has been prepared due to the
particular requirements conceming layout of specific boxes, issues connected with a
possibility of adaptation, heating method, air-conditioning, services, and sanitary
requirements.
The need for open, and partly open, air trade for small merchants has resulted
in designing partly covered stalls for about 200 vehicles, with a total area of
1800 M2. This area will be build as a central promenade for the sellers and buyers,
with open boxes where the vehicles would be parked. It is assumed that only a part
of the vehicles will be under the roof (about 1 - 2 m).
5.3. Set-up of technical infrastructure services
Water supply. The water supply for human purposes is assessed for the first
phase as:
Qaverage - 116,000 dm3/day
Qmaximum/day - 133,400 dm3/day.
The demand for water for the fire control purposes is estimated for 50 dm31s.
There is no water supply system within the investment site. In the draft development
plan it is assumed that the ground water intake "Osowa" will be the source of water
supply for the district of Baraniewice-Owczamia. During the first phase of the
project implementation the construction of two pipelines of 150 mm and 200 mm is
planned. Ultimately the Centre will be supplied with water with a 500 mm pipeline,
which will be built from the Osowa residential quarters to Bamiewice, Kiukowa and
Rebichowo.
Discharge of sanitary waste water. The amount of discharged sewage
during the first phase is estimated:
Qaverage - 116,000 dm3/day
Qmaximum/day- 133,400 dm3/day.
The objects of the first stage of the construction of the Centre will be
connected to the existing sanitary sewage system, discharging the waste water from
Osowa to Oliwa. Ultimately the discharge of sewage from the area of Bamiewice,



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   16
thus from the Centre, requires the construction of a sewer system connected to the
collector "Morena" at Kokoszki. This will involve the construction of  several
kilometres of sewage network and a system of pumping stations. The connection of
the further phases of the Centre's constructions will require adaptation to the future
infrastructure.
Discharge of rainwater. To solve the problem of the rainwater discharge
from the Centrum Hurtowe, much larger area has to be considered, which borders
are as follows:
* in the North - the road junction ,Wysoka",
* in the South - the edge of existing residential district Bamiewice,
* in the West - Wysockie Lake,
* in the East - the boarder of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park.
The area of Bamiewice is located in the watershed of the Radunia river and
the streams draining off water directly to Gdanisk Bay. The Eastern part of this area
belongs to the Potok Oliwski drainage basin, and the westem one to the Strzelenka
drainage basin.
In the south-west part, along the stream which drains off water to Strzelenka
river, there are areas with raised water levels and a small depression filled in with
peat.
To the west of Owczamia, directly next to the Westem Circular Road, is a
significant depression with a stable water level, which is overgrown to a certain
degree. This is a section of a wetland area, with ditches, which was irreversibly
separated as a result of the construction of the Westem Circular road and Passover.
This area was hydrographically linked to many depressions with stable water levels,
part of which were filled during construction works (the analysis of the maps from the
period before the construction works, confirms the fact that the area of about
157 hectares has been cut off). Water flow from this part of the drainage basin was
directed, through a culvert under the Western Circular road, (nearby Owczamia) to
the Prochowy Potok (Oliwski Potok tributary). Since there was no maintenance or
conservation works undertaken, the efficiency of this solution has been gradually
decreasing. At present the culvert is silted up, and a part of a ditch, linking a pond
nearby Owczamia with the Prochowy Potok, is choked. This has resulted in the
appearance of ponds on the western side of the Western Circular, and periodical
flooding of the allotments, located in the neighbouring area.

Expected realisation of the Centrum Hurtowe as well as housing construction
in the southem part of Osowa housing estate will cause decrease of surface
retention, and consequently an increase of water flow off and increase bankful flows
in streams discharging rainwater. In order to discharge rainwater, the previously
existing system of rainwater discharge should be reconstructed and modemised.
The former system used to discharge water from the entire area located between the
road junction Wysoka, the southern edge of the housing estate Bamiewice,
Wysockie Lake, and the westem border of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park. The
system should be able to discharge occasionall increased amounts of rainwater
flows.
The construction of the Centrum Hurtowe requires reconstruction of part of
the ditch divided along Meteorytowa street and cleaning out the ditch along its full
length.
Rainwater from the considered area should be discharged to:
* the Potok Oliwski stream;
* the Radunia River via Strzelenka stream.
The existing soil conditions, showing high filtration coefficients, allow for the
feeding of underground waters, which should stop the lowering of their levels.
Heat supply. In the area of Bamiewice Wschodnie and Bamiewice
Zachodnie, and in a part of the housing estate in Osowa, heat is produced by seven
coal heat plants. Six of them are to be liquidated. One will be radone to bum oil or
gas.
In the new designed investments, there is expected the installation of oil or
gas buming facilities. The Draft Spatial Development Plan provides for exclusively
gas and oil based heat production.
Gas supply. A medium pressure gas pipeline Dn 150 mm, laid along the
railway, supplies gas to the existing secondary reduction and metering station. This
may be used for gas supply during the first phase of project implementation.
A medium pressure gas pipeline, of Dn 350 mm diameter, exists along Galaktyczna
street. Connection of the market objects to this line would be necessary to satisfy
future demand.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  18
Electrcity supply. For the first phase, 1500 kW electric power will be suplied
from the new 15 kV sub-station erected on the Centre's site. Further supplies
depend on the construction of a new overhead line 110 kV over the Northem part of
the area and a new, large substation to the West from that line.
Solid waste disposal. Solid waste produced in the area of Centrum Hurtowe
contains a significant proportion of organic substances (over 50%) of high humidity
level (60-70%) and low calorific value (about 1000 kcal/kg).
The best waste management system, which is often applied in wholesale
markets, is considered to be waste collection in sealed containers. The waste is then
collected in skips. These skips should be distributed at strategic points of the market
to be successively filled up and then exchanged for new ones at the end of the day.
Since the airport in Rebiechowo is located so close, the problem of waste collection
and disposal from the Centrum Hurtowe should be solved with special care.
Particularly important is to protect the waste from foraging birds, who could cause
threat to air traffic.
Telecommunicaton. The presently constructed telephone exchange for
2600 lines will serve only 100 telephone numbers in the Centre. It is necessary to
construct a new switching board, specifically for the needs of the Centrum Hurtowe.
Road links. The Centre will be connected to the Westem Circular road
(Obwodowa Zachodnia) after completion of the presently constructed Owczamia
junction.
Railway transport. A partial service of the Centre by railway is considered by
the railroad passing by along the Southern border of the site, linking up with the
airport at Rebiechowo and the railway system of the Gdarisk agglomeration via
Osowa. The Board of the Centre has resigned from the railway reserve foreseen by
the "General plan of spatial development of the City of Gdarhskw to provide for the
location of a container terminal for the needs of the Centre in exchange for another
area reservation.
5.4. Phasing the project implementation
The investor sponsor foresees a phased implementation of the Centrum
Handlowe. During the first phase the construction the following facilities is foreseen
(Figure 3):
* the transportation infrastructure and parking places on an area of 11,60 hectares;

* vegetable and fruit hall;
* general foodstuff hall;
* flower hall;
* covered merchant stalls;
* office buildings (2000 m2).

6. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVES TO THE INVESTMENT
PROJECT
6.1.  Altemative solutions considered by the investment sponsor
* Searching for alternatives in the beginning, the extension of the existing market
has been considered. Within the Gdansk agglomeration three open air wholesale
markets are in operation: at Chwaszczyno (7 hectares), at the Mia#ki Szlak (5
hectares) and in Gdar6sk (2 hectares) (Figure 2). The first two are dealing with
fresh horticultural products, overseas commodities, drinks and a limited amount of
meat and dairy products. The third market is used for sale of flowers. The market
in Chwaszczyno is privately owned. The remaining two belong to local
municipalities and have a higher technical standard (hardened surface). At all the
markets, technical improvements are difficult to be introduced. Technical
infrastructure is missing. The sanitary state of basic facilities is far from proper
and do not comply with EU standards.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   21
Organisational, technical and economic concems inclined the investment
sponsor to forgo of the expansion of the existing buildings. The altemative chosen
comprises realisation of the investment in the new location.
* Different alternatives of the Centrum Hurtowe implementation phasing were
analysed.
Examining altematives for the investment phasing was due to the economical
concems. The following variants were considered:
* to build primarily one large hall for the users of different branches, with the
possibility to move some of them to new halls later on;
* to build two halls, half the size, and further expansion to the ultimate sizes during
the subsequent phases;
3 to build more, but small or and narrower halls.
In the end, the alternative of the construction of the two large, full size halls,
and one flower hall of half the size, were chosen.
* Building construction. Because of the climatic conditions, different alternatives
for the front door, and the optimal number of doors were considered. Finally the
variant of the self-closing door, made of rubber or plastic strips, which would
create a line of protection. All small vehicles will be allowed to enter the halls to
unload.
. Building size and layout Different altematives of the size and layout, of the
halls as well as the layout of paths inside the halls, were considered. Hall
proportions were specified through the marketing research, as a demand
largesse. Inside of the halls will result form functional and economical conditions.
* Organisation of the open air market Various altematives for the organisation of
the open air market were taken into account. Operations on partly covered stalls
(with temporary, movable structure), and on plots outside, for very small
merchants selling directly from vehicles, were considered.
* Transportafion services. The location of the Centrum Hurtowe, existing
landscape conditions, and administrative authorities attitude, restrict the
opportunities of altematives for technical infrastructure development. The
solutions resulted from the number of negotiations were decided upon.

6.2.  Theoretical scope of altematives
Theoretical scope for altematives could refer to:
* not carrying out the action (the no-action altemative)
* links to the transportation system - an access to the Centrum Hurtowe is
possible via housing estate Osowa; however local community protests made this
alternative untenable; to guarantee transportation access, already during the
construction phase, the construction of a new road junction ,Owczarnia", located
on the Westem Circular, is necessary already before the project period start;
* sanitary sewage discharge, which can be discharged to the Gdanisk sewage
system (collector,,Morena") through different routes of collectors;
- rainwater discharge - there is a company CEMENT S.A. (a former Cement and
Lime Pouring Plant) located in the area of Bamiewice Zachodnie; from this area
the rainwater is discharged to the outlet of Wysockie Lake with a collector, a
diameter of 800 mm. Therefore there is a possibility of connecting the Centrum
Hurtowe objects to this collector; however it is not advantageous because:
- this would cause a conflict - the collector outlet is located in the area of Zukowo
commune, and the commune authorities do not permit this solution;
- it is an expensive solution - it would require a construction of rainwater
pumping station, and a regulation of a long and difficult stretch stream, which
flows out from Wysockie Lake.
* because of the landscape concems the following aspects should be
considered:
- another layout for buildings,
- other forms of building mass, height, roofing;
- building materials, colour patterns,
- different shaping of the area (for instance isolating dikes, lowered surface),
- different shaping of the site's pavement - from fully hardened to half-hardened
(for instance through application of blocks of the "Kasprowy" type ,where
possible),
- more greenery, in conjunction with the surroundings and their requirement
(vicinity of the Tri-City Landscape Park), both inside the Centre as well as on
its perimeters.

7. FUNCTIONAL AND SPATIAL CIRCUMSTAINCES
7.1. General circumstances
The area of the planned Pomeranian Agriculture and Food Merchandise
Centre situated between the Obwodowa Zachodnia road and the areas of Zachodnie
Bamiewice will, after the construction of the road junction linking to the circular road,
have a good connection with the basic elements of the functional and spatial
infrastructure of the Gdaihsk agglomeration:
* with the road system;
* with the railway system;
* with sea ports;
* with the intemational airport,
and in consequence with direct and indirect ready markets within the Gdahsk
agglomeration, in Poland and beyond her borders.
The planned Centre lies close to large settlement units, from which it is
separated with the areas of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park. The location of the
Centrum Hurtowe might arise the conflicts with the other elements of spatial
development and the environment, because of:
* the close proximity of Osowa district developing main residential functions
towards the future Centre;
* nearness of the airfield, which causes: limited height of buildings of the Centre;
* situation of the Centre within the protected zone of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape
Park, which may cause a degradation of the Parks value (mainly in result of
increased level of noise and air pollution from intensified traffic of heavy vehicles
along the circular road, also situated within the protected zone);
* situation of the Centre within the protected zone of the surface water intake
"Straszyn";
* situation of the Centre within the area of the regional natural system of the
Gdanisk voivodship, which represents a part of the planned countrywide
ecological network ECONET. The area of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park is a part
of the ecological corridor of national importance.
* location of the site of the planned Centre is situated on the perimeters of the
groundwater intake *Osowa".

7.2.   Circumstances arising from the land use existing pattem in the area
of the project site
The area designated for the development
The entire area is used for agricultural purposes, the majority for crop
production (units "A" and "B" of total area 51.09 hectares) and as meadows and
pastures (unit "C" of 5.78 hectares). On the whole site of the future investment
project no elements of development exist apart from line infrastructure elements,
such as:
* unsurfaced field way leading from north-west to south-east, with many old trees
along;
* 15 kV power line, situated parallel to the road, on its Westem side about 200 m
away;
* short section of a field way leading north-south-South at the Eastern part of the
subject area.
Sporadically along the roads single trees are growing. Within the area "C", in
the south-eastem part of the area two ponds and a small wood are situated
(Figure 5).
The functional structure of the units NA", SB", and XC" was suited to the existing
location conditions.
Neighbouring areas:
* to the South - the area of the Centre borders directly with the railway line of local
importance, leading from Firoga via Klukowo, Owczarnia, Osowa, Wielki Kack to
Gdynia. To the South of the railway arable land is lying without any kind of
buildings. To the West from the unit "C", where to railway changes direction
towards the North-South, areas of allotment gardens are situated. To the South
from the unit "C" a small forest is growing.
* to the East - the site of the Centre borders directly with a double lane fast by-
pass road, the Obwodowa Zachodnia, running North-South. Beyond the road on
its Western side a complex of allotment gardens (within a belt 200 - 350 m wide
and about 2 km long), and further beyond the compact forest area of the Tri-City
Landscape Park.
* to the North - an area of cropland divided by unsurfaced field ways. The closest
single buildings are about 100 m away. To the north-east from the unit A" and to
the North from the unit "C" a small complex of buildings about 200 m from the
border of the site is situated.

* to the West - cropland. About 150 m away from the site border a dense complex
of farm buildings exists. Further to the West, about 350 m away from the Centre
site, a functioning industrial estate, producing plastic elements, is present. About
700 m from the site boundary to the East from that factory another industrial
facility - cement distribution - is in operation. Both estates are surrounded by
arable land. Both companies are surrounded by the arable areas. To the south-
east of the Centre, along the local road, a complex of lose rural settlements is
situated.
Land ownership
The whole area designated for the development belongs to the Pomorskie
Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozywczego S.A. The parcel of 56 hectares has been
taken over from the Agency of Agricultural Land Ownership of the State Treasury for
shares of 3,9 million PLN value.
7.3. Circumstances arising from the proposed site development
The area designated. The area designated for the project development is
subject of conditions laid down by two land use plans, which embrace two structural
units: Bamiewice Wschodnie - Owczamia, and Osowa.
Bamiewice Wschodnie - Owczamia. The area of the future investment
project belonging to this structural unit was, in its greater part, designated for railway
functions (unit "A") and for industry, depots and bases (unit "B"). In result of
conclusions between the Railway Management , the City, and the investment
sponsor, the Polish State Railways have resigned from using those areas to the
benefit of the Centre in exchange for another area obtained from the City to built a
cargo handling base. Thus, as stated by the Draft Land Use Plan, the entire unit "A"
and "B" belonging to the Bamiewice - Owczamia area is presently designated for
industrial, storage and base purposes, i.e. in accordance with the future functions of
the planned development project. The area ,C" has been appropriated, as reserved
land, for possible construction of a hotel (motel), with conservation of the existing
landscape components (ponds and forest) (Figure 6).
Osowa. A narrow strip of land belonging to the Centre, stretching on the
North parallel to the proposed Nowy twiat road, has been designated by the Local
Detailed Land Use Plan Osowa as isolation greenery.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  26
The neighbouring areas are included in conclusions of the Local Land Use
Plans of the two structural units, in the west - Bamiewice Zachodnie, in the south -
Klukowo-Rebiechowo, and, in the east, in the General Development Plan of the City
of Gdansk.
1. OSOWA
The area adjacent to the Centre on the North is subject of conclusions of the
Land Use Plan Osowa. Within the belt directly adjoin to the project area (about
250 m wide) low intensity residential functions are foreseen, and further mixed
residentiallservices functions (including large areas for educational and sporting
services with accompanying greenery).
Within the belt directly adjoining the Obwodowa Zachodnia by-pass road, about
120 wide and about 600 m long plots have been allocated for city service
facilities.
The area adjacent on the Northem side of the unit "B", and to the South from the
proposed Nowy Swiat street is partly designated for handicraft, storage, bases
functions and partly for service functions requiring concentration in adequate
centres.
2. BARNIEWICE WSCHODNIE-OWCZARNIA
Area within the belt 150 - 200 m wide on the Western side is subject of
conclusions of the Land Use Plan Bamiewice Wschodnie - Owczamia. The
development of handicraft, storage and bases is foreseen. The area further to
the West is included in the Land Use Plan of Bamiewice Zachodnie, which also
assumes further development of this area towards warehousing, bases and
handicraft along up to the area of the residential/and services area located along
the R§bichowo - Osowa railway, on its Eastem side.
3. BARNIEWICE ZACHODNIE
The new changes, introduced in the draft land use plan of the region Gdarisk
Bamiewice Zachodnie, provide with the changes of arable land classification,
designate meadows to the housing plots, and a lpart of industrial areas to
allotment gardens.
Housing in the Bamiewice area will cause new sources of organised and
unorganised emissions. Extemal sources of organised emissions will be caused
by:
* outlets of the technological processes from industrial plants and artisans
workshops;
* heating plants chimneys from housing and industrial premises.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 27
Extemal sources of unorganised emissions will be caused by cars. Introduction
of the planned changes in land development will cause the sealing of the
drainage basin, which, in the quantitative aspect, will cause:
* decrease of retention,
* increase of surface flow,
* increase of high water amplitude,
and in the qualitative aspect:
* pollution of water drained off the access roads, parking places, tumaround
areas, and storage areas.
4. KLUKOWO-RQBIECHOWO
On the South the land use plan Klukowa - R~bichowo presumes subsequently
from the side of the Obwodowa Zachodnia:
* retention of the greenery function, hence a belt of parks and greenery along
the by-pass road, preservation of the existing wood area further to the east as
well as maintaining the present function of allotment gardens adjacent to the
woods;
e further to the West retention of the function of cropland.
5. GENERAL LAND USE PLAN OF THE CITY OF GDANSK
In the General Land Use Plan of the City of Gdarisk the continuation of the
present function of the existing allotment gardens to the East from the by-pass
road is foreseen, and on the area between the gardens and the Tri-City
Landscape Park a tourist services and services function with accompanying
greenery proposed. A small area between two complexes of allotment gardens
has been allocated to meadows and pastures.
8. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VALUES AND RESOURCES
OF NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
Location. The area of the proposed location of the wholesale market belongs
administratively to the Gdar6sk - Bamiewice - Owczamia district. It lies to the West of
the Obwodowa Zachodnia by-pass road and to north-west from the "Owczamia" road
junction. According to the physical and geographical regional zoning of Poland by
J. Kondracki, extended and completed with regard to the Gdarisk voivodship by
B. Augustowski and J. Szukalski, the area in question is situated on the Pojezierze



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   28
Kaszubskie (Kaszub Lakeland) within the Wysoczyzna Chwaszczyrnsko-
RQboszewska (Chwaszczynisko-Reboszewska Height).
The area, where the Centrum Hurtowe location is foreseen, is a part of the
regional (voivodeship) system of nature areas, as it is located in the protection zone
of the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park (Figure 7). The Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park
comprises the most valuable forest areas, located in the escarpment zone of the
Gdanisk High Plain.
The park was created according to the Provincial (Voivodeship) Council
resolution of 20th October 1975. The goal of the park is to protect the natural,
historical, and cultural values of the areas included in it. In the substantiation of the
decision was stressed a necessity to satisfy tourist-and-recreational needs, and to
conserve the natural values of the forest environment" in the area of the municipal
forests of Gdarisk, Gdynia and Sopot cities, and the national forests of the
contemporary Oliwa Forest Inspectore Board.
Within the range of work on the draft Spatial Development Plan of the park,
the boundaries of the park were more specified, and this made a basis for the
Provincial (Voivodeship) Council resolution of 3rd May 1979, No. XVI/89179 on
creating the Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park (Dz. Urz. WRN in Gdahsk 1979, No.7
item 35).
The final course of the park and its protection zone borders was defined by
the Gdaisk Voivod Ordinance No. 5194 of 8th November 1994, on creating areas of
protected landscape, defining borders of landscape parks, and setting up protected
zones around them, as well as prohibitions and restrictions in them (Dz.Urz.- Woj.Gd.
1994, No. 27 item 139). For the area of the protected zone the following prohibitions
and restrictions were formulated. It has been prohibited e.g.:
* to locate and built industrial object of more then the local scale, which could
decrease environmental values;
* to drain off the peatlands, wetlands, water reservoirs etc., and while melioration
works, the approval of the Landscape Park Director should be obtained (in regard
to the work within the park);
* to locate or build industrial waste landfills;
* to locate or build tourist-and-recreational objects and facilities, and to locate or
build them in the distance of 30 m from the edge of a forest.
* At the same time, among others, the appropriate public administration
representatives were obliged to tend to concentrate housing and other premises
within already existing villages, and to limit allowance of the forest areas for the
other purposes.

an extended area of comparatively higher table of ground water exists, with small
hollows filled with peat.
To the West from Owczamia, directly along the Zachodnia Obwodowa road a
considerably large depression with a constituent water level and partly overgrown by
water plants is situated. This area constitutes a small part of a many hectares of
wetland with a network of draining ditches, which in result of the construction of the
Obwodowa Zachodnia road and the flyover undemeath this road has bee divided
forever. This area was hydrologically integrated with a number of depressions
maintaining constant levels of water; part of them have been filled during the
construction of Zachodnia Obwodowa by-pass road. The analyses of maps from
times before the construction show the existence of integrity between the Ewa Potok
stream and the above mentioned wetland.
The watershed between the Radunia river and the Potok Jelitkowski drainage
basins runs through the area of the planned Centrum. According to the Gdahisk
Voivod Decision No. O-V-722611193 of 6th August 1993, the Radunia river has been
put under protection, since the protected zone of the surface water intake ,Straszyn"
was established. The analysed area has been included in the zone of indirect
protection of the water intake, so consequently there are obligatory different
prohibitions and restrictions. There is prohibited to perform works and activities
which could decrease usefulness of the pumped water, and the intake efficiency,
and in particular
* discharge of treated sewage to the lakes and their tributaries in the section of
three km from their outlet to the lakes;
* discharge of treated sewage to the lakes and their tributaries, if they do not
comply with individual requirements, which are specified every time in water legal
permits;
* use of human and industrial sewage for farming purposes;
* use of emergency spillways in pumping stations, and treatment plants, which
discharge sewage to the protected water,
* introduction of the chemical agents to the surface water, and direct sprays filling
from rivers, lakes, and water reservoirs;
* washing of vehicles or other equipment in the protected water, and setting up
parking areas in the distance lower then 100 m from the banks;
* construction of the new engineer objects, and food processing companies, in the
distance lower then 100 m from the river and lake banks;

* location of water intensive companies, and other nuisance companies, if the
Environmental Impact Assessment will indicate their environmental harm;
* location of the liquid oil based products storages, and other chemical substances
storages, as well as pipes for their transportation, which have more then local
significance;
* location of municipal and industrial sewage discharge, and the industrial waste
landfills.
Geologic conditions. Geological survey of the High plain is good in the
vicinity of the water intakes (Osowa, Tuchom, Owczamia, Dolina Radosci). In the
rest of the area it is lime and refers mostly to the point survey (Figure 8).
A model of geological structure was made, based on the collected geological
materials. It has been presented as the hydrological section in the Figure 9. The
oldest surveyed structures originate from the Tertiary period, which were recognised
in Owczamia and in the water intake ,Dolina Rado§ci".
The Tertiary structures are represented by Oligocene and Miocene deposits.
In the Oligocene deposits occur slimly-and-clayey sediments with sand layers,
sometimes with carbonated deposits. Miocene deposits were deposited mainly in the
typical brown coal facies. They are built of clay, loam with additives of brown coal
dust, with brawn coal lenses and sandy layers, which depths reach sometimes up to
some dozens of meters.
The depths of the Miocene deposits differ as a consequence of the large
relative heights of the roof layer resulting from the late Tertiary denudation, glacier
erosion, and erosion caused by thawing water.
Quatemary deposits covering the High plain are undisturbed. Their depths
depend on the geomorphology of the area, and the relief of the postquatemary
surface. The total depth of the quatemary deposits is from 40 up to 170 m. The
largest relief of the surface occurs around Osowa and Owczarnia.
In the area of Osowa intake appears a deeply cut erosion channel, filled
mainly with sand deposits. However, in the surroundings of Owczamia was noticed
a large uplift of Tertiary deposits.
The quatemary deposits differ as well.

In the area of planned Centrum Hurtowe were recognised:
* glacial sediments - sandy clay, boulder clay
* glacial water sediments - gravel, sands of different granulations
* hollow sediments - silt, loam
Hydrogeologic conditions. The scheme of the Tertiary and Quatemary
ground water in the area of the Centrum Hurtowe, in relation to hydrogeological
conditions of ,,Osowa" and ,Dolina Rado§ci" intakes, is presented in the
hydrogeological section.
Ground waters of the Tertiary period are connected with the Oligocene and
Miocene fine sands. The Oligocene layer is not of a large significance. The ground
water of the ,,Dolina Radotci" intake is taken from Miocene layer. In the zones,
where the Miocene sands are uplifted, occur contacts of this water layer with the
Quatemary water layers.
Within the Quatemary deposits occur the water layers of regional
significance:
* the lower layer with average depth of 20 m, however the deeply cut channel near
Osowa reaches the depth of 100 m;
3 upper layer, located at the depth of 20 to 40 m, which is covered with boulder
clay. This layer is made of sand deposits of different granulation, gravel, and
pebble. The total depths of this layer differ, and reach from several meters up to
60 m. In the ,,Osowa" intake the average depth is 40 m; these layers occasionally
contact each other, remaining in the hydraulic links.
The lower layer is characterised with very good hydrogeological parameters.
Average indicator of filtration ,rK' is 2.1 x 1 4 m/s. The efficiency of the well is about
20 m3 IhIlmS, and the conductance equals T= 36 m2 /h. The upper layer is largely
taken in the High Plain, and in small amounts in the ,,Osowa" intake. The water table
in the area of the planned Centrum, occurs from 105 to 110 m above sea level. The
water flows in an easterly direction, to Nadmorski terrace and the Gdar6sk bay with
the gradient of 9100. In the region of the Centrum the gradient reaches 8 100j
The lower water layer has an impermeable cap rock layer of boulder clay and
clay loam, of a total depth of a few meters to 20 m. This water layer creates the base
for the ,,Osowa' water intake, and has an estimated reservoir of 1,062 m3/hr.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  33
According to the isotopic research, this layer in the ,Osowa" water intake is
sufficiently protected against extemal influences. The proof for this is the lack of
tritium and the estimated age of the water, based on the C14 method, which is about
900 years old.
The upper layer is supplied by rainwater. A quick exchange of water is
observed here. This fact is proved by the research of water age held in the Institute
of Nuclear Physics of the Mining and Metallurgy Academy in Krak6w. The estimated
exchange time is about two or three years.
Differentiation of the water circulation and exchange is proved by the results
of the chemical research. In the upper layer runs water of a hardness of
3.5 mval/dm3 and of a higher content of nitrogen. The total mineral content does not
exceed 250 mg/dm3.
Water in the lower level is characterised by an alkalinity of 0.7 mval/dm3, with
a total hardness is 4.5 mval/dm3. The mineral content is 300 mgJdm3. Nitrogens do
not appear in significant amounts - 0.16 mgN/dm3.
According to the hydrological data, in the water bearing cap rock deposits
appears an aeration zone with a depth of 20 + 24 m. It consists of sandy gravel
deposits covered with a clay layer of 12 m.
Climatfc condiffons. For the analyses of climatic conditions the archive
materials of the R§bichowo station, based several kilometres to the West from the
development site. Basing on observation materials from many years, the
characteristics of the climate has bee described on such factors which are decisive
for the specific climate of the study area. Particular iattention was given to the
migration of air pollution, e.g. the direction and speed of winds and the weak
balance of the atmosphere.
* Cloudiness influences the radiation balance, exerting a direct impact on the influx
of short wave radiation and on the exchange of long wave radiation. In general
the cloudiness is described by monthly means and annual values. The minimum
values for cloudiness for the RQbichowo station, independent of the time of the
day, are occurring in May, June, August and September, maximum in November,
December and January. In course of twenty-four hours, during the warm half of
the year the greatest cloud has bee noticed during noon hours. At that time better
condition exist for the creation of thermal convection., During the colder half-year
maximum mean cloudiness is visible during moming hours and the smallest at
evening time.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  34
* Air temperature. Maximum monthly mean air temperatures occur in July and
August, and the lowest in February. Typically for coastal zones thermal
differences between the warmer autumn and cooler spring are apparent.
* Relative air humidity in course of the year attains highest values from November
till February. May and June are the driest. In course of twenty-four hours the
highest values of relative humidity occur during moming hours, while the lowest
during midday. The analyses of relative humidity data indicate an even
distribution during the year, however with a clear domination of high values - over
60%. Domination of values in classes of 60-75% and 80-100% influences
indirectly the hygienic status of the air. The subject literature assumes relative
humidity values of 70% as threshold value, above which the conversion of air
pollution becomes greater, particularly of sulphur dioxide and sulphur compounds.
i Atmospheric precipitation in accordance with results of analyses performed on
data from the RQbichowo station, are characterised by low values (below 550 mm
annually). In course of the whole year the highest mean monthly total atmospheric
precipitation occur in July. The next, secondary precipitation maximum is showing
up in October, and the lowest monthly precipitation totals are observed in
February and March. Months with the highest totals of monthly precipitation do
not fully fall in line with months of the maximum numbers of rainy days. This
conclusion is important, because the formation of, among others, bioclimatic
conditions depends to a greater extent from the number of days with precipitation
and the probability of their occurrence than the annual total of atmospheric
precipitation. The greatest number of days with precipitation is observed in
October, November and December and clearly lower during the month with the
highest total atmospheric precipitation, i.e. in July.
* Winds. The review of wind directions indicates to a deciding dominance of
Westem and south-westem winds. For the first observation period the share of
Western winds was 26.3%. A similar result was noted during the second
observation period - 23.1%. During the evening time the dominant share of
Westem wind was maintained at 21.4%.
In course of the year the main share in general came from the north-eastern
winds with 9% as at 19.00 hours. The frequency of still air in course of twenty-four
hours is also interesting. The lowest frequency in this respect occurs during noon
time with a share at merely 1%. During the heating season Westem sector winds
prevail, with a share of 24% at Rebichowo station. Characteristic is the lowest
frequency of Northern sector winds. Their share does not exceed 6%. Also at
summer time winds coming from the Westem sector are prevailing. Their
contribution reaches 22.2% (second period). Exceptionally during the third period
north-eastem winds were prevailing at 18.3% while the Western winds have
shown a lesser participation at 17.9%.

The strongest winds are observed during the heating period, i.e. from November
till March. Both, the mean monthly wind speed as well as its increased humidity
showing a speed of 8 m/s. Slowest winds are occurring during May, July and  t
September. In course of those months also the participation of still wind or very
slow breeze (below 2.0 m/s).
Analysis of the twenty four hour wind speed indicated that there are lower speeds
in the aftemoons. During this time of the day very weak winds and calm air
predominates. The strongest wind within the whole year occurs from the North,
and the weakest from the West.
Fog. Appearance of fog contributes to the worsening of the hygienic state of air
and restricts influx of direct short-wave radiation to the Earth surface. In annual
mean the largest number of foggy days is observed in February and March. The
smallest number in May, June and July.
Acoustic climate. The area of Centrum Hurtowe is not highly developed and
therefore lacks significant noise sources. The only exception is the Westem Circular
road, which influences the acoustic climate of the adjacent areas.
Traffic on this road has an average speed of 80 - 90 km/h and a density of
actual vehicles during the day of up to 1300 vehlh (heavy transport = 17%) and at
night of up to 450 vehlh (heavy transport = 21%). Sound levels I m from the edge of
the road are 77 dB during the day and 73 dB at night and at a 50 m distance are
59 dB during the day and 57.5 dB at night.
Other, less important, noise sources in the area are the Gdatisk R§biechowo
Airport, which has an impact during aircraft takeoffs and landings, and the railway
line side-track between Osowa and Rebiechowo, which at present, depending on
the terrain, occasionally has an impact on the area 25 to 70 m from the track.
Vegetation cover. The area under study presents an extensive farming land
with the domination of plant population plants usually covering intercrop spaces. The
division lines between runners are overgrown by ruderal plants with young specimen
of trees (maple or birch trees). Trees (maple, lime and lbirch trees) are creating an
avenue form along the Nowy twiat street. In the valley of the right tributary of the
Strzelenka River, in a shallow, wetland area a peat structure was formed with a
small pond. This area is overgrown by giant sedge rushes and bushes of wideleafed
willow. This peatbog presents and enclave of wetland vegetation and refuge for wild
animals. Water and rushes plant communities are met between the uOwczamia"
junction and the Obwodowa Zachodnia. This is part of a former vast wetland area
coherent with the Potok Ewa stream.

Landscape. The area of the proposed development project lies within the
protective zone of the Tri-City Landscape Park. It is, however, cut off from the latter
by a spatial barrier of the double lane by-pass road Obwodowa Zachodnia.
Therefore, when viewing spatial relationships, no clear direct link between the cut-
off part of the protective zone and the area of the Park exists.
The future Centre is situated on an almost flat area of monotonous, uniform
physiognomy of a rural landscape, with the dominance of cropland, single dispersed
buildings beyond the site borders, with a small number of unsurfaced roads, tree
clusters, small water mirrors (distant) and swampy ground pits (Figure 5). In the
East, a clear site boundary is represented by the line of the by-pass road, in the
South, by the existing railway side-track, and in the East, by houses and industrial
buildings. In the North the view from the site area is open, with a housing estate in
the far distance. In general the landscape has no dominant features, except for the
buildings of the cement pouring plant in the West (photographs A - E). One of the
important landscape elements of the Centrum surroundings is edge of the Tri-city
landscape park forest on the Eastem edge of the site. The strong linear element,
which has a high aesthetic value, is the Nowy Swiat avenue, with its old maple, ash,
sycamore, and lime trees, running across the Centrum Hurtowe area.
Cultural Environment. The most important cultural elements of the macro
landscape composition of the examined area are:
? Linear elements of the former infrastructure: the crossing of transportation tracks
in the neighbourhood of Owczamia, which lead from the north to the south to
Gdarisk and from the west to Oliwa through the moraine hills. Their importance
was signified by the planting of noble tree species (lime, sycamore, and ash) in
avenues. The tracks connect:
- The farm of Barniewice with Oliwa (now Meteorytowa street)
- The farm of Nowy Swiat with Oliwa (now Nowy twiat street, creating the
maple/ash tree avenue).
These routes would connect in the large farn of Owczamia, and then the Dolina
Ewy track would lead through the hills to the Oliwa forest and further to Stara
Oliwa.
- Wysoka, Owczamia and Klukowo (running parallel to the Tri-city landscape
park forest, from North to South).

PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  38
Also recommended for protection are views on the local natural elements (i.e.
terrain depressions and ponds) and cultural elements (i.e. forms of the old
settlements).
9. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RESULTING FROM PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION
9.1. Impact on the landscape
The negative impact may be caused by:
* permanent change of the pattem of use of a vast area from open agriculture to
highly urbanised, with and industrial character;
* appearance of buildings of vast dimensions;
* destruction of the natural relief of the terrain (change from slightly undulated to
completely flat);
* noise, vibration, air pollution (mainly dust during construction) caused by the use
of heavy equipment;
* cutting of single trees;
* complete destruction of low vegetation;
* temporary piling of diggings;
* violation of the landscape harmony;
* appearance of temporary construction back-up facilities in the landscape.
The transformation of the landscape, caused by the expansion of the
transportation system and construction of the large buildings, will remain a
permanent element of the landscape.
The Centrum Hurtowe halts are lightly built constructions which do not need
deep foundations. Therefore there is no danger of disturbing the ground water
balance.
If the construction and assembly of the Centrum Hurtowe is undertaken in
compliance with the present regulations, then the building process will not cause a
danger to the environment. This conclusion refers to both the first and second
phases of the investment project.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 39
The closeness of the Westem Circular road, which is one of the main access
roads to Gdatisk, is significant when assessing visual value, since the Centrum
Hurtowe may become a representative symbol (contemporary) of the region.
The fieldwork showed that the future investment, during both the construction
process and operation, will be visible from small sections of the Western Circular
road, in the vicinity of the road junction ,,Owczarnia," of the total length of 500 m.
From the other small parts it will party visible, and not visible at all from the rest of
the Western Circular road (Figure 10).
Because the Westem Circular road will become a very busy transportation
route in the future, visual impressions will be significant, even though they appear
only in a small section. Therefore, the spatial development of the Centrum Hurtowe
(especially zones B and C, surrounds of the road junction and administration
buildings) should be designed to keep existing aesthetic values, or even raise them,
in this new development. The valuable forms of the existing development should be
protected (the avenue of trees along Nowy twiat street, the small ponds, the view of
the Tri-city Landscape Park and forest, the trees and bushes along the railway track,
the objects of cultural value in Owczamia, and the old single trees) and a project of
greeneries should be made.
The visual problem is different from the open areas in the North, West, and
South. From the North, from the housing estate Osowa, Centrum Hurtowe is very
well seen, especially its westem part, where the huge halls will be constructed in the
future. The eastem part, where there is no construction expected, is obscured by a
small hill covered with plants.
The open visibility of the future Center from existing and planned housing in
Osowa, will be the key issue while specifying mitigating measures and activities in
landscape shaping and protection.
From the West and the South, where the local roads are located, the Centrum
Hurtowe is also very well seen. However, because these local roads are only very
small and sporadically used, the visual impressions are of very little significance in
comparison to the visual impacts on the permanent inhabitants of Osowa.
9.2. Impact on the existing site development and land use (within the site)
Presently, the entire area of the future Centre is being used for farming. No
development facilities exist on the site (except for few roads, 15 kV high tension
electric line which is planned to be removed). The proposed use of the area and its



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   40
development will completely change its present character. Instead of cropland an
intensively developed Centre will appear, with numerous large scale structures,
infrastructure and fully surfaced grounds. The trees along Nowy Swiat street are
threatened with being cut because the street is planned to be liquidated.
9.3. Impact on the air quality
Most of the construction works will be the source of air pollution because of.
* earth moving, levelling and excavations
* cement mixing process (cement and lime) and sand storage
* welding works emitting dust, N02, CO
3 painting works connected with the emission of organic solvents
-- vehicle transport, causing secondary dust emission
Amounts of emitted pollution might be significant but the range of their
influence will be limited by their absorption by the ground. Emission of pollution to
the air will be lower than emissions generated by the car traffic on the Westem
Circular road.
9.4 Impact on acoustic climate
During the time of project implementation the main source of noise will be the
construction equipment, road construction machines and heavy transport
(bulldozers, frontloaders, excavators, pile-drivers if used, ground densing machines,
paving machines and road rollers). These are sources of high acoustic power (as a
role over 100 dB) exerting impact up to 200-300 m from the place of action. This
impact is varying in time and occurs with different intensity depending on the type of
works performed. Close to residential areas (Osowa) mnust be limited to day time.
The level of noise during construction works is not regulated by standards and has
no limitations. During the construction period no substantial differences in noise
intensity is linked to phases of construction, though during the 11 phase noise should
be less burdensome since road construction, and substantial part of excavation and
levelling works will be completed during phase 1.
9.5  Impact on surface and ground water
The impact of the implementation of the Centrum Hurtowe project (mainly
excavations) will be a small amount of pollution draining off with rainwater to the
irrigation ditches. There might be different sludges and dirts containing oil based



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 41
substances. The possibility of the discharge of these substances should be
effectively eliminated by the use of portable pre-treatment equipment periodically
installed in the ditches.
There will be no impact on the ground water, since the foundations will be
shallow and due to the effective isolation of the useful ground water reservoirs.
9.6  Impact on soil and natural environment
The impact on soil and vegetation will be limited to the area where the
Centrum Hurtowe will be located, where the levelling and ground removal will take
place.
After the removal and breaking up of the surface layer of soil, it should be
disposed in areas not exposed to pollution. The soil collected in this way can
therefore be used for other purposes, such as farming or gardening.
Because of the location of the present trees and bushes, some will need to be
removed.
The construction work may temporarily disturb animals and birds in the
investment project area.
9.7  Impact on the human environment
Construction of the Centrum Hurtowe will last for many years and will
comprise of the two phases of the investment implementation and the construction of
the technical and transportation infrastructure, which will allow for the Centrum to
function. The range and scale of the investment may cause a significant
concentration and intensity of small scale harmful environmental impacts. These will
be first of all noise, dust and gases from welding, solvent fumes from painting, and
air pollution from levelling, excavation and ground works.
People who may suffer from the negative impacts, such as noise, vibrations,
and dusting, will be, first of all, users of the allotment gardens on both sides of the
Westem Circular road, in the vicinity of the planned Centrum Hurtowe and the road
junction ,Owczamia."
Another group of people may be Osowa inhabitants, who will feel impacts
related to the increased vehicle traffic serving the investment area construction site.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   42
Because the distance from the investment area to the dense Osowa housing estate
is significant, the possibility of a negative impact of the construction on peoples
health is excluded.
The more detrimental period will be the second phase of the investment
project, when some objects will already exist (vegetable and fruit, flowers, and
foodstuff halls) and be functioning. This will result in the assembly and construction
process and the delivery and transport of food stuffs occurring at the same time.
10. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAUSED BY OPERATION
OF FACILITIES
10.1. Impact on air
Transport communication pollution. The main source of transport
communication pollution will be the Obwodowa Zachodnia by-pass road, which is an
existing element of the transportation structure. The increased traffic, resulting from
the Centrum Hurtowe implementation, and implementation of different objects of
similar character in the neighbouring area, as well as increase of transhipment in the
Gdynia harbour, and the transit carriages, will cause the increase in emissions of
exhaust gases.
No data exist on the background air pollution for the Bamiewice region. The
State Voivodship Sanitary Inspector has defined the following reserve of background
pollution for 1995 (maximum concentration in 30 minutes emerge):
* sulphur dioxide          - 40% of permissible level, i.e. 0.176 mg/m3
* nitrogen dioxide         - 40% of permissible level, i.e. 0.2 mg/mr3
* carbon oxide             - 70% of permissible level, i.e. 0.3.5 mg/m3
* mixture of hydrocarbons  - 50% of permissible level, i.e. 0.5 mg/im3
* total of lead            - 20% of permissible level, i.e. 0.0007 mg/im3
* suspended particulate    - 40% of permissible level, i.e. 0.05 mg/mi3
The analisys of this documentation proves thata the existing state of the
acoustic climate is satisfactory. There is no exceed of any standards.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   43
To assess the emissions from fuel combustion in the vehicles passing by the
Obwodowa Zachodnia, according to the draft plan, the traffic intensity was assumed
for 4,000 vehicles per hour one way, and 40,000 vehicles per day, including 10% of
heavy transport.
On the local roads an increased intensity of transport is expected up to the
following capacities:
* Srednicowa street                    1000 vehicles/hr. one way
* Nowy Swiat street                   800 vehicles/hr. one way
* Meteorytowa street                  2700 vehicles/hr. one way
* Wodnik street                       2700 vehicles/hr. one way
* Galaktyczna street                   1500 vehicles/hr. one way
The increase of traffic intensity will cause and increase of emission of
pollution. However the latter will not be proportional to the traffic intensity increase
for the following reasons:
* transportation will take place on new, less bending roads, which should improve
their ventilation, and thus reduce the local concentration of pollution;
* emission from single vehicles will be smaller (new types of engines and exhaust
systems).
The emissions from the motor vehicle exhausts, produces by the cars driving
on the roads in vicinity of the Centrum Hurtowe, and from the exhausts emitted on
the parking areas, will not exceed the permission limits of air pollution in so called
,,areas."
However it may be assumed that the increased traffic on the Western Circular
road may cause the occasional concentrations of the suprastandard air pollution, on
the border of the protected area of the Tri-City Landscape Park. These situations
may occur, when during the weak airing. Also in the area adjacent to the Western
Circular, on the side where the Centrum Hurtowe is located, may occur exceedings
of the permission limits.
Polluton caused by energy production. The heat production to supply the
objects of the Centrum Hurtowe will be gas based. The heat will be produced in four
heating plants in the first phase of the project implementation, and probably also in
the second phase. Under the possible combustion technologies, this source of heat
energy is the most environmentally friendly.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   44
Since the heating plants in the housing estate of Osowa are to be
modernised, the decrease of the total pollution, produced by the energy production,
is expected in the whole area of Bamiewice. This conclusion is due to the following
circumstances:
* 7 boiler houses fired by hard coal at Osowa will be replaced by one fed by
heating oil or gas;
* objects of the Centre and other, which will be erected in the neighbourhood, will
be heated by gas boilers;
* in relation to factories new requirements enforcing modemisation of energetic
installations and change of heating venue.
Considering the facts listed above, it is expected that the emission of harmful
substances, which are produced in the process of energy production, will not exceed
the permission levels for the toxic substances emissions, in the area bordering with
the protected Tri-City Landscape Park.
10.2. Impact on acoustic climate
After the project implementation is completed, the new sources of noise will
appear and the area effected by the existing sources will increase. In the project, the
construction of many new roads is foreseen , mainly to serve the new Centrum.
Apart from them there will appear many new industrial sources of noise, resulting
from the range and the purpose of investment implementation.
In the area of the Centrum Hurtowe, there will exist two basic types of the
extemal, direct noise sources:
* transportation noise, from the car transportation and goods supply to the Centrum
Hurtowe, car traffic in parking areas for the service of clients, parking places for
the Centrum employees, railway transport, and intemal transport for the unloaded
supplies;
* noise from ventilation, air conditioning and cooling of the halls, offices and
storage places.
Among the ventilating devices will be installed ventilation boards for aeration
and blowing out, ventilation boards for aeration, cooling aggregates, sets of
ventilating condensers, wall aeration ventilators, roof ventilators of different types,
air curtains and heating-and-ventilating equipment.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   46
Estimated results of the calculations related to the level of noise, emitted from
the linear sources are presented below. It is expected that the assumed range of
roads nuisances in the analysed area will look as it follows:
* Westem Circular road
isoline LAeq = 50 dB   rx = 600 m
isoline LAeq = 55 dB   r. = 320 m
isoline LAq = 60 dB   r. = 170 m
* Other planned roads
isoline LAq = 50 dB   r. = 200 - 250 m
isoline LAq = 55 dB   rx = 100 - 160 m
isoline LAeq = 60 dB   r, = 60 - 90 m
The assumed impact of the Westem Circular road is considerably higher then
at present. It results from the planned parameters of the road, but first of all from the
increase of the car traffic and their speeds.
As already mentioned above, there will be two main types of sources emitting
acousting energy to the surrounding - from the transportation and the installed
felicities.
During the Centrum Hurtowe exploitation, the basic and difficult to eliminate
source of noise will be the traffic noise from supplies delivery and goods removal to,
from, and within the Centrum. The entire area of the Centrum will be a huge surface
source, which would emit the noise in the course of the entire day, with the
maximum during the more intensive car traffic (from 2.00 to 9.00 o'clock). This is the
period of time which should be especially protected since the site area is bordering
with the housing estate. The entrance roads to the Tri-City agglomeration will be
particular nuisant in the same hours.
The noise from devices (ventilation, cooling, air-compressing and heating)
installed in the Centrum will be of less significance, particularly that it could be
effectively decreased with the technical means. Among the sources of noise from the
mentioned installations, during the first phase the ventilators (vegetable and fruit
hall), cooling and air-conditioning equipment (flower hall) will be of the most
significance.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                     47
During the second phase the meat, dairy and fish halls are to be constructed.
Because of the kind of the products to be traded, in these halls the powerful cooling
system will have to be installed. The halls are to be built in the north-western part of
the Centrum, close to the housing areas of Osowa and Bamiewice Zachodnie.
Noise produced from this kind of installations may have an impact on the
residential area located even several meters away, and may exceed the permissible
level, particularly during the night time.
10.3. Surface flow assessment
The mutual influence between the intensity, time of lasting and probability of
the rain falls may be formulated in different ways. In this paper was adopted the
formula based on the collection of 67 years of rain falls observations in Warsaw,
from the period 1937 - 1959, with the application of average intensity method:
ITm =  067  UIs/hectares, where:
ITm    rain intensity VS/hectares
c     period (in years), when certain intensity was exceeded
t     penod of rain lasting
To estimate the intensity of the rain the following measurements were taken:
* c = 1, t = 10 min., therefore                    ITm = 100 I/s/hectares
* the area of the project analysis                 A = 60 hectares
* the indicator of run off flow from the drainage basin  p= 0.8
* the intensity of the surface run off             Qs = (p x ITm x A
* the capacity of the surface run off              Vs = Qs x t
Qs = 0.8 x 100 x 60 = 4,800.0 I/s = 4.80 m3/s
The capacity of the surface run off will be:
Vs = 4.8 x 10 x 60 = 2,880 m3



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   48
The next issue related to rainwater discharge is water run off from the roads
and the parking areas. The sources of pollution are:
* rainwater and snow melt run off,
* discharge of the harmful substances during car accidents.
Rainwater run off might be very polluted, especially after a long, dry period.
The main pollution indicators in the run off from the roads are:
* suspended matter;
* heavy metals and other toxic substances;
* chlorines;
* compounds characterised by the content of the carbon, BOD and COD;
* oil based substances.
The survey held by the Instytut Badawczy Dr6g i Most6w (Roads and Bridges
Research Institute) during 1988 -1990 showed, that the largest harm to the waters
recieving rainwater are:
* suspended matter    average value 292.8 mg/l permitted value* 50.0 mg/l
* COD                 average value 362.2 mg/I permitted value' 150.0 mg/l
10.4 Impact on ground water
The area of the planned Centrum Hurtowe is located about 2 km south-east
from the water supply system ,Osowa", and 2.5 km north-west from the ,Dolina
Radosci" water intake. Most of the investment area is found within the resource area
of the ,Osowa" water intake. The detailed location is presented in the documentary
map with the hydrological elements (Figure 8).
Exploitation forecasts of the ,,Osowa" water intake state, that the Centrum
impact in the area will result the lowering of the ground water table by about 1 m.
This decrease will not cause any change in the general ground water flow in the
zone between the intake and the Centrum, since the water table decreases already
According to Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry
of 5th November 1991



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   49
appear in this area. There will be no threat of the possible pollution migrations to the
,Osowa" water intake.
The ,,Dolina Radosci" water intake, and in particular its impacts, ale placed
outside the ground water currents.
According to the data from the plannes of the protected zones for these
intakes may be stated that the area of the Centrum is located outside the area of the
indirect protection zones (25 year of water inflow is foreseen).
The Centrum Hurtowe will be felicitated with the rainwater drainage system,
and the sewage water system, which will be utilised for discharge of all the sewage
to the proper recipients. With this kind of water management, and with the
assumption that there is 10 m depth layer of clay, from the surface of the terrain, the
threat of ground water during the normal exploitation is not expected.
Uncontrolled discharge of sewage to the ground may disturb environmental
balance in the roof layers of Quatemary deposits.
In this case bacterias of Escherischia Coli are very important, therefore the
biological water control is held with the use of Cola indicator.
The research of decomposition and survival of these typhus bacterias has
proved that how long they stay alive depends on the environmental yield (organic
pollution). The lower the degree of pollution (P04, NO3, Cl, NO2, NH4), and
consequently the lower use of KM1O4, the bacterias have, less chance to survive.
To estimate the time of sewage migration to the water layer through the aeration
zone of 20 m (10 m of clay, and 10 m of sand), the following formula is used:
=-/ d /, where:
h V
V, - the actual speed of vertical migration through the aeration
zone;
h - depth of the aeration zone.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 50
The actual vertical velocity is calculated according to the Bindeman formula:
Vr = (ne)-3 w2K
assuming that the average yearly infiltration o = 2.5 x 10-4 m/d (according to A.S.
Kleczkowski), average filtration rate of the aeration zone K = I m/d, and the average
effective porosity ne = 0.2:
Vr = 0.015 m/d
Therefore the time of percolation through the aeration zone will take 1333
days (about 3.5 year). This period guarantees the full water treatment from the
biological pollution. Due to this there is no possibility of the pollution infiltration to the
water layer in the natural way.
10.5 Environmental threats in the case of emergencies
Centrum Hurtowe, during its fits phase of functioning, should not cause the
that of the more serious emergencies, except for the fire danger. The type and the
character of the food stuffs will not require a use of any special cooling devices,
which work with the use of the large amounts of ammonia. Any sanitary threats
should not occur.
However during the second phase of Centrum Hurtowe implementation, which
includes among others the meat, fish, and dairy halls, the emergencies may occur,
e.g. as the result of cooling installations breakdown, when the ammonia may be
released to the air, or in the case of sanitary threats related to the trade of the very
perishable food stuffs. In this case the most threaten will be the surface water
supplying water intake in Straszyn.
The other problem is a hygiene threat, which may relate to the Centrum
Hurtowe employees and the consumers of the food stuffs. A wholesale trade of the
food products is regulated by a number of the sanitary ordinances, and will be
permanently supervised by the State Voivodeship Sanitary Inspector.
10.6 Impact on the landscape
The main impact will be the appearance in the landscape of a group large
dimension buildings, situated on an extensive area, mainly surfaced. In addition a
negative impact will be caused by a permanent movement of a large number of



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  51
vehicles (including heavy and large ones as determined by the Centre's function)
causing noise, vibration, air pollution, appearance of moving lights at night, etc.,
distorting the character of the surroundings hitherto. Because of the closeness of the
residential areas of Osowa and the by-pass Zachodnia road, being a viewing
passage along the Centre site, the buildings will be well exposed. This, together with
the industrial character of the proposed investment project, means a substantial
negative visual impact of permanent character, if no mitigation measures are taken.
The detailed impact on the landscape was described in the chapter 9.1 and
presented in the Figure 10, since most of the impacts occur during both phases, the
Centrum Hurtowe construction and operation.
10.7 Impact on cultural values
The impact on the cultural values refers to the area of the investment project
(the threat of the trees habitat along the Nowy twiat street), and to the
archaeological site with its surrounding (the impact on the valuable rural areas with
the elements of the spatial development, like concentrations of the village housing
and historical system of rural paths). The most precious historical object is the
Owczamia farm, located 350 m east of the Centrum Hurtowe, which spatial structure
and aesthetic values may be disturbed by the close neighbourhood of the different in
its character Centrum, if it is not properly developed.
The new development and industrial features of the new activities can
demage historical values of the area. The irreversible looses of cultural heritage and
of the elements of historical development, which may improve modem forms of lay-
out and architecture of new buildings, may occur.
11. ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SIGNIFICANCE,
INCLUDING MITIGATION MEASURES
The implementation of the Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spotywcze will
begin a long term process of changes in the area of the investment, related to the
buildings construction, the changes of spatial development in the surrounding area,
realisation of the technical infrastructure, and expansion of the transportation
system. This large investment programme and the increased attractiveness of the
Centrum neighbourhood, may cause a process of secondary development in the
adjacent areas. These development processes, together with the progressing growth
of the Osowa housing estate, may result in a change of land use and development



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   52
character, and to the forming of an urbanised zone along the Western Circular road,
in its westem part.
The long lasting investment process will be of the greatest importance in
determining the direction and scale of environmental transformation in this large
area. Therefore the impact of the planned Centrum Hurtowe will be only one element
in a wide range of influences.
Impacts of the planned Centrum Hurtowe will be significant during both
phases, i.e. the construction and the functioning, which, for a certain period of time,
will continue parallel. The kind, intensity, and range of impacts will be determined by
the character of threats resulting from the Centrum Hurtowe construction,
environmental conditions, and the way and range of the mitigation measures used.
The Centrum Hurtowe site is placed in the direct neighbourhood of the
protected areas, i.e. the Tr-City Landscape Park, close to the Osowa housing
estate, the direct protection zone of the surface water intake in Straszyn, the Ground
Water Main Reservoir, and borders on an area of the allotment gardens.
The other restrictions result from the protection of the cultural environment.
The natural rural landscape and bordering on the site of the Owczamia farm and the
forester's house, put high demands on the aesthetic and cultural development of the
investment area, its surroundings, and these particular objects.
Many of the changes which will occur in the environment as a result of the
Centrum implementation will be irreversible. Over 50 hectares of arable area will be
lost to farming. Also a significant number of allotment gardens will be liquidated as
consequence of the ,Owczarnia" road junction implementation. In the vicinity of the
road junction, air quality and acoustic conditions will worsen, eliminating the
possibility of further recreational use of a large number of the allotments.
The conditions of water run off will also be considerably changed. Due to the
surface hardening, construction of the objects and the roads, rainwater will supply
Radunia river and Straszynski reservoir through the Strzelenka river. Because of the
necessity of protecting the water in the reservoir, many steps for water pre-treatment
should be applied. These will require the setting up of retention and pre-treatment
ponds and ditches, prolonging the time of water run off to the reservoir.

The efficiency of this treatment is presented in the table below (according to:

Proper elimination of pollution from the rainwater is particularly important in
the Centrum Hurtowe, because most of this water will be discharged to the
Straszyriski reservoir, which is a drinking water intake for the city of Gdanisk.
The natural relief of the area allows for the opportunity to set up an additional,
vegetation based, water treatment step. In figure 12 is pointed out the fragment of
the Strzelenka river tributary, which should be used as the vegetation based
treatment plant.
These activities will change the state of the already disturbed water
conditions, which were caused during the construction of the Western Circular road,
when the road created an artificial watershed. The planned activities will change the
hydrographical conditions, as well as the soil and water relations in the area, where
the environmental sensitivity is higher (the landscape park buffer zone). This will
reduce the amount of water supply to the forest area of the Tri-City Landscape Park.
The area, where the planned Centrum Hurtowe will be located, has very little
variation in vegetation. The farmlands, with segetal habitats, predominate. The trees
along Nowy Swiat street do not have any symptoms of degradation. There are
spaces in the tree line along the road. The lay out plan of the objects in the Centrum
foresees the liquidation of a considerable part of the mentioned avenue. Since the
vegetation is very poor in the area, and there are a lack of trees and shrubs, the
cufting of trees in the avenue will have a negative impact on the biotic conditions of
the area.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   54
The mentioned avenue should remain in this area, as a naturally active
element, being included in the local system of open areas, which are linked with the
Strzelenka river valley and its left hand tributary from the area of Owczamia. The
line of trees would strengthen and fill in the green isolation zone, which is planned to
go between the Centrum Hurtowe site and the housing estate of Osowa. It would
also connect the biologically active areas on both sides of the planned investment
project, which are, in the east, the Tri-city Landscape Park area, and, in the west,
the open natural and recreational areas.
Because of small biotic variety, the area analysed is not used by birds for
breeding or foraging. Occasionally, in the farmlands, may forage single or coveys of
partridges, and periodically buzzards. Owls and magpies breed in the trees,
especially old and sick trees. The tree avenues are rarely used for hooded crow or
rook nesting. Birds usually chose areas richer in food, such as the Tri-city
Landscape Park, the adjacent to the housing estates, and city parks.
The important problem which needs to be solved is a problem of birds
congregating in the vicinity of the Centrum Hurtowe. Birds may occasionally fly
closer to the area of the airport in RQbiechowo. At the present time birds are
foraging in other areas, where more food can be found. The sanitary conditions and
the safety demands of taking off and landing planes will require an efficient solution
for the organic waste collection and disposal of the Centrum area. The best would
be a system of containers placed in crucial spots of the Centrum. The organic waste
and the waste of other origins should be collected in separate containers. At the end
of every working day, the filled containers should be exchanged with new ones. The
organic waste should be composted in the specially separated section of the
municipal waste landfill in Szad6lki.
The Centrum Hurtowe implementation will have various negative impacts on
the arable land. They will result in the occupation of the land for construction of the
Centrum objects, access roads and other related objects. During the construction
phase there will occur a permanent change in land use, together with losses of the
arable areas and soil degradation, resulting from:
* heavy construction equipment, causing soil compacting (increased density of the
surface soil layer);
* damage of the fertile, humus layer of the soil;
* change in water conditions, caused by land levelling, etc.;
* soil pollution with oil based substances, building materials, etc.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                    55
As a result of the Centrum Hurtowe construction, geotechnical transformation
of the soil will occur. The construction works will disturb the natural structure of the
soil in the project site, and will damage the surface humus layer of the soil. Also a
change in the relief of the terrain will occur, since the artificial dikes will be formed,
and large pits will be dug for foundations and the technical infrastructure (linear
elements of the technical infrastructure). This all will lead to the acceleration of the
erosion processes, especially since the humus layer of the soil will be damaged,
which normally stabilises the ground.
Levelling works and excavations will damage the soil profile, which will
consequently decrease the original zone and lower the ground water level. The soil
characterised by the parameters of different water capacity depending on the
content of organic mafter. Capability to collect and infiltrate rainwater through the
soil is often increased as a consequence of dying and rotting of plant roots. The
construction of the Centrum will cause a decrease of the surface and soil retention,
and a change in the soil chemism, resulting from expansion of the insaturated zone
(aeration zone).
Before the commencement of the construction works, the area where
technical roads, permanent roads, linear elements of technical infrastructure, and
the buildings of the Centrum will be located, a layer of soil, to a depth of 0.5 m,
should be removed and collected in a specially prepared site, so it could be used
later for construction of the new elements of the development (dikes, ditches,
artificial hillocks). The remaining mass of the soil should be disposed in a previously
prepared place, to be used for degradated area reclamation, construction of small
architecture elements in the city or adjacent housing estates (necessary co-
operation with the cities and housing estates self-governments).
To protect the land against the run off of pollution, resulting from the work of
the construction equipment and stored materials, before the works commencement
the access roads, and the technical roads within the Centrum should be properly
prepared. The most accurate and profitable solution would be to built the ultimate
transportation system before any construction works begin.
Significant changes are excepted in the landscape. The scale of planned
objects will totally changed the character of the area. The existing landscape will
transforn to industrial , and will dominate on the agricultural areas. The new
investment development will contrast with allotments, forests and housing estates.
The decrease of landscape values is expected.

The listed above environmental impacts do not unable the implementation of
the investment project because of the character and the range of the environmental
interferences. There is a whole range of possibilities to reduce their negative
impacts. They refer to both phases of the project implementation, which are the
investment realisation, and the functioning. The negative impacts should be
identified and considered when designing the Centrum Handlowe and the necessary
technical and transportation infrastructure. In the table below are listed the degrees
of the environmental threat, and the range of the negative impacts on the
environmental components and spatial development, during various phases of the
investment realisation. From the tabulation may be concluded that the environmental
conditions will be worsening as the investment will be developing according to the
basic variant, however the use of the mitigation means will be more likely.
In relation to the potential negative impacts identified in the area of the
analysis, the following necessary mitigation means have been formulated
(Figure 12):
, It is recommended to close off the view of the investment area from the north,
where the existing and developing housing estate of Osowa is located. This
should be realised by forming an isolation zone, which would be made of a green
dike covered with vegetation layers of many tree lines and decorative bushes.
The introduction of various evergreen species, which would create effective
protection and visual value through the whole year, will be required. This zone
would make, besides its visual function, a barrier against noise and air pollution.
The zone will also connect the green areas of the Tri-city Landscape Park in the
east, and the open arable and recreational lands in the west, located around
Wysockie lake. It is of great importance to start forming the dike and to plant
vegetation at the same time as the investment implementation begins. The
remaining soil from the ground levelling etc., should be used to form the dike.
The green dike will not cause any disharmony in the landscape, since the area of
the investment project is naturally folded. It may even be in a certain way a
continuation of the forest edge of the Tri-city Landscape Park, which covers the
moraine hills. The present open view from Osowa will change its character and
will be sheltered by the green barrier.
* It is recommended to create a green zone in the westem part of the investment,
which would have an aesthetic and isolation value, to separate the Centrum
Hurtowe from the other storage areas.
* In the area adjacent to the Westem Circular road is recommended to introduce
architectural greenery, which would emphasis the existing high aesthetic values
of the landscape. This is important, as the car traffic on the Western Circular road
increases, and this road becomes the ,,indicator" of the Gdat5sk agglomeration.

* The existing tree avenue along Nowy 8wiat street must be protected. It represents
a cultural value (the remains of the historical road), and landscape and
environmental values (the natural connection of the Tri-city Landscape Park with
the open green areas around the Wysockie lake). The investment site
development and the objects arrangement has to be suited to the existing tree lay
out. Where there is more space between the trees, the crossings connecting
separated parts of the Centrum Hurtowe site could be located. Where possible,
new plantings of the same species should be put in.
* There should be more plantings introduced in the existing green zone of trees and
shrubs along the railway track, to develop a visible green border of the investment
in the south.
* The relief, the streams and the ponds in the area IC', and in the area adjacent to
the Centrum Hurtowe in the South should be kept up. The latter renaturalization of
the area should be attempted.
* The zone of the large constructions should not exceed the line pictured in
figure 12.
* It is recommended to prepare a project of land development and greenery
plantings in the site and in the surrounding of the planned road junction in
Owczamia.
* According to the provisions of the land use plans, it is impossible to protect the
existing form of the historical settlement and the road system. Therefore it is
recommended to ,,draw in the new elements of the development in the planned
urban architecture, which at the same time may increase their value, due to the
variety and the original way of spatial design. The new designs should highlight
the general architectural idea of the historical space." The chaotic location of the
new, large buildings should not be allowed.
* The tree lines along the local paths and the railway track should be filled in with
the new plantings of the same species, and the old trees along the avenues
should be entirely protected.
In regards to noise pollution, the best way to protect against it is to decrease
its level at the source. Noise from the installed devices could be limited through the
use of proper technical means (cases, silencers). The transportation noise can be
reduced through the use of the proper protections of the landscape planning, as
artificial screens or the green dikes.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 58
Due to the impacts of the traffic, which is expected to produce air pollution
over the permission limits and noise of a significant level, a number of the
allotments, in the vicinity of the planned ,,Owczamia" road junction should be
liquidated, and instead protection green area should be put in.
From the two types of noise mentioned above, it is easier to reduce the noise
from the installed devices through the possibility of its reduction at the source. Traffic
noise propagation from the larger areas is more difficult to reduce. More effective
seems to be passive protection, used in the points of reception, i.e. near the objects
or directly in the objects, which should be protected.
In the area of the Centrum Hurtowe should be avoided locating of sources of
significant industrial noise, like air-compressors, sets of ventilating condensers, and
high power ventilators. It should be required to locate the sources of any significant
noise in the southem and eastem elevations of the objects. In this way the objects
themselves will act as screening elements in the directions of the existing and
developing housing estate.
Due to the above mentioned reasons the main car traffic flow should be
concentrated in the area between the Westem Circular road and the eastem
boundary of the Centrum Hurtowe site, and should pass around the adjacent streets
of Nowy 8wiat and 8rednicowa. These streets set the borders with the neighbouring
areas of the housing estates in Osowa and Bamiewice Zachodnie.
The access to the centre as well during the construction and operational face
is possible only from the Westem Circular, omitting the housing estate Osowa.
Areas recommended in the project for greenery, tree or shrub areas, or small
architecture, should be developed according to the approved plan, if they are not to
be used during the construction process; this refers particularly to the new forms of
the relief (dikes, artificial hillocks), and introduction of the properly developed green
areas (trees, shrubs). At the same time these areas, after their development, should
be protected against negative impacts of the construction processes.
Before the commencement of the construction work, the health of the avenue
of trees along Nowy 8wiat street should be assessed, and conservation measures
should be worked out. This assessment will be a basis for the formulation of the
recommendations in regard to which species should be applied to develop the zones
of the trees and shrubs in a correct way. The plan of the site development should
contain the locations of the protective zones, lay out of the trees and the bushes with
the specification of their quantitative and qualitative variation. This project of the



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 59
properly developed lay out of the trees and bushes should create a coherent and
mutually supporting system with the green areas within the investment site and the
adjacent ones.
The development of the green areas should consider the directly
neighbouring location of the airport. This issue refers particularly to the height of the
breeding places of birds, which live in flocks (crows, starlings).
12. IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS REQUIRING FURTHER
RESEARCH
The present state of the planning and the development works does not allow
for unequivocal judgement of the many significant problems related to the
environmental impact assessment of the Centrum Hurtowe, and the investments
which are necessary for its functioning. Due to this, during the preparation of the
technical documentation (the construction plan) it is recommended to analyse the
problems mentioned below.
* The way and the conditions of rainwater run off from the Centrum Hurtowe area,
with particular emphasis on the recipients (Strzelenka river, Potok Oliwski).
D Specification of technical solutions for the plant-based rainwater pre-treatment.
a The intensity and range of the environmental impacts of the ,,Owczamia" road
junction and the Westem Circular road, on the garden allotments.
* Problems of the collection, disposal and transportation of the organic waste to the
landfill in Szad6lki, and the prevention of excessive bird foraging.
* Problem of the screening of the planned housing in the Osowa housing estate
adjacent to the northem border of the Centrum Hurtowe.
13. ECONOMICAL ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS
To assess the negative impacts of the Centrum Hurtowe construction and
functioning, there could be applied an approach based on the methods of cost -
benefit analysis. This refers to the benefits, which the environment serves to its
users, and to those who do not use the environment directly, but they are happy for
its existence.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   60
The first group of benefits relates mainly to those users, whose profit making
activities will suffer from the investment project implementation. This will refer to the
following consequences:
* allotment gardens liquidation;
* withdrawal of the arable areas from their present function.
To assess the range of these consequences, the following two methods could
be applied:
* assessment of the restitution costs (purchase of the proper areas, reconstruction
of the investments and the plantings);
* assessment of the production losses (the net loss should be considered, i.e. the
value of the average production/yield, after withdrawal of the costs put in by the
farmers). Additionally, there should be assessed the shortened time of the
farming. To do this the information about foreseen farming use of the arable areas
should be collected from the local spatial development plan. If this was not
specified in the plan, for the allotment gardens it can be assumed a period of 20
years, and for the arable areas 100 years.
The other group of consequences is related to the indirect impacts, or to the
impacts which may arise later. This relates particularly to sewage and solid waste
production, and to air pollution or noise generation. To assess these impacts, the
most accurate method would be the one of prevention costs assessment. These are
mainly investment costs, since the exploitation costs are relatively low in these
cases.
In relation to the majority of investment works standardised price indicators
could be used, being applied in the cost calculations of the engineering and
excavation works. However, the costs cannot be properly estimated without an exact
knowledge of the kind of works. The exploitation costs will mainly comprise
conservation works (1 - 3% of the investment value for every year may be assumed).
The other and more significant will be the cost of organic waste transportation and
disposal. These costs differ enormously within the country.
The other problem arises from the charges form environmental use.
In the cost assessment always appears a problem of limitations or looses of
the non measurable benefits. In this case a method of the polls, in which people
would declare their preferences may be applied. In the polls among the local
residents, they would be asked in particular about the amount of money which they
would be willing to spend to avoid the environmental impacts, or how much they



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  62
In general may be stated that the costs necessary for the investment
implementation, which are directly connected with the environmental protection will
be in total (without stating separately how much costs will be covered by the
Centrum Hurtowe):
* water supply with the waterpipe - phase 1       800,000 PLN
* sanitary sewage discharge with the collector - phase 1    40,000 PLN
* rainwater sewage system in the Centrum
Bamiewice and Osowa housing estates - phase 1  4,000,000 PLN
* protective greenery                             300,000 PLN
* collection and disposal of the solid waste      250,000 PLN
TOTAL                                            5,400,000 PLN
14. PROBLEMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
MANAGEMENT
After the investor obtains the decision on the conditions for the construction
and area development, the planning phase of the Centrum Hurtowe will commence.
This phase is to obtain a building licence. Construction projects like Centrum
Hurtowe must undergo an Environmental impact Assessment, according to the Act
on Protection and Shaping of the Environment, No. 68 item 5.
It is necessary to obtain permits specifying the use of the environment before
a building license is granted. Because the investor is not planning a new water
intake or individual sewage system, a permit for water intake exploitation or sewage
discharge will not be needed from the Voivodship. Water and sewage systems
should fulfil the technical conditions specified by Saur INeptun Gdarsk in the letter
TS/3060412S/bg/95 from 2.11.1995. SNG specify the technical conditions for water
intake, 6 dm3/s (in phase I - 2.32 dm3/s) for social uses and 50 dm3/s for fire
protection, from the 500 mm diameter water main on Wodnika street. In the same
letter SNG specify the conditions for the discharge of sewage. For the first phase,
permission was given for sewage discharge to the existing Osowa - Oliwa collector.
However, ultimately the sewage will be discharged to the planned sewage system
(collector .Morena").



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  63
For the discharge of rainwater (waste water), the investor must obtain a water
supple and sewage effluent disposal consent. This is according to the requirements
of the execution ordinances of the Water Law Act. However, it may be expected that
the conditions which the sewage discharge should comply may be made more
restrictive since it will be discharged to the Strzelenki, located Straszyna drainage
basin.
If the investor decides to produce heat from his own source, in spite of the
solution, it will be necessary to obtain a decision on the permitted emissions to the
atmosphere of the pollution generated from the burning of fuel. It will be also
necessary to carry out a feasibility study on the impact of noise.
The problem of collection, disposal, and utilisation of solid waste from the
Centrum Hurtowe will require special consideration. Because of the origin and
content of the solid waste, it should be collected in a way which separates organic
from other wastes. Organic waste should be composed in the landfill in Szad6tkach.
The other kinds of waste require permission for their disposal. Organic waste should
only be disposed of in the landfill in Szad6kach.
To guarantee the proper environmental management, it will be necessary to
have an environmental management specialist. This will ensure the proper and
effective functioning of the Centrum Hurtowe.
This specialist should continuously control the investment functioning (land
management, parking, cleaning, disposal, sorting and waste removal, facilities
exploitation, etc.).
Of particular importance will be the proper fulfilling of the aesthetic demands
in the land development of the site and the closest surroundings. It is especially
important since the investment is located in the protection zone of the Tr-city
Landscape Park, and in an area of high cultural and natural value.
The existing vegetation should be kept and enriched, especially maple, ash,
and lime trees in the avenues, the rush areas around the ponds, and the trees alone
the railway track. Planting of new plants should take place as early as possible in
the investment implementation. Domestic species should be planted to guarantee
fast and effective growth, and the fast achievement of the ultimate planned state.
The program of landscape management, because of the environmental and
cultural conditions (Tri-city Landscape Park and its protection zone, historical roads
and settlements, natural landscape), should include not only the internal area of the



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                  64
investment, but the surroundings, especially in the eastem part. It should comprise
the entire area of the Owczamia road junction and the area of the historical farm and
foresters house in Owczamia, to enable the proper spatial management of the visual
impact of the protected objects.
The first years of planting - minimum three years (filling the gaps in the
present landscape as well as new areas) - should have a guarantee from the
company doing the planting. The guarantee should include the standard activities,
such as planting, watering, weeding, fertilising, pest control, pruning, and, if
necessary, replacement of plants.
There should be a regular overview of the state of the landscaping, including
the health of the plants, to detect any problems, plant diseases or damage at an
early stage.
The landscaping program should comprise layout and cultivation of trees,
hedges, and lawns, and management of the ponds.
Lawns. It is forbidden to artificially fertilise and use pesticides on the
designed lawns, to prevent possible pollution of surface and ground water, since the
investment site is located in the protection zone of the water intake in Straszyn and
on the boarder of the Main Ground Water Reservoir.
It is allowed to use herbicides, however it should be restricted to a minimum.
Trees. All trees should be regularly checked. Cultivation activities and, if
necessary, immediate activities should be carried out on a regular basis.
Shrubbery. Proper species variety, which supports the functioning of the plant
community of antropogenic origin and which raises the aesthetic value of the
investment property, should be ensured. Periodic pruning should take place.
However, this should be done outside bird breeding and nesting periods.
Hedges. They should be regularly pruned, but, again, outside of bird breeding
and nesting times. It is not recommended to use chemical sprays on the hedges.
Ponds. The quality of water should be monitored. It is recommended to treat
them mechanically, not chemically. Not more than 50% of pond banks should be
accessible to the workers and clients, and a minimum of 50% should not be
accessible, but left as an ecological reserve. The accessible part can be partly
managed and the grass can be regularly cut. Fishing and bathing are not allowed.



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 65
Landscaping should play a hydrosanitary role, to exclude pollution runoff to
the water.
The protection of the landscaping attractiveness should be parallel to the
economic activities. The following basic elements of the landscape view should be
shaped:
* foreground of the settlement area of Owczamia
* the view axis (e.g. Nowy 8wiat street)
* characteristic landscape elements (old trees, forest fronts and tree lines, and
ponds).
Transportation Infrastructure. It is assumed that the layout and construction of
the roads should comply with the high demands of the European Union. They should
be kept clean and tidy, and the ice and possible pollution should be removed.
Trainings. The program  of Centrum  workers training should include
environmental protection issues, especially the disposal, reuse, and removal of the
solid waste and the water and sewage service. The trainings should be on-going.
The area of the Centrum should be properly managed and clearly signed to create
conditions for proecological activities, including water and energy use, and to make
environmental protection easier for the workers (readable signs on the containers to
ensure the correct sorting of waste and the proper directions of transportation).
The proper standard of the facilities should be kept.
It is recommended to integrate the Centrum management system with one of
the approved environmental management systems, for example British Standard
7750, EU management Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), or
the series of ISO 14000.
In the description above, the focus was on selected problems of
environmental management which seem to be crucial in the Centrum. However, if
the Board of the Centrum Hurtowe decides to introduce one of the environmental
management systems, they should act according to the requirements of the chosen
standard, and identify and solve problems according to the procedures
recommended in those standards.

15. MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
Monitoring will be required for the quality of the rainwater discharged to the
reservoir (Strzelenka river), ground water and noise.
Monitoring of water drained off of the area of the Centrum Hurtowe to the
Straszyn drainage basin should be carried out continuously. After a detailed
geological study, a local monitoring project of ground water, to approximately the
depth of 20 meters, should be made (to the water table).
Checking measurements of noise sources should be carried out at the
beginning of the implementation of the investment, to check the compliance with the
recommendations formulated in the technical project preparation phase.
Checking measurements of the road noise at the level of the closest housing,
particularly during the night, should be made. These measurements should be made
after or during the beginning of the investment phases.
Continuous monitoring is not necessary. The measurements should be done
by environmental protection services.
16. COURSE OF THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS
The course of the social consultancy process, described below, is related to
the procedure of doing the local land use plan for the district of Bamiewice-
Owczamia, within which is located the site of the proposed Centrum Hurtowe, and
the adjacent housing estate of Osowa. Information about the planned construction of
the Centrum Hurtowe was the subject of many press publication and radio and TV
news. Due to this information, the local community and the people of Gdarnsk obtain
general knowledge about the character and scale of the planned investment. At the
same time, documents, delivered to the local govemments of the city of Gdanisk and
administrative authorities, allowed for the development ol the various aspects of the
implementation and functioning of the Centrum. This referred to the conditions of
land functions, and especially the transportation service, water and energy supply,
and sewage discharge.
The idea of the investment implementation met approval of business circles
and other social groups. At the same time, groups of local people expressed their
concems about worsen environmental conditions, lifestyles and recreation. These



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                   67
were firstly residents of the housing estate Osowa, who are afraid of the
implementation and functioning of the Centrum will considerably raise transportation
impacts of the road system in this district, which is expected to be reconstructed. On
this matter the citizens of Osowa and the authorities of the Akademicka housing
collective were applying to the Municipality and City Council of Gdansk. The
statement expressed by the citizens finds its substantiation in the record related to
the transportation solutions in the present local detailed plan of spatial development
of the Osowa district. However, this record does not mean automatically that the
traffic of the vehicles serving the Centrum will be directed to the newly planned
transportation system. This statement is based on the acceptance by the DODP and
investor, that the implementation of the junction in the Westem Circular road is built
prior to the implementation of the Centrum. This road junction should guarantee the
full service of the Centrum, by-passing the housing area, in particular the intemal
roads of the housing estate.
The other social group expressing their concem over the implementation of
the Centrum Hurtowe, or rather the road junction Owczarnia, is the users of the
allotment gardens. Depending on the accepted technical solution of this junction, it
wvill be necessary to liquidate up to several dozen allotments, however, in the vicinity
of the junction, the conditions for recreation will worsen significantly, which will
consequently lead to the further liquidation of the remaining allotments.
Other issues were raised by the administrative authorities of the city of
Gdafisk, which related to the water and sewage services. The subject of their
interest is the protection of the surface water (water intake for the city of Gdafisk, in
Straszyn), ground water (intakes ,,Osowa" and ,Dolina RadosciD) and nature and
landscape protection (Tri-city Landscape Park).
17. CONCLUSIONS
1. The planned investment of the Pomorskie Hurtowe Centrum Rolno-Spozycze
S.A., in Gdarisk Bamiewice, is completely reasonable due to existing or foreseen
trade in foodstuff in the region of Gdah'sk and in the cross-boarder markets and
the markets of neighbouring countries. The two phases of the Centrum
implementation are correct for the infrastructural conditions.
2. The location of the planned Centrum Hurtowe is very beneficial according to the
planned functions. It has a good location in relation to the food supply and retail
markets. It is located directly by the Westem Circular road, a railway line, and



PROEKO Sp. z o.o.                                                 68
near by the R§biechowo airport, and the Gdynia and Gdansk harbours, therefore
it has very good accessibility to transportation.
3. The Centrum Hurtowe site does not cause any significant problems or threats to
the environment or with existing or planned land development, besides the
necessity of protecting the trees along the Nowy twiat street. It is an arable area
practically without investment. Soils within the area are of a low quality.
4. The area adjacent to the planned Centrum site and surrounding areas have
complex environmental and natural conditions, which relate to the Centrum
location:
* in the protection zone of the Tri-city Landscape Park;
* on the edge of the protection zone of the water intake ,Straszyn";
*   within resource area of the ground water intake ,,Osowa";
3 on the boarder of the area of the Main Reservoir of Ground Water No. 113;
X In the area of the region natural system, which is an element of the planned
nation-wide ecological network ECONET;
* nearby the Osowa district, which is developing in the direction of the future
Centrum;
3 nearby existing garden allotments.
5. The commencement of the Centrum Hurtowe will require the prior construction of
the transportation infrastructure (road junction ,,Owczamia") together with the
system of access roads, water, gas and energy supple, and the discharge of
sanitary sewage and rainwater.
6. Environmental impacts related to the implementation and operation phases of
the Centrum Hurtowe will vary. The most important impact of the construction
phase will be the exclusion of more then 50 hectares of soil from arable
cultivation, and the liquidation of a large number of allotments. There will be
significant and irreversible changes in the landscape. It will change its character
from the rural to the industrial. Impact on the other elements will be smaller and
of less influence. A threat may be caused by the change of the historical
foregrounds of the historical settlements in Owczamia (the farm and the
forester's house). This causes the necessity of the particularly careful planning of
the architecture and greenery of the new junction road.
Impacts of the operation phase will be more serious. Significant changes in
water conditions in a large area, and impacts on a section of the Tr6jmiejski
Landscape Park, in the forms of air quality and the acoustic climate should be

considered. Also the present recreational value of many allotments, located near
the,,Owczarnia" junction, will be lost.
A gradual increase, of the conflict between the planned Centrum Hurtowe, and
the nearby housing development of Osowa, should be also considered.
Impacts on the water resources of the ground water intake ,Osowa" is not
expected.
7. The location of the Centrum Hurtowe in the direct neighbourhood of the
Tr6jmiejski Landscape Park and the housing area of Osowa estate, in the
protection zone of the surface water intake ,,Straszyn', within the resource area
of the groundwater intake ,Osowa", and in the neighbourhood of the allotment
area, requires the use of special mitigation means against the impacts of
implementation and operation phases of the Centrum Hurtowe. There should be
foreseen:
* the proper placement of the investment objects in the present landscape;
* isolation of the investment from the surrounding area, in the form of the
properfy shaped area (the dike) and the greenery of high density and
continuous character,
- use of the technical systems and means to prevent soil and water pollution;
* isolation and disposal of the solid waste from the Centrum to the landfill in
Szad6ki.
8. The area of the Centrum Hurtowe is located outside the zones of impact on the
closest ground water intake ,Osowa" and ,Dolina Radosci". However since it is
located within the resource area of the ,Osowa" intake, technical solutions for
waste water management should be considered. Due to the present study, it may
be stated that the planned Centrum will not have a negative impact on the
ground water resources.
9. The restrictions which are due to the protection of the cultural environment,
natural rural landscape, and close proximity of the investment to the historical
farm and the foresters house in Owczamia, put a high aesthetic demand on
investment area management, and the management of its surrounding and
particular objects. Due to the existence of the identified archaeological site, the
prior immediate archaeological research should be begun.
10. Implementation of the Centrum Hurtowe, especially during the first phase (the
food stuffs, vegetable and fruit, and flowers halls) will not cause any threats to
peoples health, however, it will improve to a great degree sanitary conditions of
the present wholesale trade of the food products.

11. Because of the proximity of the airport in RQbiechowo, and a danger which birds
might cause to air traffic, it is necessary to develop an entirely safe solution for
the waste collection in the Centrum, and disposal to the dump in Szad6lki. The
solutions proposed by the designers of collecting and temporary disposal of
waste exclusively in containers and the system of their removal and
transportation will eliminate the threats caused by the foraging and flying birds.
12. The emergencies may occur in the case of fire or the breakdown of the cooling
facilities containing ammonia. Since the stands will be equipped with individual
cooling felicities, even if the entire content of ammonia were to be released from
such an installation, it will not cause any environmental emergency.
13. During implementation of the Centrum Hurtowe the existing greenery should be
filled in, particularly the trees along the historical roads, and trees and shrubs
along the railway track.
14. In the course of more specific research and analysis, the range of suprastandard
impacts on the allotments around the ,,Owczamia" junction should be defined,
and the specified number of allotments should be realised for other land
functions. The remaining allotments should be surrounded by a green isolation
zone.
15. Because of the high protection requirements of the water intake in Straszyn,
there should be conducted a continual monitoring of the rainwater quality,
discharged from the area of Centrum Hurtowe to the Strzelenka river.

PROTOKOL
ze spotkania w dniu 11.12.1995 r. w sprawie lokalizacji
Pomorskiego Hurtowego Centrum Rolno-Spozywczego
w Gdansku-Barniewicach
Spotkanie otworzyla mgr B. Szczerbowska - Kierownik Referatu Studi6w i Plan6w
Rozwoju Przestrzennego Wydzialu Planowania Przestrzennego Urzndu Miejskiego
w Gdansku, w kt6rym opracowywany jest plan miejscowy rejonu Gdan'sk_Barniewice.
Nast,pnie wystqpila autor planu - gl6wny projektant mgr inz.arch. W.Boguslawska,
kt6ra zreferowala krotko podstawowe problemy, ktore wylonily si, przy opracowaniu
koncepcji planu i prosila zebranych o zajecie stanowiska.
Prezes Pomorskiego Hurtowego Centrum Rolno-Spozywczego scharakteryzowal
stan zaawansowania inwestycji Centrum oraz stanwIasnosci terenu kt6ry zostal
zakupiony od Agencji Wlasnosci Rolnej Skarbu Pa6stwa.
Podkreslil takze potrzebe rozwiqzania kwestii infrastruktury i obslugi komunikacyjnej,
kolejowej i drogowej dla rynku hurtowego i Barniewic w og6le - koniecznosc realizacji
kolektora ,,Morena" oraz polqczezi z obwodnicq Trojmiasta.
Prezes Centrum Hurtu zuwazyl takze, ze na inwestycje przeznaczone sq kredyty
z Banku Swiatowego i istnieje potrzeba pilnego wykonania planu, kt6ry b,dzie
podstawq prawnq dla decyzji inwestycyjnych.
inz. W Boguslawska podkreslila, ze teren b,dacy obecnie wlasnosciq gieldy
przeznaczony jest w planie og6lnym zagospodarowania przestrzennego m. Gdaniska
pod rezerwV terenu dla kolei.
Nastqpnie glos zabral A. Staszkiewicz - przedstawiciel Pln. DOKP - Biura Inwestycji
Techniki i Rozwoju, kt6ry scharakteryzowal potrzeby kolei. Podkreslil, ie lokalizacja
budowy planowanej stacji ladunkowej w rejonie Barniewic jest optymalna dla potrzeb
kolei. PKP nie ma w planie inwestycyjnym budowy ladowni w najblizszym czasie
jednak w planach nalezy rezerwowac tereny pod takq inwestycj,.
Docelowo wybudowanie stacji ladunkowej zwolni tereny obecnie istniejqcych stacji
w Sr6dmiesciu Gdafiska dla innych funkcji oraz odciq:zy frednicowq Gdafisk-Gdynia.
Z uwagi na koncepcj, lokalizacji Centrum Hurtu Spoiywczego w Barniewicach, PKP
nie wyklucza moiliwosci alternatywnej lokalizacji stacji ladunkowej-w rejonie Klukowa,
kt6ra jest dobra pod wzglIcdem kolejowym, jednak mniej korzystna z punktu widzenia
transportu drogowego z wyladowni.
W dalszej czqeci dyskusji zgloszono nastepujqce uwagi:
- ini. J. G6ra - Wydzial Komunikacji U.W - zastfpcze lokalizacje terenu nowej ladowni
kolejowej dia m. Gdanska sq moiliwe do rozwiqzania i nalezy je rozpatrywac w
powiqzaniu z ukladem drogowym tj. trasq W-Z, trasq Slowackiego, ktore sq
w najbliiszych planach realizacyjnych.

INFORMACJA
w sprawie termin6w i zakresu realizacji
ulicy Kozioroica w Gdansku-Osowej.
W odpowiedzi na pismo Akademickiej Sp6ldzielni Mieszkaniowej L.dz. ASMI250/96
z dn. 15.03.1996r. Wydzial Inwestycji Miasta informuje, ze zgodnie z ustaleniami
"Planu zamierzeni inwestycyjnych miasta Gdafiska na lata 1996-98 w zakresie
inwestycji wiasnych", oraz zatwierdzonym budzetem miasta Gdafiska na 1996r,
rozpoczal przygotowania realizacji ulicy Koziorozca w Gdafnsku-Osowej.
Wychodzac naprzeciw postulatom mieszkanic6w skarzatcych sie na uciazliwosci
komunikacyjne, wywolywane wzmozonym ruchem samochodowym, ktWry z
konieczno§ci, ze wzgledu na brak odpowiednich tras ukladu og6lnomiejskiego, obci#za
niedostosowane do tego celu, wewnetrzne uliczki osiedlowe, przyspieszono
rozpoczecie realizacji zbiorczej trasy §rednicowej.
Planowana w latach 1996/97 inwestycja, zgodna z ustaleniami obowiazujacego
"Miejscowego szczeg6lowego planu zagospodarowania przestrzennego dzie}nicy
Osowa" obejmowac bedzie pierwszy odcinek ulicy o dl. 600 m, o przekroju
jednojezdniowym od skryzow. z ul.Kielnieiska do skrzyzow. z ul.Afrodyty i
Jednorozca Zakres rob6t obejmuje realizacje ulicy, chodnik6w, o§wietlemna oraz
niezbednego uzbrojenia podziemnego.
Oddarue do uzytku w/w fragmentu trasy umozliwi dogodny dojazd w glab dzielnicy
oraz na tereny przysz1osciowej zabudowy, z pominieciem dotychczas
wykorzystywanych wewnetrznych ulic osiedla (gl6wnie ul.Soldka).
Przygotowanie i realizacje inwestycji w ramach posrednictwa inwestycyjnego
prowadzi Dyrekcja Rozbudowy Miasta Gdariska.
Jednoczesnie informujemy, ze planowana budowa Pomorskiego Centrum Handlu
Hurtowego w Barniewicach, realizowana bedzie kompleksowo, lacznie z wykonaniem
niezbe,dnego ukladu drogowego. Zasadnicze powiazanie zespolu obiekt6w z
podstawowym ukladem drogowym projektuje sie poprzez bezposrednie wlatczenie do
Obwodowej Zachodniej z wykorzystaniem istniej4cego wiaduktu nad Obwodowa
Zachodniq (w ciagu Owczarnia-Barniewice) oraz odpowiednia rozbudowe
towarzyszacego wezla i ukladu drogowego.

Uprzejmie informuje, ze miedzynarodowe organizacje lotnicze coraz czesciej zwracaja
agv na zagrozenie zderzen statkow powietrznych z ptakani. W Polsce w ostatnich latach
Sa miejsce w skali rocznej okolo 30 - 40 zderzefi z ptakami. Statystyki lotnicze wykazuja
oczny wzrost tego zjawiska. Z doswiadczei minidzynarodowych i krajowych wynika, ze
iska odpadow komunalnych stanowia miejsca ierowisk ptakow zazwyczaj o duzej
oncentracji i w przypadku loaklizacji ich w sqsiedztwie lotnisk, a zwlaszcza na przediu±eniu
drogi startowej, powodujg, szczeg6lne zagrozenie dla bezpieczefistwa lot6w.
Zgodnie z zaleceniami rniedzynarodyi, pzewidzianyi do wprowadzenia iako
/wylaczne ±r6dio przepisow obowiq~zujacych w Unii Europejskij p uje sit, ze wysypiska
odpad6w komunalnych stanowii, potencjalne zagrozenie dla lotnictwa, jezeli sa zlokaliowane
w franicach do ok. 8 km od koica drogi startowej wzdhi±jej osi lub do ok. 3 km z boku drogi
staitowej. Prowadzone badania wykazaly, ze w przypadku lokalizacji wysypisk w podanych
odlegtosciach, -6yi-one czynnildem  iicznych wypadk6w  lotaiczych, spowodowanych
zderzeniari statk6w powietrznych z ptakami, z kt6rych czesc pociagne}a za soba nawet utrate
Zycia. Z drugicj strony og6lnie uznaje sie, ze aktywnosc ptakow w podanym przedziale
odlegiosci, jest bardzo niepo±zdana, gdyz wiVe sie on z wykonaniem najbardziej trudnej
operacji lotniczej - podejscia do ladowania i startu samolotu.
Z do§wiadczefi krajowych wiadomym jest, ze opr6cz ptak6w ±erujqcych n-a
wysypiskach odpad6w komunalnych, zlokalizowanych w sMsiedztwie lotniska, drugie powazne
zagrozenie dla ruchu lotniczego stanowia, hodowle goIebi w strefach przylotniskowych.
W ostatnim czasie obserwuje sie liczne przypadki lokalizowania wysypisk odpad6w
komunalunych w ns                       . W zwiazku z tymn przedstawiajac powyzej

Perseusza, Biwakowej, Koziorozca, Afrodyty, Daru Pomorza, Otag  i terenow do
przyleglych w Osowie, ponawiamy kategoryczny protest przeciwko               w
bezposrednim sasiedztwie naszych dom6w trasy, majacej przebiega6 od polaczenia wqzla
drogowego Wysoka z ulic, Kielnieiska, obok zabudowy ulic Smugowej i Szafera, ku
dzisiejszej ulicy Kozioroica i dalej, na poludnie, ku tzw. dzielnicy przemyslowej Osowy.
Niezaleinie od termin6w, jakimi trasa ta jest okre§1ana przez planist6w i nazywana w
korespondencji urzedowej, ma to by6 w kazdym razie ulica o dw6ch jezdniach (majacych po
2 pasy ruchu) i szerokosci 40 m.
2. Wspomnianq trasq przewidywano pierwotnie (tj. w latach osiemdziesiatych) w odleglosci
kilkuset metr6w od lokalizacji planowanej obecnie, w rejonie dzisiejszej ulicy Wodnika.
Trasa ta miala wykorzystywac istniejqcy tam dawny ciag drogi polnej i starego nasypu
kolejowego. Taki jej przebieg nie kolidowal w6wczas z istniejqcq w owym rejonie zabudowa,
gdy± trasa przechodzilaby w bezpiecznej (w sensie mozliwosci zapewnienia niezbednego
pasa ochronnego) odleglosci od budynk6w sp6ldzielni mieszkaniowej im. Obronic6w
Wybrzeza, nie stanowiqc tez zagrozenia dla nielicznych w tym miejscu mieszkanc6w ulicy
Perseusza.
3. Tymczasem, miino dokonanej przez LWSM "Osowa", zgodnie z planami realizacyjnymi,
zabudowy tzw. jednostki A, trase, o kt6rej mowa, zaczqto rozwaza6 w ukkadzie
wariantowym, stopniowo spychajac j, ku wybudowanemu juz osiedlu tej sp6dzielni, a
oddalajqc od budynk6w sp6ldzielni im. Obronic6w Wybrzeza Zaniepokojenie mieszkanic6w
LWSM "Osowa", kt6rzy wybierali miejsce zamieszkania kierujac sie tre§cia pierwotnych
zalozeni plan6w zagospodarowania przestrzennego nie przewidujqcych budowy w tym
miejscu ruchliwego ciagu komunikacyjnego, wyrazilo sie w ich wystqpieniach zar6wno do
sp6ldzielni, jak i do Urzedu Mic'skiego w Gdafisku (Wydzial Urbanistyki, Architektury i
Nadzoru Budowlanego). Nie spotkalo sie ono jednak z iadnq, odpowiedziq ze strony tego
ostatniego. Uporowi mieszkanic6w "Osowy", kt6rzy zwr6cili siq ostatecznie bezposrednio do
Rady Miasta, zawdziecza6 nalezy, ze dokonala ona, z udziakem jej przewodniczacego, wizji
lokalnej jesieniq 1990 roku. Absurdalnosc zalozefi projektowych najwidoczniej sprawi}a na
radnych wrazenie, skoro efektem wspomnianej wizji byla obietnica odstapienia od
(lansowanego juz w6wczas jako jedynie shuszny) przebiegu drogi wzdluz granic jednostki A i
wstrzyrmania zamierzonych przez sp6ldzielniq im. Obronic6w Wybrzeza prac budowlanych w
rejonie ulicy Wodnika.                                      wye. .'ein.aj^    mn;

statycznie wyznaczalnych, czegciej rozdylatowanych i z odpowiednia, stolarka, okienna Za
masywne i odpome na wstrz4sy i halas trudno zreszta. umac kt6rekolwiek  z dom6w
polozonych przy planowanej trasie.
8. Jestesmy swiadomi potrzeby istnienia w osiedlach mieszkaniowych ulic, shz±qcych
potrzebom lokalnej zbiorowoici. Jest jednak rzeczq dla nas oczywista., ze w przypadku
tworzenia nowychjednostek osadniczych najpierw wytycza siq ciagi komunikacyjne, a potem
podejmuje decyzje o zabudowie. Postepowanie odwrotne, kt6rego jestesmy az nazbyt
czynnymi swiadkami, oznacza pogarde nie tylko dla sztuld planowania urbanistycznego i
interes6w tych, kt6rym to planowanie formalnie shiy, ale i dla zdrowego rozsa.dku.
5.  Nie widzac powod6w, dla kt6rych miellby!my, jako zbiorowosc, ponosic skutli gier
interes6w w poprzednich w}adzach miasta i godzic siq z efektami urzedniczej indolencji,
protestujemy przeciwko dalszernu forsowaniu plan6w budowy zagrazajqcej nam trasy.
Wzywamy Radq Miasta Gdaxiska do podjecia krok6w, maja.cych na celu zaniechanie
wszelkich dzialafi zmierzajqcych ku budowie drogi, o kt6rej mowa, podjqcia zas prac
zmierzaja,cych do szukania nowych rozwiazaii komunikacyjnych; chqtnie podpowiemy idee,
kt6re nam  sie nasuwaja,. Zapraszamy jednoczesnie  przedstawicieli Rady Miasta do
odwiedzenia miejsca, kt6rego dotyczy nasz protest. Wierzymy, ze jedynym efektem takiej
wizji moze by6 uznanie naszych racji i odrzucenie pomysl6w, oznaczajqcych istotne
zagrozenie dla setek mieszkanic6w Osowy. Protestujemy w imieniu naszym i wszystkich,
kt6rych dotknq6 musialaby trasa intensywnego ruchu, poprowadzona wedlug nonsensownych
zalozefi.

UKIAD KOMUNIKACY.JNY DZIELNICY GDANSK-OSOWA
PYTANIA I W4TPLrWOSCI
Podstawowe za}ozenia dotyczqce ukladu komunikacji regionu gdaniskiego zostaly
sformulowane w latach 70-tych i zakladaly rozw6j miasta i przemyshu w kierunku Tczewa.
Zycie zweryfikowalo te zalozenia i rozw6j przedsiebiorczosci wykazuje najwiqkszq
dynamikq w  kiernk   ZUOWA, KARTUZ, KOSCIERZYNY  i WEJ-EROWA.
Czy zalo±enia ukladu komunikacyjnego uwzglvdniajav te zmiany?
Jak si9 to ma w nawikzaniu do planowanej budowy drogi srednicowej (4 pasma ruchu),
r6wnoleglej do obwodnicy, przy r6wnoczesaym braku odciazenia ulic Spacerowej
i Kielniefiskiej ?
Jedynga droga lacz4ck osiedle OSOWA z OLIWA jest ul. Kielniefiska i Spacerowa o bardzo
duzym natvzeniu ruchu z tendencja dalszego wzrostu.
Kazda wiqksza kolizja na tej trasie, zwalone drzewo, naprawa drogi, pozar - a wszystkie
takie wydarzenia mialy juz miejsce - powodujq paraliz komunikacyjny i mogq zmaczqco
op6im6 dojazd strazy pozarnej, pogotowia itp. shkub do dzielnicy Osowa.
Znane sq powszechnie trudnosci komunikacyjne na ulicy Kielniefiskiej (a szczeg6luie
w okresie letnich weekend6w) i w wypadku kolizji na tej ulicy brak moziiwosci objazd6w
uliczkami osiedlowymi.
Czy planowany uklad komumikacyjny, r6wnolegly do obwodnicy, w jakikolwiek spos6b
pomoze rozwiaza6 te ucikiliwogci ?
3. Przebieg drogi srednicowej w saqsiedztwie granic osiedla LWSM ,,OSOWA" - jedn. ,.A" nie
byl oznaczony ani nawet zasygnalizowany przez wladze miejskie zar6wno w informacji
o terenie jak i w decy2ji lokalizacyjnej dla tego osiedla. Zaprojektowane i zrealizowane
budynki mieszkalne przy ul. Smugowej, Szafera i Niedzialkowskiego. kt6re obecnie
znalazly siev w bezposrednim sqsiedztwie projektowanej drogi §rednicowej, stanowi4
zabudowQ szeregowa, w postaci wieloprzqslowych, 2-kondygnacyjnych ram zelbetowych,
nieodpornych na wstrzqsy i halas.



I



W przedstawionej sytuacji rodz; siq pytania:
* Czy przy ustalaniu trasy drogi srednicowej analizowano warunki gruntowe pod katem
podatnogci na przenoszenie wstzqs6w komunikacyinych ?
Czy w analizie techniczno-ekonomicznej dla projektowanej trasy przewidziano niezbedne
naklady na zabezpieczenie w/w budynk6w przed tymi uciazliwo9ciamr  niezalezule od
koszt6w budowy ewentualnych ekran6w akustycznych ?
Uprzedzamy, ze mieszkancy zastrzegajq sobie prawo do dochodzenia roszczeni z tytulu
istotnego ograniczenia korzystania z nieruchomosci
4. Urzad Miejski po wydaniu lokalizacji i pozwolefi na budowv dla LWSM  ,,OSOWA",
w  latach nastqpnych wydal nastepne lokalizacje przy uL Kozioroica dla kolejnych
inwestor6w: Sp-ni Akademickiej, ,,Nasz Dom", Towarzystwa Ziemsldiego oraz innych.
* Dlaczego nie zapewniono dojazd6w na okres realizacji w/w osieda  a caly ruch i dow6z
material6w budowlanych odbywa sie uliczkarai lokalnymi Soldka i Niedzialkowskdego ?
5. Projektowana droga srednicowa (o max3 wlaczeniach ulic osiedlowych na I km)
w niewielkim stopniu obshluy mieszkafic6w osiedla, natomiast z calq, pewnosci, bedzie
shkiyla dla przeprowadzenia ruchu tranzytowego przez osiedle do gieldy towarowej,
lotniska i teren6w przemyslowych.
Rodzq sie kolejne pytania:
* Czy interesy lobby przemyslowego muszA by6 osiqgni*te kosztem mieszkanic6w ?
* Czy przeprowadzono analize innych, mniej kolizyjnych rozwiezan, po terenie dotychczas
nie zabudowanym ?

s4siedniej    zabudowy   mieszkaniowej.   Powstanie   gieldy   i
skomunikowanie jej z u1ic, lrednicow4 zmienia zasadniczo warunki
wyjtciowe okretlone przy sporz4dzaniu planu Osowej, wnioskujemy
wiQc o sporz4dzenie prognozy skutk6w wplywu ustalert miejscowego
planu zagospodarowania przestrzennego na trodowisko przyrodnicze
z   uwzglednieniem   tej   nowej   sytuacji   (  na   podstawie
Rozporz4dzenia Ministra Ochrony Srodowiska, Zasob6w Naturalnych
i Letnictwa z dnia 9 marca 1995r, Dz.U. nr 29, poz.150) i na jej
podstawie zmiane lokalizacji drogi szybkiego ruchu a takze takie
rozwi4zanie   komunikacji  w  Osowej,  aby  wykluczyd  motliwo6t
skomunikowania   gieldy  i  lotniska  w  Rebiechowie  z ulicami
przechodz4cymi przez zabudowe mieszkaniow4 lub w jej bliskim
s4siedztwie.
Ponadto stwierdzamy, te droga 6rednicowa zostala zaprojektowana
niezgodnie z przepisami obowi4zuj4cymi w momencie zatwierdzania
planu   miejscowego   (Rozporz4dzenie   Ministra  Administracji,
Gospodarki Terenowej i Ochrony grodowiska z dnia 3 lipca 1980 r
w   sprawie  warunkcw  technicznych,  jakim  powinny  odpowiadac
budynki), okreslajacymi minimaln4 odleglo6d budynk6w od drogi
tej klasy na 40-80 m. Odleglotc ta nie zostala zachowana.
Aktualnie   odleglotc  miedzy  istniej4cymi  i  nowopowstaj,cymi
budynkami mieszkalnymi, miedzy kt6rymi ma przebiegat 4-pasmowa
droga   nie   przekracza   55  m,  wiec  nie  mote  byc  mowy  o
jakichkolwiek strefach ochrony.
Obecnie   obowi4zuj4ce  przepisy  nakladaj4  na  projektant6w  i
planistow    uwzglednianie  w  swoich  pracach  wymog6w  ochrony
6rodowiska, w tym ochrony przed halasem i spalinami. Przy takim
zblizeniu ulicy do istniej4cej zabudowy mieszkaniowej nie ma
technicznych motliwotci na wyeliminowanie negatywnych skutk6w
drogi.

191



3.2. Przyjmuje sie dla okresu perspektywy ograniczenie rozbudowy mieszkalnictwa
w Osowej Barniewicach do 15 tys. mieszkanic6w.
Pozostale ok. 10 tys. bedzie moglo byc realizowane po budowie polqczenia
kanalizacji z kolektorem ,,Morena" w Kokoszkach, rozwi4zania problemu ciepla
poprzez budowe centralnego ir6dla i zapewnienie innych nosnik6w np. gazu
ziemnego, oraz rozbudowy systemu komunikacji miejskiej, kt6ra bylaby w

W planach tych wystepujq r6wniez tereny uslug og6lnomiejskich.
We wsi Klukowo przewiduje sie adaptacjQ zabudowy wzdluz ulicy Radarowej
poza strefami uci4aziwosci lotniska, z ewentualn4 moiliwokci4 tworzenia
siedlisk ogrodniczych na terenach pomiedzy bocznica kolejowa i obwodnic4.
Przewiduje sie niewielki rozw6j funkcji mieszkaniowej (mala jednostka
mieszkaniowa)   miedzy   innymi   poprzez   przemieszczenie   ludzi
wykwaterowanych w zwi4zku z rozbudowa4 lotniska.
5. Funkcje og61nomiejskie.
a) Tereny rekreacji i wypoczynku.
Na terenie jednostki i jej obrzzezu (gmina Zukowo, miasto Gdynia) znajdujq

Tr6jmiejskiego Parku,
-  teren Tr6jmiejskiego Parku Krajobrazowego
b) na obszarze pomiQdzy wsiami Kukowo i RQbiechowo projektuje sie nowy
cmentarz komunalny dila miasta Gdaf±ska wraz z terenami
zabezpieczajqcymi uslugi i parkingi dla cmentarza.
192



Istnieje r6wniez morliwoi6 realizacji cmentarza projektowanego w dzielnicy
Gdynia Zach6d.
c) Po zachodniej stronie jeziora Wysockiego na terenie gminy Zukowo rezer-
wuje sie obszar przeznaczony na funkcje uslug i zarzadzania (w tym uslug
zdrowia i nauki) w skali aglomeracji, z uwagi na polozenie terenu centralnie
w stosunku do zainteresowani zar6wno miast Gdaiiska i Gdyni i planowane
w okresie kierunkowym powiazanie teren6w wysoc zyzny SKM.
6. Przemysl, Bazy, Sklady, RzemiosloFp-roedule5nel -sel4tdewej
Przewiduje sie dalsza rozbudowe dzielnicy Osowa-Barniewice - zaklcadaja,c funk-
cje obslugi miasta i aglomeracji w dziedzinie baz, sklad6w, przemyslu drobnego,
nieuciazliwego i rzemiosla.
Pomiivdzy projektowanym cmentarzem, bocznica kolejowa, i ul. Slowackiego, we
wsi Kluk-owo projektuje sie rezerwe terenu na sklady konsygnacyjne, strefe wol-
noclow4, zaplecze magazynowe i uslugi zwiazane z lotniskiem w Rebiechowie.
Zwiazana z tymi rejonami jest projektowana budowa dw6ch ladowni kolejowych
w Barniewicach i Klukowie.
7. Ochrona srodowiska i zielen'.
Projektowany cmentarz w Klukowie oraz obszary p6l i lak zachowanych w gra-
nicach Strefy Raduni i strefy uje6 wody tworza obszar ekologicznego powiazania
Tr6jrniejskiego Parku Krajobrazowego w rejonie Owczarni z ternami otwartymni
w gminie Zukowo.
Teren ten, jak r6wniez bezpo§rednio przylegly do Tr6jrniejskiego Parku Krajobra-
zowego teren Owczarni winny byc chronione przed zainwestowaniem, dopuszcza
sie urzadzenie zwiazane z rekreacja.
Poza tym plan zakl;ada:
- budowe kotlowni rejonowej w Barniewicach, aby wylaczyc cz,sc kotlowni
lokalnych -  wskazalie jest ponadto wprowadzenie do zabudowy jednoro-
dzinnej ogrzewania gazem,
- pelne skanalizowanie dzielnicy chroni%ce zlewnie potoku Jelitkowskiego, rzeki
