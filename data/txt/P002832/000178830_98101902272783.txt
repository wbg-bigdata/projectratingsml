INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$10.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a road construction project
in Togo.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a'-TO "Cur-
rent Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30,
1974. A basic economic mission visited Togo in March/April 1976 anid the
draft report will be discussed with the Government in the spring oE this
year. Its main findings are incorporated below. Annex I contains basic
country data.
3.        Togo's long-term annual average growth of GNP per capita in real
terms has been more than 4 percent during 1960-73. From 1966 to 1970, GDP
growth in real terms was steady, averaging 6 percent yearly. The sustained
expansion of Togo's economy was due, in great part, to a vigorous expansion
of external commerce which, in turn, was spurred on by favorable market con-
ditions for two of the country's principal exports, cocoa and coffee. With
its low-tariff structure - a legacy from trusteeship days - Togo developed
into an important regional commercial entrepot and, with fast commercial
growth, accumulated substantial foreign reserves. Between 1965 and 1970,
Togolese exports increased by 22 percent a year in current prices. During
this same period, imports - particularly of consumer goods, of which a
high percentage were subsequently- re-exported - also rose sharply.
4.        In the early 1970's economic growth slowed down.   Adverse weather
conditions affected agricultural production, particularly during the years
1971-73; a sizable reduction in border trade, coupled with unfavorable market
conditions for Togo's main exports led to a deterioration of the balance of
payments. In 1974, however, there was a marked improvement of Togo's finan-
cial and economic position. The 1974 trade balance showed a sizeable surplus
(14 percent of GDP) due to substantially higher world market prices for the
country's principal export commodities, especially phosphate. This surplus
turned into a deficit (7 percent of GDP) in 1975, and a further deficit is
expected in 1976 due to reduced quantities exported and falling prLces of
phosphate. Togo's 1975 per capita GNP is tentatively estimated at US$270.

5.        The Togolese Government has generally followed prudent financial
policies which have led to some budgetary savings during periods of high
export growth. For instance, budgetary revenues rose from about 13 plercent
of GDP during 1966-72 to nearly 19 percent in 1974/75, and budgetary savings
increased from an average of 2.2 percent (1966-72) to 3.7 percent of GDP in
1974/75. Selected tax increases as well as public savings generated through
the Office des Produits Agricoles Togolais (OPAT) as a result of favorable
world market prices for coffee and cocoa, have helped improve domestic re-
source mobilization. However, average export prices and volume both fell in
late 1975 and early 1976 and, due to slackening world demand, phosphate sales,
in particular, dropped significantly. Foreign exchange reserves, which rose
to record highs of seven months of imports during 1974, decreased to the
equivalent of about three months' import requirements in 1976. Togo's market-
oriented economy has historically shown the capacity to adjust rapidly to
swings in agriculture and trade, but the magnitude of the recent fluctuations
in phosphate earnings was unprecedented. The Government has had to review
expenditure plans which were based on expectations of high phosphate revenues,
and is taking steps to restrain expenditures including decisions to freeze
new hirings during the 1976 fiscal year and to postpone or slow down public
investment. Moreover, it has the capacity to adjust further, if necessary,
through use of short-term credit and financing facilities from BCEAO, the
IMF, and the European Community's Stabex arrangement.
6.        The position of city dwellers employed in commerce, industry,
construction and the Government -- particularly in Lome -- has improved con-
siderably in recent years, but much of Togo's rural population has remained
untouched by the modern sector's economic expansion. To improve conditions
in the countryside the Government is accelerating the promotion of food crops
and important cash crops like cocoa, coffee and cotton, especially in less
developed regions of the country. The Government's growing concern with
social equity is shown by its policy to distribute more widely the benefits
of economic growth. For instance it raised producer prices of virtually all
agricultural products substantially and selectively increased minimum wages
and salary levels -- especially for lower-paid staff -- and abolished the
regressive head tax.
7.        Togo's development outlook is favorable with prospects for GDP
growth during the next decade of about 7 percent per year and further im-
provement in income distribution and employment. The new Five-Year Devel-
opment Plan assesses the physical and institutional bottlenecks to future
growth with considerable realism, although financial targets have had to be
revised in the light of recent price movements. Its strategy is designed to
further diversify the economy and exploit natural resources, to rehabilitate
and expand both food and cash crop production, to further improve the coun-
try's infastructure in order to lay the ground for new, directly productive
investments, and to promote international regional cooperation. The 'Gov-
ernment's longer term development policy gives emphasis to equity and em-
ployment, including basic education reform, rural development programs and
extension of the feeder road network, promotion of small- and medium-scale
indigenous enterprises and the search for more labor-intensive techniques.



Nevertheless, some further reallocation of current and capital expenditures
towards the rural sector may also be needed to achieve the Government's
objectives in this sector.
8.        While domestic resources available for public investment more than
tripled between 1966-70, foreign financing doubled thus reducing the average
foreign share in the financing of total public investments from nearly 70
percent during the First Plan period to close to 50 percent in 1971-75.
While the Bank Group has become a major donor, EDF, Germany and France pro-
vided more than 75 percent of total capital aid disbursements, which averaged
between 5 to 7 percent of GDP during the past 10 years. The bulk of this
assistance was primarily for infrastructure projects. The expected level of
public investment will require continued efforts by the Togolese Government
to mobilize increasing amounts of domestic resources. Traditional donors are
likely to provide relatively large amounts for public investment, but Togo
has already begun to diversify its sources of assistance by approaching OPEC
and other Western and Eastern countries.
9.        During 1971-74, aid to Togo was provided on relatively soft terms,
with grants accounting for about 50 percent of foreign capital inflow. As
of December 31, 1975, the country's external public debt, including undis-
bursed (about 50 percent), amounted to US$163 million (excluding a line of
credit from the People's Republic of China of about US$54 million) most of
which was incurred at low interest rates and with repayment periods of more
than 10 years. More recently, the share of suppliers' credits and commercial
borrowing has increased. Average debt service payments amounted to about 5
percent of exports from 1971 to 1975 but this ratio is estimated to increase
on the average to a range of between 10 and 15 percent of export revenues
during the remainder of the decade. GLven Togo's good longer-term economic
prospects, the Government should be able to keep debt service within manage-
able limits and sustain a moderate amount of foreign borrowing on conventional
terms. In view of the country's low per capita income, the growing need for
external funding of priority projects in an expanding economy, and Togo's
exposure to widely fluctuating world market conditions, the major part of
foreign financing necessary to sustain economic growth should continue to be
provided on concessionary terms. Because Togo is expected to be able to
finance about 30 percent of its public investment programs, foreign donors
should continue to provide at least 70 percent of total project costs includ-
ing -- in appropriate cases -- some financing of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
10.       To date the Bank Group has extended four credits to Togo amount-
ing to US$27.9 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the
CIMAO regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and
one of US$49.5 million to CIMAO). Two of the credits were for highway



- 4 -
construction and maintenance and two for agricultural projects. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Togo as of December 31,
1976, as well as notes on the execution of the projects.
11.       The Highway Maintenance Project, the Bank Group's first lending
operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed. The second Highway Project
evolved from preinvestment studies financed under the first and provided for
the construction or upgrading of three highways and the continuation of the
maintenance program. This project is progressing satisfactorily alt:hough, due
to inflation, the scope of the road construction component had to lbe reduced
(reference, Semi-Monthly Report to the Executive Directors, R76-187, July 8,
1976).
12.       The first agricultural project for which a credit was apl?roved in
1974, covers part of a long-range program for the development of the Plateau
region's coffee and cocoa potential. This project, which includes planting
and maintenance of 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee, is proceeding well
with planting a year ahead of forecasts. This lead is expected to decrease
in 1977 for cocoa because drought has limited seed production, but will be
maintained for coffee. The second agricultural credit which was approved in
June, 1976, provides financing for a rural development project in clhe Mari-
time Region geared primarily to increasing foodcrop production and providing
support services and rural infrastructure for 20,000 farm families. Project
implementation has begun on schedule.
13.       Togo is the host of the CIMAD project, one of the largesl: interna-
tional industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa. Implementation
of this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other
official aid-agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily.
14.       The future lending program will include a cotton developilent proj-
ect which was recently appraised, a follow-up of the ongoing cocoa--coffee
project, a rural development project ia the north and a Fourth Highway Proj-
ect concentrating on the construction and maintenance of secondary roads.
The program also features an education project.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN TOGO
General
15.       Togo is a small country (56,785 km ) with a 50 km coastline on the
Gulf of Benin. It forms a narrow, 600 km corridor between Ghana to the west
and Benin to the east. Except for a long mountain range in the north along
the border with Benin and in the center along the border with Ghana, Togo's
terrain is flat and presents no major topographical obstacles to transport.
Togo's northern neighbor is Upper Volta.
The Transport Sytem
16.       Togo's transport system is relatively simple.    It is geared to meet
the country's domestic transport needs and consists mainly of about 7,400 km



of roads and of 436 km of railways linking the new deepwater port of Lome,
the nation's capital and economic center, with the rest of the country.
There is also a phosphate wharf at Kpeme, which is connected to the railway
and road network. Lome has the country's only international airport. Five
other small airstrips, mainly in the north, are open to internal general and
military aviation.
17.       Road transport is the predominant mode.   About 1,100 km of the road
network are paved; three times more than in 1970. The network is densest in
the south. The 717 km, south-north road, running the length of the country
from Lome to the border with Upper Volta, forms the backbone of Togo's
national highway network and is complemented by an east-west coastal road
linking Lome with Accra and Cotonou. 214 km of the south-north axis remain
to be paved; EDF is financing the Kante-Mango section (90 km) of that axis
and may also finance the remainder with regional funds.
18.       Togolese railway (CFT) operates three lines, Lome-Blitta (276 km)
in a south-north direction, Lome-Palime (116 km), northwestward to the Ghana
border, and Lome-Aneho (44 km), eastward along the coast. Extension of
the network will take place with the construction of a 50 km branch line,
from the Lome-Blitta trunk to Tabligbo, site of the CIMAO regional clinker
plant.
19.       The free port of Lome was opened to traffic in 1968.    Traffic,
which has been increasing at an average annual rate of 13 percent since
1968, reached 590,000 tons in 1975, including some temporary traffic for
Nigeria diverted because of the congestion of the port of Lagos. T'he port
of Lome's estimated capacity of about 300,000 tons is expected to lie reached
in the early 1980's. The port authority is independent, well manag;ed, finan-
cially autonomous and basically self-siipporting.
20.       Air transport in Togo is only important for international traffic
via the airport at Lome. Between 1970 and 1975 international traff'ic almost
quadrupled. Interior traffic is marginal and limited to military and general
aviation. There is limited need for interior air transport, becauE,e of the
good condition of the primary road network, which puts Lome within eight
hours' travel of almost any part of the country.
Transport Planning and Coordination
21.       The Ministry of Commerce, and Transport (MCT) is responsible for
overall transport planning and coordination. The coordination between trans-
port modes, particularly between road and rail, was extensively studied in the
1960's before major investments in the sector by EDF, KfW and IDA started.
These studies led to the introduction of covenants in the First and Second
Highway Projects to the effect that the Aneho and Palime lines should be
phased out over a 10 year'period after parallel roads were paved (completed in
1968 and 1971 respectively), and that the Blitta line should not be extended
without satisfactory economic justification.



- 6 -
22.       In 1976, the Association re-evaluated the situation and found out
that the Palime and Aneho lines still incur losses ($400,000 per year each),
but that the proposed fertilizer plant at Kpeme would generate a substantial
volume of phosphate bulk traffic to warrant keeping the Aneho line open. The
study also indicated that the Blitta line is now incurring the heaviest losses
($1.0 million per year), and CFT continues to be overstaffed and to have a low
productivity.
23.       At negotiations, the Government explained that the three railway
lines continued to serve a useful role as passenger carriers and th.at it could
not consider the closure of any of them. The Government pointed out that
long-term regional development would justify the extension of the Blitta line
northward in the 1980's. The Government asked that, instead of closing the
lines, the Association should finance, under the proposed project, a study for
the improvement of the railway operations. The Association agreed to this and
under the project, the Government would carry out a study and implement the
recommendations made, not later than December 31, 1979,after reviewing them
with the Association (Sections 3.01 and 4.04 (c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
The previous covenants requiring the closing of the Aneho and Palime lines
were annulled (Section 4.04 (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). With respect
to the Blitta line, it was agreed that the provisions originally included in
the Second Highway Credit,namely,that the line would not be extended without
satisfactory economic justification and that the Association be consulted
prior to any major investment in CFT, were to be reincorporated into the
proposed Credit Agreement (Section 4.04 (a) of the draft Credit Agreement).
24.       Main transport issues other than rail/road coordir,ation and low
railway productivity, are the imbalance in expenditures for road construction
and maintenance between the primary and secondary road network and the feeder
road network (paras. 27 and 28), and the rationalization of the transport
industry (para. 30). The Government is aware of the fact that Togo's prospec-
tive transport demand has evolved to the point where there is need for strength-
ening the country's overall transport planning organization.    To this effect
the proposed project would provide for technical assistance to help set up in
the Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT), a Transport Planning and Coordi-
nation Unit that can give adequate and continuing guidance on different
transport issues and transport investments needs. This unit would be estab-
lished no later than March 31, 1978. (Section 3.04 of the draft Credit
Agreement).
Transport Investments
25.       Togo's transport infrastructure has grown rapidly in the Last
decade as a result of heavy investment in the sector financed mainly from
abroad (EDF, KfW, FAC, and IDA). From 1971 to 1975, about 25 percent of
total public investment was earmarked for transportation, amounting to
US$61 million or about US$12 million a year. About 55 percent of this
amount was spent in the highway sub-sector, mainly for the construction of
the South-North axis and 35 percent for the expansion of the Port oE Lome.



- 7 -
For the period 1976-80 the Government plans total investments in the'trans-
port sector of almost US$143 million, of which more than half would be in
the highway subsector. A third of this amount is again earmarked for the
completion of the south-north road axis. Other objectives include construc-
tion or improvement of two small rail sections to serve ongoing industrial
projects, completion of the expansion of the Port of Lome, and improvement
of the airport at Lome and five regional airports.
The Highway Subsector
26.       The highway network has been described briefly in para 17.   The
size of the motor vehicle fleet is estimated at about 14,000 vehicles or 1
vehicle per 150 inhabitants. Between 1971 and 1975 traffic increased by
about 8 percent or nearly twice the rate of increase of the gross domestic
product.
27.       The Roads Division (RD) of the Public Works Department (PWD) of
the Ministry of Equipment and Postal Services (MEPS) is responsible for con-
struction and maintenance of the primary and secondary road network. This
division has been handicapped in the past by lack of experienced personnel
and inadequate office space. The latter problem is being remedied by the
construction of a new office building. The Ministry of the Interior, with
assistance from PWD, is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of
feeder roads. Certain regional and agricultural development agencies also
undertake limited feeder road construction and maintenance. SRCC, and SORAD
Maritime, for instance, are carrying out feeder roads construction and
improvement programs under the Small Holder Cocoa-Coffee Project and the
Maritime Regional Rural Development Project respectively, both financed by
IDA. A feeder road component would also be included in a forthcoming IDA-
financed Cotton Project. However, no adequate overall financial or admin-
istrative structure exists for these road programs. The proposed project
would provide for a study for organizing feeder roads construction and
maintenance to be carried out before June 30, 1978 (Section 3.01 (b), of
the draft Credit Agreement).
28.       Expenditures for maintenance of the primary and secondary road
networks are financed almost entirely from PWD's ordinary budget. PWD's
expenditures for maintenance of the primary and secondary roads are adequate
while annual expenditures on feeder roads are insufficient ($400,000 per
year). Following the conclusion of the feeder roads study (para. 28), the
Association would consider a separate feeder roads project focussing mostly
on organization and maintenance.
29.       Short-term planning for primary and secondary road construction
and maintenance is done annually in conjunction with the preparation of the
MEPS's budget. There is no overall coordination of road planning and until
recently there was no systematic long-term highway planning; projects were
selected on an ad hoc basis. In order to improve road planning and also
to develop the country's capability to undertake preinvestment studies the
proposed project would include technical assistance to strengthen the Road
Planning and Design Unit within the Road Division (Section 3.03 of the draft
Credit Agreement).



-8-
Road Transport Industry
30.       At present all road transport is in private hands in Togo except
for a few bus lines which are operated by the railway authority, and the newly
created semi-public national transport organization (Togo-Route) 1/. The
Government, anxious to develop the traffic of goods through the port of Lome
(to and from Mali, Upper Volta, Niger and Nigeria), negotiated agreements with
these states on the division of international truck traffic between their
nationals. To ensure that Togo has enough equipment to carry its share of the
goods, the Government established Togo-Route, equipping it initially with 55
trucks and 70 trailers. Too fast a development of Togo-Route might lead to
overcapacity in the trucking industry. Therefore, the Government has agreed
that a study of current and future supply and demand for surface transport
would be carried out by the proposed Transport Planning and Coordination
Unit.
31.       In 1969 the Government created a Road Transport Service (RTS)
to organize and oversee road transport. RTS activities include inter-alia
transport licensing, studying costs and preparing transport legislation. This
agency has been hampered by lack of qualified personnel. The ongoing Second
Highway Project provides for an expert to improve RTS's operations and train
its staff. The recruitment was delayed by the Government but steps are now
being taken to hire this expert.
Highway Sector Financing
32.       The Government has pursued a conservative highway sector financing
policy, with road user charges covering more than 100 percent of highway
expenditures, except in 1975 when investments increased by almost 40 percent
and coverage fell to 96 percent of expenditures. Continuing this financial
policy, the Government doubled road user taxes in early 1976. The proposed
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit would look into the implications of
of this policy.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Staff Project Report - Third Highway Project
- Togo" (N. 13332a-TO) is being circulated separately. A credit ancl project
summary is contained in Annex III.   The project is based on consultants
studies financed under the First and Second Highway Credits. A field apprai-
sal mission took place in March 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington
in December, 1976. The Togolese delegation was led by Mr. Mivedor, then
Minister of Public Works and Mines, and included representatives of the
Ministries of Planning and Finances.
1/   Togo-Route is authorized to engage in international and domestiLc transport
of both passenger and cargo, but has so far limited its intervention to
international cargo traffic.

Project Description
34.       The proposed project has, as its main objective, the improvement
of two important roads serving mainly agricultural areas and the preparation
of future projects through pre-investment studies. It would also initiate
certain institutional reforms in the transport sector by strengthening the
Government's overall transport planning and coordinating capacity through
the creation of a specialized unit in the Ministry of Commerce and Trans-
ports. In addition it would continue the efforts begun under the two previous
highway projects, to build an efficient Public Works Department within the
Ministry of Equipment and Postal Services by providing technical assistance,
and highway maintenance and workshop equipment. The main components of the
project would be:
(a)  reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 km)
to two-lane paved standards;
(b)  construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km) to
two-lane gravel standards;
(c) provision of technical assistance and fellowships to
the Roads Division for road maintenance and road planning
and design; and to the Ministry of Commerce and Trans-
ports for overall transport planning and coordination;
(d)  studies for improving CFT's operations, and for organi-
zing feeder roads construction and maintenance; and
(e) preinvestment studies of the Bassar-Mango road (137 km).
35.       The Aneho-Tabligbo road crosses the densely populated Maritime
Region. The road ends at Tabligbo, close to the site of the CIMAO clinker
plant. The road was paved between 1957 and 1963 as a low-standard, one-
lane road. Several sections, subject to frequent floodings, have dete-
riorated. The road would be reconstructed as a two-lane paved road.
36.       The proposed Agou-Notse, two-lane, gravel road would link two
agricultural marketing centers and would help open up an isolated, sparsely
populated area to migration and agricultural development. It was to have
been constructed under the Second Highway Project but work was postponed for
lack of funds resulting from costs overruns on other items.
37.       Under the First Highway Project, the Roads Division of MEPS was
supplied with new maintenance equipment. The proposed project would finance
the procurement of 23 additional trucks, as well as equipment for the Equip-
ment Division workshop in Sokode.
38.       Technical assistance for the Roads Division would consist of pro-
vision for about (i) 77 man-months of expert services to complete the training
of road maintenance and central workshop staff and to fill organizational



- 10 -
gaps which still hamper productivity; and (ii) 20 man-months for the services
of an engineer/economist for the Road Design and Planning Unit. There is also
provision in the proposed project to strengthen the soil-testing road labora-
tory by closely associating it with the supervision of construction of the two
project roads.
39.       Technical assistance to the Ministry of Commerce and Transports
would consist of provision of about 72 man-months of consulting services to
the Transport Planning and Coordination Unit. This unit would, inter-alia,
assist the Government in solving the main issues in the transport sector and
in formulating a national transport policy. In particular, it wouldl supervise
the execution of the proposed studies for improving CFT's operations and
organizing feeder road construction and maintenance.
40.       In the past the main difficulty with technical assistance has been
the lack of personnel for counterpart training. The Government has indicated
that it would step up its recruitment efforts so as to provide the proposed
Planning and Coordination Unit and the Roads Division with qualifiecd and
experienced personnel in sufficient numbers to enable these units to carry out
satisfactorily their respective tasks (Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the draft
Credit Agreement).  The proposed project would also provide fellowships for
four DPW engineers to receive 2 years of supplementary education in Mali.
41.       The study to improve CFT's operations would be directed at reducing
the railway's losses by reducing operating costs, improving training and pro-
ductivity and increasing tariffs. ThE study for organizing feeder road con-
struction and maintenance would lay the groundwork for the Bank's proposed
feeder road project.
42.       A preinvestment study would be undertaken of the Bassar-Mango road
in the northern part of the country. The area to be served by the road is
underpopulated but has good agricultural potential. The study should be
completed before December 31, 1979 (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Credit
Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
43.       The total cost of the project, excluding taxes, is estimated at
US$12.9 million, of which foreign exchange expenditures are US$11.0 million,
corresponding to 85 percent of the total. The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0
million would finance 78 percent of the total project cost (net of taxes).
The Government would finance the remaining 22 percent (US$1.0 million of for-
eign exchange and US$1.9 million of local cost). Taxes are estimatetd at
US$2.4 million.

44.       The cost of reconstructing the Aneho-Tabligbo road has been esti-
mated on the basis of unit prices and quantities from the detailed engi-
neering, to which 10 percent for physical contingencies has been added.
Construction costs for the Agou-Notse road are based on the lowest bid
received in November 1974, when the road was originally scheduled for con-
struction (para. 36). Due to the generally poor soil conditions found in
the area, physical contingencies of 15 percent have been added. Costs for the
road maintenance and workshop equipment are based on consultants' estimates
using CIF prices of January 1976. All project base cost estimates have been
updated to January 1977 prices and appropriate price contingencies have been
added beginning January, 1977. Consulting services are estimated to cost an
average of $6,900 per man-month.
Implementation
45.       The Ministry of Equipment and Postal Services, through its Public
Works Department, would be responsible for project implementation, except for
the Transport Planning and Coordination Unit and the studies for improving
CFT's operations and for organizing coxnstruction and maintenance of feeder
roads which would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and
Transport. The proposed project would take nearly four years to complete
(April 1977 to December 1980). Technical Assistance for the maintenance
program under the Second Highway Project, which was to end early in 1977,
would be extended for another two years. Technical assistance for the
Planning and Design Unit would also be provided for two years as soon as the
new PWD premises are completed in early 1978. Technical Assistance for the
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit would be provided for three years
(1978-80).
Procurement
46.       The reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road would be carried out
by contract awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with



- 12 -
the Bank's guidelines for procurement. International bids for the construc-
tion of the Agou-Notse road were called and opened in 1974. The Association
would not object to the Government awarding the contract to the bidder with
the lowest evaluated bid of 1974, provided that the contractor extended
the validity of his bid. Otherwise, bids would be called again. Road mainten-
ance equipment would be procured after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Workshop equLpment up
to US$50,000 (including contingencies) would be procured on the basis of local
procurement procedures acceptable to the Association. Domestically manufactured
goods would be allowed a preference of 15 percent, or the level of applicable
duty, whichever is less, when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers.
47.       Construction supervision contracts would be awarded to the consult-
ing firms which carried out the detailed engineering of the roads, Gendron
Lefebvre for the Aneho-Tabligbo road and DIWI for the Agou-Notse road.
Technical assistance for the continuation of the maintenance program would
be procured by mutual agreement between the Government and the consultants
Louis Berger International, Inc., who carried out the previous programs under
the First and Second Highway Projects. Other technical assistance and study
items would be carried out by qualified consultants under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association.
Disbursements
48.       The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover 57 percent of the total
cost of the road construction works and 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of equipment (or 60 percent of local expenditures for imported equipment
locally procured) and 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultants
services.
Benefits and Risks
49.       The two roads to be constructed would serve areas with considerable
agricultural potential. The overall rate of return for the portions of the
project having quantifiable benefits is 22 percent. The justificaticin for the
Aneho-Tabligbo reconstruction is based on vehicle operating cost savings. In
1974 the road carried an average of 362 vehicles per day of which about 40
percent were trucks, and the remainder passenger cars. Based on a 2C0-year
economic life and an annual traffic growth of 10 percent p.a. in the first 10
years following reconstruction and 5 percent thereafter, the economic return
of the reconstruction of the road which accounts for 38 percent of project
costs is estimated at 26 percent. Even under highly unfavorable assump-
tions in the sensitivity analysis, the economic rate of return remains over
11 percent. The Aneho-Tabligbo road would also improve access to the CIMAO
clinker plant.
50.       The new Agou-Notse road would connect a food deficit area near Agou
with the food surplus area of Notse. The road was first studied between 1970
and 1972, and was estimated then to yield an economic return of over 10 percent,
based primarily on an increase in value added agricultural produce in the area



- 13 -
affected by the proposed road. Additional studies in 1976 indicate that
the construction of this road, which accounts for 28 percent of project
costs, is likely to have an even higher return, 18 percent under conserva-
tive assumptions, because of the new development planned in the area.
A large part of the benefits would result from immigration to the area by
Cabrais people from the north who traditionally resettle in the region.
51.       The institution building aspects of the project are important
but the benefits are, of course, much less tangible. Improving the transport
planning capacity of the Ministry of Commerce and Transports is particularly
appropriate since Togo's network has an important role to play in the devel-
opment of a sound West African regional network serving the interests of
landlocked and coastal countries alike. Improvements in the Ministry of
Equipment and Postal Services' capacity with respect to road planning and
design are urgently required.
52.       The main risk of the project is the, thus far, slow response of the
Togolese authorities under, for example, the Second Highway Project, to
technical assistance components. Delays in the implementation of the technical
assistance component of the proposed project would be serious, and close
attention would have to be given to this aspect during supervision.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Togo and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee prov.ded for
in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the draft resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially
to the pattern of recent agreements used for highways projects. Special
conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex IV.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C. Projects in Execution
Credit No. 131     Highway Maintenance Project; US$3.7 Million Credit of
October 10, 1968; New Closing Date: June 30, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: January 14, 1969
Execution of this project is virtually completed and was generally
satisfactory.
Credit No. 450     Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1974
The project provided for the construction of one section of the
main south-north road axis - Blitta-Sokode and two secondary roads (Sokode-
Kambola) and (Agou-Notse). The project is proceeding satisfactoriLy. How-
ever, due to inflation, the scope of the road construction project had to be
reduced; the construction of the Agou-Notse road, one of the three roads to
be constructed under the project was dropped. The economic re-eva;Luation of
the project shows that the economic return of Blitta-Sokode has increased from
22 percent at appraisal to 29 percent, while the return of Sokode-.chambo has
slightly decreased from 16 percent to 14 percent.
Credit No. 503     Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit of
August 6, 1974;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1910;
Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1976
This project provides for the rehabilitation of the planling and
maintenance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 ha of coffee in the Plateaux
Region. The planting program for 1976 still runs a year ahead of aippraisal
estimate. This lead will be less in 1977 for cocoa because drought, has
limited seed production, but will be maintained for coffee. Action has been
initiated towards the preparation of a follow-up project.
Credit No. 638     Maritime Region Rurail Development Project; US$9.5 Million
Credit of June 16, L976, Closing Date: Decembe! 31, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: October 26, 1976
The purpose of the project iiS to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, grundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for about 20,000
farm families.  FAC financing has enabled the project to begin on schedule
and the carrying out of field tests for the first year. Key management posts
have been filled and the 1977 agricultural program is under preparation.
Construction of project buildings is due to start soon and procurement is
underway for road building equipment.
