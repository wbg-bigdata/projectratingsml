STAFF PROJECT REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
TOGO
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The proposed project would be the third Bank Group operation in the
transport sector in Togo. The First Highway Project (Credit 131-TO, US$3.7
million, 1968) consisted of a four-year highway maintenance program and pre-
investment studies, among others of the Agou-Notse 1/ road (51 km), one of
the roads included in the proposed Third Highway Project. The first project
was successfully completed at the end of 1973. The Second Highway Project
(Credit 450-TO, US$8.7 million, 1973) comprised construction of one section
of the main south-north road axis linking Lome with the Upper Volta border
and of two secondary roads, additional technical assistance to PWD for high-
way maintenance and to the Road Transport Service for highway transport
organization, and preinvestment studies, including the Aneho 2/ -Tabligbo
road (45 km), also part of the proposed Third Highway Project. The project
is well underway, although construction of one of the secondary roads (Agou-
Notse) had to be deleted, because of cost overruns on other project compo-
nents. The economic re-evaluation of the two construction items kept in the
Second Highway Project shows that both items are still justified: the econ-
omic return of Blitta-Sokode is now estimated at 29% (22% at appraisal) and
that of Sokode-Tchamba at 14% (16% at appraisal). The proposed Third High-
way Project would include reconstruction of the Tabligbo-Aneho road, con-
struction of the Agou-Notse road, purchase of highway maintenance and work-
shop equipment, technical assistance to the Public Works Department and
to the Ministry of Commerce and Transport, and various studies. The esti-
mated project cost is US$15.3 million. Foreign exchange costs amount to
US$11.0 million or 72 percent of total project cost.
A. TRANSPORTATION IN TOGO
General
2.        Togo is a small country (56,785 km ) with a 50 km coastline on the
Gulf of Benin. It forms a narrow, 600 km corridor between Ghana to the west
and Benin to the east. Except for a long mountain range in the north along
the border with Benin and in the center along the border with Ghana, Togo's
terrain is flat and presents no major topographical obstacles to transport.
Togo's northern neighbor is Upper Volta.
1/   Formerly Nuatja.
2/   Formerly Anecho.

The Transport Sytem
3.        Togo's transport system is relatively simple.  It is geared to meet
the country's domestic transport needs and consists mainly of about 7,400 km
of roads and of 436 km of railways linking- the new deepwater port of Lome,
the nation's capital and economic center, with the rest of the country.
There is also a phosphate wharf at Kpeme, which is connected to the railway
and road network. Lome has the country's only international airport. Five
other small airstrips, mainly in the north, are open to internal general and
military aviation.
4.        Road transport is the predominant mode.  About 1,100 km of
the road network are paved; three times more than in 1970. The network is
densest in the south. The 717 km, south-north road, running the length of
the country from Lome to the border with Upper Volta, forms the backbone of
Togo's national highway network and is complemented by an east-west coastal
road linking Lome with Accra and Cotonou. EDF is financing the Kante-Mango
section (90 km) of the 214 km of the south-north axis that remain to be paved
and may also finance the remainder with regional funds.
5.        Togolese railway (CFT) operates three lines, Lome-Blitta (276 km)
in a south-north direction, Lome-Palime (116 km), northwestward to the Ghana
border, and Lome-Aneho (44 km), eastward along the coast. Extension of
the network will take place with the construction of a 50 km branch line
from the Lome-Blitta trunk to Tabligbo, site of the CIMAO regional clinker
plant.
6.        The free port of Lome was opened to traffic in 1968.  Traffic,
which has been increasing at an average annual rate of 13 percent since
1968, reached 590,000 tons in 1975, including some temporary traffic for
Nigeria diverted because of the congestion of the port of Lagos. The port
of Lome's estimated capacity of about 800,000 tons is expected to be reached
in the early 1980's. The port authority is independent, well managed, finan-
cially autonomous and basically self-supporting.
7.        Air transport in Togo is only important for international traffic
via the airport at Lome. Between 1970 and 1975 international traffic almost
quadrupled. Interior traffic is marginal and limited to military and general
aviation. There is limited need for interior air transport because of the
good condition of the primary road network, which puts Lome within eight
hours' travel of almost any part of the country.
Transport Planning and Coordination
8.        The Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT) is responsible for
overall transport planning and coordination. The coordination between
transport modes, particularly between road and rail, was extensively stud-
ied in the 1960's before major investments in the sector by EDF, KfW and
IDA started. These studies led to the introduction of covenants in the
First and Second Highway Projects to the effect that the Aneho and Palime
lines should be phased out within 10 years after parallel roads were paved
(completed in 1968 and 1971 respectively), and that the Blitta line should
not be extended without satisfactory economic justification.



- iii -
9.        In 1976, the Association re-evaluated the situation and found out
that the Palime and Aneho lines still incurred losses ($400,000 per year),
but that the proposed fertilizer plant at Kpeme would generate a substantial
volume of phosphate bulk traffic to warrant keeping the Aneho line open. The
study also indicated that the Blitta line was incurring the heaviest losses
($1.0 million per year), and that CFT continues to be overstaffed and have low
productivity.
10.       At negotiations the Government explained that the three railway lines
serve a useful role as passenger carriers and that it could not consider
closing any of them. The Government pointed out that long-term regional devel-
opment could justify the northward extension of the Blitta line in the 1980's.
The Government asked that, instead of closing the lines, the Association
finance under the proposed project a study for the improvement of railway
operations. The Association did not insist that the lines be closed, but
required that several conditions be met. First, the Government would carry
out a study and implement a program (approved by the Association) to improve
CFT's operations before December 31, 1979. Funds are included in the proposed
project for that study; consequently the previous covenants requiring the
closing of the Aneho and Palime lines were annulled. Second, with respect to
the Blitta line, it was agreed that the provisions originally included in the
Second Highway Credit, namely that the line would not be extended without
satisfactory economic justification and that the Association be consulted
prior to any major investment in CFT, were to be reincorporated into the
proposed Credit Agreement.
11.       Main transport issues, other than rail/road coordination and low
railway productivity, discussed with the Government were the imbalance in
expenditures for road construction and maintenance between the primary and
secondary road network and the feeder road network (paras. 14 and 15) and the
rationalization of the transport industry (para. 17). The Government is aware
of the fact that Togo's prospective transport demand has evolved to the point
where there is a need for strengthening the country's overall transport
planning organization. To this effect the proposed project would provide for
technical assistance to help set up, in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport,
a Transport Planning and Coordination Unit that can give adequate and continu-
ing guidance on different transport issues and transport investment needs.
This unit would be established no later than March 31, 1978.
Transport Investments
12.       Togo's transport infrastructure has grown rapidly in the last
decade as a result of heavy investment in the sector, financed mainly from
abroad (EDF, KfW, FAC, and IDA). From 1971 to 1975, about 25 percent of
total public investment was earmarked for transportation, amounting to
US$61 million or about US$12 million a year. About 55 percent of this
amount was spent in the highway sub-sector, mainly for the construction of
the south-north axis, and 35 percent for the expansion of the Port of Lome.
For the period 1976-80 the Government plans total investments in the trans-
port sector of almost US$143 million, more than half of which would be in
the highway subsector. A third of this amount is again earmarked for the



- iv -
completion of the south-north road axis. Other objectives include construc-
tion or improvement of two small rail sections to serve ongoing industrial
projects, completion of the expansion of the Port of Lome, and improvement
of the airport at Lome and five regional airports.
The Highway Subsector
13.       The highway network has been described briefly in para. 4.  The
size of the motor vehicle fleet is estimated at about 14,000 vehicles or
1 vehicle per 150 inhabitants.  Between 1971 and 1975 traffic increased
by about 8 percent or nearly twice the rate of increase of the gross domes-
tic product.
14.       The Roads Division (RD) of the Public Works Department (PWD) of the
Ministry of Equipment and Postal Service (MEPS) is responsible for construction
and maintenance of the primary and secondary road network. This division has
been handicapped in the past by lack of experienced personnel and inadequate
office space. The latter problem is being remedied by the construction of a
new office building. The Ministry of the Interior, with assistance from PWD,
is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of feeder roads. Certain
regional and agricultural development agencies also undertake limited feeder
road construction and maintenance. SRCC and SORAD Maritime, for instance, are
carrying out feeder road construction and improvement programs under the
Small-holder Cocoa-Coffee Project and the Maritime Regional Rural Development
Project; both are financed by IDA. A feeder road component would also be
included in a forthcoming IDA-financed cotton project. However, no adequate
overall financial or administrative structure exists for these road programs.
The proposed project would provide for a study on organizing feeder road
construction and maintenance to be carried out before June 30, 1978.
15.       Expenditures for maintenance of the primary and secondary road
networks are financed almost entirely from PWD's ordinary budget. PWD's ex-
penditures for maintenance of the primary and secondary roads are adequate,
while annual expenditures for feeder roads are insufficient ($400,000 per
year). Following the conclusion of the feeder roads study (para. 14), the
Association would consider a separate feeder road project focusing mostly
on organization and maintenance.
16.       Short-term planning for primary and secondary road construction
and maintenance is done annually in conjunction with the preparation of
MEPS's budget. There is no overall coordination of road planning, and until
recently there was no systematic long-term highway planning; projects were
selected on an ad hoc basis. In order to improve road planning and also to
develop the country's capability to undertake preinvestment studies, the
proposed project would include technical assistance to strengthen the Road
Planning and Design Unit within the Roads Division.
Road Transport Industry
17.       At present all road transport in Togo is in private hands except
for a few bus lines, which are operated by the railway authority, and the newly



v 
created semi-public national transport organization, Togo-Route 1/. The
Government, anxious to develop the traffic of goods through the port of Lome
to and from Mali, Upper Volta, Niger and Nigeria, negotiated agreements
with these states on the division of international truck traffic among
their nationals. To ensure that Togo has enough equipment to carry its
share of the goods, the Government established Togo-Route, equipping it
initially with 55 trucks and 70 trailers. Too fast a development of Togo-
Route might lead to overcapacity in the trucking industry. Therefore, at
negotiations, the Government agreed that a study of current and future
supply and demand for surface transport would be carried out by the pro-
posed Transport Planning and Coordination Unit.
18.       In 1969 the Government created a Road Transport Service (RTS)
to organize and oversee road transport. RTS activities include inter alia
transport licensing, studying costs and preparing transport legislation.
This agency has been hampered by lack of qualified personnel. The ongoing
Second Highway Project provides for an expert to improve RTS's operations
and train its staff. This expert is now being recruited.
Highway Sector Financing
19.       The Government has pursued a conservative highway sector financing
policy, with road user charges covering more than 100 percent of highway
expenditures, except in 1975 when investments increased by almost 40 percent
and coverage fell to 96 percent of expenditures. Continuing this financial
policy, the Government doubled road user taxes in early 1976. The proposed
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit would look into optimal economic and
financial policies in this matter.
B. THE PROJECT
Project Description
20.       The proposed project has, as its main objectives, the improvement
of two important roads serving mainly agricultural areas and the preparation
of future projects through pre-investment studies. It would also initiate
certain institutional reforms in the transport sector by strengthening the
Government's overall transport planning and coordinating capacity through
the creation of a specialized unit in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport.
In addition it would continue the efforts begun under the two previous highway
projects to build an efficient Public Works Department within MEPS by providing
technical assistance and highway maintenance and workshop equipment. The main
components of the project would be:
1/   Togo-Route is authorized to engage in international and domestic trans-
port of both passengers and cargo, but has so far limited its interven-
tion to international cargo traffic.



- vi -
(a)  reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 km)
to two-lane paved standards;
(b) construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km) to
two-lane gravel standards;
(c) provision of technical assistance and fellowships to
the Roads Division for road maintenance, and road planning
and design; and to the MCT for overall transport planning
and coordination;
(d) studies for improving CFT's operations, and for organiz-
ing feeder road construction and maintenance; and
(e)  preinvestment studies of the Bassar-Mango road (137 km).
21.       The Aneho-Tabligbo road crosses the densely populated Maritime
Region.  The road ends at Tabligbo, close to the site of the CIMAO clinker
plant. The road was paved between 1957 and 1963 as a low-standard, one-
lane road. Several sections, subject to frequent floodings, have dete-
riorated. The road would be reconstructed as a two-lane paved road.
22.       The Agou-Notse road was to have been constructed under the Second
Highway project, but work was postponed for lack of funds resulting from
cost overruns on other items. The planned two-lane, 8 m wide gravel road
would link two agricultural marketing centers and would help open up an
isolated, sparsely populated area to migration and agricultural development.
23.       Under the First Highway Project, the Roads Division of MEPS was
supplied with new maintenance equipment. The proposed project would finance
the procurement of 23 additional trucks, as well as equipment for the Equip-
ment Division workshop in Sokode.
24.       Technical assistance to the Roads Division would consist of pro-
vision for about (i) 77 man-months of expert services to complete the training
of road maintenance and central workshop staff and to fill organizational
gaps which still hamper productivity; and (ii) 20 man-months for the services
of an engineer/economist to the Road Planning and Design Unit. There is also
provision in the proposed project to strengthen the soil-testing road labora-
tory by closely associating it with the supervision of construction of the two
project roads.
25.       Technical assistance to MCT would consist of provision of about
72 man-months of consulting services to the Transport Planning and Coordina-
tion Unit (TPCU). TPCU would inter-alia assist the Government in solving the
main issues in the transport sector and in formulating a national transport
policy. In particular, it would supervise the execution of the proposed studies
for improving CFT's operations and for organizing feeder road construction and
maintenance.



- vii -
26.       In the past the main difficulty with technical assistance has been
the lack of personnel for counterpart training. The Government has indicated
that it would step up its recruitment efforts so as to provide TPCU and the
Roads Division with qualified and experienced personnel in sufficient number
to enable these units to carry out satisfactorily their respective tasks.
The proposed project would also provide fellowships for four young DPW engi-
neers to receive two years of supplementary education in Mali.
27.       The study to improve CFT's operation would be directed at reducing
the railway's losses by reducing operating costs, improving staff training and
productivity, increasing tariffs and diversification of activities. The study
for organizing feeder road construction and maintenance would define the most
appropriate organizational framework and the needs and means to construct and
maintain feeder roads in order to allow the Bank to appraise its proposed
feeder road project.
28.       A preinvestment study would be undertaken of the Bassar-Mango road
in the northern part of the country. The area to be served by the road is
underpopulated but has good agricultural potential. The study should be
completed before December 31, 1979.
Project Cost and Financing
29.       The total cost of the project, excluding taxes, is estimated at
US$12.9 million, of which foreign exchange expenditures are US$11.0 million,
corresponding to 85 percent of the total. The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0
million would finance 78 percent of the total project cost (net of taxes).
The Government would finance the remaining 22 percent (US$1.0 million of for-
eign exchange and US$1.9 million of local cost). Taxes are estimated at
US$2.4 million.

mated on the basis of unit prices and quantities from the detailed engi-
neering, to which 10 percent for physical contingencies has been added.
Construction costs for the Agou-Notse road are based on the lowest bid
received in November 1974, when the road was originally scheduled for



- viii -
construction (para. 22). Due to the generally poor soil conditions found
in the area, physical contingencies of 15 percent of the total amount of works
have been added. Costs for the road maintenance and workshop equipment are
based on consultants' estimates using CIF prices of January 1976. All project
base cost estimates have been updated to January 1977 prices and appropriate
price contingencies have been added beginning January 1977. Consulting
services are estimated to cost an average of $6,900 per man-month.
Implementation
31.       The Ministry of Equipment and Postal Services, through its Public
Works Department, would be responsible for project implementation, except
for the Transport Planning and Coordination Unit and the studies for improving
CFT's operations and for organizing construction and maintenance of feeder
roads which would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and
Transport. The proposed project would take nearly four years to complete
(April 1977 to December 1980). Technical assistance for the maintenance
program under the Second Highway Project, which was to end early in 1977,
would be extended for another two years. Technical assistance for the Plan-
ning and Design Unit would also be provided for two years as soon as the new
PWD premises are completed in early 1978. Technical assistance for the
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit would be provided for three years
(1978-80).
Procurement
32.       The reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road would be carried out
by contract awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. International bids for the
construction of the Agou-Notse road were called and opened in 1974. The
Association would not object to the Government awarding the contract to the
bidder with the lowest evaluated bid of 1974, provided that the contractor
extends the validity of his bid. Otherwise, bids would be called again
on an international competitive basis. Road maintenance equipment would be
procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Workshop equipment amounting to US$50,000 (includ-
ing contingencies) or less in the aggregate would be procured on the basis of
local procurement procedures acceptable to the Association. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15 percent, or the level
of applicable duty, whichever is less, when comparing domestic bids with those
of foreign manufacturers.
33.       Construction supervision contracts would be awarded to the consult-
ing firms which carried out the detailed engineering of the roads--Gendron
Lefebvre for the Aneho-Tabligbo road and DIWI for the Agou-Notse road.
Technical assistance for the continuation of the maintenance program would be
procured by mutual agreement between the Government and the consultants
Louis Berger International, Inc., who carried out the previous programs under
the First and Second Highway Projects. Other technical assistance and study
items would be carried out according to terms of reference satisfactory to the
Association by qualified consultants.



- ix -
Disbursements
34.       The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover 57 percent of the total
cost (including taxes) of the road construction works and 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of equipment (or 60 percent of local expenditures for
equipment locally procured) and 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
consultants' services.
Benefits and Risks
35.       The two roads would serve areas with considerable agricultural
potential. The justification for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road is based on vehicle operating cost savings. In 1974 the road carried an
average of 362 vehicles per day of which about 40 percent were trucks and the
remainder passenger cars. Based on a 20-year economic life and an annual
traffic growth of 10 percent p.a. in the first 10 years following reconstruc-
tion and 5 percent thereafter, the economic return of the reconstruction of
the road is estimated at 26 percent. Even under highly unfavorable assump-
tions in the sensitivity analysis, the economic rate of return remains over 11
percent. The Aneho-Tabligbo road would also improve access to the CIMAO
clinker plant.
36.       A two-lane gravel road between Agou and Notse (51 km) was originally
approved by the Board of Directors as part of the Second Highway Project, but
cost escalation in other components of that project forced deferral of the
road. This road would provide a reliable connection between a food deficit
area near Agou and the food surplus area of Notse. Most importantly, it would
open a new area for agricultural production, as the middle portion of the
existing track is practically missing. Preinvestment studies first carried
out between 1970 and 1972 were primarily based on an increase in value added
to be produced in the zone of influence of the road. Additional studies in
1976 indicate that the project is likely to have a higher return (18% under
conservative assumptions) than was originally appraised. As there are clear
indications that enough complementary development is firmly planned for the
road zone, it was not considered justified to develop a more elaborate economic
justification of the whole rural development package. A large part of the
benefits would be linked with immigration into the zone, a phenomenon which is
rather spontaneous in this part of Togo, as Cabrais people from the north have
a tradition of resettling in the region.
37.       The institution building aspects of the project are important but
the benefits are, of course, much less tangible. Improving the transport
planning capacity of MCT is particularly appropriate since Togo's network
has an important role to play in the development of a sound West African
regional network serving the interests of landlocked and coastal countries
alike. Improvements in the NEPS's capacity with respect to road planning
and design are urgently required.
38.       The main risk of the project is the continued slow response of the
Togolese authorities, under the Second Highway Credit for example, to technical
assistance components. Delays in the implementation of the technical assistance
component of the proposed project would be serious, and close attention would
have to be given to this aspect during supervision.






I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geographic and Economic Factors Influencing Transport Growth
1.01      Togo is a small country (56,785 km 2) with A 50 km coastline on
the Gulf of Benin. It forms a narrow, 600 km corridor between Ghana
to the west and Benin to the east. Except for a long mountain range in
the north along the border with Benin and in the center along the border
with Ghana, Togo's terrain is flat and presents no major topographical
obstacles to transport. Togo's northern neighbor is Upper Volta, a land-
locked Sahelian country.
1.02      Togo's population is about 2.3 million.  Its gross domestic pro-
duct (GDP) per capita, estimated at US$270 in 1975, is one of the fastest
growing in Africa (4.4% per annum on the average between 1960 and 1973).
However, rural incomes average less than US$100 per capita. In 1974 alone GDP
grew by 43%, but this was mainly the result of soaring phosphate prices and
substantial gains in prices for coffee, cotton and cocoa which are Togo's
major export products. A slump in phosphate exports in 1975 coupled with a
step-up in consumer goods imports generated by the 1974 boom resulted in a
loss of almost one third of the foreign exchange reserves.
B.   The Transport System
1.03      Togo's transport system is relatively simple.  It is geared to
meet the country's domestic transport needs and consists mainly of about
7,400 km of roads and of 436 km of railway linking the new deepwater port
of Lome, the nation's capital and economic center, with the rest of the
country. There is also a phosphate wharf at Kpeme, which is connected to
the railway and road networks. Lome has the only international airport;
five other small airstrips, mainly in the north, are open to internal
general aviation traffic.
(a)       Highways
1.04      Details of the highway subsector are discussed in Chapter II.
(b)       Railways
1.05      There are three railway lines in Togo operated by the Reseau des
Chemins de Fer du Togo (CFT):
a.   The Lome-Blitta central line extending from the capital
276 km towards the north;
b.   the Lome-Palime line, called the "border line," extending
116 km northwestward to the cocoa and coffee growing area
bordering with Ghana; and



-2-
c.   the Lome-Aneho 1/ coastal line extending 44 km eastward
via Kpeme (36 kim), site of the phosphate wharf and pro-
cessing plant.
All lines are meter gauge and in rather good condition. But they have in-
curred financial losses over a number of years; closure of some of them has
been under consideration since 1968, when the Association made its first
loan to Togo (see para. 1.20).
1.06      A fourth line, the CIMAO line (50 kim), is in an advanced stage of
planning; it will extend from km 19 on the Lome-Blitta line to Tabligbo, the
site of a regional clinker plant, for which financing was recently secured
from IBRD and a group of other lenders.
(c)       Seaports
1.07      As the coastline on the Gulf of Benin offers no natural protection
against the ocean, Togo's port needs could only be solved by recourse to
major engineering works. Since 1900 four wharves have been successively
constructed at Lome while plans were made for a regional port serving both
Togo and Benin. After large phosphate deposits were discovered close to
Kpeme, 28 km east of Lome, the Togolese phosphate mining company went ahead
with the construction of a phosphate wharf at Kpeme in 1955. It was not
until May 1959 that the Government of Togo decided to abandon the regional
port idea and to build a Togolese deepwater port 8 km east of Lome. Con-
struction started in July 1964 with financing from the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG), and in 1968 the deepwater port opened for traffic. There is no
interior waterway traffic in Togo.
(i) Deepwater port of Lome
1.08      The autonomous port of Lome is a free port 2/ of some 675 ha with
three major berths for ships of a maximum length of 270 m and a 9.5 m draught,
and one minor berth for ships with maximum draught of 5.5 m. The port also
has about 1,000 ha available for industrial installations. There is a separate,
small modern fishing port, sometimes used for loading coastal traffic for
Nigeria. A new mole is under construction, which, in addition to an extra
berth for general cargo, will provide room for petroleum tankers and mineral
ships (for clinker from CIMAO).   At present petroleum tankers anchor offshore
at a sea-line with a 230-ton per hour capacity. When the new mole is completed
the port will be able to handle about 800,000 tons of general merchandise
imports and exports per year (a one-third increase).  No further extension of
the port is planned before 1980.
1/   Formerly Anecho.
2/   Port franc:  Goods can enter and leave withouL paying duty, and the port
is open to vessels of all nationalities.



- 3 -
1.09      Traffic in the port oL Lome increased from 444 ships and almost
253,000 tons in 1968 to 760 ships and almost 590,000 tons in 1975, which
corresponds to an average annual traffic growth rate of about 13%. Most
imports are related to the cement industry (100,000 tons), petroleum needs
(62,000 tons) and ships' supplies (80,000 tons). A major part of the lat-
ter (some 55,000 tons), as well as some 45,000 tons of transit traffic for
Nigeria, is related to temporary congestion in the port of Lagos, Nigeria.
1.10      The Port Authority is independent, well managed and basically self-
supporting. A Togolese director was appointed in 1976. Technical assistance
from the FRG has been progressively phased out on the operating side, and the
same will be done later on the planning side.
ii)   Wharf at Kpeme
1.11      The Kpeme wharf is a modern structure that allows the export of
at least three million tons of phosphate per year and the import of the
petroleum necessary for the exploitation of the phosphate mine.
(d)       Air Transport
1.12      Air transport in Togo is only important for international traffic
via the modern airport of Lome; interior traffic within the ccuntry is lim-
ited to military and general aviation. There is little need for interior
air transport, because of the good condition of the primary road network,
which puts Lome within eight hours' travel of almost any part of the country.
i)   International traffic
1.13      Togo is a share-holder in the multinational company Air Afrique.
Air Togo still exists as a company, although its activity is limited to
representing and servicing other airlines in Togo and to three round-trip
flights a week between Lome and Lagos. There is a total of 27 flights a week
into and out of Lome. The number of passengers coming through Lome increased
from less than 10,000 in 1962 to more than 115,000 in 1975, and freight traf-
fic increased from 206 tons in 1962 to 3,284 tons in 1975.
1.14      The airport of Lome has a runway 2,400 meters long and 45 meters
wide, with a bearing capacity of 140 tons. The airport is equipped with an
instrument landing system (ILS). It has three parking stations for jets and
a new airport hall (4,000 m ) which can handle up to 500 passengers at the
same time. With minor additional investment, the airport seems able to serve
Togo's needs for the foreseeable future.
ii)   Interior air traffic
1.15      As already mentioned, there is very little air traffic in the in-
terior and no commercial flights. There are a:ir strips at Dapaon (formerly
Dapango), Lhe northernmost city, Mango, Lama Kara, Sokode and Atakpame, of
which Dapaon and Lama-Kara are accessible by DC-3. Most of these air strips
are equipped with radio facilities.



-4-
C.   Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.16      The Government's economic objectives are incorporated into Five-
Year Plans for Economic and Social Development prepared by the ministry in
charge of planning 1/ in cooperation with the ministries in charge of imple-
menting them. Under the Second Plan (1971-1975) the Government's major
objective in the transport sector was to pave most of the south-north road
axis, providing a hinterland for the port of Lome. The axis has been paved
except for the last 214 km (para. 2.01).
1.17      Investment expenditures in the transport sector between 1971 and
1975 amounted to CFAF 15 billion (US$61 million) or about US$12 million
per year. This was about 25% of total public investment in all sectors
of the economy in that period. About 55% of this amount was spent on the
improvement of the highway network (para. 2.29). Some 86% of investment
expenditures in the sector was financed from abroad (EDF 34%, KfW 30%, IDA
and FAC 7% each, others 8%). The remaining 14% was financed from local
sources, mainly the Government's investment budget (Chapter I, Table 1).
Under the Second Plan, total spending exceeded financial targets by 3%,
but project completion data (in physical terms) are not available.
1.18      The Government has prepared an ambitious draft Third Plan for the
1976-1980 period, but due to a fall in export prices, mainly of phosphates,
it was compelled to reduce investments foreseen in its original plan and may
have to make further reductions 2/. According to the latest figures avail-
able the Government plans to invest a total of almost CFAF 35 billion in the
transport sector (US$142 million), more than half of which (nearly CFAF 19
billion or US$77 million) would be in the highway subsector (Chapter I, Table 2
and para. 2.15).
1.19      In the draft Third Plan, the Government identifies transport infra-
structure as one of the priority sectors. It specifically lists the following
objectives for that sector:
a.   Completion of the ongoing expansion of the Port of Lome
and preparation of the port's industrial zone;
b.   Construction (50 km) and rehabilitation (60 km) of two small
railway lines serving industrial projects of a regional
character (clinker and fertilizer plants);
1/   At present the Ministry of Planning, Industrial Development and Adminis-
trative Reform.
2/   Figures used in this report are those from Troisieme Plan Quinguennal
de Developpement Economigue et Social 1976-1980 (en chiffres) which is
a revised version of the figures contained in Plan de Developpement
Economigue et Social 1976-1980-Projet. It was published early in 1976
and was still the latest set of figures available when this report was
prepared.



-5-
c.   Reorganization of the Road Transport Service (para. 2.07)
to achieve better coordination between road transport and
other modes of transport and to reduce transport costs;
d.   Completion of the road network so that it can adequately
serve the whole country;
e.   Improvement of the existing airport of Lome and a study
of the future location and cost of a new airport, farther
away from the city, so as not to hinder the city's devel-
opment; and
f.   Improvement of five regional airports and study of a new
large national airport in Niamtogou, north of Lama-Kara.
These five-year objectives seem to be listed in the right order of priority
and are basically sound except for the absence of a major effort for feeder
roads and the Government's plans for air transport, which appear too ambi-
tious for a small country with a modern international airport, a good pri-
mary and secondary road network and with more pressing investment needs
especially in the agricultural sector.
1.20      The coordination of transport modes in Togo, particularly between
road and rail, was carefully studied in the 1960's before major investments
in the sector by EDF, KfW and IDA started. These studies led to the con-
clusions that the Lome-Palime line and the Lome-Aneho line should be phased
out, and the Lome-Blitta line should be extended by a paved road rather than
a railway. An independent study dated April 1973 confirmed these conclusions.
Consequently, in the Credit Agreements of both the First and Second Highway
Projects (Credit 131-TO, 1968 and Credit 450-TO, 1973), covenants were intro-
duced which stipulate that:
(i)  the branch lines of Lome-Palime and Lome-Aneho should be
phased out within 10 years after the parallel roads were
paved (completed in 1968 and 1971 respectively) unless a
feasibility study establishes to the satisfaction of the
Association that continued operation of the branches is
economically justified; and
(ii)  the Lome-Blitta line should not be extended unless the
Association is provided with satisfactory economic jus-
tification. Furthermore, the Government should consult
with the Association concerning economic justification
of any major investment in CFT before deciding on its
implementation.
1.21      In 1976 the Bank Group re-evaluated the situation and learned
that the Lome-Palime line continued to incur losses (US$400,000 per year).
The Lome-Aneho line, if the proposed fertilizer plant is built, may require



-6-
additional investments rather than closure because a substantial volume of
phosphate-associated bulk traffic would be carried on the line. The main
conclusions of the study were that the railway continues to be significantly
over-staffed, productivity is low and that the Lome-Blitta line has now
become the line liable to incur the largest financial deficits (estimated at
US$1.0 million per year). It recommended that the Government should give
serious consideration to closing the Lome-Blitta line except for the first 19
km, which will be rehabilitated for CIMAO, and that steps should be taken to
gradually reduce CFT's staff and to redeploy the railway's younger staff and
repair facilities to areas of expanding activity such as the new CIMAO line
and passenger bus service.
1.22       The Government feels that the three railway lines, although incur-
ring losses, still serve a useful socio-economic role as passenger carriers,
and that it would be politically impossible to consider closing them. Further-
more, the Government is confident that long-term regional developments would
justify the extension northward of the Lome-Blitta railway line in the 1980's
and would transform CFT into a profit-making organization. The Government has
commissioned consultants to carry out the feasibility study of this extension,
which would serve potential mining sites.
1.23       Since there are similar transport development plans in other nearby
countries, a consultant was engaged by the Bank Group to evaluate overall
transport development in West Africa. The consultant found that, even under
favorable assumptions, no extension of the Lome-Blitta line is economically
feasible in the foreseeable future. As the closing of the two branch lines of
Lome-Palime and Lome-Aneho would not substantially reduce the railway deficit
and is no longer the main railway issue, the Association accepted deletion of
the corresponding covenant of the First Highway Project (para. 1.20(i)),
provided that a study be made on ways to help CFT to improve its operations.
The other covenants of the First and Second Highway Projects regarding future
investments in the railways (para. 1.20(ii)) were incorporated in the Third
Highway Project's Credit Agreement. The Association also agreed to finance
the foreign component of the study for the improvement of CFT operations, to
be completed not later than December 31, 1978 (para. 3.21). The Government has
committed itself to take appropriate measures for the implementation of a
program for the improvement of railway operations, as recommended by the study
and approved by the Association, not later than December 31, 1979.
1.24       Main transport sector problems, other than rail/road coordination
and low railway productivity, are (i) the imbalance in expenditures for road
construction and maintenance between the primary and secondary networks and
the feeder road network (paras. 2.13, 2.15 and 2.31), and (ii) the need for
rationalization of the road transport industry (paras. 2.07 and 2.10). In-
deed, the country's economic development and prospective transport demand
have evolved to the point where transport sector decisions can no longer be
postponed. A consistent and detailed long-term plan of action must be worked
out. The Government has agreed to strengthen the overall transport planning



-7-
organization by creating a unit that can give adequate and continuing guidance
on the different transport issues and transport investment needs. That
transport planning and coordination unit would also serve as a nucleus for
transport policy making in the new Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT). A
technical assistance element is included in the project (paras. 3.19 and 3.20)
to help set up the unit. The Government has agreed to the terms of reference
of the planning unit and also to review, with the Association, the recommenda-
tions prepared by the unit.

II. HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
2.01      Togo's road network comprises:
(a) two primary roads going from the capital of Lome (at the
southwestern corner of the country) north to the Upper-Volta
border (717 km) and east to the Benin border (48 km); the
latter is a section of the important Accra-Lome-Cotonou
Lagos coastal road;
(b)  secondary roads (1,602 km) spreading from the above primary roads; and
(c) feeder roads totalling about 5,000 km.
The growth of the road network is given below (in km):
1970    1971    1972    1973    1974    1975    1976

The two primary roads and about 587 km of the secondary roads are paved, ex-
cept the last 214 km to the Upper Volta border. The remaining secondary roads
are either gravel or earth roads (1,015 km). The feeder roads are generally
dry-weather tracks.
B. Traffic
2.02      There are no valid statistics on the motor vehicle fleet, since the
Road Transport Service registers new vehicles, but does not collect informa-
tion on the withdrawal of vehicles from the fleet. However, assuming an
average life span for each category of vehicle, it is calculated that the
size of the vehicle fleet was about 14,000 in 1974, or about I vehicle per
150 inhabitants, which is a lower vehicle density per inhabitant than in the
neighboring coastal countries except Benin. The table below lists the new
vehicle registrations for the period 1970-1974 and the estimated vehicle fleet
at the end of 1971 and 1974:

/1   These figures approximately coincide with those given by the transporters'
syndicate UNATROT (Union Nationaie des Transporteurs du Togo).
2.03      During the three-year period 1972-1974, passenger car growth was
about 10.6% p.a., while the number of all other vehicles increased by about
3.6% p.a. As a whole, the number of motor vehicles rose by 8.4% p.a. Ir.
spite of the somewhat erratic rise in fuel consumption during the 1971-1975
period due to the 1973-1974 petroleum crisis, the 8.4% growth in vehicle fleet
roughly coincides with the 9% average annual growth in fuel consumptice by
road users in the somewhat longer 1971-1975 period as shown below (in cubic
meters):

2.04      The Roads Division, RD (Arrondissement Routes) of the Ministry
of Equipment and Postal Services (MEPS), is responsible for the collection of
traffic data. RD's field subdivisions have carried out manual traffic counts
on most roads since the early 1960's, but RD has been unable to process the
data collected. Consultants reorganized traffic counts in 1974 under the



- 12 -
Second Highway Project, and the 1975 data seem reasonably accurate. The
Government has purchased traffic counting equipment to check the manual counts
at specific locations in 1976. In 1975, total traffic was estimated at about
260 million vehicle-km, and at about 300 million ton-km.  Traffic on paved
roads ranged from 150 to 2,000 vehicles per day (vpd) and up to 150 vpd on
gravel and earth roads.
2.05      Togo's gross domestic product increased by 4-5% p.a. in real terms
from 1971 to 1975, while traffic is estimated to have grown at the same rate
as the vehicle fleet, about 8% p.a. (para. 2.03), showing an elasticity of
traffic to GDP of nearly 2. Economic growth in the second half of the decade
is forecast at 5-6% p.a. Assuming the same elasticity of traffic to GDP as
before, it is estimated that traffic growth will average between 8-10% p.a.
during the 1976-1980 period.
C. Road Transport Industry
2.06      Togo's road transport industry comprises many small firms.  Local
transporters owning one to five trucks provide transport for all general
merchandise; two larger foreign firms monopolize petroleum tanker traffic.
Passenger transportation is provided by small enterprises operating station
wagons and vans. Since 1973, it has also been provided by the railway
authority, which operates six buses on the profitable Lome-Palime-Atakpame
route. In March 1976, the Government, feeling that the lack of large, private
trucks impeded the development of transit traffic to and from neighboring
countries through the port of Lome, created a joint public-private company,
Togo-Route (para. 2.10).
2.07      In 1969, the Government created the Road Transport Service (RTS)
to organize and oversee road transport, both on domestic and international
routes. This covers a variety of tasks ranging from registering vehicles,
issuing driving licenses, and inspecting vehicles, to delivering transport
licenses, preparing road transport legislation, and studying road transport
costs. RTS lacks qualified personnel and thus is unable to collect the
necessary information and develop adequate policy guidelines for the Govern-
ment. The ongoing Second Highway Project (Credit 450-TO, 1973) provided for
an expert for a period of two years to improve RTS's operations and train its
staff. The Government recently took the necessary steps to hire the expert.
In 1974, the Government created a Permanent Committee for Road Transport,
comprising representatives from several Government agencies (including RTS)
and the private sector to advise the Government on road transport policies.
The work of this committee, however, is impeded by the lack of data concern-
ing transportation supply and demand for both passengers and freight.
2.08      Maximum authorized gross vehicle weight is 38 tons, with a max-
imum single axle load of 13 tons. The Government intends to design its
legislation on vehicle dimensions and axle loads along the lines of stan-
dards presently being considered in the European Economic Community, which



- 13 -
should result in lower single axle loads. Starting in 1976, it also intends
to enforce compliance with vehicle weight legislation through the use of
several weighing stations located on the main road axis, since overloading
seems to be widespread. The Association has drawn the Government's attention
to the Credit Agreement's covenant regarding enforcement of axle load regula-
tions. During supervision missions the Association will advise the Government
on enforcement of these regulations and on making effective use of the weighing
stations.
2.09      The average rates for freight and passenger transportation by road
and rail are shown below:

General freight and passenger transport rates are usually lower by rail than
by road, but sometimes barely cover operating costs for either means of
transportation. These low rates are maintained by the railway authority with
the help of Government subsidies (para. 1.21) and by the private transporters
by paying low wages, avoiding overheads and taxes, and postponing maintenance
and depreciation. Specialized transport of goods, such as petroleum, is much
more profitable, because the transporters have a virtual monopoly.
2.10      The Government, anxious to develop the traffic of goods through the
port of Lome to and from Mali, Upper Volta, Niger and Nigeria, negotiated
agreements with neighboring states on the division of international road traf-
fic between Togolese truckers and those of each these countries. A freight
office has been set up at the Lome harbor to enforce these agreements. To
ensure that Togo has enough equipment to carry its share of international
transport, the Government recently created a joint publicprivate transport
company (Togo-Route). According to its charter, Togo-Route's purpose is to
handle national and international transport of passengers and cargoes. As a
first-phase development, Togo-Route bought 55 road tractors and 70 trailers
for general cargo. Currently it concentrates on international traffic only,
although it may enter domestic transport. A second phase is expected to begin
in 1977, when the oil refinery under construction at Lome starts production.
Togo-Route intends then to ship fuel to neighboring countries. It has no plans
to enter passenger service. Too fast a development of Togo-Route might lead



- 14 -
to over-capacity in the trucking industry and subsequent protection of Togo-
Route by the Government from direct competition with private transporters.
The Government has agreed that domestic and international road transport needs
would best be met through fair competition between the various transporters,
and that a study of current and future supply and demand for surface transpor-
tation was desirable so that adequate measures can be taken to avoid over-
capacity in transport equipment. This study will be carried out by the
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit to be established within MCT under
the proposed project (para. 3.19).
D. Administration
2.11      The Public Works Department (PWD) of the MEPS, through its Roads
Division (RD), is in charge of planning, construction and maintenance of the
primary and secondary road networks, while the Ministry of Interior is respon-
sible for feeder roads. Current PWD organization is shown below. RD has five
field subdivisions comprising 18 sectors. The subdivisions, however, are also
engaged in construction (mostly by force account) and maintenance of all
Government buildings (except in Lome) under the supervision of the Buildings
Division. All equipment for road maintenance and construction owned by RD is
maintained by the Equipment Division, either at its main workshop in Lome or
at its annex in Sokode. Since the Equipment Division is also capable of
maintaining the equipment used on feeder roads by several Government agencies,
the Government is considering having the Division provide this service. The
necessary arrangements are expected to be implemented under the feeder road
project which is in preparation (para 2.13).
2.12      PWD's present organization is satisfactory, except for RD which
is not properly structured and which has suffered from a long period of
uncertainty about construction of much-needed office space. The Government
is to start construction of a new building for PWD in early 1977 for comple-
tion by April 1978. In the meantime, office space will be rented temporarily.
Plans for the reorganization of RD,were worked out by PWD with the assistance
of consultants under the highway maintenance program. Under the proposed
reorganization, RD would be divided into three units, one each for planning
and design, construction, and maintenance. The number of sub-divisions would
be increased from 5 to 11. The proposed project would assist the Government
in implementing a new RD organization by providing technical assistance to the
planning and design and the maintenance units (paras. 2.19 and 3.14 to 3.16).

2.13      The Ministry of Interior is responsible for the feeder road network
through its 21 District Offices (Circonscriptions). Because of the lack
of funds provided in the National Budget for feeder roads, however, the
District Offices only undertake some small manual maintenance operations with
the technical assistance of PWD. Several agricultural agencies participate in
construction and occasionally in maintenance of part of the feeder road net-
work with the technical assistance of the Rural Engineering Division (Genie
Rural) of the Ministry for Rural Infrastructure, MRI (Ministere de l'Equipe-
ment Rural). These agencies fall into two categories. The first includes the
five SORADs (Regional Agencies for Equipment and Development), which are auto-
nomous public corporations with responsibility for all development activities
within their regions. They maintain and improve a small number of feeder
roads on a contract basis. The second category comprises several specialized
public agencies concerned with the development of specific crops. This
category includes the Societe pour la Renovation du Cafe et du Cacao (SRCC-
Agency for the Development of Coffee and Cocoa), Societe Nationale des Palmiers
a Huile (SONAPH-National Agency for Palm Trees and Palm Oil), Societe Togolaise



- 16 -
du Coton (SOTOCO-Togolese Agency for Cotton), and the exporting agency, Office
des Produits Agricoles Togolais (OPAT-Agency for Togolese Agricultural
Products). This situation is being reviewed by the Association in the course
of preparing a possible feeder road project. The aims of this project would
be (i) to correct the imbalance in construction and maintenance expenditures
between the primary and secondary network and the feeder road network, and
(ii) to organize a Government agency capable of constructing and maintaining
the feeder road network, presumably within the newly created Ministry for Rural
Infrastructure, as the existing agencies would need considerable strengthening.
The project includes consultants services to assist the Government and RMWA in
defining the most appropriate organizational framework for feeder roads and to
help prepare a feeder road project (para. 3.22). The Association would also
use the feeder road project as a vehicle for working out appropriate labor
intensive methods for construction and maintenance.
E. Planning
2.14      Until recently, there was no long-term highway planning.  All road
construction projects were selected on a project-by-project basis, since the
primary network and the major sections of the secondary networks are not ex-
tensive and the Government concentrated its efforts on their improvement. In
1975, under the Second Highway Project, consultants BCEOM (France) completed
a survey of about.2,300 km of unpaved roads, chosen from among the minor
secondary roads (1,000 km) and the main feeder roads (1,300 km).  The study
helped define five categories of road standards (para. 2.17) and priorities
for the improvement of the roads under study. The most feasible improvement
works (600 km of secondary roads) will be carried out mainly by RD betterment
and regravelling brigades (para. 2.26).
2.15      During the 1971-1975 period, investment expenditures for the
primary and secondary road network averaged CFAF 1.6 billion (US$6.7 million)
annually (para. 2.29). The 1976-1980 Plan, as revised in mid-1976, contains
a list of road transport investments for a total amount of CFAF 19 billion
(US$77 million) or an average CFAF 3.8 billion (US$15 million) per year, but
with a major concentration in the first three years (Chapter 1, Table 2). The
list emphasizes paving the last section of the Lome-Upper Volta axis, Kante-
Mango-Upper Volta border, and the construction of a comprehensive network of
secondary roads. Some of the latter roads appear overdesigned and their
justification is based on political and social, not economic, considerations.
Less than 5% of the 1976-1980 expenditures will be for feeder roads unless the
proposed feeder road project or agricultural projects including a feeder road
component can alter the Government's priorities.



- 17 -
2.16      Short-term planning for primary and secondary road construction
and maintenance is carried out annually in conjunction with the preparation
of the MEPS budget. Detailed work plans and budgets for each subdivision
and for the Equipment Division are drafted by RD and incorporated into the
MEPS budget proposal. This proposal is then discussed with the Ministry of
Finance. To improve MEPS's road planning, the proposed project will include
technical assistance to RD for the strengthening of its planning and design
unit (para. 3.16).
F. Engineering
2.17      For several years, the Government has been using the same standards
within each category of road it constructed, although there are no official
design standards for roads. The BCEOM study of 2,300 km of unpaved roads
(para. 2.14) recommended that these standards be defined in five road categor-
ies, comprising:
(a) simple earth roads;
(b) improved earth roads;
(c) gravel roads (8 m roadway);
(d) widened gravel roads (10 m roadway); and
(e) paved roads.
The main problem, however, is to systematically apply economic criteria in
road design, since the Government has a tendency to overdesign secondary
roads, while not sufficiently improving the feeder road network. The pro-
posed RD planning and design unit (para. 3.16) should help focus the Govern-
ment's attention on this problem.
2.18      All major road design is carried out by foreign consultants under
RD supervision. There are only two small Togolese surveying firms, which
are mainly engaged in cadastral surveys, and there is only a small local
laboratory created by PWD for simple soil and material testing. The project
would help PWD to develop its laboratory facilities (para. 3.17).
G. Staffing and Training
2.19      PWD's managerial personnel is largely local.  There are 29 Togolese
engineers in PWD, and only five technical assistance experts (four provided
under the Second Highway Project for maintenance organization, and one under
FAC bilateral assistance for management of the Equipment Division's Annex
in Sokode). The Togolese engineers are graduates of the Civil Engineering
College (Ecole des Travaux Publics, ETP) in Paris (France), universities



18 -
elsewhere in Europe or the Polytechnical College of Bamako (Mali); and most of
them have received practical training abroad. Under the Second Highway
Project (Credit 450-TO, 1973), three engineers will be sent to France, Tunisia
and Ivory Coast for 4 to 12 month stays. The first engineers completely
educated in Togo graduated in June 1976 from the College for Industrial
Mechanics (Ecole Superieure de Mecanique Industrielle, ESMI), which has
a civil engineering section. However, many PWD engineers are still inexpe-
rienced in highway engineering and administration, and a continuation of
the technical assistance in highway administration and maintenance is there-
fore still necessary for about two years (para. 3.14). Additional technical
assistance is also needed for the strengthening of RD's planning and design
unit (para. 3.16) and the road laboratory (para. 3.17). The consultants' key
function would be to train their Togolese counterparts adequately to allow a
smooth transition upon termination of their assignments. The project also
provides for fellowships abroad to allow four engineers trained in Togo to
receive further education in Mali (para. 3.18).
2.20      At lower levels, training courses for highway foremen, mechanics,
equipment operators and road laboratory assistants are given by the Regional
Center for Training in Highway Maintenance (CERFER) in Lome, created with
the technical and financial assistance of USAID, FAC and EDF, and operated
by Togo on behalf of the five countries belonging to the Conseil de 1'Entente:
Benin, Ivory Coast, Niger, Togo and Upper Volta. Since 1964, 425 Togolese
have attended the nine-month training sessions of CERFER, most of them as
Government employees, and currently 20 are being trained there.
H. Construction
2.21      Several foreign contractors have established branch offices in
Togo, as there are no regulations preventing them from operating in the
country.  They carry out about 75% of the total amount of public works.
The remaining 25% is carried out by five domestic contractors and one Togo-
lese-French contractor. Domestic contractors do not compete directly with
foreign contractors, as they only supply materials and construct drainage
and other minor civil works. They obtain contracts for these works through
either joint ventures with or subcontracts from foreign contractors. Several
domestic contractors, however, are growing and two or three of them in parti-
cular intend to compete directly with foreign firms in a few years.
2.22      Development of the domestic construction industry is currently
impeded by the lack of adequate equipment and working capital, as local
dealers and banks are reluctant to give medium- and short-term loans to
domestic contractors. Thus, they must finance their development mostly
with their own liquid resources. The National Investment Corporation, SNI
(Societe Nationale d'Investissements), created in 1971, was specifically
designed to help domestic firms to develop by participating in their equity,
guaranteeing their borrowings or by giving them medium- and short-term loans.
But SNI is not yet completely operational, the two other national investment



- 19 -
institutions have not yet operated in this sector. The project is not suitable
to help domestic contractors to solve their financial difficulties, since
there are only three or four of them who could receive assistance. Development
of the domestic construction industry could only be considered in the broader
framework of a DFC operation.
2.23      Road construction works are generally carried Gut b- coultra&t awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding. Important constriiction supervfsion is
mostly carried out by consultants under RD's directio-.  SuudivisL-Ln >mads
supervise small construction works.
I.  aia ntenarce
2.24      Maintenauce of the highway neetwcrk has freat iy imL01p )ved since
1969, when a fcur-year maintenance program was begun under the First Highway
Project (1969-1973).  The maintenance program was followed up by a three-year
technical assistance program under the ongoing Second Highway Project (1974-
1976). The first program aimed at setting up a Government road maintenance
service capable of maintaining the primary (765 km) and secondary (1100 km)
road networks and improving to gravel standards the last 400 km of secondary
roads which were still earth standard. Existing highway maintenance equipment
was repaired and necessary new equipment was purchased.  PWD's workshops were
rehabilitated and extended, and a performance accounting system was intro-
duced. Concurrently, most personnel received refresher courses, either abroad
from equipment dealers and manufacturers or in Lome at CERFER and at the
National Center for Professional Training. Consultants also gave intensive
on-the-job training to personnel at all levels (1971-1972).
2.25      Reorganization of maintenance operations, however, proved much
more difficult to achieve. The five field subdivisions remained directly
in charge of all maintenance and most betterment works under RD supervision.
All subdivisions were equipped with mechanized units for reshaping and
regravelling. Those subdivisions responsible for maintaining paved roads
were also equipped with a patching-resealing unit. A betterment brigade for
upgrading of earth roads was organized under direct RD management. The sys-
tem was operational from 1972 to 1974, but proved unsatisfactory, as only
half the anticipated work was carried out. The main shortcomings were:
(i) the lack of coordination and supervision at the RD level; (ii) the un-
economic use of equipment for scattered works; (iii) the poor preparation
of the drainage system before gravelling some earth roads; and (iv) the
lack of funds for operating expenses such as the purchase of diesel oil and
materials.
2.26      In view of the above, PWD decided in early 1975 to reorganize
maintenance operations. RD was given direct responsibility for all of the
regravelling operations previously managed by the subdivisions. All regravel-
ling equipment was transferred to three new brigades, which are assigned to
the various subdivisions for specific periods and with well-defined programs.



- 20 -
A second betterment brigade was created to upgrade earth roads. Preliminary
results for 1975 seem to indicate an increase in the output of road regravelling
and betterment, and show that the actual cost is competitive and might even be
below current prices offered by contractors for similar work. Routine mainte-
nance is still organized and carried out directly by the field subdivisions,
and its quality is variable. It should improve when, under the project, RD's
maintenance unit is properly staffed and able to supervise all maintenance
programming and execution (para. 3.15).
2.27      Maintenance of road equipment was also extensively reorganized under
the First and Second Highway Projects. Five operational levels are defined:
routine maintenance, periodic maintenance, small repairs, large repairs and
general overhauling. The field subdivisions perform routine and periodic
maintenance and small repairs in their workshops. Large repairs and general
overhauls are carried out by the Equipment Division, either in its main work-
shop in Lome in the south or at its annex in Sokode in the north. The Equip-
ment Division is also responsible for ordering spare parts for all subdivi-
sions and for periodic inspection of all equipment. The Division's perform-
ance is adequate, although the large turnover of staff, who often leave for
the private sector where salaries are higher, necessitates continuous train-
ing of new personnel.
2.28      Most of the paved network is less than 10 years old and is generally
in good condition. Some stretches, however, need a surface treatment which
has been delayed. Some southern sections of the Lome-Upper Volta axis also
show deficiency in their pavement and require strengthening. The condition
of the secondary network varies but has improved in recent years. The main
concern now is the maintenance and improvement of the feeder road network, for
which no adequate financing or administrative structure exists (para. 2.13)
J. Financing
2.29      Highway investment expenditures in the 1971-1975 period were fi-
nanced from two sources: (i) multilateral and bilateral aid (EDF 53%, IDA
13% and the French FAC 12% of total road investment); and (ii) the investment
budget (22% of total road investments). Highway maintenance expenditures are
provided almost solely by the general budget, which also finances minor
improvements and small equipment purchases. The table below summarizes total
highway expenditures for the primary and secondary road network in 1971-
1975:

2.30      Total expenditures for investment in the primary and secondary road
networks have fluctuated during the last few years, because they have been
financed mainly by foreign aid on a project-by-project basis. Expenditures
for maintenance and minor improvements of primary and secondary roads in-
creased at an average rate of 15% p.a. over the past five years, from CFAF
315 million (US$1.3 million) in 1971 to CFAF 552 million (US$2.2 million)
in 1975 and represented, on average, 3.2% of the current budget expenditures.
In 1975, maintenance expenditures amounted to about CFAF 209,000 (US$850) per
km, which should be adequate provided funds are not used to finance major
betterment works or overhead costs of PWD.
2.31      Expenditures for feeder road improvements are often provided from
several Government agency budgets and are difficult to isolate because they
are often a part of agricultural projects (para. 2.13). In the past, feeder
roads were often financed by EDF and OPAT. The Association is providing funds
for construction of about 100 km of feeder roads in the Palime area under an
ongoing project for the improvement of small-holder cocoa and coffee pro-
duction (Credit 503-TO) and has included construction of another 1,000 km



- 22 -
of rural roads under the Maritime Region Rural Development Project and a new
cotton project being prepared. In recent years, however, only about 50 km have
been constructed annually at a cost of about CFAF 80 million (US$0.3 million).
Maintenance budgets for feeder roads have been small, amounting to about
CFAF 30 million (US$120,000) for the District Offices, and CFAF 7 million
(US$28,000) for SRCC. Although other data are not available, it can be
estimated that total maintenance expenditures on rural roads have not exceeded
CFAF 50 million (US$200,000) per year or CFAF 10,000 (US$40) per km, which is
insufficient. This matter will be analyzed in detail in the proposed feeder
road project.
2.32     Revenues from road users increased by almost 10% p.a. during the
1971-74 period. The 1975 revenues from road users were unusually low, as the
Government reduced fuel taxes at the beginning of the year, and these taxes
were increased twofold in February 1976. As a result, revenues from road
users should also cover Government road expenditures in the coming years.
Road investment expenditures increased almost by more than 12% p.a. and
maintenance expenditures by 15% in the 1971-75 period. On the average,
revenues from road users amounted to about 12% of road expenditures for the
primary and secondary network in the past as shown below. The proposed
transport planning and coordination unit will look into the implications of
this policy (para. 3.19).

K. Sector Lending
2.33      The institutions involved in transport planning and administration
are still in the early stages of development, and the personnel requires
additional training and experience to help it gain authority. The issue of
transport coordination has not been and is still not being given sufficient
consideration by the Ministry in charge of transport (MCT). After a series of
studies on transport coordination in Togo (paras. 1.20 and 1.21), final
decisions still have to be made on a number of critical transport sector
issues (paras. 1.23 and 1.24). The Association examined with the Government
the need to strengthen the overall transport planning organization. A trans-
port planning and coordination unit will be created in MCT (para. 1.24) for
which the project will provide technical assistance (paras. 3.19 and 3.20). To
improve planning in the road subsector, which shows some shortcomings (paras.
2.14 to 2.16), RD's road planning and design unit will be strengthened and its
staff will be trained under the project (para. 3.16). Once these two units
are operational, the country should be one step closer to becoming eligible
for highway sector lending.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Description and History
3.01      The project consists of:
(a)  reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 km)
to two-lane paved standards;
(b)  construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km) to
two-lane gravel standards;
(c) purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment;
(d) provision of technical assistance and fellowships to the
MEPS's PWD for (1) road maintenance and (2) strengthening
of the road planning and design unit; and of technical
assistance to MCT for overall transport planning and
coordination;
(e)   a study on improvement of the operations of the Togolese
Railways (CFT);
(f)   a study on organizing the construction and maintenance
of the Togolese feeder road network; and
(g)  preinvestment studies of the Bassar-Mango road (137 km).

3.02      The Association's involvement in highway maintenance in Togo dates
back to 1968, when a first highway credit was given to the Government for
that purpose. The consultant firm Louis Berger was chosen to provide tech-
nical assistance. The Agou-Notse road was first studied in 1972 by the
German consultant firm DIWI with financing provided under the Association's
First Highway Project. The construction of Agou-Notse was originally part
of the Second Highway Project, but it had to be dropped because of lack of
funds due to a large cost overrun on other construction items because of
the 1973-1974 world-wide inflation.  The economic reevaluation of the con-
struction items kept in the Second Highway Project is given in an attachment
to this report. It shows that the construction items, which are now practi-
cally completed, are still justified. The 1972 feasibility study for the
construction of Agou-Notse road, made by the German consultant firm DIWI, was
updated in 1976 and the road has been reintroduced in the Third Highway
Project. The Aneho-Tabligbo road was studied in 1975 by the Canadian con-
sultant firm Gendron Lefebvre with financing provided under the Second
Highway Project.
Reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo Road
3.03      The Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 kim) crosses the densely populated
Maritime Region (300 inhabitants per km ) where IDA and FAC will be he'ping
the Government to increase agricultural output under the Maritime Region
Rural Development Project. The road starts in Aneho at the intersection
with the Accra-Lome-Cotonou-Lagos international road axis and ends at
Tabligbo, an administrative and market center close to the CIMAO clinker
plant for which financing was recently secured (para. 1.06).
3.04      The first stretch of the road (Aneho-Anfouin, 13 km) was paved
in 1957 under the French trusteeship. It was thus one of the first paved
roads in the country. The second stretch (Anfouin-Tabligbo, 32 km) was
constructed in 1963 under FAC financing. Due to the scarcity of funds, the
road was designed as a low standard, one-lane road (pavement width: 3.5 m;
roadway width: 6.0 m). The following years, RD widened the pavement to
between 4.5 and 5.0 m. In spite of costly maintenance operations, several
sections have now deteriorated under rapidly growing traffic. The poor
drainage of the roadbed has led to general rutting on both sides of the
pavement, and potholes are forming more rapidly than they can be filled.
An 8 km section was flooded in 1974 and the pavement destroyed. It was
repaired temporarily by RD.
3.05      Reconstruction works would comprise a widening of the roadway to
9 m, and of the existing pavement to 6 m together with its overall strength-
ening, a complete rehabilitation of the drainage system, and improvement
of the vertical alignment on seven sections (totalling 7.2 km) to prevent
flooding, minor improvements of the horizontal alignment. Detailed engineer-
ing of the reinforcement was completed in December 1975 by consultants
Gendron Lefebvre under the Second Highway Project. PWD will be assisted
by consultants in supervising the reconstruction works.



- 25 -
3.06      The existing alignment of the first 4.4 km chosen by the consultants
is not ideal, as reconstruction of the road would start in the center of
Aneho (30,000 inhabitants) at the bridge over the lagoon on the Lome-Cotonou
road. The first 1.2 km of reconstruction works are on a main commercial
street with a right-of-way 10 m wide (the cross section provides for a 7 m
wide pavement and two 1.5 m wide sidewalks, with an underground storm drainage
system). Then for the following 3.2 km the road winds, crossing a 70 m long
bridge over a lagoon, to the village of Glidji before taking the general
alignment, which is practically straight for the next 40 km to Tabligbo.
3.07      This 4.4 km alignment has two shortcomings: (a)  it requires long-
distance traffic to drive through one of Aneho's major streets, and (b) it
unnecessarily increases the distance vehicles have to travel. The Government
has agreed on the following changes, provided no major obstacle arises in
acquiring land:
(a)   in addition to the reconstruction of the existing 1.2 km
crossing part of the city, a 500 m by-pass will be
constructed to divert the long-distance traffic onto
the Lome-Cotonou road, avoiding the city so as not
to clog the main commercial street; and
(b)   the road alignment of the next 3.2 km will be straight-
ened, thus avoiding the village of Glidji.
Construction of the Agou-Notse -/ Road
3.08      Construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km) to gravel standards has
two ob4ectives: to open to agricultural development an isolated area of some
900 km , and to provide a reliable all-weather connection between Notse, an
important food surplus center, and the Klouto-Agou area, which faces a con-
tinuous food shortage. This road project constitutes the Government's first
priority in the highway subsector.
3.09      Along the proposed alignment, the first 16-km section from Agou
(Gadjagan) to the village of Kati is a track barely passable during the rainy
season. The track crosses the Sio River just before Kati on a 20-m long,
one-lane bridge built in 1931. After Kati, the track becomes a footpath on the
following 20 km to the Haho River where a 32-m long, one-lane bridge was
constructed in 1966 under the financial assistance of the FRG. The next
15-km section is an earth track barely passable during the rainy season.
3.10      The works proposed under the project would consist of constructing
an 8-m wide, two-lane laterite road. The surfacing is restricted to a 20 cm
wearing course of selected laterite materials. On about half of the total
1/   Formerly Nuatja.

length, however, the existing soils are of poor quality and require an addi-
tional sub-base course. The design speed is 80 km/h, which is quite suitable
given the flat terrain. A few sharp curves have been maintained at approaches
to the two existing bridges, for which improvement is not presently justified.
Slopes in the drainage region of the Agou Mountain are limited to 4.5% to
avoid surface erosion. PWD will be assisted by consultants in supervising the
construction works.
Purchase of Road Maintenance and Workshop Equipment
3.11      RD has two betterment and three regravelling brigades, equipped for
the most part with equipment bought in 1971 under the First Highway Project
(para. 2.26). Together, these brigades have a potential capacity of 200 km a
year, and thus are well adapted for the periodic maintenance needed approxi-
mately every six years on the 1,200 km of gravel and earth roads under RD's
responsibility (para. 2.01). However, the trucks, bought after international
competitive bidding, proved ill-adapted for the heavy type of work which they
have to carry out. They have become subject to frequent breakdowns and must
be reassigned to easier routine maintenance activities in the subdivisions.
The proposed project would finance the procurement of four dump-t-lwks and two
water tank trucks for each betterment brigade, and three dump-truc-
regravelling brigade. In addition, one diesel tank truck and one nb 
maintenance truck would supply fuel and help to maintain the equipment          -
five brigades. This equipment (with estimated costs, net of taxes, as
of January 1977) is listed below:

Technical Assistance and Fellowships to PWD
3.13      The First Highway Project provided for 241 man-months of technical
assistance to RD and the Equipment Division under the Highway Maintenance
Program (1969-1973), and the ongoing Second Highway Project provides for
another 130 man-months as an extension of the previous program during the
1974-1976 period. This technical assistance has helped the Government to
train operating staff, reorganize maintenance operations and improve the
maintenance of road equipment (paras. 2.24-2.27). The main shortcoming
of the technical assistance was its inability to train Togolese professionals
and subprofessionals, because of the lack of Togolese counterparts and ade-
quate premises in RD to accommodate new personnel. RD's dilapidated and
overcrowded premises deterred the setting up of the maintenance unit. PWD
wanted to appoint an engineer with several years of in-the-field maintenance
experience to manage the maintenance unit, but could only find a subdivision
head who first had to receive two years of additional education at the Engi-
neering College of Bamako (Mali).
3.14      The Togolese engineer who was appointed head of the Equipment
Division in 1973, early in the execution period of the project, was adequately
trained, but three additional Togolese professionals (the head of the main-
tenance unit, the head of the central workshop and the equipment inspector)
were only appointed in January, February, and September 1976 respectively.
Two key positions, the maintenance inspector and the head of the betterment
brigades, are still vacant. It is thus necessary to extend technical assis-
tance for highway maintenance under the proposed project in order to complete
the training of local staff for a period of up to two years and to fill
organizational gaps which still hamper productivity. The main task of
the consultants will be to continue to train the managerial staff, as well
as the clerks and technicians who will be hired as soon as the maintenance
unit can occupy larger premises (para. 2.12).
3.15      The technical assistance for maintenance, not including the road
planning and design unit (para. 3.16) and supervision of construction work,
would comprise 77 man/months divided as follows:



-28 -
(i) a road engineer and mission leader (for a 22-month
period) who would train the chief of the maintenance
unit, advise the head of RD on maintenance
matters, and define and supervise all training acti-
vities;
(ii) a maintenance advisor (22 months) who would advise
the maintenance inspector and field subdivision heads
in the execution of all manual and mechanized mainte-
nance works carried out either by the subdivisions
with their own equipment and staff or by the regravel-
ling brigades, and would train Road Sector heads;
(iii) a road foreman (11 months) who would advise the head
of the betterment brigades and train their staff; and
(iv)  an equipment advisor (22 months) who would advise the
chief of the Equipment Division and complete the train-
ing of the Central Workshop staff.
The consultants' terms of reference have been agreed upon. In order to
guarantee adequate use of technical assistance and its total phasing out at
the end of two years, agreement has been reached on the provision of suffi-
cient local staff to operate the maintenance unit not later than October 1,
1977. Dispatching technical assistance experts will be subject to availa-
bility of counterparts on all positions.
3.16      The RD intends to strengthen its planning and design unit in early
1978 (para. 2.12), and will need a road engineer/economist for 20 months to
help organize the unit and to train the local staff. The project will provide
necessary funds to hire a consultant for this task. The planning and design
unit will be in charge of preinvestment studies and planning. Large prein-
vestment studies will still be carried out by foreign consulting firms, which
the unit will supervise, while undertaking the smaller studies itself. In the
economic and planning fields, the unit will first have to collect and analyze
traffic data, vehicle operating costs, and construction and maintenance costs,
and then assess benefits from road investments versus benefits from road
maintenance. It will then prepare road investment plans and the annual
investment budgets. Its terms of reference have been agreed with the Govern-
ment. In order to guarantee maximum benefit from the technical assistance,
agreement has been also reached on the provision of adequate managerial and
operating staff to run the unit not later than May 1, 1978.
3.17      PWD also intends to strengthen its soil testing laboratory which
is still underequipped. Some additional equipment is being purchased under
the Second Highway Project, and a new building, currently under construction,
should be ready by the end of 1977. The road laboratory would be set up



- 29 -
as a self-supporting, autonomous agency under the assistance of the French
CEBTP (Centre Experimental de Recherches et d'Etudes du Batiment et des
Travaux PuK 3ics), which manages or assists several state-owned road labora-
tories in French-speaking Africa and has already carried out various assign-
ments for RD. The project would directly support the development of the
laboratory by closely associating it with the supervision of construction
of the Aneho'Tabligbo and Agou-Notse roads.  The laboratory would be respon-
sible for executing all material testing and would second the necessary per-
sonniel aDel eqWiprncrit to the two consultants' teams in charge of construction
supervisjot.}  These se)vices would be financed under the proposed project as
constructiou) supeyvis,ioi expenises.  If the road laboratory were not able
to provide sUf b services from the beginning of construction, the super-
vising conqsu.i:i-is would make their own arrangements, probably at a higher
cost.
3,18      TrJ10( p:JeT  also provides for four fellowships to allow four young
DPNW w'lg-" C' S,luated from Togo's College (para 2.19), to receive two
years sinp,,Icmentaiy education at the Polytechnical College of Bamako (Mali).
Technical Af;isaijce to MCT
3.19       The Government has agreed to create a Transport Planning and
Coordination UDit within the Ministry of Commerce and Transport in order to
strengthen overall transport planning and assist in solving the main issues in
the transport sector (paras. 1.20 to 1.24).  In general, the unit will:
(a)   organize collection of the necessary data and then define an
optimal transport policy for the country;
(b)   plopose this optimal policy to the Government;
(c)   piepare future Five-Year Development Plans and follow the
ib,lementation of the ongoing Plan in the transport sector; and
d)   coordinate transport modes, particularly rail and road.
The unit will also directly carry out or supervise the execution of several
studies which will help the Government define and implement a strategy to
improve the efficieipcy of the transport sector. To be included are:
(a)   a study on th  improvement of CFT operations (para. 3.21);
(b)   a study of current and future supply and demand for
surface transportation (para. 2.10); and
(c)     jeview of the level and implications of taxation on
road users (para. 2.32).
The outline terms of reference of the unit have been agreed upon, and the
Governmevnt has asked the Association to review and discuss the work of
the unit from time to time.



- 30 -
3.20       The Government has also agreed to set up the unit not later than
March 31, 1978, and to put an experienced Togolese economist acceptable to the
Association in charge. In addition, the unit will be staffed with two Togo-
lese engineers and another Togolese economist. To assist the unit during its
early stages of development, the project provides for 72 man-months of consult-
ing services. A team of expatriates will comprise an economist and mission
leader for about 3 years (or 33 man-months) on permanent assignment, and
several experts specialized in the various transport fields who will be hired
on temporary assignment (for a total of 39 man-months) to provide their
expertise as needed by the unit.
Study of CFT Operations
3.21       The CFT is experiencing losses on its operations, and the Govern-
ment, anxious to overcome the deficit (paras. 1.21 and 1.23), will commission
Consultants financed under the project to study adequate measures to improve
CFT's finances. The consultants will analyze: (a) staff productivity and
potential reduction in operating costs; (b) tariffs; (c) personnel training
needs at all levels; (d) the need to introduce commercial and performance
accounting systems; (e) deletion of non-productive investments; and (f) in-
creased diversification (such as in road passenger transport). The Government
and the Association will agree on the terms of reference of the study and on
the choice of consulting firms, and together will review the Consultants'
draft report. The study is estimated to take some 8 man-months to complete,
and the final report will be submitted not later than December 31, 1978. The
Government will implement the recommendations of the study as soon as they
become available.
Study for Organizing Feeder Road Construction and Maintenance
3.22       The Association is preparing a possible feeder road project (para.
2.13). To speed up the preparation of this project, the proposed highway
project provides for about five man-months of consulting services to assist
the Government and the Association in (a) defining the most appropriate
organizational framework to construct and maintain feeder roads; (b) identi-
fying the roads to be improved; (c) reviewing the existing equipment and work
shop facilities; and (d) defining staffing, equipment and workshop needs. The
consultants will also help prepare bidding documents for equipment purchases,
which will allow an earlier implementation of the feeder road project.
Preinvestment Studies of the Bassar-Mango Road
3.23      Preinvestment studies of the Bassar-Mango road (137 km) will,
in a first stage, identify the alternative routes for the existing track and
their economic feasibility. The Government and the Bank will review the first
stage studies to decide together the detailed engineering studies to be
undertaken in the second stage. Terms of reference for the preinvestment
studies have been agreed upon.
3.24      The isolated area to be served by the road has good agricultural
potential, since it has sufficient rainfall and 80% of the land is suitable



- 31 -
for cultivation. The area is currently under-populated since only 20%
of the usable land is under cultivation. If accessible, the area could
receive some of the inhabitants of the neighboring over-populated Lama-Kara
region. A proposed Cotton Development Project, which aims at improving
the income of about 40% of the inhabitants in the area, will also benefit from
this road.
3.25      The first section of the Bassar-Mango road (Bassar-Kabou, 22 km)
is a reasonably well maintained all-weather earth road. The second section
(Kabou-Guerin Kouka, 37 km) is hardly passable during the rainy season. From
Guerin-Kouka on, the road becomes a track which stops after 18 km at the Kara
River, where the ford has been washed out by floods. There is a gap of 48 km
between the Kara and Koumongou rivers. The last 12-km section between the
Koumongou River and Mango is a very poor track~
3.26      In the near future, Bassar will be 1:iked to Sokode, along the
main Lome-Upper Volta road axis, by a paved road to be constructed und',
African Development Bank financing.  Improvement of the Bassar-Mango  od
would permit access to partially or totally isolated areas, opening them
up to planned agricultural development. In the long run, Sokode-Mango via
Bassar will become a 35 km shorter and easier alternative to the existing
paved Sokode-Mango-Upper Volta border road via Lama Kara, which winds through
a mountainous area considerably increasing transportation costs; the proposed
alternate road will go through a less mountainous region.
B. Project Cost and Financinig
3.27       The total capital cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is
estimated at US$12.9 million equivalent, with foreign costs of about US$11.0
million (85%); taxes and duties total about US$2.4 million equivalent, and
other local costs about US$1.9 million equivalent. Total cost including taxes
and duties would amount to US$15.3 million. Estimates reflect prices as of
January 1977. Project costs are summarized on page 32. Chapter III, Table I
gives details of the project cost and Chapter III, Table 2, gives further
details of the technical assistance cost.
3.28      The foreign cost component of civil works following the worldw-lde
inflation since 1973 has changed only slightly from 65% to 66%, which means
that the increases in local and foreign prices are about the same. The
foreign component of equipment procurement is estimated at 90% of total cost,
which also includes local preparation and delivery. Equipment will be pro-
cured free of duties and taxes. The foreign component of consultants' services
is estimated at 80% for construction supervision and road preinvestment
studies, and 90% for other studies and technical assistance. No taxes are
levied on consultants' services in Togo. The fellowships are entirely a
foreign cost.

3.29      Reconstruction cost of the Aneho-Tabligbo road has been estimated
on the basis of unit prices and quantities from the substantially completed
detailed engineering, and 10% for physical contingencies has been added.
The reconstruction cost per km (including contingencies) amounts to US$91,000
net of taxes and supervision at January 1977 prices. Construction costs for
the Agou-Notse road are based on the lowest evaluated bid received in November
1974, when the road construction had to be postponed. Due to the generally
poor quality of soils found in the area, physical contingencies of 15% of the
total amount of works have been added. The construction cost per km (includ-
ing contingencies) amounts to US$57,000 net of taxes and supervision at
January 1977 prices. Costs for the road maintenance and workshop equipment
are based on consultants' estimates using CIF prices of January 1976.
3.30      The cost of construction supervision has been estimated in detail
and amounts to about 8% of construction costs. The cost of technical assis-
tance is based on man-month unit prices (Chapter III, Table 2). Those
unit prices have been estimated on the basis of similar services in Togo. The
billing rate for consulting services is estimated at US$4,100-6,500 per field
man-month, according to the man's qualifications, and comprises salaries and
overhead (home office expenses, expatriate allowances, social security,
proposal preparation and other indirect expenses). Reimbursable expenses
payable to consultants are estimated at US$1,400-1,700 per field man-month
including housing, internal and external travel, and telecommunications.
Fellowships are estimated at US$5,000 a year, including travel. The cost of
road preinvestment studies is estimated at CFAF 1.2 million (US$4,800) per km,
on the basis of recent similar studies carried out in Togo and comparable
countries.
3.31      Updating of 1974 and 1975 prices to January 1977 prices and calcu-
lating price contingencies after January 1977 have been done in the following
way:
(a)  local price variation indices, including local and
foreign parameters, have been used to update prices
until beginning January 1976, the latest time at
which these indices were available; and
(b)  price increases estimated in accordance with expected
international price trends have been used to calculate
price variation for 1976 and price contingencies for
1977-1980.
The increases expected are shown below:

1980                      7%                            10%
Local and foreign price increases are assumed to be the same.
3.32      The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at
US$11.0 million equivalent. IDA's contribution cannot exceed US$10.0 million;
therefore the Government has agreed to meet US$1.0 million of foreign costs,
as well as all local costs and any potential project cost overrun. The finan-
cial plan is as follows in millions of US$ net of taxes:
Local          Foreign       Total       %

C. Implementation
3.33      Implementation of the project elements will be the responsibility
of the MEPS through its PWD except for the transport planning and coordination
unit, the study for the improvement of CFT operations, and the study for
organizing the construction and maintenance of feeder roads, which will be the
responsibility of the MCT.
3.34      The expected implementation schedule for the major activities
of each project element is shown on the bar chart below. The project will
take nearly four years to complete, from April 1977 (expected date of Credit
Agreement signature) to December 1980. Both road construction works should
start at the end of 1977 and last approximately 18 months.  Road maintenance
and workshop equipment should be delivered by the beginning of 1978. Techni-
cal assistance for the maintenance program under the Second Highway Project,
which will end in April 1977, would be extended for another two years from
October 1977 to September 1979, but the mission leader will remain in the
field after the end of the Second Highway Project to provide continuity of
services. Technical assistance for the road planning and design unit would be
provided for two years as soon as the new PWD premises are completed in early



- 35 -
1978. Technical assistance for the transport planning and coordination unit
would be provided for three years between January 1978 and December 1980.  The
study of CFT operations would be carried out from January to September 1978,
and the feeder road study between May 1977 and March 1978. Road preinvestment
studies would be carried out from October 1977 to July 1979, with a review of
feasibility studies by the Government and the Bank in mid-1978.

D. Procurement
3.35      The reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road would be carried out
by contract awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Bidding documents would include
an appropriate price adjustment clause. Prospective bidders would have to be
prequalified.
3.36      Bids for construction of the Agou-Notse road on an international
competitive basis had already been called in 1974 and opened in November
of that year, when this item was deleted from the Second Highway Project.
Recently, the rate of inflation has been low in Togo, and from October 1974
(base of the bid) to December 1975 (last known indices) the contract price
adjustment clause went up by only 0.1% for earth moving, 4.0% for pavement
and 2.4% for structures. The Association does not object to the Government
awarding the contract to the bidder with the lowest evaluated bid of 1974,
provided that the contractor extends the validity of his bid. Otherwise,
bids will be called again on an international competitive basis.
3.37      The Government intends to award construction supervision contracts
to the consulting firms which carried out the detailed engineering of the
road improvements: Gendron Lefebvre for the Aneho-Tabligbo road and DIWI
for the Agou-Notse road respectively.
3.38      The road maintenance equipment would be procured after interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. Bidders would not be prequalified but would compete on the
basis of cost, delivery time and reliability of after-sales service. Due
consideration would also be given in bid evaluation to matching the equip-
ment to be purchased with existing equipment in order to simplify equipment
maintenance. Workshop equipment, amounting to an aggregate of about US$50,000
including contingencies, would be procured after local advertising and competi-
tive bidding in accordance with procurement procedures of the Government ac-
ceptable to the Association. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed
a preference of 15% or the level of applicable duty, whichever is less, when
comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufacturers.
3.39      The Government wants consultants Louis Berger International, Inc.
to continue providing technical assistance for the maintenance program begun
under the First and Second Highway Projects. The Government would try to
obtain an expatriate road engineer, who may be financed by bilateral aid
(such as FAC), to organize the planning and design unit. The proposed
project will provide funds for this position if the Government cannot
find financing elsewhere by early 1978. Other technical assistance and
study items will be carried out by qualified and experienced consultants
according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.

E. Disbursements
3.40      Disbursements would be made for 57% of the total cost (including
taxes) of the road construction works, corresponding to 86% of the estimated
foreign exchange cost. Disbursements for all other items of the project
would be made for 100% of the estimated foreign exchange costs (or 60% of
local expenditures for equipment locally procured). Based on these partici-
pation rates and on the project implementation schedule, a projected disburse-
ment schedule is shown below:

3.41      Should funds remain in the Credit account after project completion,
they would be used to reimburse the Government for part or all of its share in
financing foreign costs of the project, and to procure additional road main-
tenance equipment to be approved by the Association.

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
4.01      The economy of Togo is predominantly agricultural, which at its
present level of development generates only modest levels of transport de-
mand. In the economic field, the two major long range objectives of the
Government are to increase (a) the output of agriculture and (b) the pro-
duction and processing of raw materials. The proposed project is designed
to help achieve the first objective by providing better and cheaper road
communication throughout the country through more efficient road maintenance
operations, and in two specific areas by the reconstruction of one road and
construction of another. Reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road would
reduce transportation costs between the coast and the agricultural area
around Tabligbo, which is also the site of a major industrial plant (CIMAO)
soon to be built. Construction of the Agou-Notse road would open up an al-
most inaccessible area with good agricultural potential. The latter is par-
ticularly important for agricultural development, because experience with the
construction of the Palime-Atakpame road a few years ago demonstrated that
spontaneous population migration occurs when a new road is constructed in
an area with good agricultural land in Togo. The project would also improve
the Government's highway maintenance and planning capacity and its overall
transport coordination.
4.02      The proposed road reconstruction and construction are justified
and expected to yield an economic return (ER) of about 22% and a benefit/
cost ratio of about 2 at 12% discount rate. The rate of return on the rural
development package in the Agou-Notse area will be of the same magnitude. The
other elements of the project (purchase of highway maintenance and workshop
equipment, technical assistance to PWD and MCT, and studies) were not included
in the ER calculation since they are either marginal extensions of an ongoing
maintenance program with a good rate of return (First Highway Project with a
continuation under the Second), or new elements to strengthen the Government,
increase the efficiency of the railways and prepare future projects.
B. Reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 km)
(a) Background
4.03      The Aneh-Tabligo road crosses a densely populated region (300
inhabitants per km ) important for the production of palm-oil, manioc,
cassava, yam, maize, vegetables and fruit. Additional income is derived
from breeding small animals (sheep, goats, pigs). The Association, under
the Mlaritime Region Rural Development Project, and other aid agencies are
helping the Government to develop the region's agricultural production for
both export and for local consumption. The region has one of the highest
rates of immigration in Togo. Two-thirds of the country's oil palm planta-
tions and the only palm oil processing plant are in this region. The CIMAO



- 41 -
Regional Clinker Project will soon help the region to diversify its economy.
The plant site is along the Aneho-Tabligbo road, about 2 km from Tabligbo;
construction work is due to start in October 1977.
(b) Traffic
4.04      Traffic volumes on the Aneho-Tabligbo road were determined on the
basis of information collected by the consulting firm Gendron Lefebvre and on
traffic data regularly collected by PWD. These counts showed that daily traf-
fic in 1974 averaged 362 vehicles per day on the whole road, with 651 vehicles
per day on the first section (Aneho-Anfouin, 12.5 km), 340 vpd on the second
(Anfouin-Amegnran, 16.5 km) and 170 vpd on the third (Amegnran-Tabligbo,
15.7 km) (para. 4.05). In addition the road carries some slow-moving agri-
cultural equipment and a significant amount of bicycle and pedestrian traffic
particularly on market days. Truck traffic accounts for almost 40% of all
traffic on the road. Details of the traffic composition by category of
vehicle and by road sections in 1974 are shown below:
Road Sections
Aneho-Anfouin Anfouin-Amegnran Amegnran-Tabligbo
12.5 km           16.5 km             15.7 km
v.p.d.      %  v.p.d.         %    v.p.d.        %
Passenger car                    430        66   214         63     97          57
Light trucks (less than 5t)    163          25    68         20     51          30
Medium trucks (5 to 20 t)         46         7    51         15     20          12
Heavy trucks (20 t and more)    12           2     7          2      2           1
TOTAL                    651       100   340        100    170          100
4.05      Loads consist mainly of oil palm nuts, fruit, maize and other
food products for consumption in Aneho and Lome or for export via Lome. The
fuel and construction material traffic is also expected to grow rapidly
because of the planned construction work in the region, particularly the CIMAO
regional clinker plant. A traffic growth rate of 5% has therefore been assumed
between 1974 and 1978. For traffic growth rates during the 20 year period
following reconstruction of the road (1979-1998), a best estimate and a low
estimate have been employed, as shown below:
Year                          Average traffic growth rates p.a.
best estimate               low estimate
First period:  1979-1988                   10%                         6%
Second period:  1989-1998                   5%                         5%



- 42 -
4.06      The best traffic estimate foresees a traffic growth rate of 10% p.a.
during the first ten-year period. This is slightly higher than the estimated
traffic growth rate of 8-10% in the whole country for the 1976-1980 period
(para. 2.05). Indeed, the region will be in the forefront of economic ac-
tivity, and the road links the major city of that region with the national
capital and the port facilities. During the second ten-year period, traffic
growth is forecast at 5% p.a. Even the low traffic estimate leads to 1,000
vpd on the first section by 1983, 500 vpd on the second by 1982 and 500 vpd on
the third by 1994. Traffic on the third section may still be underestimated
under both estimates beyond 1982, because it is not possible to quantify now
the commuting traffic which will be generated by the CIMAO plant. This will
depend upon where the workers live, which has not yet been determined.
(c) Construction and maintenance costs
4.07      The cost estimates, exclusive of taxes, which were used in the eco-
nomic evaluation are shown below in millions of CFAF at October 1975 prices.
They were the basis from which the January 1977 costs of page 32 have been
projected.
Item                                 Cost
Construction (including phys. cont.)             874
Supervision of construction                       78
Total Construction                    952
Physical completion of the road is foreseen as follows:  25 km in 1978 and 20
km in 1979. Investment expenditures are therefore expected to be 60% in 1978
and the remaining 40% in 1979. Maintenance costs have been assumed the same
with and without reconstruction. This is a simplifying and conservative
assumption, because it  underestimates the costs of maintenance without the
project, as increasing expenditures would be required to maintain the road at
its current state without major investment.
(d) Transport costs
4.08      Transport costs are based on operating typical vehicles with esti-
mated average loads as indicated below (see also para. 4.04). In this
case they are:
Passenger car (Peugeot 404 station wagon, 9 passengers)
Light truck   (Toyota HILUX 1600, average load 1.2 ton)
Medium truck  (Ford K 700, average load 6.0 ton)
Heavy truck   (Berliet GR 900, average load 7.5 ton)



- 43 -
The operating costs of these vehicles on a paved road in poor condition
(the existing Aneho-Tabligbo road) and on a paved road in good condition
(as the road will be after reconstruction) are shown below net of taxes
in CFAF per km at October 1975 prices:
Category                                       Paved road
of                                  Condition
Vehicle                             Poor         Good          Saving
Passenger car                       43.8         27.4       16.4 or 37%
Light truck                         41.8         23.8       18.0 or 43%
Medium truck                        97.8         50.7       47.1 or 48%
Heavy truck                        137.8         71.1       66.7 or 48%
These vehicle operating cost figures indicate savings after reconstruction
averaging 40% for passenger cars and light trucks and 48% for medium and
heavy trucks.
(e) Benefits
4.09      Benefits from road construction were quantified as savings in
vehicle operating costs from improved road conditions, that is, average
daily traffic by section times 365 days, times vehicle operating cost sav-
ings per km, times number of km per section. Other benefits, such as time
savings to drivers and vehicle occupants, increase in riding comfort, and
reduction of accidents, were not included. The savings are shown below in
millions of CFAF for the estimated 20-year lifetime of the road under the
traffic growth estimates discussed above. In spite of the road's partial
completion in 1978, no benefits have been counted in that year, but in return
full benefits have been counted in 1979, when the last 20 km are expected to
be completed.

(f) Economic Return
4.10      Based on a construction period of 18 months and an economic life
of 20 years, economic appraisal of the above mentioned costs and benefits
shows that reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road is justified. The
overall economic return on its reconstruction is estimated at 26% under the
best traffic growth rate estimate. A separate analysis has also been carried
out for each section of the road. On the two first sections, the ER is above
or in line with the overall return. On the third section, Amegnran - Tabligbo,
where traffic is lower, the ER is 13%. As explained in para 4.06, however,
the traffic assumptions for Amegnram - Tabligbo are very conservative, since
the additional traffic generated by the CIMAO plant has not been quantified.
The overall ER is still about 18% under the low traffic estimate. The overall
benefit/cost ratios at 10% and 12% interest rates are 2.9 and 2.4 under the
best traffic estimate and 1.8 and 1.5 under the low traffic estimate.
(g) Sensitivity
4.11      To determine the sensitivity of the ER to variations in the estimated
costs and benefits (apart from the sensitivity to traffic changes as analyzed
in the best and low traffic estimates), an analysis was carried out, assuming
overall increases in costs and benefits separately and simultaneously. The
results of this analysis, which are summarized below, indicate that, under the
best traffic estimate, with costs increasing or benefits decreasing by as much



- 45 -
as 165% and 65% respectively or with a simultaneous increase in costs and
decrease in benefits of 45% the ER would still remain about 11%. Even the low
traffic estimate can retain an ER of 11% with a cost increase of 65%, a
benefit decrease of 40% or a simultaneous change of 25%.

Costs + 45%, Benefits - 45%                  11
(h) Major Beneficiaries
4.12      It is expected that, in the first round of distribution, the major
beneficiaries of traffic cost reductions would be the local truck owners and
operators, but that the cost reductions will later be passed on to the farmers
of the region and their families (about 200,000 people in total) in the form
of higher farm gate prices due to lower transport costs or slower increases
in transport costs because of the competitive situation in the road transport
industry. Farm gate prices are basically set by the Government in cooperation
with OPAT, which is also responsible for collecting and exporting agricultural
products.
C. Construction of the Agou-Notse Road (51 km)
4.13      A two-lane gravel road between Agou and Notse was originally approved
by the Board of Directors as part of the Second Highway Project in Togo, but
cost escalation in other components of that project forced deferral of the
Agou-Notse road. This road would serve two functions. First, it would provide
a reliable all-weather connnection between the Klouto area near Agou, which
faces regular food shortages, and Notse, an important market located in a food
surplus area; currently, the only possible routes via Atakpame or Tsevie are
more than three times longer. Second, and most important, it would open a new
area for agricultural production, as there are now only two sections of barely
passable track, about 30 km long in total, at each end of the chosen alignment
but with the 20 km long middle portion practically missing (para. 3.09).



- 46 -
The preinvestment studies were first carried out by consultants between
1970 and 1972 on the basis of vehicle operating cost savings on traffic on
the two existing road sections and the increase in value added to be produced
in the zone of influence of the road. Subsequently,,additional studies
carried out by consultants in 1976 indicate that the project is likely to
have a higher return than was originally appraised. Conservative assumptions
on vehicle operating cost saving and on the expected increase in net economic
benefits from new agricultural production attributable to the road would be
sufficient to yield a rate of return of 18%.  Sensitivity tests indicate that
the project would be justified even with substantial variations in costs and
benefits. As there are clear indications that enough complementary develop-
ment is firmly planned in the road zone and spontaneous in-migration will take
place (para. 4.01), it was considered that the costs of further studies to
develop a more elaborate economic justification of the whole rural development
package would not be justifiable.
4.14      The major beneficiaries of the new road will be the 15,000 people
who live at present in the project area and an estimated additional 30,000
who could settle in the project area and become communal landowners there
through clearing and developing the land. These new settlers are expected to
come mainly from the Cabrais regions in the north, where pressure on the land
and prolonged drought have made life very hard.
D Other Project Elements
4.15      Procurement of road maintenance and workshop equipment and of
technical assistance for road maintenance under the proposed project should
allow PWD to carry out all routine maintenance of paved roads and periodic
and routine maintenance of unpaved roads of the primary and secondary net-
work more efficiently. Properly planned maintenance operations usually have a
high ER, and the addition to overall efficiency due to the purchase of new
trucks and the transfer of inadequate ones to lighter duty, the purchase of
additional workshop equipment and the continuation of some necessary technical
assistance is expected to be great.
4.16      The project al- 4provides some technical assistance for the train-
ing of the personnel of the road planning and design unit and for the transport
planning and coordination unit, and for a study of the railway operations, a
study of the organization of feeder road construction and maintenance, and a
pre-investment study for a major road in the north (Bassar-Mango). The
former is an important institution-building element of the project, and the
latter will most probably lead to improved railway operations, a much needed
feeder road project and an economically well justified investment in an
area now basically undeveloped because of its physical isolation.



- 47 -
E. Risks
4.17      There are no unusual risks involved in this project.  The Aneho-
Tabligbo road reconstruction improves an already existing axis with large
traffic volumes and, therefore, presents the lesser risk of the two roads.
Part of the benefits expected from the construction of the Agou-Notse road are
closely linked to immigration into the zone influenced by the road, but even
the risk of this not occuring is minimal because when the Palime-Atakpame
road was completed, Cabrais people from the north resettled in the region with
minimal support from Government agencies. That occurred in the late 1960's and
early 1970's, and since then the Sahel drought ravaged the northern regions
increasing the incentive for these people to move to the south. The only ele-
ments which may not be a complete success under this project are the various
technical assistance components. In particular, it may take a while for the
overall transport planning and coordination unit to gain the experience and
the political influence necessary to have an important effect on policy-
making.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      The following items were discussed and agreed with the Government,

ATTACHMENT:
ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
OF THE CONSTRUCTION ITEMS KEPT IN
THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT (Credit 450-TO)
AFTER COST INCREASES
A.   General
1.         The Second Highway Project (Credit 450-TO, US$8.7 million) was
appraised in November/December 1972, and approved by the Board on November 27,
1973. In addition to technical assistance to the Government and preinvest-
ments studies, it comprised three construction items:
(a)   rehabilitation of the paved road Blitta-Sokode (78 km);
(b)   improvement of the Sokode-Tchamba-Kambole road (75 km) to
gravel standards; and
(c)   construction of the Agou-Nuatja (now Notse) road (51 km) to gravel
standards.
The project suffered considerably under the 1973-1974 world-wide inflation,
and bids received in November 1974 showed on average a 60% increase over
appraisal estimates. Consequently the Government decided to delete construc-
tion of the Agou-Notse road and improvement of the Tchamba-Kambole section
(except for six small bridges) from the project. Rehabilitation of the Blitta-
Sokode road started in March 1975, and will be completed in May 1977, with a
five month delay due to the necessity to stabilize with cement the new base-
course of the road because of an unexpectedly steep rise in the traffic. Im-
provement of the Sokode-Tchamba section and of the six bridges on the Tchamba
Kambole section started in October 1975 and was completed in November 1976.
PWD will soon start gravelling the Tchamba-Kambole section by force account
under its own budget.
B.   Economic Justification
2.         The economic justification of the two roads at appraisal was
based on the expected reduction in vehicle operating costs. Other benefits,
including induced agricultural development, increased transport reliability,
time savings and reduction in accident costs were described qualitatively but
not quantified in the estimation of economic returns. The same methodology is
used in the revaluation and leads to the conclusion that with expected returns
of 29% and 14% the road investments were justified even with the substantially
increased costs (paras. 8 and 9).

C.   Construction Costs Estimates
3.         Original cost estimates at 1973 prices and actual construction
costs at October 1975 prices (both net of taxes) are as follows:
---------------CFAF million---------------
Appraisal estimates        Actual costs
(1973 prices)      (October 1975 prices)
Blitta - Sokode
Construction                                     947                   1,692
Construction supervision                          78                     142
Total                             1,025                   1,834
Sokode-Tchamba
Construction                                    204                     389
Construction supervision                         16                      59
Total                               220                     448
The actual construction costs for the Sokode-Tchamba section are the total
costs of the contractor's contract for the Sokode-Tchamba-Kambole road minus
the construction costs for the six bridges on the Tchambe-Kambole section.
Actual construction costs are higher than estimated at appraisal, by 79% on
Blitta-Sokode and 104% on Sokode-Tchamba.
D.   Vehicle Operating and Maintenance Costs
4.         The vehicle operating costs used in the reevaluation are derived
from those used in the appraisal of the proposed Third Highway Project (para.
4.08) but include costs for heavier vehicles which do not often travel on the
roads of the Third Highway Project. They are given below in CFAF per kilometer,
net of taxes, at October 1975 prices:
Paved road                  Unpaved road
Condition                      Condition
Good          Poor      Good gravel        Poor earth
road             road
Passenger cars and light
trucks                            27.4          43.8          34.0              59.4
Medium trucks                      50.7          97.8          62.3             137.5
Heavy trucks                       71.1         137.8          88.9             193.5
Truck-trailers                     88.9         172.2         111.1             242.0



- 51 -
The increase in operating costs for passenger cars is 94% between appraisal
time and October 1975. It is difficult to make that comparison for other
vehicles because the vehicle types used in the Second and Third projects
differ somewhat.
5.         For the Blitta-Sokode road, maintenance costs have been assumed the
same with or without rehabilitation, since it is doubtful that PWD could
extend maintenance operations if the road surface is deteriorating rapidly.
For the Sokode-Tchamba road, maintenance expenditures are estimated at CFAF 11
million per year on the gravel road, including routine and periodic mainte-
nance. Practically no maintenance was carried out on the former earth road.
No maintenance costs were given in the appraisal report.
E.   Traffic Forecasts
The Blitta-Sokode Road
6.         Traffic has been growing fast on the Blitta-Sokode Road, from 175
vehicles per day in 1972 as reported in the appraisal report to 320 in 1975
and 430 in 1976. This results mainly from the general growth of Togo's
economy but also somewhat from the efforts made by the Government to attract
import and export traffic to and from some Sahelian countries (Mali, Upper
Volta and Niger) through the port of Lome. The breakdown of the average daily
traffic for 1975 and 1976 is as follows:
Number of Vehicles
1975          1976
Passenger cars and light trucks               256            302
Medium trucks                                  53            113

The Sokode-Tchamba Road
7.         The average daily traffic given in the appraisal report is 105-110
vehicles in 1972. Traffic data collected by PWD for the 1972-1976 period are
somewhat erratic, but they indicate a growth from some 70 vpd in 1972 to some
100 vpd in 1976. There are indications that the 1972 traffic data collected
by consultants and included in the appraisal report may have been overesti-
mated. The breakdown of 1976 average daily traffic is as follows:

For the future, a traffic growth of 8% p.a. has been assumed for the next
10 years, and of 5% for the remaining 6 years of the expected 16-year life of
the road.
F.   Conclusion
8.         The appraisal report expected returns of 22% for the Blitta Sokode
road and 16% for the Sokode-Tchamba road. The economic returns at project
completion are re-evaluated at 29% for the Blitta Sokode road and 14% for
the Sokode-Tchamba road. This shows that the road investments were justified
even after substantial cost increases before and during implementation.
9.         Construction costs and vehicle operating costs have both approxi-
mately doubled between appraisal and completion of the project. For the
Blitta-Sokode road, the higher ER found in the re-evaluation is due to an
unexpected traffic increase of about 150% between 1972 and 1976. For the
Sokode-Tchamba road, the estimated ER at appraisal is slightly higher than the
re-evaluated ER, mainly because construction costs increased about 10% more
than vehicle operating costs.
