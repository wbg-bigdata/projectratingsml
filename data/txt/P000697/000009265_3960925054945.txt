URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1366-ET)
PREFACE
This ".s the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Urban
Development Project in Ethiopia for which Credit 1366-ET in the amount
of US$20 million was approved on May 15, 1983. The Credit was closed on
August 16, 1991, at which time the remaining balance of SDR 18,371.83
was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Eastern Africa Department in the Africa Reqion (Preface, Eviluation
Summary Part I, and Part III). Preparation of the report was started in
June 1991 and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Development Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.
The Borrower's comments on the Project have been abstracted from
their report entitled "The Addis Ababa Urban Development Project Project
Completion Report" of February 1990.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The objectives of the Project were to:
(a)   implement a new resource-efficient housing policy based on
modest standards, self-help and individual initiative, thus
easing the burden on public finances;
(b)   strengthening the financial and professional capabilities of
the Housing and Savings Bank which would play a central role
in implementation of the housing policy;
(c)   improve health and environmental conditions through upgraded
services and sa-:tation whir.; should ultimately improve
productivity within affected populations;
(d)   reform policies and practices regarding maintenance of urban
infrastructure and housing with a view to ultimately
reducing rent subsidies and improving the efficiency of
public resource utilization; and
(e)   strengthen two other key urban institutions dealing with
land: the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing and the
Addis Ababa Central Association (i.e., Administrative
Region).
Implementation Experience
The project was essentially completed by the original closing
date of June 30, 1990 albeit with a slight delay in construction of
houses and community facilities due to delays in obtaining the Board
approval, the shortage of building materials and change in project
scope. The closing date was once extended to June 30, 1991 to permit
continued operational support to project agencies while awaiting
effectiveness of the follow-on IDA Credits. Total amount disbursed from
the Credit was SDR17.98 million out of the total Credit amount of SDR18
million. The Credit was closed and the remaining balance was canceled
in August 1991.
Results
The Project is viewed as being successful in meeting its
principal objective of implementing a new, more resource-efficient
housing policy based on modest standard, self-help, individual
initiatives and cost-recovery. The physical targets of the Project were
achieved substantially as planned, and in some cases, even surpassed.
Other project objectives which were largely achieved are:
(a)   the Housing and Savings Bank was assisted in its
professional and financial development;
(b)   access, drainage, water supply and environmental conditions
in the upgrading area were considerably improved;



iii
(C)   the review of rental housinq policies led to the adoption of
a policy of divestiture of rental houses;
d)   road maintenance and sanitation policies and practices were
reviewed and a program of assistance was incorporated into
the follow-on urban project; and
(e)   the capabili'ies of the two key urban institutions, MUDHC
and AAAR, were also strengthened.
Sustainability
The Project has proved to be sustainable as evidenced by the
excellent mortgage loan repayment history (100%) maintained by project
beneficiaries. AAAR's efforts to maintain infrastructure services have
not kept up with the need but their capacity is being strengthened under
a follow-up urban project being financed by IDA.
The replicability of the project approach has been demonstrated in
at least one oth3r donor-financed project currently under
implementation. UNCDF is financing a $7.9 million project in Addis
Ababa. The Lafto Project, designed according to the principles of the
project's Nefas Silk scheme, will accommodate about 1,500 low-income
households on newly serviced plots.
Findinas and Lessons
The principal lessons learned include the following:
a)    Community participation in project planning, design, and
management was a key ingredient to the overall success of
the Project. Sensitive community organization efforts
mounted by the project unit resulted in the formation of
cohesive and effective housing cooperatives whose self-help
efforts were responsible for the efficient construction of
low-income dwellings for owner occupac:on;
b)    A central aspect of the effective community organization
which characterized the Project was the process of group
formation based on the workplace, i.e., housing co-
operatives were formed on the basis of groups working for
the same employer. This facilitated, inter alia, the
release of workers from their jobs thus improving the co-
ordination of mutual self-help construction activity.
c)    Project implementation was scheduled in such a way as to
delay the completion of road construction until most of the
house construction was completed. This meant that remedial
works to the road network needed to repair damage caused by
the movement of heavy construction vehicles and equipment
were minimized;
d)    The establishment of special project implementation units
outside of agencies normally responsibile for municipal
services and shelter development should be avcided if any
long term institutional development is to take place. A
follow-up urban project in Addis Ababa was implemented
directly by the city administration while the project unit
set up under this project was given the responsilility to
implement a project directed at selected market towns: and



iv
e)    The nationalization of housing stock and the policy of rent
control by the Government led to both the diminution and the
deterioration of the existing housing stock owing to lack of
incentives for maintenance. The Government revised its
rental housing policy and adopted an approach to give back
the nationalized housing stock to the private sector.
However, implementation of the policy change had to be made
into a _ondition 'f disbursement under the follow-on
project.

Subsector               Urban
2. Background
2.01     Addis Ababa, the nation's capital, had a population of 1.3
million in 1982, making it the largest city in Eastern Africa between
Cairo and Johannesburg. Jt was growing at an estimated annual growth
rate of 6.5% which was expected to cause it to double in size in the
next ten years, and to further strain its already inadequate physical
infrastructure and housing. The vast majority of its urban dwellers
were severely impoverished and suffered from unhealthy environmental
conditions.
2.02     The 1974 Revolution fundamentally reordered social and economic
relationships in Ethiopia. Nationalization of urban land and "extra"
(rental) houses disrupted the existing system of shelter development,
which heavily depended on private investments for rental dwellings,
without replacing it with a new system. As a result, a monumental urban
housing shortage existed at all income levels. The capital also
suffered from serious deficiencies in urban services and particularly in
maintenance operations, and existing housing areas throughout the city
needed improvement.
2.03     The new Government was committed to improving the living
conditions of the poor -- both urban and rural -- who constituted the
majority of the population. In the urban sector, the Ministry of Urban
Development, Housing and Construction (MUDHC), which was responsible for
town planning, administration of urban land, superviaion of
municipalities and housing policies, had started implementing sites and
services housing programs emphasizing self-help for the lower-income
groups with EEC assistance in nine secondary towns. Experience gained
from this program was useful in designing the IDA-supported Project.
Recognizing that it had neither the manpower nor the financial resources
to undertake the role of landlord for the entire urban population,
Government's housing policy was based on large-scale, low-cost shelter
construction by owner-occupants rather than on provision of rental
units. Standards were to be affordable to the urban population.
2.04     Bank strategy in the urban sector was to focus initially on
assisting Government to implement its housing policy by improving the
delivery of serviced land and housing and strengthening its housing
finance system. It was also to assist it to preserve and more
efficiently utilize existing municipal services and shelter.
Strengthening existing urban institutions, both financially and
professionally, was another key element of the strategy. The Project
was viewed as an important first step toward achievement of these goals.
3. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.01       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the Project were to:
(a) implement the new resource-efficient housing policy based on
modest standards, self-help and individual initiative, thus
easing the burden on public finances;



-2-
(b) Etrengthen the financial and professional capabilities of the
Housing and Savings Bank (HSB) which would play a central role
in implementation of the housing policy;
(c) imnprove health and environmental conditions through upgraded
services and sanitation which should ultimately improve
productivity within affec'ed populations;
(d) reform policies and practiceb on maintenance of urban
infrastructure and housing with a view to ultimate1y reducing
rent subsidies and improving the efficiency of public resource
utilization; and
(e) strengthen two other key urban institutions dealing with land:
the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Cunstiuction
(MUDHC) and the Addis Ababa Administrative Region, then called
the Central Association (CA).
3.02       Proiect Components.  The Project focussed primarily on key
investments in the capital city of Addis Ababa with minor support for
important secondary towns and provided for:
(a) development of about 2,950 serviced plots for residential,
commercial and industrial 7-rposes, construction loans for
development of about 2,700 houses through self-help, upgrading
of infrastructure for about 800 existing families and
construction of community facilities at the Nefas Silk site
in Addis Ababa;
(b) upgrading of road, drainage, water supply and solid waste
systems and provision of loans for upgrading of pit latrines
and houses at the Tekle Haimanot community, the most congested
residential area adjacent to the main market in Addis Ababa;
(c) provision of essential equipment and spare pa.ts for Addis
Ababa Municipality for refuse collection and improvement of
roads;
(d) establishment of a loan fund for construction of community
facilities in project areas or for other development
activities in Kebeles (neighborhoods) throughout Addis Ababa;
(e) housing construction loans for self-help upgrading or new
dwelling construction; and
(f) provision of training, advisory services, studies of urban
transport operations, rental housing and road maintenance,
management support for project agencies, and preparation of a
future urban project.
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.01     The Project was primarily designed as a pilot demonstration in
Addis Ababa of lower-cost approaches to housing development and
upgrading of infrastructural services based on the priority requirements
of the city at that time. As this Project was the first IDA-supported
project of its kind in Ethiopia, the physical designs of the schemes,
which were being developed by the implementing agencies, evolved during
the early years of implementation, taking into consideration materials
availability and local practices. While it was always expected that new
houses would be developed utilizing self-help techniques, it was not
originally envisioned that construction would be carried out exclusively
by housing cooperatives (groups of families who build together), a
Government policy which turned out to be highly successful.



-3-
4.02     Given the limited experience of Government in implementing
sites and services and upgrading programs in the past, the scope and
scale of the Project were considered appropriate. The Project was
timely in that it was launched when Governi.,ent was beginning to evaluate
the impact of nationalization policies of urban land and rental houses
and was considered a useful demonstration of a public-private
partnership in housing development, employing cost recovery of the
services provided thereby reducing the burden on the Government's
budget.
4.03     MUDHC was to be the key implementing agency for the Project,
responsible for design and construction of al: physical works, except
maintenance and community facilities which were to be the responsibility
of the AAAR. For its purposes, MUDHC established (on a temporary basis)
a project implementing unit, the Urban Development Project Off.:ce
(UDPO). However, as AAAR was responsible for development programs in
the capital, it was questionable why responsibility for desi n and
implementation of the sites and services and upgrading projeG's was
vested in a temporary office under MUDHC created solely for the purpcses
of the Plroject rather than in AAAR. These overlapping roles later led
to confusion and a less than satisfactory working relationship between
the two agencies. Although this arrangement did not hamper physical
implementation which was largely carried out by contractors, it did
create difficulties in recordkeeping, confusion with regard to the
financial obligations which were to be absorbed by AAAR upon transfer of
the assets created, and institutional rivalry.
5.  Project Implementation
5.01     Implementation Schedule.  The Project was originally scheduled
to be completed in four years and the original closing date was set at
June 30, 1990. Most of the project components were completed in about
five-and-a-half years by mid-1988, except for some of the community
facilities and the feasibility studies for the follow-on projects. The
main reasons for the delay over appraisal estimates were:
(a) due to significant delays in obtaining board approval caused
by the second suspension of lending operations in Ethiopia over
compensation issues, implementation of the Proje.cc began more
than a year later (by 2/84) than the schedule shown in the
appraisal report (early 1983);
(b) shortages of certain building materials, particularly during
the last three years of the Project, slowed down construction
of houses and community facilities; and
(c) changes in project scope, particularly the othe  towns
component and the addition of the middle/higher income plots.
5.02     Despite these delays, the Project was essentially completed by
the original closing Date of '1une 30, 1990. The Closing Date was
officially extended, however, .y one year to June 30, 1991, to permit
continued operational support, including training, to project agencies
while awaiting effectiveness of the follow-on IDA credits and to permit
delivery of the remaining equipment and vehicles for UDPO and other
urban areas. Disbursements were discontinued and the oustanding balalnce
of SDR 18,371.83 was cancelled in August 1991.
5.03     Project Risks  Of the potential risks identified at appraisal,
only the building materials shortage proved to have significant
consequences.



-4-
6. Proiact Results
6.01     Project obiectives.  The Project is viewed as being successful
in maeting its principal objective of i.mplemesnting a new, more resource-
efficient housing policy based on modest standards, self-help and
individual initiative.  Recovery of appropriate development and housing
costs of the sites and services component is currently in process which
will permit replicability of the scheme and ease the ourden on public
finances. While the proportion of poor households (defined as those
below the 77th percentile of the urban income distribution) benefitting
from this scheme was somewhat less than the appraisal target (64% versus
70% at appraisal), this was primarily due to the inclusion of an
additional area earmarked for middle and higher-income families not
originally envisioned which lowered the overall proportion in relative
terms although not in absolute numbers (2,025 lower-income households
benefitting versus 1,890 lower-income households estimated at
appraisal).
6.02     other project objectives were also largely achieved, with some
exceptions. HSB was assisted in its professional and financial
development which helped it to smoothly implement the housing
construction loan component. Access, drainage, water supply and
environmental conditions in the upgrading area were considerably
improved, although improvement of houses and pit latrii:.s was not
achieved, as most houses were owned by the Government and rented out to
the occupants who had little incentive to borrow funds to undertake the
improvements. Rental housing policies were reviewed and Government
subsequently approved a policy of divestiture of rental houses in order
to reduce rent subsidies and increase the incentives for maintenance.
Implementation of the divestiture policy had not started when the
project was closed. Road maintenance and sanitation policies and
practices were additionally reviewed and a program of assistance in
these areas has been included in the follow-on urban project. The two
other key urban insitutions, MUDHC and AAAR, were also strengthened in a
number of areas, and this is expected to improve their respective
abilities to successfully implement the follow-on projects.
6.03     Physical Results  The physical targets of the Project were
achieved substantially as planned, and in several cases, even surpassed.
The implementation results are shown in Table 4 in Part III. The key
variances between actual results and appraisal targets are described
below.
6.04     Variances Between Appraisal and Actual Results  The major
changes in proiect design during implementation were:
(a) Residential/Commercial/Industrial Plot Development. The number
of residential plots developed at Nefas Silk was substantially higher
(37%) than planned due to (i) the inclusion of plots which had been
originally earmarked for future development of middle/higher income uses
along the main accessways but which were in-orporated during this phase
to provide a more balanced community in terms of income groups and house
typcs and (ii) the addition of plots on the slope at the edge of the
development which previously was judged difficult to be accommodated due
to the terrain. Also, adjustments were made in plot sizes and numbers
of commercial and industrial plots in response to demand, resulting in a
smaller number of generally larger plots.
(b) Utilization of House/Building Construction Loan Funds. Due to
lack of demand for: (i) building construction loans at Nefas Silk by
commercial and industrial beneficiaries who preferred to utilize their
own funds, (ii) house and pit latrine improvement loans at Tekle
Haimanot by residents who were primarily rentors and, therefore, did not



-5-
wish to borrow for improvements, and (iii) house construction loans by
residents in other urban areas who could obtain loans at a more
attractive interest rate than under the Project (4.5% versus 5.0%), the
Bank and Government agrced that the construction loan funds earmarked
for these purposes would be utilized for the substantially increased
residential demand at Nefas Silk.
(c) Additional Eguipment Purchases With the Bank's agreement,
gains in the loan account resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were
utilized to purchase additional equipment and vehicles for (i) other
project towns (Jimma, Asmara, Dire Dawa, Bahir Dar) to be used in
construction of lower-income housing schemes and maintenance of urban
roads (in lieu of housing construction loans mentioned above) and (ii)
UDPO for site preparation for housing development schemes included in
the follow-on -arket Towns Development Project.
(d) Communal Water Standpipes The number of standpipes was lower
than originally planned both at Nefas Silk and Tekla Haimanot due to the
greater number of individual connections than expected, therefore
requiring fewer communal water points.
6.05     Financial Performance   At appraisal, projections of HSB's
financial statement.*. were made for the period from FY1982 to FY1986.
During this period, HSB's loan portfolio grew more slowly than
anticipated. Its medium and long-term loans increased to B 252.6
million in FY1986, as compared with the estimated B 329.3 million at
Appraisal. As a result of this slow growth in the loan portfolio, HSB's
gross profit fell behind the estimates at Appraisal. Its surplus before
taxation and provisions was B 2.9 million in 1986 compared with the
estimated B 10.6 million.   Consequentlv, HSB's cash position became
tight; a percentage of cash against the amount of deposits was 8%
compared with the estimated 18% at Appraisal.   After FY1987, HSB1s
performance improved significantly. Its loan portfolio increased to B
423.0 million in FY1990, which was 67% increase from the balance in
FY1986. This was mainly attributed to a major increase in lending to
housing cooperatives. HSB's earnings showed improvement, which
reflected the fact that as its operating revenue grew due to the
increase in the volume of lending, its operating expenses decreased due
to the lower interest rates and HSB's greater efficiency in loan
administration. Its surplus before taxation and provisions increased to
B 17.1 million in FY1990 from B 2.9 million in FY1986. HSB's collection
performance was enhanced by the action plans proposed under the Project
and provisions for bad loans were accumulated to B 15 million as of the
end of FY1990. HSB's state capital was also increased from B 6.0
million to B 15.7 million in FY1990.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.01     The project has proved sustainable as evidenced by the
excellent mortgage loan repayment history maintained by project
beneficiaries. AAAR efforts to maintain infrastructure services have
not kept up with the need but their capacity is being strengthened under
a follow-up urban project being financed by IDA.
7.02     The replicability of the project approach has been demonstrated
in at least one other donor-financed project currently under
implementation. UNCDF is financing a $7.9 million project in Addis
Ababa. The Lafto Project, designed according to the principles of the
Nefas Silk scheme, will accommodate about 1,500 low-income households on
newly serviced plots in Addis. Two follow-up operations modeled in part
on the project were financed by IDA, viz., the Second Addis Ababa Urban
Development Project and the Market Towns Project.

8. Bank Performance
8.01     Under the Project, the Bank made a positive contribution to the
development of shelter policies in Ethiopia through the demonstration of
more appropriate approaches to addressing the serious shortages of
housing and municipal services. The Bank has also provided sound advice
aimed at supporting the institutional development of key urban service
delivery and credit agencies.
8.02     The Bank's performance during the project cycle was generally
satisfactory, although the assistance provided during the preparation
stages of the Project was unusually heavy in terms of staff time and
costs and frequency of visits (173 staff/weeks and 15 visits over six
years). While this is partly explained by the suspension of lending
activities to Ethiopia over compensation issues, the primary reason was
the Bank's own involvement in project design rather than requiring (as
is normally the case) Government to retain a full-time design consultant
(through a PPF advance) to work with the implementing agencies, which
were inexperienced in preparing these types of project components. In
the end, the Project was designed in an iterative manner by the
implementing agencies with guidarce and advice provided by visiting Bank
missions, which proved to be very costly and time-consuming (though
consistent with the then still experimental practices of the Bank's
Urban Sector).
8.03     The Bank's supervision effort was more than aiequate, with 16
missions fielded over eight years. The missions were appropriately
staffed, technically strong and provided good staff continuity (only one
change in task management responsibility during implementation).
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     The Borrower's performance during the project cycle was
generally very good, particularly during implementation which proceeded
smoothly. This is evidenced by the consistent overall rating of 1
(minor or no problems) by Bank staff of the project's progress
throughout the project period. The establishment of a coordinating
committee consisting of senior officials of all implementing and utility
agencies, which met regularly to discuss project issues, contributed to
this exceptional performance. All implementing agencies carried out
their respective responsibilities well with a few exceptions.
9.02     Some problems were experienced during the upgrading of
infrastructure at Tekle Haimanot due to poor coordination with the Addis
Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA). The road maintenance and
reconstruction works were undertaken without prior consultation with
AWSA and consequently existing mains were sometimes damaged, with the
result that some residents were deprived of water service which was
intended to be upgraded. Repairs to the mains interrupted the road
works, but in some instances the road contractor carried on regardless.
The follow-on projects have required coordination with utility agencies
during the early stages of preparation to ensure proper cooperation,
acceptability of designs and proper phasing of improvements in the
future.
9.03     As mentioned previously (para 4.03), MUDHC, through UDPO, was
the key implementing agency for the Project. In retrospect,
establishment of special project implementation units (UDPO in this
case) outside of agencies normally responsibile for municipal services
and shelter development should be avoided if any long term institutional
development is to take place. In this Project, UDPO was strengthened
during implementation, but due to the temporary nature of the office and
the uncertainty of future work, many of its staff resigned when the
Project was nearing completion, thereby losing a valuable experience.



- 7 -
The follow-on project in Addis Ababa is being carried out by
municipa'ity staff and this should consolidate the Region's capacity for
urban development. While the role of UDPO under this Project was
questionable, it has proved to be a useful vehicle under the follow-on
Market Towns Development Project for supporting secondary towns which
fall under the direct responsibility of MUDHC for their development
programs and which are generally very weak in terms of implementation
capacity. The permanency of this office, however, should be established
shortly so as to permit it to retain the experience and expertise gained
during the follow-on project.
10. Proiect Relationships
10.01     The Bank's relationship with Government and implementing
agencies has been good throughout the project period.
il. Consulting Services
11.01     Various consultants, contractors and suppliers were engaged
during implementation of the Project and performed generally
satisfactorily, with one notable exception. The subconsultant (local
firm) to the main consultants carrying out the feasibility and design
studies for the follow-on urban projects was inexperienced in design of
municipal i;.frastructure and housing schemes and lacked proper
management and motivation to complete the work within a reasonable time
period. The quality of the work produced was unacceptable, containing
numerous errors and inconsistencies. While Government and Bank staff
tried to build up this design capability within the firm through the
guidance and advice provided, the firm was insensitive and unresponsive
to the requirements of its client. This has resulted in considerable
delays (six months to one year) in initiating these components under the
follow-on projects due to the substantial time and energy required by
Bank staff and the relevant project agencies in reviewing and correcting
the designs and in completing the bid documents.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01     The original documentation for the project was adequate,
providing a useful framework for both the Bank staff and the Borrower
during implementation. Good recordkeeping by project agencies
facilitated preparation of this PCR, which was based on a draft PCR
prepared by UDPO under the old format.
13.   Findings and Lessons
The principal lessons learned include the following:
a)    Community participation in project planning, design, and
management was a key ingredient to the overall success of
the Project. Sensitive community organization efforts
mounted by the project unit resulted in the formation of
cohesive and effective housing cooperatives whose self-help
efforts were responsible for the efficient construction of
low-income dwellings for owner occupation;
b)    A central aspect of the effective community organization
which characterized the Project was the process of group
formation based on the workplace, i.e., housing co-
operatives were formed on the basis of groups working for
the same employer. This facilitated, inter alia, the
release of workers from their jobs thus improving the co-
ordination of mutual self-help construction activity.



- 8 -
C)    Project implementation was scheduled in such a way as to
delay the completion of road construction until most of the
house construction was completed. This meant that remedial
works to the road network needed to repair damage caused by
the movement of heavy construction vehicles and equipment
were minimized;
d)    The establishment of special project implementation units
outside of agencies normally responsibile for municipal
services and shelter development should be avoided if any
long term institutional development is to take place. A
follow-up urban project in Addis Ababa was implemented
directly by the city administration while the project unit
set up under this project was given the responsibility to
implement a project directed at selected market towns; and
e)    The nationalization of housing stock and the policy of rent
control by the Government led to both the diminution and the
deterioration of the existing housing stock owing to lack of
incentives for maintenance. The Government revised its
rental housing policy and adopted an approach to give back
the nationalized housing stock to the private sector.
However, implementation of the policy change had to be made
into a condition of disbursement under the follow-on
project.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The following text has been abstracted from the Borrower's Project
Completion Report of February 1990 (pages 40/41):
"....Some relevant and vital issues shall be high lighted here under:
1.    The IDA loan, which was geared towards residential construction on
serviced site and upgrading of one of the most congested slum area is a
prototype to the country (sic).
The loan has enabled the Government to increase its volume of investment
in shelter development; on particular, it strengthened the financial
base of the HSB and the institutional capabilities of agencies involved.
2.    The approach and methodology employed, i.e., self-help housing
scheme on serviced site proved to be appropriate to enable the urban
poor (80% of the total urban population) whose monthly income is less
than Birr 250 construct their dwellings.
This assertion is in harmony with the achievement of the project where
75% of the low-income beneficiaries are earning below Birr 250 per
month.
Projects similar to Nefas-Silk should be set up elsewhere by bringing
housing costs down to affordability ranges through the use of
alternative building materials, cheaper housing forms and lower
infrastructural standard (cost) to embrace the very lower income groups.
3.    The Tekle-Haimanot upgrading scheme that was meant to address the
urban poor was successful in the construction and improvement of roads
and drainage. Nevertheless, the program failed to meet its objectives
in physical upgrading of houses and construction of pit latrines.
These omissions are serious: that the program should be re-established
as a pilot exercise.
4.    Establishment of an independent and autonomous project
implementing office with efficient operational and institutional
procedures proved pertinent in the undertaking of the Urban I Program.
The felt need of society expressed in the objective of the project
promoted effective participation by beneficiaries that accelerated the
success of the project.
5.    In the course of project implementation, it was found prudent to
produce major building items based on cost benefit analysis and
procurement of building materials and equipment that are not
domestically available.
6.    To preserve the achievements of the project it is essential to
prepare beneficiaries to take over the developmental endeavors after the
termination of the project office.
7.    The project has demonstrational and experimental character that
would enable the Government to establish new programmes suited to the
needs and capacities of low-income population."
