MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A TAX ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Russian Federation for the equivalent of US$16.8 million to help finance a Tax Administration
Modernization Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 17 years, including five years of grace.
Country/Sector Background
2.         Progressive improvement in macro-economic stability is a critical condition for the develop-
ment of a sound market economy in Russia. A key condition for stabilization is to reduce the budget
deficit, in part through additional revenue measures. These require improved collection of a number of
taxes, particularly the value-added tax (VAT) and profit tax, which account for more than two-thirds of
government tax revenues at the federal level. More generally, with the move toward privatization and
a vigorous market-oriented economy, the share of revenues collected from state-owned enterprises is
expected to decline and those collected from the growing private sector should increase considerably,
provided tax compliance can be enforced adequately for these new taxpayers. Overall tax revenues are
falling in conjunction with the decline in enterprise production. Onerous tax rates on enterprises must
be reduced and collections increased from an expanding tax base.
3.         The Government is in the process of reforming the tax system. The objectives of the reform
are: (i) to improve the revenue performance of the current tax system; (ii) to reduce distortions; and (iii)
to favor administrative effectiveness. The guiding principles are to simplify the existing regime, to
broaden the tax base, and to reform the taxation of natural resources, energy in particular. The reform
in the design of the tax system and the modernization of the tax administration are mutually supporting.
The simplification of the tax regime facilitates its administration. In turn, a strengthened administration
improves tax collection and the continuing reform of the design of the tax system.
4.         In early 1991, the Government introduced a new financial system basing government
expenditures on a market-oriented system of tax collections. The State Tax Service (STS) was created
within the Ministry of Finance and subsequently became an independent structure with ministerial status
in November 1991.
5.         The STS is charged with managing and supervising nearly all types of taxation in Russia,
including taxes administered by regional and local governments. Tax policy remains the responsibility
of the Ministry of Finance. Initially the STS also performed the functions of criminal enforcement;
however, an independent Tax Police Department was created in 1993 to carry out investigative and
criminal work. The STS has three levels: the federal level, 89 regional offices, and 2770 local offices.
The heads of regional and local offices are appointed by the STS and report to the STS. All staff in the
system are employed and paid by the STS. The staffing strength of the STS has grown from 70,000 in
1992 to 140,000 in 1994, building towards its newly authorized strength of 200,000. The STS evaluates



the performance of regional offices annually, including the application of national standards and
guidelines.
6.          In all, the STS is responsible for administering the collection of 17 types of taxes at the
national level; three taxes at the regional level; and over 20 types of taxes at the local level. In the first
quarter of 1994 the four largest federal taxes accounted for the following shares of total federal tax
revenues: profits tax, 41%; Value-Added Tax (VAT), 27%; income taxes, 14%; and excise taxes, 5%.
7.          Problems. The introduction of the new tax system in 1991 and 1992 was made without
allowing the STS sufficient time and resources to prepare appropriate systems, accounting procedures,
training and information programs for taxpayers. The processing of tax returns and payments was mostly
done manually, procedures for processing returns and detecting delinquent taxpayers varied by office,
and efforts were duplicated because of an organizational structure built along a "type of tax" structure.
8.          The main challenge facing the STS is to change its system from one designed to deal with
a small number of large and trusted taxpayers (state enterprises whose returns were verified for arithmetic
mistakes) to a large number of small and non-trusted taxpayers (private enterprises whose returns need
to be checked systematically for under-reporting). Consequently, all administrative systems must change
and processing capacity must be greatly increased.
9.          The number of taxpayers (legal entities) has burgeoned from  1.3 million in 1992 to 2.2
million in 1994. In addition, most of these taxpayers must file multiple advance payments and returns.
Compared with 1992, 450,000 additional VAT returns and 3.6 million profits tax returns are expected
in 1994; and 1.4 million and 10.8 million additional advance payments for VAT and the profits tax,
respectively.
10.         The STS does not have the capacity to cope with its increased responsibilities and workload
owing to problems in organization and procedures; inadequate processing capacity and lack of adequately
trained staff. First, local tax offices lack a functional specialization. They tend to be organized by type
or location of taxpayer and each unit performs the full range of functions from registration, desk
verification of returns, field audits, and dealing with delinquent taxpayers. This leads to duplications of
functions and inadequate quality. Second, current processing procedures have been derived from the
former command economy in which there were relatively few and large enterprises. Taxpayers are
required to visit the local office to have their returns verified. Tax inspectors-who are assigned about
200-300 enterprises each-then perform a desk review. This is a laborious, staff-intensive process that
slows the collection process and imposes a burden on the taxpayer. Such desk reviews are often
ineffective and fail to detect under-reporting. The assignment of tax officials to specific enterprises also
contributes to graft.  Little effort is made in educating taxpayers of their responsibilities and what
procedures to follow. The tax forms tend to be complicated, often requesting unnecessary information.
11.         A third problem is inadequate capacity to process returns. This will pose costly constraints
on the ability of the STS to capture new revenues as the tax base expands with the growing private sector.
Payments are handled manually, or at best with outdated computing equipment. Lack of automation
means delays in processing payments, the inability to detect deviations (e.g. "stop-filers", delays and
delinquencies), and difficulties in generating accurate and timely information to manage the system as a
whole. The lack of automation also contributes to the inability to develop a computerized audit strategy
for targeting the most promising cases for selection. Finally, the system lacks qualified staff to make tax



- 3 -
administration effective, particularly in the field of auditing. At present staff lack the training and
specialization to carry out effective field audits.
12.         The consequences of the present tax administration system are inequitable (i.e. partial) and
inconsistent application of tax legislation; inefficient use of staff and other resources; inability to easily
detect non-compliance; inadequate collections; and slow processing. These factors result in losses of
revenues.
13.         Government Strategy and Program. With the assistance of the International Monetary Fund
and other donors, the STS has developed a long range, integrated strategy to modernize tax administra-
tion. The first phase (1992-94), currently under implementation with IMF and European Community
assistance, involves a small pilot project to modernize the administration of the value-added tax in two
local offices. The goal of the pilot is to develop and test a new organizational structure, procedures,
automation design and staff training programs that can be used as models for handling other types of taxes
and in other regions. The second phase (1994-97) will add all other federal taxes and two regions
encompassing about 110 local offices. The second phase includes detailed preparations for national
coverage. The third phase (1997-98) calls for the introduction of modern tax administration in 25 of the
largest regions, including 1000 local offices and the fourth phase (1999-2000) would complete national
coverage in the remaining 62 regions and 1600 local offices.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations
14.         Stand-alone tax administration modernization projects are relatively few in the Bank and
most have become effective within the past two years. Relevant examples for this project include
Hungary, the Philippines, Thailand, Jamaica, and Argentina. These were developed with IMF assistance
based on experience with tax computerization in industrialized countries. Experience in countries with
modern tax administrations has demonstrated the potential to achieve: (i) faster, more accurate and
improved tax processing, auditing, and collections; (ii) improved taxpayer compliance; (iii) improved
reporting due to the expectation that computers will detect errors; and (iv) a better managed tax system,
providing accurate information at the central and regional levels, which can facilitate better budgetary
planning.
15.         Best project design invariably has three common characteristics: (i) projects bring a high
level of automation to tax administration activities, not only to gain efficiency in the process of returns
and payments, but above all to improve taxpayer compliance, auditing and collections; (ii) projects
include parallel changes in the organizational structure of the tax administration agency to take full
advantage of investments in technology and training, and to better support data processing, auditing and
collections functions; and (iii) projects include a comprehensive training component to support
implh;aicitation and provide long-term sustainability.
16.         Project designs also recognize the strong influence that tax policies play on the actual tax
administration activities. For example, small variations on thresholds can affect data processing volumes
substantially. Inclusion of extraneous data collection for statistical purposes can affect document entry
time, and hence efficiency and productivity of staff. Changes in legislation or regulations can have
profound influence on application systems. What appear to be simple changes can render whole
application systems obsolete. Keeping systems up-to-date and disseminated to regional and local offices
to maintain uniformity require costly logistics and coordination.



17.         The Hungary operation has now been effective for about fifteen months and is progressing
smoothly, but supervision reports indicate that new computerized tax systems cannot be implemented
efficiently or effectively without significant improvements in tax returns, payment forms, and tax
administration policies and procedures. Computerization strategies must focus on implementing tax
administration reforms rather than simply automating current processes and systems, or merely adding
computer capacity. Moreover, IMF and Bank experience points to the need to try out reforms on a
limited scale, and make corrections on the basis of problems detected, before proceeding with large-scale
implementation of modernization programs.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
18.         The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was discussed with the Board
on May 19, 1994 in the context of the Financial Institutions Development Project (R94-67). At that time,
the Bank recommended an Intermediate Case lending program on the order of $1-1.5 billion annually (not
including quick-disbursing lending). As described in the CAS, the Bank's key objectives in Russia are
to: (i) support the development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (ii) the
provision of physical, social, legal and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the
private sector; and (iii) finance high priority public sector investments. The proposed project is fully
consistent with the CAS. It focusses on institutional development of an organization, the STS, that is a
key to stable fiscal management and indispensable for an effective system of public finance. By financing
the modernization of the State Tax Service, the Bank would contribute to increasing revenues without
increasing tax rates; ensure the continuity and sustainability of the revenue increases; and facilitate
voluntary compliance through a perception of fairness in the application of tax laws. The status of Bank
Group Operations and IFC Investments is shown in Schedule D.
Project Objectives
19.         The overall purpose of the project is to help develop and install an effective and efficient
national system of tax administration. The proposed project would create the infrastructure needed to
collect and process intended tax revenues at reasonable cost and speed from an expanding tax base. The
specific objectives of the project, which is to implement the second phase of the long-term program of
the STS, are two-fold:
a.  To modernize tax administration in 2 regions (Nizhny Novgorod and Volgograd) with
about 110 local offices (Phase 2 of the Government's long-term program) through (i)
reorganization of structures and procedures; (ii) automation; and (iii) staff training; and
b.  To assist in the institutional development of tax administration by (i) building the
capacity of the STS, (ii) preparing for nationwide implementation of tax administration
reforms, and (iii) providing project management support.
To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would finance (i) expert services (Russian and
international), (ii) staff training, (iii) acquisition of hardware and software, and (iv) minor improvements
of offices to accommodate computerization.

Project Description
20.        Organizational and Procedural Reform. The proposed project would introduce a functional
organization in the STS offices and simplify procedures by adopting a self-assessment system and
instituting a system for audits. Taxpayer education would be instituted through staff dedicated to this
purpose and the organization of seminars and informational literature.
21.        Automation. The project would (i) computerize the tax processing of all major federal
taxes, including particularly the VAT and profit tax; (ii) simplify tax forms to make them "user-friendly"
and request only essential data; and (iii) finance the acquisition and installation of computer hardware
for the two regional offices and about 110 local offices. The systems design concept calls for each local
office to be responsible for processing returns relying on relatively inexpensive personal computers linked
through local networks. The volume of basic hardware required would be about 1500 personal computers
and necessary ancillary devices such as file servers and printers. The tax applications systems developed
in pilot Phase 1 would be used, with minor modifications. The same systems development methodology
as in Phase 1 would be used to computerize the profits tax.
22.        Staff Training. The project would finance the development and application of staff training
programs in the areas of taxpayer education, audit, default tax collection and computerization.
International experts would train regional trainers who would in turn train staff in the local offices.
Approximately 3500 staff would undergo training ranging from 4-8 days each. A total of 32,000 staff-
days of training would be provided within Russia. In addition, 220 senior tax officials would undertake
study tours to countries outside Russia that have engaged in tax administration modernization; and 220
tax officials from regional and local offices would attend external courses on "Tax Administration in a
Market-Oriented Environment."
23.        Organizational Development.  The proposed project would finance various studies to
strengthen the capacity and operations of the STS, including:  reorganization of the headquarters;
proposals for interagency cooperation; and a strategy for taxpayer education.  A national audit plan
would also be developed. The plan would specify the percentage of taxpayers by category that should
be audited, conditions that would trigger audits and identify the mix of audit methods to be employed;
it would also define the resources required, staff training implications, and methods to evaluate
effectiveness. A national staff training plan would be developed based on a detailed needs analysis in
relation to the performance of new functions.  Finally, the proposed project would finance a
comprehensive analysis of the legal and regulatory framework of the Russian tax system, with particular
emphasis on implementation and enforcement practice.
24.        Preparation for Nationwide Implementalion. The proposed project would also finance the
costs of preparing for nationwide implementation. This would include: first, an independent review of
systems implementation to date and, second, development of national guidelines and standards on tax
modernization so as to promote consistency of approach and facilitate later systems integration. A
national systems architecture would be developed for implementation of an integrated national
management information system.
25.        Project Management Unit Support. The new organizational structure for local tax offices,
to be implemented in parallel with the automation of these offices, has been planned to take place from
the ground up with little infrastructure support at higher levels of the organization. Higher levels need



- 6 -
strengthening to undertake a project of this dimension. A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been
established at the central level of the STS to provide this support.
26.        Expert Services. The project would finance the services of 15.1 staff-years of external
expert services in such areas as overall project management, software development, forms design,
procurement, taxpayer education, audit planning and conduct of audit examinations.
Project Implementation
27.        The proposed project would be carried out by the State Tax Service (STS). The project cost
is estimated at US$27.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.7 million
equivalent (65 % of project costs) excluding taxes and duties estimated at about US$3.5 million equivalent.
The proposed Bank loan would finance US$16.8 million equivalent (or 95% of the foreign exchange
component and 61 % of the total project costs). The IMF would grant US$0.9 million equivalent (5%
of the foreign exchange component) to provide technical assistance to support the implementation of the
reforms and continue to guide the STS on tax policy and institutional framework for tax administration.
The IMF has helped prepare the project and would be an active partner during its supervision. The STS
would finance 23% of total project costs (US$6.2 million equivalent). Additionally, the Government
would commit the necessary funds for project taxes (US$3.5 million equivalent or 13 % of project costs).
A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events is given in Schedules C. A map is attached. In lieu of a Staff Appraisal
Report, a detailed Technical Annex was prepared and is being distributed separately.
Project Sustainability
28.        The proposed project does not pose any unusual difficulties to be sustained over the long
term. It is an integral part of a long-range program of reforms which enjoys top priority with the STS
and the Government as a whole. The Government, accordingly, has fully budgeted the implementation
expenses that would be incurred by the STS and the project does not require substantially more resources
for the tax staffing budgets. In fact, an integral aim of the project is to use those existing resources more
efficiently. Adequate provisions have been made under the project for technical sustainability. Support
groups would continue at the center to provide technical support and maintenance for the systems installed
under the project. Moreover, provisions have been made for continuous training of staff to keep them
abreast of technological improvements in the system.
Agreed Actions
29.        The following conditions were met prior to Board presentation: formal agreement between
the Russian Federation and IMF on IMF-financed technical assistance; appointment of the heads of the
main project implementation teams; appointment of the disbursement team and adoption of acceptable
accounting rules for the project.
Environmental Aspects
30.        This is a Category C project: "no appreciable environmental impact."



-7 -
Program Objective Category
31.        The proposed project would make a direct contribution to better public administration and
national economic management. More efficient tax administration would enable the Government to
implement its tax policies more efficiently. The management information generated about tax collection
levels and patterns would permit better fiscal planning and budget management.
Participatory Approach
32.        The relevant stakeholders in this operation are authorities in the State Tax Service and
Ministry of Finance. Staff of the STS were closely involved in preparation of the project and directed
the shaping of the project content.
Benefits and Risks
33.        Benefits.  The proposed project would achieve a more effective and efficient tax
administration in two regions, and would prepare the way for modernization nationwide. Increased
effectiveness would be manifested in better tax collections through automation, a national audit strategy
and better management information systems. The project would also contribute to increasedfairness in
the tax system by enabling the application of more uniform treatment of taxpayers. Increased efficiency
would be evidenced in faster processing of tax payments and returns. Automation would mean that the
STS could cope with increased workloads virtually within the envelope of existing resources. The project
would also contribute to expansion of the tax base through more effective registration, better information
systems and better taxpayer education and public awareness. Increased compliance would also be the
result of lowering the private cost of compliance (through simpler tax forms and elimination of need for
enterprises to visit tax offices), increasing the cost of non-compliance (through better detections systems
and more effective auditing) and the perception of increased fairness in the system. All these factors
could contribute ultimately to increased tax revenues.
34.            Risks. The proposed project alone cannot guarantee increased revenues without parallel
action on improving tax policies (e.g. tax simplification). In addition there is a risk that conditions
outside the project would prevent it from realizing its full benefits, e.g. the "protection" levies extracted
by organized crime that reduce tax compliance. Within the project, full implementation of the
modernization program could be compromised by lack of local interest in collection of federal (as
compared with local) taxes and lack of acceptance of the intended reforms. For this reason the project
features the extensive use of "users' groups" to smooth the acceptance of innovations. Staff training is
intended to ensure proper use of the new systems. The pace of implementation could also be affected
by changes in tax legislation or regulations requiring changes in project software. The project counts on
full financing of implementation costs by the Government. These are assured for project execution, but
sustained operation of the reformed tax administration requires adequate salaries and benefits to retain
staff who have been retrained and avoid cuts in critical taxpayer education programs.  Procurement,
delivery and installation of equipment in about 110 different locations is a logistical challenge with the
risk of misplacement or improper installation of equipment. This risk would be minimized through the
inclusion of final installation in bidding documents and use of independent agents for verification.
35.        Overall, the risks have been minimized through the phased approach. This approach permits
adjustments in design based on the lessons from experience in the pilot project. In the final analysis, how-



- 8 -
ever, the greater risk is loss of potential revenues without the project-the STS would not have sufficient
institutional capacity to capture new revenues as the private sector grows and the tax base expands.
Recommendation
36.        1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Bank
and the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
