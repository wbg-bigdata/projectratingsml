                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to move in a positive direction. The first restructuring of the project, which became effective in May 2011, contributed to the consolidation of the
                         public management tools supported by the project and movement towards an integrated approach for results based management. The initial slow down in implementation progress
                         during 2012 was resolved, and following the approval of 2012 POAs for almost all components, implementation of project activities progressed effectively in the second half of the
                         year.

                         Following the Government’s proposal for e-governance related activities falling within the Project scope, an extension of 18 months, from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014, was
                         approved in May 2013. This extension will allow time for completion of these activities and ensure smooth project completion, facilitating progress towards project development
                         objectives. Past e-government related efforts have primarily focused on necessary back-end developments. Front-end focused activities are required to more completely fulfill the

                         part of the PDO aimed at the “consolidation of key public sector management instruments under the CCO’s mandate?, and to fully translate advances into service delivery. The Bank
                         team worked with the counterpart in preparing a proposal to finalize the e-government architecture and roll-out key software (EDAP) that will develop an integrated e-government
                         platform for document management and the provision of centralized electronic process management services within the federal administration, allowing for the implementation of
                         electronic procedures and services for citizens by exploiting and integrating ICT investments made during the life of the project. Digitalization and interoperability will be expanded
                         through a system for processing information and administrative files within and across agencies (EDAP) and the development of a bus of services for exchange of information
                         between agencies, allowing the consolidation and tracking of information, and facilitating the simplification of proceedings for external beneficiaries. The system will also allow the
                         integration of existing databases with information of public officials.

                         Surveys to measure satisfaction rates on services provided as well as understanding of quality standards, goals, and indicators by agencies subscribing to Citizens Charter Program
                         (CCP) are being implemented and results will be available in June 2013. SISEG reports are utilized by the Ministry of Labor, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ARN), the
                         Subsecretariat of Evaluation of Projects with External Financing, and the Secretariat of the Cabinet and Administrative Coordination (with the last being incorporated in 2013).
