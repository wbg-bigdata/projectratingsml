Project
Description:    The proposed operation is designed to support the Bolivian
Government's Emergency Social Fund in its efforts to
address the social consequences of the eoonomio crisis
afflicting Bolivia since 1980. It would support the first
year of the ESP's program, whieh consists of small-scale
employment- and income-generating sub-projects (75% of
funding) and social assistance sub-projects (25% of
funding). The ESF program is targeted to those suffering
most from the effects of the crisis and the economic
adjustment process, such as short-term unemployed,
particularly those affected by the collapse of the mining
industry. The project would support the strengthening of
the ESP through the testing and elaboration of procedures
and criteria for sub-project selection and
implementation. Finally, it would provide support for
planning the second and third years of ESF's program and
associated monitoring mechaniims.
Benefits:        The project offers benefits of three kinds:  first, it
would create about 20,000 man-years of employment.
Second, the sub-projects, including road improvements,
erosion control, and urban upgrading, would improve
infrastructure and the environment.  Third, it would allow
the Government to test mechanisms prio7 to embarking on a
larger program.
Risks:           This is an unusual and relatively risky project which has
been prepared rapidly to address urgent social problems.
The Bolivian Government is under considerable pressure to
relax its economic austerity policies, in order to provide
relief to the unemployed. The ESF program, designed t

diffuse these pressures, involves some risk of uneconomic
use of funds. However, given the modest soale of this
initial phase, strong iS? management and carefuIly
elaborated selection criteria, this risk is manageable and
worth taking. Furthermore, close IDA supervision is
envisaged, with prior approval of sub-projects costing
over US$250,000, and special audit arrangements to ensure
transparent financial management.

PROPOSED CREDIT OF S1D17.8 JmlIO  (us$ic =MOIiNO 3QUIVAxT) TO
T EIIIPUNIC O BOLIVIA
FOR A1N
1.        The following memorandum on a proposed development credit to
Bolivia for SDR7.8 million (US$10.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval in response to a request from the Government of Bolivia for
emergency assistance in addressing the social problems associated with the
acute economic crisis which Bolivia has been facing since the early
1980's. The proposed credit, on standard IDA terms, would help fimance the
start-up phase of the Emergency Social Fund (ESF), involving all ESF
operations for 1987. It would be implemented by ESP.
2.        Background:  Bolivia's economic program, initiated in August
1985, constitutes a coherent and comprehensive policy package to address
the economic crisis. The focus was, initially, on stabilization, to halt
inflation (which was running at some 24,000% a year) and restore balance in
the external account. Key features of the stabilization program were sharp
reductions in Government expenditures and tight monetarr controls. The
Government also launched longer-term structural adjustment measures aimed
at dismantling most price controls, reforming the trade regime,
restructuring ailing public enterprises, and overhauling the tax system.
The challenges inherent in the Bolivian situation were compounded by sharp
reverses in the terms of trade, and above all, the collapse of the world
market for tin, until then Bolivia's chief export. The Government has
pursued its economic policies with remarkable tenacity and has reduced
inflation to less than 20% in the last 12 months. However, staying the
course on policy reform has been difficult, as successive crises detract
from the medium-term effort, which is vital to returning to a sustained
economic growth path.
3.        One important problem is that the pressure of events has allowed
little leeway to address social issues--both the short-term unemployment
problems linked to the depression and, more directly, stabilization
measures, and the enormous baeklog of work that is neeued to improve social
conditions in Bolivia, which rank among the worst in the hemisphere.
Recent figures indicate that the maternal death rate is the highest in the
world and that infant mortality is the highest in the Western Hemisphere.
The Government has concluded that effective action to address social issues
is critical to the success of the economic program, and policies to address
them must come immediately to the forefront.



-2-
4.        To this end, the Government in November 1986 launohed an
Emergency Social Fund, whose aims are to provide emergency relief and to
carry out an employment-generating/economic reactivation program designed
to assist the population groups most acutely affeoted by the economie
crisis, and the most depressed areas. The decree which set up the ESP in
its present form explicitly limits its life to three years: 1987-89. The
estimated cost of the program is about US$50-70 million per year. The
Government has asked for IDA support in: (a) advising on strengthening the
program's desigi- and operating procedures and monitoring its
implementation; (b) mobilizing international financial support; and (e)
financing part of the 1987 program. The Government intends to request IDA
support for the 1988-89 program also; a lending operation for the purpose
is tentatively scheduled for FY88 (subject to good progress with the 1987
nrogram). In conjunction with the second Reconstruction Import Credit, we
are discussing the Government's soeial development policy broadly,
including issues on public sector expenditure and employment policies. The
ESP is thus an integral part of the medium term strategy for addressing
social issues. We will seek to mobilize and coordinate financial support
for the ESF both through this project and, more broadly, under the aegis of
the Consultative Group. There is great interest in the program among donor
agencies, and Bolivia has already secured substantial finanoing eommitments
(see Teehnical Annex, para. 12). Now that the first year ESP program has
been clearly defined, and ESF procedures well elaborated, the government
expects to secure commitments to fill the remaining financing gap within
the next three months.
5.        The Emergency Social Fund reports directly to the Presidency of
the Republic. It is designed to be temporary and to work outside the
Government bureaucracy so that speedy, effective action is possible. It is
to remain a small organization, relying largely on existing loeal
institutions (local communities, non-governmental organizations, etc.) to
identify, prepare, and implement sub-projects. ESP's primary concern so
far has been to establish a sound financial management system and clear
criteria for sub-project desig , selection, and supervision. As of May 22,
ESF had 70 sub-projects under implementation or finally approved, totalling
US$6.8 million, with an average size of US$98,000. Its target for the end
of 1987 is to approve about 60 sub-projects a month, totalling about US$6
million, subject to availability of funding. The sub-projects are directed
to creating temporary Jobs among critically affected groups, notably the
21,000 miners who lost their jobs through the restructuring of COQIBOL (the
state mining company) and their families, and women working in the informal
sector affected by the economic depression.
6.       ESP is staffed by well-qualified inJividuals, most recruited from
the private sector. It is a well-managed, dynamic institution with well
thought-out procedures and sound financial management, but it has yet to
stand the test of extensive experience. The sub-projeots selected to date
promise good economic returns; implementation has begun quickly, and the
volume of sub-project approval is now building up to the point where the
establishment of field offices beoomes warranted. ESP thus offers two
important advantages: it is one of the few institutions which can move
quickly in the difficult environment of Bolivia today, and it offers a
program well designed to make a significant impact in alleviating the
immediate consequences of the current depression.

7.        ProJect Objectives. The proposed project would support ESF's
start-up phase, which is defined as the 1987 program. Its objectives would
be, first, to verify through actual operations (and thereby strengthen) the
managament procedures, operating oriteria and financing of the Emergency
Social Fund; second, to support viable sub-projects; and third, through
monitoring of poverty indicators, to help the Government shape its future
policy on poverty alleviation. During this first phase ESF, with IDA
support, would complete its staffing, gain direct operational experience,
aAd, in ths light of that experience, refine its procedures. The aim would
be to make all of ESF's functional units fully operational by September
1987.
8.        ProJect Description. The 1987 program includes:  (i) consoli-
dating ESP management and operating procedures; (ii) implementing a range
of sub-projects covering both employment and income generation (e.g. road
maintenance and repair, erosion control, urban works, small-seale
irrigation, reforestation, communal buildings, family income projects--75%
of funding) and social assistance (e.g. food distribution,
vaccinations--25% of funding); and (iii) setting up a monitoring/studies
program to assess program impact and help the Government to formulate
medium- to long-term policies for poverty alleviation, health care, and
rural education. The program would involve sub-contracting with local
communities and NGOs; types of etitracts applioable to different
eircumstances would be developed and tested. The proceeds of the Credit
would be lent to the Republic of Bolivia, which would pass them on as a
grant to ESF. ESF, in turn, would use the Credit, in conjunction with
funds from other international donors and the National Treasury, to
finance, on a grant basis, sub-projects proposed and implemented by local
governments, cooperatives, and other community groups, both public and
private, under the technical supervision of appropriate agencies.
9.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Bolivia, one of the poorest
eountries in the Western Hemisphere, faces deep-seated social problems.
These have been exacerbated by the depresaion afflicting the country since
1980. There is potential for serious unrest. The current Government has
launched a courageous program of stabilization and recovery, one element of
which is the innovative Emergency Social Fund which this memorandum
describes. IDA's role in chairing the Consultative Group for Bolivia puts
the Association in a unique position to lead the donor community in helping
the Government to alleviate the social pressures which threaten the
economic reform program, by supporting the ESP. IDA involvement in its
start-up phase will also enable the Association to advise ESP on the design
and implementation of a program which strikes a sound balanoe between aid
to the poor through social assistanc versus aid via productive
employment.
10.      Actions Agreed Upon.  The Government and ESF have aoreed on the
following actions:
(a)  that ESF will complete its staffing according to the agreed
organization chart by September 30, 1987, and consult with the
Association before replacing any staff at director level and
above;



- 4 -
(b)   evaluate all sub-projeots in accordance with its Evaluator's
Guide ("Guia del Evaluador") reviewed during appraisal, duly
modified to reflect agreements with IDA as to the types and eize
of sub-projects for which rates of return are to be calculated;
the out-off economio return will be 12% (Technical Annex, para.
30);
(c)   furnish a summary benefit/cost data sheet for each subprojeot
submitted to IDA for finanoing (Technical Annex, para. 21 and
Attachment II);
(d)   follow procurement procedures satisfactory to IDA (Technical
Annex, para. 20);
(e)   carry out a survey among sub-project beneficiaries as agreed, and
feed back the findings into improvements in the design of its
program; a report will be submitted to IDA by January, 1988 fur
review and comment (Technical Annex, para. 26);
(f)  set up, by September 30, 1987, an inter-agency committee to
coordinate monitoring of poverty alleviation efforts and carry
out macro-level monitoring of the impact of ESP's activities; the
committee will prepare a report setting out proposed improvemonts
to poverty alleviation projects and policies, and submit it to
IDA by March 31, 1988, for review and comment (Technical Annex,
para. 27); and
(g)   keep IDA informed, by progress reports due on September 30 and
December 31, 1987, of its sources and applications of funds
(including co-financing), and submit a completion report on the
1987 program by March 31, 1988.
11.       Justification and Risks. The project would generate three kinds
of benefits: (a) it would create about 20,000 man-years of employment; (b)
the sub-projects would yield direot economic benefits in the form of
erosion control, lowered transport costs, etc.; and (c) it would strengthen
ES? before it embarks on a larger program. The methods adopted for
selecting and implementing sub-projects endeavor to strike a balance
between providing rapid and responsive assistance in a time of crisis, and
ensuring that resources are allocated where they can be most effective.
This implies some risk that funds may be poorly used. To counter this
risk, explicit agreement has been reached on evaluation criteria and
implementation procedures, on technical assistance targeted at sub-project
identification, preparation and appraisal, contraot supervision and
monitoring. Furthermore, IDA will review ex ante all sub-projects with en
ESF contribution of US$250,000 or more, and audit by internationally
recognized private auditors is envisaged to ensure transparent financial
management.

TSRCAL AS= TO TIE
PRESIDENTI'S
Origin of the Project
1.      During the December, 1986 meeting of the Consultative Group on
Bolivia, the Association accepted a lead role in helping to structure the
Government's newly created Emergency Social Fund (BSE). to provide IDA
resources, and to coordinate fund-raising efforts directed at other
multilateral and bilateral sources. The project was appraised in early
May. 1987. Technical discussions and negotiations were held in Washington
from M-ay 26 to June 2: the Bolivian delegation was led by Mr. Fernando
Romero. Executive Director of 1SF.
Objectives
2.      The project addresses the severe unemployment and loss cf income
prevailing in 1987 as the cumulative result of the shrinking of the economy
since 1980, the strict fiscal and monetary austerity measures introduced in
mid-1985 as part of the New Bconomic Policy. and the collapse of tin prices
in late 1985. By helping to finance the start-up phase of ISP's planned 3-
year program, the proposed Credit will serve to develop, through actual
operations. ISF's institutional capacity, with a view to preparing for
further IDA support to the subsequent phase of ISF's program. At the same
time the Project is intended to help mobilize support for ESP among the
international donor community.
Description
3.      The proposed Credit will support the first year of ESF's program,
from January through December. 1987. The program consists of small-scale
employment-generating and income-generating sub-projects (752 of funding)
and social assistance sub-projects (25X of funding), targeted to those
suffering most from the effects of the economic crisis and the economic
adjustment process, such as short-term unemployed. particularly those
This project was appraised by Graham Smith (mission leader), Margaret Grosh
(economist), Steen Jorgensen (economist) and Bruce Fuller (sociologist).

affected by the collapse of the mining industry. The Project also provides
technical assistance to ESF for institutional strengthening and. through the
ESP. to the Ministry of Planning for monitoring the social impact of the
economic crisis and adjustment policies.
4.      The proceeds of the Credit will ba lent to the Republic of Bolivia.
which will pass them on as a grant to NSF. NSF in turn will use the Credit.
in conjunction witb funds from other international donors and the National
Treasury, to finance. on a grant basis, sub-projects proposed and
implemented by local goversments, cooperatives., and other community groups,
both public and private, under the technical supervision of qualified
agepcies.
The Emergency Social Fund
5.      The Government of Bolivia has designated the Emergency Social Fund
as its primary tool for addressing. in the short term the hardships and
social costs of economic adjustment. First formed in 1985. it was
restructured in November, 1986, by a supreme decree as an independent
institution reporting directly to the President. It is to have a life of
only three years (1987-89), will be a financing and supervising agency only.
and will have a staff of no more then 80 persons. At the end of this period
it is to hand over its operations to the appropriate sectoral ministries or
agencies.
6.      ESF is headed by a widely respected and capable businessman, who has
recruited a staff of able. young and highly motivated professionals. As of
early May its entire staff numbered about 50. Its 1987 administrative
budget is between 2 and 32 of its total program amount. By the tenms of the
Supreme Decree. not more than 11 of funds received from the Treasury may be
spent on administration; the remainder must be funded by external donors.
All sub-projects have to be approved by a board of directors consisting of
the President of the Republic as chairman, the executive director, and three
members representing respectively the technical community, the political
community and non-governmental social institutions. The Fund is further
accountable to public opinion through its obligation to report to Congress
every three months on its sources and uses of funds.
7.      The Fund's principal functions are (a) fund-raising. (b) identifying
and encouraging the e velopment of sub-projects addressing the needs of its
target groups. (c) screening and appraising sub-projects. and (d)
contracting for and supervising their implementation. It is organized and
equipped appropriately. though it is still short of staff to operate at its
intended full capacity (see organization chart. Attacbment III). By
September 30, 1987, it intends to complete its staffing, including opening
field offices outside La Paz to develop projects among its target groups and
supervise projects under way. This was confirmed at negotiations. By
December 31, 1987 it will also. in consultation-with the Association.
organize surveys to monitor the impact of its projects and provide feedback
for future operations (para. 17 and 25).



- 13 -
8.      ESE  plans to provide finsacing of US$50-70 million per year. the
exact level depending largely on the international support forthcoming. As
of May 22. 1987, it had 70 sub-projects in operation or finally approved.
122 under evaluation, and some 180 sent back for reformulation, postponed or
refused (Attachment I). It was receiving about 25 requests per week and
approving 10-12 per week, implying a commitment rate of about US$4-S million
per month. By August 198- it intends to be committing at full capacity.
i.e. US$4.8-8.4 million per month depending on financial support. The 1987
program is expected to create about 20.000 man- ears of employment.
-r.
9.      In order to aid in reaching effectively the various components of
the target population, an outreach (tpromocion") unit has been formed to
aBsist in identifying and preparing sub-projects.  Its work is concentrating
in the first stage on the formulation of sub-projects received by the ESF.
Its emphasis will progressively shift to achieving the desired project mix
by tsrget group. sub-project type and location (para. 28-9).
10.    ESF has established operating procedures and selection aud
evaluation criteria which are applicable to all sub-projects.  These
psocedures are well defined and appropriate to the circumstances under which
ES! operates. They include. inter alia. specific requirements to assure
assessment of beneficiaries, conformity with target group objectives, and
economic rate of return standards for larger sub-projects. These criteria
are being effectively applied and the sub-projects approved to date are
soundly designed. Thus, they provide a good basis for the continuing
execution of the first-year program. During the remainder of calendar 1987,
IS? and IDA will continue to review these procedures and criteria. Purther
refinements will be the subject of continuing consultation between ES! and
IDA during preparation and appraisal of the Phase II program.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
11.      ES! plans to comuit a total of US$ 49.9 million in the project
period. If sub-projects still to be approved have the same average cost as
those submitted for evaluation to date (approximately US$100.000). a total
of about 500 sub-projects will be carried out. The total cost of the
project. including technical assistance. will be US$50.3 million equivalent.
of which US$5.1 million equivalent (or 102) will be in foreign exchange
(Table 1). Tax is estimated to be not more than US$3 million equivalent (6X
of the total). No provision needs to be made for physical and price
contingencies, in view of the time-slice nature of the project; any under-
or over-estimation of prices will be accommodated by adjusting the number of
sub-projects committed.

12.    The IDA Credit of US$10 million will cover 202 of total commitments
by BSF through December 1987. Sources of funding for the program are show
in Table 2. Other financing will be sought to fill the funding gap of
US$14.0 million. In the event that less becomes available, the IDA Credit
will not be affected; ESP will defer committing sub-projects beyond those
for which 1002 funding is assured. The Government already bha commitments
from the following donors (though some are subject to restrictions):
Canda. Federal Republic of Germany, Netherlands. Spain. Switzerland. United
Kingdom. USAID, Inter-American Development Bank and UNDP. Further donation.
are being discussed with several of these donors, as well as Italy and the
OPEC fund.

13.      The Credit will be applied against partial disbursements by ESP
against all eligible sub-projects approved by ESP after May 15. 1987 (the
completion of the appraisal mission) and under implementation at the time of
Credit effectiveness (expected to be October 1. 1987) and thereafter until
such time as the Credit is exhausted. Expenditures on eligible sub-projects
made between May 15 and the signing of the Credit agreement will qualify for
retroactive financing up to an aggregate of US$1 million (101 of the Credi.
amount). If other donors choose to finance exclusively about 20% of all
sub-projects. the Credit will be fully disbursed by the end of January.
1988. and will be applied to 400-450 sub-projects under implementation
between October 1987 and January 1988. Other sources will ensure financing
of the gap between the total cost of IDA-assisted sub-projects and IDA's
contribution.
Implementation
14.      Sub-projects will be sponsored (i.e. requested) by municipalities.
co-operatives. NGO's and other community organizations. Civil works and
construction sub-projects will be carried out by local contractors under the
supervision of either the sponsoring agency or, if it is judged to lack the
capacity to do so, a technical agency such as a departmental development
corporation or municipality. Social assistance sub-projects will in general
be carried out by the sponsoring agency under the supervision of a
government department or NGO. Each sub-project will be covered by a 3- or
4-party contract among ESF (as the funding agency), the sponsoring agency,
the contractor (where appropriate) and/or the separate supervising agency.
15.      Sub-projects are expected to take on average 6 months to implement,
with a maximum of 24 months. ESF will disburse 20% of the cost of each sub-
project as a mobilization advance upon signing of the contract. Thereafter
it will make partial payments each mon.. covering the percentage of work
completed, the latter having to be certified independently by both the
supervising agency and an ESP field representative. These arrangements are
satisfactory to the Association.
16.     IDA-financed technical advisors will be hired by ESF (51 domestic
expert-months and 1 international expert-month) at an average total cost per
month of US$1.500 for domestic experts and US$10,000 for international
experts. and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.
17.     IDA's technical assistance to ESF will cover services in the
following areas between June and December 1987: (a) assistance in
establishing a database of benefit information to aid in the appraisal of
sub-projects (3 domestic expert-months to assist an international expert (1
month) to be financed by UNDP); (b) assistance in evaluating sub-projects on
a contract basis (18 domestic expert-months) (c) a survey of the target
population to establish their needs (1 foreign expert-month and 18 domestic
expert-months); and (d) monitoring of project-level effects on the target
population, as well as macro-economic monitoring of the effect of ESP's sub-



- 16 -
projects (12 domestic expert-months). The terms of reference for items (a)
and (b) are in the project file. Those for items (c) and (d) will be
presented prior to Board presentation.
18.     Other international assistance has been agreed upon for project
identification (outreach) and contract supervision costing about $300Q000.
for 100 man-monuhs between June and December 1987. ESF has tentative
commitments from other donors for this assistance. Should it not
materialize, the proceeds of the Credit will be reallocated to cover these
essential needs.
19.     Allowing 6 months time contingency for possible implementation
delays, the project will be completed by July 31. 1988. The closing date of
the Credit will be January 31. 1989.
Procurement
20.     Since all contracts must. by the terms of the Supreme Decree, be for
less than US$750,000 and will be scattered throughout the country, it is
unlikely that foreign contractors will be interested in participating.
ESF's standard procurement procedure is direct negotiation with a contractor
proposed by the sponsoring agency on the basis of a schedule of unit rates
developed and continually up-dated by ESP. The Association has reviewed
this procedure and, in view of the very slow and unsatisfactory experience
with competitive bidding in recent years under current Bolivian law, the
small size of most ESP contracts and their urgency. finds it acceptable for
contracts expected to have a value of up to US$250.000. To avoid holding up
implementation, and considering that about 400 small contracts are involved,
IDA review of such contracts will be made, on a sample basis, by supervision
missions in the field. after signing of the sub-project contract; if any are
found unsatisfactory to the Association, the corresponding amounts will be
deducted from subsequent reimbursements against statements of expenditures
(see next para.).  For contracts expected to have a value  xF over
US$250,000. ESF will employ a local shopping procedure, whereby bids will be
sought from at least three contractors prequalified by the sponsoring
agency. This is expected to apply to about 10% of projects and about 502 of
total project cost. Contracts and bid evaluation for each such subproject
will be reviewed by the Association before IDA makes its first reimbursement
(see next para.). All contractors w..ll have to meet the criteria for
eligibility under IDA's procurement guidelines. These arrangements were
reviewed and agreed upon at negotiations.
Disbursements and Sub-project Review
21.     The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed as follows:
(a) 75% of disbursements by ESF against eligible sub-projects
submitted to the Association; and
(b) 100% of technical assistance.



- 17 -
The initial amount, to be disbursed as soon as the Credit becomes effective,
will reimburse expenses incurred on eligible sub-projects approved and
committed by ESF after May 15, 1987 and meeting the targeting, evaluation
and procurement criteria agreed with IDA (paras. 28-29. 30-31. and 20
respectively), A revolving fund will not be needed, since ESF has sufficient
Treasury funds for working capital. Each month after effectiveness ESF will
submit a request for reimbursement against a statement of expenditures. At
such time the Association will carry out an ex post evaluation of those sub-
projects with an ESF contribution of less than US$250,000, for which
reimbursement of a mobilization advance is requested, and disburse against
only those found to meet the agreed criteria. To qualify for IDA financing.
sub-projects with an expected ESF contribution of more than US$250.000 will
be submitted to the Association for evaluation prior to the award of
contract. For each sub-project. ESF has agreed to submit a summary data
sheet of key benefit/cost indicators. as the basis for the Association's
review (Attachment II).
Accounts and Audits
22.     ESF's accounts will be available for inspection by the Association
at any time. Annually audited accounts will be submitted to the Association
no later than six months following the end of ESFVs fiscal year. Auditing
will be done by an independent auditing firm acceptable to the Association;
arrangements for appointment of this firm will be completed prior to Board
presentation and will include specific arrangements for audit of statements
of expenditures submitted for disbursements.
Reporting
23.     ESF will send IDA progress reports by September 30, 1987 and
December 31. 1987, setting out (among other things) its sources of funds,
including co-financing, and applications of funds. It will also submit a
completion report on its 1987 program by March 31. 1988.
Cost Recovery and Sustainability
24.     ESF requires the same cost recovery arrangements for sub-projects as
those for other projects carried out by the various sponsoring agencies.
This ensures that the institutional framework of each sub-project is
consistent with other similar projects carried out by the same institution.
Cost recovery is explicitly required in the sub-project contracts for
housing. street paving, water supply, and sewerage projects. Certain health
care services funded by ESF also provide for partial cost recovery.
commensurate with the purchasing power of the low-income target population.
Ultimate responsibility for cost recovery lies with the sponsoring agencies.
Their institutional capacity to provide for successful management beyond the
investment period is one of the criteria of sub-project selection (para. 30-
31).



- 18 -
Central Monitoring and Local Feedback
25.     ESF staff are designing surveys to assess the effectiveness of sub-
projects (pars. 17), that will (a) provide basic data on the costs, number
of beneficiaries, derived unit costs, and rates of return for local sub-
projects; and (b) provide more detailed data and qualitative information on
how local project managers can imprQve their organizational effectiveness.
This latter set of information also will inform central ESP staff and donors
on how better project proposals can be identified and supported.
26.     To this end. a quick survey of the target groups specified above
will be supported within the Association's technical assistance allocation.
Little empirical information is currently available on displaced workers'
patterns of migration, employment, family structure. and social quality of
life. A sample of not more than 600 displaced workers will be interviewed
and a report submitted to IDA by January 31, 1988 for review and comment.
The study's objectives are to determine the highest priority economic and
social needs of displaced workers and to delineate how local sub-projects
can be best crafted to address them. The study should be conducted in close
cooperation with relevant planning and statistical agencies, NGOs and with
labor associations representing displaced miners and other workers.
27.     An inter-agency committee will be formed by September 30, 1987, to
assess the aggregate impact of local sub-projects on macro-economic
conditions, especially in reducing under-employment and the resulting social
costs. The committee will be chaired by the Minister of Planning or his
representative, and include representatives of ESF, the National Institute
of Statistics (NIS) and the Unit for Economic Policy Analysis. The aim of
this effort is to determine the adequacy of the ESF initiatives in
addressing the broad effects of the on-going economic adjustment. ESF
projects will reach but a fraction of all unemployed, under-employed and
impoverished people that are touched by the current crisis; and ESP relief
will only be of a short-term nature. Therefore, as the Government and the
Association track the long-run social impact of economic adjustment, an
assessment of ESF's discrete impact within this broader context is
important. As a part of this study. ESF staff will explore the feasibility
of expanding the existing urban household survey (conducted by NIS) to
include a sample of rural households and to identify the rates of
participation by displaced and under-employed workers in ESF-funded
projects. The schedule for these project-level and macro-level monitoring
actions was confirmed at negotiations.
Target Groups and Beneficiaries
28.     The target group of ESP is the part of the population most affected
by the economic crisis and other segments of the population whose
nutritional and health levels have reached critical levels. This
specifically includes the unemployed miners, other workers dependent on the



- 19 -
mining sector, and dismissed public sector employees. as well as the
fa-ilies of the above, and women in the informal sector.
29.     In selecting sub-projects. BSF matches their location with available
information on local unemployment rates and social indicators. Targeting is
also achieved through the setting of commitment goals by sub-project type.
as each affects particular portions of the target population. For example.
road or street paving sub-projects typically attract a relatively high
proportion of women workers, erosion control sub-projects usually employ ex-
miners, and food supplement schemes are targeted to mothers and infants.
The beneficiaries are explicitly considered in two groups: those wbo receive
employment during the investment period. and the beneficiaries of the
completed sub-project. For example. an erosion control project in a
poverty-stricken area (either urban or rural) will be preferred to a similar
project in a wealthier area.
Benefits
30.    The scope of the economic appraisal carried out by ESP depends on
the sub-project's type and size. They are first categorized into those for
which a rate of return calculation is feasible and those for which it is
not. The latter include sub-projects for social assistance. construction of
schools and medical centers, training, and some infrastructure, as well as
bridging loans. Among the former. a 12% economic return is required as a
minimum for all sub-projects expected to cost US$100.000 or more. For
smaller sub-projects and those excepted above, less detailed benefit
information is gathered. and multiplier effects are proxied by consideration
of total cost per month of work created (US$165 has been the average on sub-
projects approved to date), labor cost as percent of total cost (the goal is
60X or more). and import costs as percent of total costs (the goal is less
than 102)-all of which are acceptable.   As a check on the evaluation
process. Association staff evaluated four representative sub-projects among
the first approved by LSF (an urban landslide prevention project. a mixed
erosion control/reforestation/rural road project. a street paving project.
and an irrigation rehabilitation project). and found their economic rates of
return to range between 15% and over 1001. (Details are available in the
project file). In approving sub-projects, ESF tempers the results of the
economic evaluation with the expected impact on the target population and
the sustainability of the sub-project.
31.     To strengthen the evaluation system. Association support will
include technical assistance for the development of a data bank on project
benefits in the various sectors concerned (para. 17). Benefits to be
surveyed will include the following:
(a) Improvements in pbysical infrastructure and the environment-
resulting in economic benefits for which standard rates of return can be
determined;



- 20 -
(b) Direct social benefits* for instance, eontruction of basic
shelter, provision of simple health care. and improvement of cbild cars ed
school organizations - resulting in economic benefits in both the ahort and
long run; and
(c) Strengthened organizational capacity in both public and non-
governmental organizations (NGO's) - resulting in institutional benefits
that are more difficult to quantify.
Risks
32.     The methods adopted for selecting and implementing sub-projects
endeavor to strike a balance between providing rapid and resposmive
assistance in a tine of crisis, and ensuring that resources are allocated
where tbey can be most effective. The risks associated with excessive speed
of response are that funds would be poorly used; they would be diverted from
other investments and inflationary pressures would be increased. The
consequence of too slow a responsoe would that the sought-for alleviation of
the social impact of adjustment would not be achieved. thereby intensifying
social pressures that might endanger the economic reform program. In order
