I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Portugal and Quimica de Portugal, E.P. (QUIMIGAL,
the Company) have requested a Bank loan of US$58 million equivalent to assist
in financing the modernization and expansion of QUIMIGAL's nitrogenous fer-
tilizer facilities (the Project), which would include: (i) an economically-
sized ammonia plant with a capacity of 900 tpd based on partial oxidation of
fuel oil; (ii) two nitric acid plants with a capacity of 360 tpd each;
(iii) revamping of the existing 150 tpd urea plant to raise its capacity to
250 tpd; and (iv) revamping of an existing ammonium nitrate plant. Except
for one of the nitric acid plants, all project facilities will be located at
QUIMIGAL's existing plant in Lavradio, an industrial town about 15 km south
of Lisbon. One of the nitric acid plants will be located at QUIMIGAL's plant
in Alverca, about 20 km north of Lisbon (Map, IBRD 13778).
1.02      The Project was prepared (Project File - Reference A) by QUIMIGAL,
a wholly-owned Government enterprise established in January 1978 through the
merger of three existing Government-owned fertilizer companies, i.e., Com-
panhia Uniao Fabril S.A.R.L. (CUF), Amoniaco Portugues S.A.R.L. (AMPOR), and
Nitratos de Portugal S.A.R.L. (NP). The Project is expected to be completed
by March 1982 and is estimated to cost about US$242 million equivalent, in-
cluding US$146 million in foreign exchange. The Government will contribute
US$87.5 million in equity and QUIMIGAL US$15.8 million from internally gene-
rated cash, which together will represent 43% of the total financing required.
The proposed Bank loan of US$58 million will cover about 24% of the Project's
total financing needs and 40% of its foreign exchange requirements. Remaining
debt financing will be provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB), US$21
million; suppliers' credits, US$31 million; and commercial banks, US$29 mil-
lion, most likely under co-financing arrangements with the Bank.
1.03      The Project is designed to ensure that Portugal will possess suffi-
cient domestic production capacity to satisfy expected increases in domestic
demand for nitrogenous fertilizers through the mid-1980s. The Project involves
revamping and expansion of existing facilities to improve their economics and
building of new units within QUIMIGAL's existing production complexes, and
thus would provide additional production at costs lower than those from a new
greenfield plant. It will also enable the Company to switch from naphtha feed-
stock, which is in deficit in Portugal, to fuel oil, which is projected to
remain in surplus in Portugal and in Western Europe through the 1980s; this
shift is in line with the Government's policy to bring into better balance
the future demand and supply of petroleum products. The Project is also an
important element in the Government's strategy to modernize the country's agri-
cultural sector, to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and to improve
its balance of payments. Thus, it is an integral part of the Bank program
aimed at helping Portugal improve its agricultural sector, and which also
includes prospective operations in agricultural credit, extension services,
forestry and irrigation.

1.04      The Project was identified by a Bank mission in June 1977 and pre-
appraised in October 1977. It was appraised by Messrs. E. Segura, H. H.
Burmeister, D. A. Caplin, S. Venkataraman and R. Bhan of the Industrial
Projects Department, S. Agarwal of EMENA Programs Department, and D. Gianturco
and G. Weinschenck (consultants) during missions to Portugal in February,
April and June 1978.
II. THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY SECTOR
2.01      A detailed description of the Portuguese industrial sector is given
in the report, "Manufacturing Export Industries in Portugal" (Report No.
1695a-PO, dated December 27, 1977). Manufacturing industry was a leading
sector in the country's economy during the 1960s and early 1970s. Output
grew at 11% per annum from 1963 to 1973, by which year manufacturing industry
contributed 35% of GDP, employed 25% of the labor force and produced 60% of
merchandise exports. The growth in manufacturing output was led by the
textiles, clothing and footwear, metal products, machinery, and transport
equipment industries. Through good quality, competitive prices and reliable
deliveries, Portuguese manufacturers (particularly of processed foods and
textiles) took advantage of market potential in the US and Europe. Manufac-
turing industry accounted for about 28% of capital investment in Portugal by
1973, concentrated in the higher growth sub-sectors such as metal products,
machinery, and textiles, but with substantial investment also in chemicals
and foodstuffs.
2.02      Up to 1973, Portugal's industrial policies relied on private entre-
preneurial initiative, stimulated by numerous incentives through tax conces-
sions, low interest rates, tariff protection and an industrial licensing
system which closely regulated domestic competition. Many of the larger
industrial groups had close links to the banking sector and benefited from
tight national controls of any collective activity by the labor force and of
the level of industrial wages. Some inefficient industries, often serving
captive markets in Portugal's colonies, had prospered under these controls.
By 1973, the Government had started to liberalize investment and licensing,
to increase competition in the industrial sector, and to initiate industrial
planning, but these changes were overtaken by the political events of 1974.
2.03      Since 1974, the manufacturing industry has been affected directly
by the fundamental economic and social changes that occurred in Portugal
after the revolution in 1974, and by the worldwide economic recession. There
was a profound impact on labor relations, productivity, management, financial
structure, investment and export markets. Manufacturing output, which showed
an impressive average annual growth rate of 11% during 1970-73, increased only
3% in 1974 and fell by 10% in 1975, before increasing by 4.6% in 1976 and 9%
in 1977; in 1977, manufacturing output was only 7% above the 1973 level.
Export growth also collapsed from a 10% per annum increase in 1970-73 to a
decline of 14% each in 1974 and 1975, before recovering to an annual growth
rate of 6% in 1976 and 1977. This setback in exports was principally due
to the unstable situation in Portugal, temporary loss of export markets in
Portugal's ex-colonies, and the recession in the OECD countries to which
Portugal exported about 78% of its total exports in 1973. Total gross fixed



capital formation (in all sectors) also declined in 1974-75, before recover-
ing somewhat in 1976-77; fixed investment in 1977 was still about b% below
the 1973 level. Indeed, during the last five years, most industrial firms not
only postponed plans for expansion, but also neglected necessary investments
for maintenance and modernization. The proposed Fertilizer Modernization
Project is an example of such postponements; some of its components are being
implemented several years after they were first conceived.
2.04      Portugal's industrial structure is characterized by a large number
(about 15,000) of very small enterprises; of these, about 12,000 firms (or 80%)
employed less than 50 workers and only 1,500 employed more than 100 workers.
There are equally wide variations in management ability, organization, tech-
nology, marketing and investment planning capabilities. Private firms in
the manufacturing sector continue to dominate both aggregate output and ex-
ports, although following the revolution of 1974, large industrial groups
were nationalized. The nationalization of the banking system and insurance
companies gave the Government varying degrees of participation in private
sector enterprises, which created uncertainties for investors and industri-
alists. The Government has now taken a number of measures to promote gX.eater
confidence among potential private investors. First, it has announced that
there will be no further nationalization. Second, a law on compensation
for nationalized assets was approved in August 1977. While the exact amount
and timing of compensation to former shareholders is still to be finalized,
it is expected that a satisfactory solution will be reached shortly. Third,
several financial measures have been instituted to help bring private enter-
prises in serious financial difficulties back on their feet. Fourth, a series
of steps have been initiated to stimulate private investment, including mea-
sures to improve the profitability of exporting and manufacturing in general,
through lowering real wages in 1977, depreciating the exchange rate and pro-
viding special fiscal incentives. And, finally, a law was passed delineating
the boundaries of the private and public sectors. Private enterprises can
engage in all sectors except armaments, oil refining, petrochemicals, ferti-
lizers, iron and steel, cement, water, power, telecommunications and public
transport.
2.05      With the implementation of all these measures, business confidence,
which has been improving, would be given a further boost. This, in turn,
should lead to the much needed revival of private investment and exports. To
assist the Government's efforts, the Bank has recently made a loan of US$50
million (Loan No. 1432-PO of May 24, 1977) to help in the financing of indus-
trial firms. To help the large number of small and medium industries, the
Government has also set up the Institute for Assistance to Small- and Medium-
Size Enterprises, and is developing numerous industrial estates through the
Institute for Industrial Estates as part of its strategy to remove regional
imbalances and to create new industrial employment.
2.06      A major share of new investment in Portugal since 1974 has been
in the public sector and a significant proportion of this investment related
to the continuation of the Sines industrial complex. The Sines complex was
conceived in the 1960s to create a new growth center in the south of Portugal,
away from the existing, congested industrial centers of Lisbon and Oporto.



-4-
The original Sines Master Plan included a massive port, a large refinery, and
a number of heavy industrial units, including a petrochemical complex and
facilities for the production of fertilizers, railway wagons, iron pyrites,
steel, etc. The economics of the Sines complex have been severely affected
by the changes both inside and outside Portugal since 1973. However, a large
amount of investment has already taken place and the complex must continue in
some form. The Government is now reviewing the Sines complex in line with its
attempt to re-evaluate the investment programs of all public enterprises on an
economic basis. One of the objectives of this review is to determine the
order and rate at which the different developments currently planned at Sines
should proceed within the constraints set by the national economy, and what,
if any, new projects should be considered. A Bank mission was recently
undertaken in order to assist the Government in determining the scope and
procedures of this review. It is clear that a number of projects earlier
included in the complex will have to be substantially delayed. For example,
the large fertilizer complex planned for Sines is now indefinitely postponed,
and the Government has given assurances that any further expansion of the
fertilizer sector will only be undertaken after exchanging views with the
Bank.
2.07      Portugal is a small country and has a limited domestic market.  Its
economy has been relatively open and future growth significantly depends on
its ability to increase exports and substitute for imports in agriculture and,
to some extent, in other sectors. In recent years, exports covered only about
one-half of imports. Until the revolution of April 1974, workers' remittances
and tourism earnings helped cover the trade gap. But recently, because of the
decline in these and in exports, the current account has deteriorated sharply
from a surplus of US$0.35 billion in 1973 to a deficit of US$1.2 billion in
1976 and US$1.5 billion in 1977. While the long-term solution to Portugal's
balance of payments deficit is to significantly increase its exports, princi-
pally of manufactured goods, the recent growth of imports, specially in food-
stuffs, would also have to be simultaneously contained by developing efficient
import substitution and achieving self-sufficiency in food; in 1977 food
imports totalled US$860 million. The proposed Project is one of the major
steps being undertaken by the Government as part of its strategy to improve
the productivity of the agricultural sector and to reduce food imports.
There is also a need to improve and further develop inter-industry linkages.
Portugal has applied for membership in the Common Market (EC), for entry by
about 1985. The development of import substituting industries should, there-
fore, be selective to ensure that these industries are cost competitive,
rationally structured, and are part of a broad strategy to develop a tech-
nological and industrial base suitable for Portugal's entry into the EC.
2.08      The industrial sector will obviously remain the leading sector in
Portugal's future growth. It is expected that the Government's recent measures
to restore confidence of the private sector would have an impact in the medium
term. In the short term, the Government needs to re-examine the public sector,
both its existing production and the investments in progress, to see whether
they can be redirected or rephased. The export potential in the public sector
has not been adequately exploited, for example. As mentioned, the Government
is now attempting to take stock of all investment projects in the public sector
and evaluate them on an economic basis.



III. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   Structure of the Industry
3.01      Until December 1977, the Portuguese fertilizer industry consisted
of five companies: (i) Companhia Uniao Fabril S.A.R.L. (CUF), (ii) Amoniaco
Portugues S.A.R.L. (AMPOR), (iii) Nitratos de Portugal S.A.R.L. (NP), (iv)
Sociedade Portuguesa de Petroquimica S.A.R.L. (SPP), and (v) S.A. de Produits
et Engrais Chimiques du Portugal (SAPEC). The attached map (IBRD - 13778)
shows the location of various plants owned by these companies. CUF, the
largest of the companies, was originally formed in the late nineteenth century
and, by the time of its nationalization in 1975, was the largest company in
Portugal with sales exceeding US$850 million equivalent, including major rev-
enues from banks, shipyards, shipping lines and refineries which were divested
from CUF in 1975. After 1975 CUF continued to produce fertilizers and pesti-
cides, chemical and metal products, vegetable oils and soaps, animal feedstuffs,
and industrial and domestic textiles. AMPOR produced mainly fertilizers, but
was also implementing a project to manufacture aniline; in 1977 its sales were
over US$32 million. NP,produced nitrogenous fertilizers and pesticides (1977
sales of US$23 million). SPP manufactured ammonia and town gas for the Lisbon
area. SAPEC, a Belgian-owned company, produced mainly phosphatic fertili-
zers, animal feedstuffs, seeds, industrial chemicals and mineral products.
Annex 3-1 and Project File - Reference B contain a detailed description of the
activities and financial performance of the companies in recent years.
3.02      Four of the five companies mentioned above, which were owned by
local private shareholders until 1974, were nationalized during 1975, as
was most other heavy industry in Portugal. In January 1978, CUF, AMPOR and
NP were formally merged to form Quimica de Portugal, E.P. (QUIMIGAL). SPP,
the sole supplier of town gas to Lisbon, has been renamed Empresa Petroquimica
e Gas (EPG) and incorporated into the energy sector, although it will continue
to supply some ammonia to QUIMIGAL for the foreseeable future. SAPEC, which
is foreign owned, was not merged into QUIMIGAL and will remain in private
hands. Similar organizational arrangements have been or are being taken in
other nationalized industries, as part of the Government efforts to stream-
line the management of the public sector.
B.   Production Capacities and Utilization

3.04      Whereas phosphates have been produced for many years in Portugal
(since 1909), significant quantities of nitrogenous fertilizers began to be
produced only in the late 1950s, with imports continuing to supplement local
production until the early 1960s. The Portuguese fertilizer industry is
essentially oriented towards the domestic market. Since 1970, about 85%
of domestic production has been directed to domestic consumption (Annex 3-2)
though some nitrogenous fertilizers and ammonia have been exported in most
years; exports in recent years reached a peak of 115,000 tons of nitrogen in
1975, but have since dropped to about 80,000 tpy. In addition to the con-
sumption of ammonia for fertilizer use, about 20,000 tpy has been produced
for industrial products in recent years. Production of phosphate fertilizer
has remained more or less steady. Portugal has exported small amounts of
phosphates since 1960.
3.05      The production pattern of nitrogenous fertilizers manufactured
by QUIMIGAL companies is approximately the same as the domestic consumption
pattern (para 5.15), although production of ammonium nitrates exceeds local
consumption, since the product has been the principal export of the industry
in past years. Ammonium sulphate is progressively becoming less important,
and ammonium nitrates in various forms - mainly calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN
20.5% N and CAN 26.0% N) and ammonium nitrate (33.5%) - now dominate the
production pattern. Compound fertilizers are also becoming increasingly
important. Urea has limited use in Portuguese agriculture because it is not
the preferred fertilizer for the dry acid soils which prevail over most of
Portugal; there is however a considerable industrial demand for urea. The
following table shows the pattern of nitrogenous fertilizers produced by
QUIMIGAL companies in the period 1962-77.

a/   The drop is partly due to AMPOR Plant start-up in 1975.
The CUF ammonia plant has been operating close to its nominal capacity of
70,000 tpy. However, the age of the plant is beginning to have an effect,
and unplanned shutdowns for repairs in 1976 lowered capacity utilization to
83%, representing a loss in production of about 9,000 tons. This had reper-
cussions on the performance of downstream plants, with the urea plant capacity
utilization dropping to only 81%. The performance of the nitric acid plants
has been low throughout the period, partly due to insufficient ammonia, and
partly to the age of the CUF nitric acid plant and the older NP plant (both
of which were erected in 1960). The decline in capacity utilization of the
ammonium sulphate plants reflects the shift in market requirements from ammo-
nium sulphate towards ammonium nitrates and compound fertilizers. However,
ammonium nitrates capacity utilization, while showing some improvement over
the period, is constrained by the shortage of nitric acid. This shortage is
particularly serious; to utilize fully the ammonium nitrates facilities, about
320,000 tons of nitric acid is required, but only 279,000 tons could be avail-
able at 90% capacity utilization (actual 1977 production was 260,000 tons), of
which about 25,000 tons are required for direct sales and for the manufacture
of industrial products. As several of the intermediate products plants are
nearing the end of their useful lives, even lower capacity utilization can be
expected in the future and the problem is likely to become more acute.

C.   Need for Fertilizer Industry Modernization
3.07      Thus, while Portugal has downstream facilities to produce finished
fertilizers (e.g., ammonium nitrates, urea) to partly satisfy the expected
increases in domestic demand for nitrogenous fertilizers in the early 1980s,
its capacity to produce the required intermediate products (ammonia and nitric
acid) is much more limited. This imbalance will be corrected when additional
ammonia and nitric acid capacity is installed under the Project to replace
those existing plants which are reaching the end of their useful lives and
will have to be shut down in the early 1980s. In addition, existing ammonium
nitrates and urea plants can be economically revamped to extend their economic
life through the 1980s and to meet increased domestic market needs, thus post-
poning the need for new, greenfield plants. The rationale for the proposed
Project is given in a detailed study prepared by the Company in 1977 (Project
File - Reference C) and summarized in the following paragraphs. A comparison
of production facilities before and after the proposed Project is depicted in
Chart C-1.
3.08      Ammonia.  Portugal currently has three ammonia plants.  Of these,
two are scheduled for closure in 1981-82. The older of the EPG ammonia plants,
which was erected in 1961 and has a capacity of 210 tpd, is planned for shut
down in 1982 for technical, economic, and ecological reasons. Due to its
small size, obsolete technology and old age, this plant produces ammonia at
a relatively high operating cost; total production costs, before interest
charges and depreciation, are currently estimated at about US$185/ton of
ammonia, on the basis of international feedstock prices. EPG's second and
larger 550 tpd ammonia plant is also 13 years old and in a better physical
state. EPG intends to keep it in production through the 1980s since it is the
sole supplier of town gas to Lisbon. The third existing ammonia plant, belong-
ing to CUF, is similar to the smaller EPG plant. This plant, with a capacity
of 210 tpd, is about 17 years old and is near the end of its useful life; it
is due for closure in 1982 because, besides having high operating costs, it
is also becoming dangerous to operate. To extend the plant's life beyond that
date will require substantial replacement of equipment, involving considerable
production losses and high capital investment, resulting in uneconomic costs
of production. Furthermore, since ammonia requirements of CUF's downstream
facilities exceed the capacity of its ammonia unit, the Company has been pur-
chasing about 75,000 tpy of ammonia from EPG.
3.09      By 1982, when the two smaller ammonia units are closed, the larger
EPG unit (with a capacity of 160,000 tpy) will be the only domestic ammonia
source.  The shutdown of the CUF ammonia plant would also eliminate the CO2
source for the CUF urea plant. In para 5.19, it is shown that in 1983 domestic
ammonia requirements will reach approximately 300,000 tpy (and 435,000 tpy by
1990). There is, thus, a need for additional ammonia capacity to offset these
plant closures and to meet future market needs.
3.10      Since Portugal lacks a domestic source of natural gas, the economic
choice of feedstock for future ammonia plants is between naphtha and fuel oil.
In 1976, the Government set up a special commission to carry out a study on



- 9 -
alternative feedstocks for the fertilizer industry. This study (Project File -
Reference D), reviewed the future demand and supply situation of petroleum
products in Portugal and the economics of different feedstocks. It concluded
that (a) Portugal will remain in deficit in naphtha and in surplus in fuel oil
through the 1980s; and (b) given the difference in the expected international
prices of fuel oil and naphtha (with fuel oil expected to remain priced at
about 60% of the naphtha price), the most economic alternative would be the
erection of a fuel oil based partial oxidation plant. Analysis by Bank staff
has confirmed this conclusion and indicates that the price of fuel oil would
have to increase, in 1978 dollar terms, to US$96 per ton or 74% of the naphtha
price per ton to make the steam reforming process using itaphtha more economic.
Such narrowing of the price differential is unlikely for the foreseeable
future, given the expected world demand and supply situation for the two
products (Project File - Reference E).
3.11      The Government has also asked EPG to review the possibility of
switchover to other feedstocks at its existing facilities in order to make
ammonia production more economic. Such a switchover, while technically feasi-
ble, would not justify running the smaller, 210 tpd, ammonia plant after 1982.
It also appears that the investment required to make such a change in the
larger 550 tpd ammonia plant (for such items as air separation unit, air,
nitrogen and oxygen compressors, gasification and recovery, gas purification
and nitrogen wash) would be very costly and will not be economic. Therefore,
EPG is likely to keep operating this plant with naphtha as feedstock.
3.12      The immediate need for the large-scale ammonia plant included in
the Project, however, is not conditional on the closing of the larger of the
EPG plants, because the closure of the QUIMIGAL - CUF plant and the smaller
EPG plant in the early 1980s as well as the expected increase in demand for
nitrogenous fertilizers during the next decade would create a need for this
new ammonia capacity (para 5.19). However, because of the need to view this
new capacity in the context of Portugal's overall nitrogen supply, the Govern-
ment and QUIMIGAL have agreed that the Bank will be consulted during the devel-
opment of a longer-term strategy for the sector, including the future of the
550 tpd ammonia plant and its impact on the need and timing of later invest-
ments in the sector (para 2.06).
3.13      Urea.  By 1985, domestic urea requirements are expected to reach
74,000 tpy, of which 43,000 tpy is for agricultural needs (both direct use and
in compounds) and 31,000 tpy for industrial uses (para 5.18). In 1976, CUF's
existing plant produced 40,700 tons (81% of 50,000 tpy capacity) of urea; of
the total production loss of 9,300 tons, about 3,900 (42%) was due to lack of
ammonia and CO caused by breakdowns of the CUF ammonia plant. The CUF urea
2
plant is 14 years old and requires revamping to continue operating for another
decade. With such revamping its production capacity could also be increased
to 82,000 tpy, and production costs reduced. To revamp the urea plant, the
principal improvements envisaged are to increase the reaction yield in the
first cycle from the present 46% to 70%, minimize the water recycled to the
reactor, optimize the pressure used in the process, and better utilize the
reaction heat.



- 10 -
3.14      Nitric Acid.  The nitric acid capacity situation is also unsatis-
factory.  While AMPOR has ample nitric acid capacity for its needs (from a
new plant with 115,000 tpy capacity), both the CUF and NP sites suffer from
production imbalances caused by nitric acid shortages. The situation is
exacerbated by the difficulty and expense of transporting nitric acid over
long distances. The situation of CUF's nitric acid plant (capacity 55,000
tpy) is similar to that of the ammonia plant, both regarding equipment age
and technical-economic obsolescence. A survey made by CUF of plants of the
same type erected in 1960 showed that the average life of such plants was 12.6
years. The compressors at the CUF plant are in bad state, and breakdowns are
frequent. Thus, the plant, which also has serious pollution problems, is
scheduled for closure by 1981, and would be replaced by a 119,000 tpy plant.
3.15      NP operates two 70,000 tpy nitric acid plants at Alverca, one of
which was erected in 1960 and the other in 1969. Due to improvements in
NP's downstream ammonium nitrate production capacities, there is now a short-
age of nitric acid capacity. This shortage has forced the ammonium nitrate
production facilities to operate at below 70% of capacity. Fertilizer out-
put could be immediately increased if sufficient nitric acid were available;
NP, therefore, also proposes to install a 119,000 tpy nitric acid plant to
balance production capacity and to replace the older of its two plants.
3.16      Ammonium Nitrate.  The existing ammonium nitrate facilities at the
CUF, AMPOR and NP complexes are in a relatively good state. However, the CUF
plant requires modifications to extend its life, increase its liquor produc-
tion capacity, reduce pollution problems and better balance its capacity with
other plants. This 100,000 tpy capacity plant was erected in 1963 and later
substantially modified and modernized in 1966/67. The plant uses a prilling
process and is in good operational condition; only marginal investments are
required to maintain it in operation until the mid-1990s. Modifications
planned will also enable the CUF ammonium nitrate plant to operate at a
slightly higher rate of 118,000 tpy to balance the proposed nitric acid facil-
ity and will reduce atmospheric pollution. In the recent past, the plant has
been operating at a low utilization level (70% of capacity in 1976) due to the
shortage of nitric acid. This prob'lem will be solved when the proposed larger
nitric acid plant enters into operation.
IV. THE BORROWER AND PROJECT SPONSOR
4.01      As mentioned earlier, the Project was prepared by and will be imple-
mented and operated by QUIMIGAL, a wholly Government-owned enterprise esta-
blished on January 1, 1978 (para 3.02). QUIMIGAL is a major diversified manu-
facturing company. In 1977, 45% of its consolidated sales were generated by
the Fertilizer and Pesticides Division. The other divisions' shares of the
sales were - Vegetable Oils and Soaps: 20%; Products for the Cattle Industry:
18%; Chemical and Metal Products: 10%; and Industrial and Domestic Textiles
and others: 7%. QUIMIGAL will be the borrower of the proposed Bank loan.



- l l -
A.   Organization and Management
4.02      QUIMIGAL operates under the 1976 Law on Public Enterprises, which
states that Government-owned enterprises hold juridical personality and h-
administrative, financial and patrimonial autonomy. Government control is
limited to overall guidelines, leaving management free to run the Company.
QUIMIGAL, which has retained the basic corporate structure of the former
CUF, is managed by a Management Council appointed by Portugal's Counc i of
Ministers which reports to the Minister of Industry and Technology. Tue
Management Council consists of the President, Vice President, and five other
Directors, all long-standing executives of QUIMIGAL's predecessor companies
(Project File - Reference F). The Management Council, which is chaired by the
President of the Company, defines the overall business strategies and policiesz:,
issues planning targets, decides on investment proposals, financial policies
and labor relations, and exercises diract control over the activities of the
operating divisions.  Each member of the Management Council has respos ihilit
both for Company functions and for the activities of specified operating
'divisions of the Company.
4.03      QUIMIGAL's operating organization will remain basically that of CUF.
with seven decentralized manufacturing and two service divisions, each contin-
ing to operate as an independent profit center within QUIMIGAL (Annex 4-1).
Divisional managers are responsible for the profitability of their respective.
operations, including planning and control, development of new products and
projects, marketing, sales and production. They report to the President
through the Director in charge (who is also a member of QUIMIGAL's Management
Council) except for the managers of four operating divisions who report
directly to the President. The most important manufacturing division of
QUIMIGAL, Fertilizer and Pesticides (the Division), will absorb the operations
of NP and AMPOR, with the exception of AMPOR's aniline project which will be
under a new Organic Chemicals Division. The Fertilizer Division will be
responsible for implementing and operating the facilities of the Project. It
is headed by Mr. Jaime Figo, formerly the manager of CUF's Fertilizer and
Pesticides Division. He is also the chairman of a committee whose main task
is to integrate management of all fertilizer production and marketing, as well
as financial and administrative activities within the Division. Such an
integration is a delicate and difficult task but has been satisfactorily
carried out by the Division so far. However, considering the logistic and
personnel complexities involved, it is necessarily a slow process and is
expected to be completed early in 1979. The integration of the three marketing
and sales organizations was successfully completed in July 1978, and the
integration of the shipping and production scheduling activities and of
the accounting and financial control systems is now virtually complete.
Most of the new senior managers have now been appointed and the reassignments
of most middle managers completed. QUIMIGAL has agreed that full integration
of these functions insofar as the Division is concerned, as well as the
introduction of a uniform accounting system for all the Divisions' operations,
will be completed by June 30, 1979.
4.04      Bank staff has met with a number of QUIMIGAL's executives and be-
lieves that the management team of QUIMIGAL consists of competent and dedicated



- 12 -
people, particularly at the level of the operating divisions. Regardirng
corporate management, as mentioned, the process of merging the managements of
three companies is still taking place and it is too early to judge the effec-
tiveness of its implementation. However, CUF, which prior to nationalization
was one of the largest and most successful private companies in the country,
is one of the few major companies in Portugal which has enjoyed a certain
amount of management continuity and its operations were affected relatively
little by the nationalization. An indication of management stability and
competence is the absence of labor strikes at CUF, even though labor problems
have otherwise been generally widespread throughout the country. With the
assistance of the Company's relatively sophisticated planning, financial con-
trol and information systems, which are capable of coping with the complexi-
ties of multi-divisional operations, QUIMIGAL's management is considered
capable of successfully managing the existing operations of the Company, the
implementation and subsequent operations of the proposed Project, as well as
of the other investment projects currently being implemented (para 4.09).
B.   Past Financial Situation and Performance
4.05      The past performance of QUIMIGAL's predecessor companies is dis-
cussed in detail in Annex 3-1.  Since QUIMIGAL itself was formed only on
January 1, 1978, its consolidated historic financial statements are not
available. However, it has prepared proforma historical statements by
combining the financial results of the operations of the predecessor companies
relating to activities now under QUIMIGAL. The proforma combined financial
statements for 1975-78 (Project File - Reference G) are summarized in
the table below.

4.06      Despite profitable fertilizer operations in the recent past, the
financial position of QUIMIGAL's component companies has remained tight due
mainly to substantial losses incurred by CUF's non-fertilizer operations
during 1974-77. This deterioration in CUF's financial performance resulted
from four basic causes. First, price controls and continued operation of
inefficient plants in the Industrial and Domestic Textiles Division and in



- 13 -
the Chemicals and Metal Products Divisions. Second, divestiture, at the time
of nationalization, of many of CUF's more profitable operations (e.g., ship-
ping, banking, insurance, etc.) which earlier had partly compensated for the
less profitable operations. Third, the general economic downturn temporarily
affected demand. And, fourth, a sharp increase in the Company's operating
costs due to substantially increased labor costs. CUF financed these losses
and maintained its liquidity by resorting to heavy short-term borrowings;
interest charges on these borrowings further increased the losses. As dis-
cussed in para 4.08, QUIMIGAL has agreed to consolidate most of these short-
term loans and thus improve its current ratio; substantial payments (totalling
about Esc 1 billion (US$20.2 million equivalent) are expected from the
Government in compensation for previously nationalized assets.
4.07      In 1977, the financial performance improved in all three companies
(CUF, AMPOR and NP) which now form QUIMIGAL, mainly due to cost reductions
(Annex 3-1 and Project File - Reference B). NP showed a profit in 1977 which
compensated partly for the losses incurred by CUF and AMPOR; the combined cash
flow was positive. Estimates for 1978 indicate that QUIMIGAL will show a
profit this year. However, the long-term solution to restoring the Company to
profitable operations must include: (a) a review of price controls still
imposed on some of its products, and (b) a critical evaluation of its existing
product lines and plant facilities to identify the precise reasons for the low
profitability of its non-fertilizer operations. During the past year, QUIMIGAL
has initiated such a review and identified the non-profitable product lines
and facilities. It has also initiated preliminary discussions with the
Government on the future of these operations, considering the strategic,
employment and social implications of their termination. The Government has
agreed that it will complete, before March 31, 1980, its analysis of the
QUIMIGAL review and along with QUIMIGAL implement any measures or policies
considered necessary to ensure that the Company's non-fertilizer divisions
would earn sufficient revenues to cover their costs and provide an adequate
return on invested capital, provided the facilities are operating efficiently.
Confirmation has also been obtained that such reviews would thereafter be
undertaken on a periodic basis.
4.08      The Company's debt/equity ratio is satisfactory and financing
arrangements made for the new projects (para 4.09) indicate that it will
continue to remain so. The current ratio would also be satisfactory assuming
satisfactory resolution early in 1979 of the two major problems that caused
liquidity problems in the past. The first concerns the difficulties QUIMIGAL
has had in receiving prompt payments of compensations against fertilizer
subsidies to farmers (para 5.26). The second concerns the short-term borrow-
ings, totalling about Esc 3 billion, owed by the Company. QUIMIGAL has agreed
to reduce substantially these borrowings. It has reached an understanding
with its creditors to refinance Esc 2.25 billion of short-term loans and
increase their maturity to seven years, thereby attaining a satisfactory
current ratio of 1.3:1. Liabilities arising from the divestiture of assets
(amounting to Esc 1 billion) form part of this rescheduled debt. QUIMIGAL and
the Government expect shortly to reach a final solution for offsetting these
liabilities within the framework of the overall Compensation Law. Effective
restructuring of these obligations will be a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan.

C.   Expansion Plans
4.09      In addition to the proposed Fertilizer Modernization Project, the
Company is currently implementing nine expansion projects, aimed at rational-
izing the production operations of the Company over the medium term. These
projects involve: (i) pelletization of pyrites; (ii) production of sulphuric
acid; (iii) production of metallic zinc; (iv) electrolytic copper refining;
(v) production of polyether formulations for plastics and detergents; (vi)
production of polyester resins for plastics and textiles; (vii) production
of glass fibres; (viii) production of anilines; and (ix) additional power
generation. A brief description of these projects including their respective
capital costs and estimated completion dates is given in Annex 4-2. The total
investments required are estimated at US$175 million. The Government is pro-
viding the Company with new equity to finance 40% of this cost, with the
remainder to be financed with long-term debt. QUIMIGAL has secured satisfac-
tory debt financing from domestic and foreign banks, including loans totalling
US$22.3 million equivalent from EIB for these investments. All of these proj-
ects, which are scheduled for completion between 1979 and 1981, are well con-
ceived and are currently being implemented by divisions of QUIMIGAL other than
the Fertilizer Division. They are not expected to affect adversely the imple-
mentation of the proposed Project.
V. THE MARKET AND MARKETING SYSTEM
A.   Introduction
5.01      The past and future prospects of fertilizer consumption in Portugal
are closely linked to the evolution of the agricultural sector in the country.
This chapter, therefore, provides a brief review of the agricultural sector,
including the Government's agricultural policies in key areas which have con-
strained the sector's growth so far, before discussing the historical develop-
ment and future prospects of the fertilizer market in Portugal.
B.   Agriculture in Portugal
5.02      A more detailed review of the issues and development strategies
in the agricultural sector is given in the Bank report entitled "Portugal
Agricultural Sector Survey" dated March 16, 1978 (Report No. 1689b-PO). For
at least two decades agriculture has been a lagging sector in Portugal, in
spite of the aggregate growth of the economy. As the share of agriculture
in GDP declined from 30% to 12% in the 20-year period between 1955-75, a
geographical and occupational redistribution of population occurred. During
that period, out of a total agricultural population of five million, about
one million people moved from rural areas to the cities, and agricultural
employment fell from 47% to 27% of total employment. While total real GDP
rose at an average annual rate of 5.7% during the period, along with personal
incomes and aggregate demand for food, agricultural production almost stag-
nated and increased at an average annual rate of only 0.9%. Consequently,
to satisfy increased demand, food imports, especially of cereals, sharply



- 15 -
increased from a negligible amount in 1965 to US$770 million in 1975, and
US$860 million in 1977. At present, imports represent over 50% of domestic
cereal consumption. These food imports have put a heavy burden on the balance-
of-payments situation of the country; in 1977 food imports were equivalent to
57% of the balance of payments current account deficit of US$1.5 billion. In
the pre-1974 period, when Portugal enjoyed a favorable international economic
position and comfortable reserves -- due in large part to remittances from its
colonies and migrant workers employed in Europe, and from tourism earnings -
the country could finance such imports. But, since 1974, the substantial
deterioration in the balance of payments situation has made the narrowing of
the trade gap in agricultural products indispensable for the economic well-
being of the country.
5.03      Of the total land area of 7.6 million ha, cultivated area totals
4.2 million ha of which arable land accounts for 2.5 million ha. Most of
the rainfall is on forest and natural pasture land in the mountainous region
of the North (Map IBRD-11564). The quality of soil in many areas of Portugal
is poor. Aside from the paucity of good quality arable land, several major
institutional constraints have prevented agriculture from performing its
potentially key role in the economy. First, the agrarian structure that pre-
vailed until 1975 kept a large proportion of the rural population poor and
powerless. Second, the institutional role of the Government in the sector
was passive and essentially limited to administering subsidies. Third,
economic policy led to distortions in resource allocation.
5.04      The Government recognizes the urgency of transforming the agricul-
tural sector to improve the country's foreign exchange situation, raise income
of the rural population, and generate a higher volume of savings for the
sector's capital requirements. Since there is hardly any additional land in
the country to be brought under cultivation, the basic problem of increasing
agricultural production can be solved only by increasing output per hectare.
Accordingly, the Government has recently taken strong initiatives for (a)
accelerating technological modernization of agriculture through the use of
modern technologies and inputs, including fertilizers and improved seeds; (b)
strengthening credit, research and extension institutions serving agriculture;
(c) completing reforms in land tenure and intensifying land use; (d) raising
the level of investments relative to the sector's gross domestic product; (e)
modernizing and expanding the irrigation system and (f) reducing regional
imbalances in rural income.
C.   Fertilizer Use and Government Policies
5.05      Under optimal market conditions, the use of fertilizers in agri-
culture depends on the relationship between fertilizer prices and the value
of the additional production expected by farmers from its use. In practice,
the use of fertilizers by farmers also depends on other institutional factors
such as (a) incentives (or disincentives) provided to farmers by the land
tenure and farm size systems; (b) convenient availability of agricultural
credit for fertilizer and other inputs; (c) adequacy of agricultural research
to determine the response of crop production to fertilizer application; (d) ex-
tension of this knowledge to farmers; (e) availability of suitable fertilizer



- 16 -
and complementary inputs at attractive prices, and (f) adequacy of the trans-
portation, storage, distribution and marketing systems. Except for the last
item -- the country possesses a substantial infrastructure of such supporting
activities -- all other factors have been unfavorable in Portugal and have
constrained fertilizer use. As a result, the country has one of the lowest
rates of fertilizer application of all the Southern European countries which
include countries with similar land and climate (para 5.13). As part of its
increasing interest in accelerating the development of agriculture, the Govern-
ment has initiated important measures to remove the above constraints. The
Government policies in this regard are briefly discussed below.
5.06      Land Tenure:  Portugal can be divided into two regions -- the North
and the South with the Tagus River as the dividing line -- which possess sig-
nificantly different land tenure and agrarian structure systems. The North
comprises about 60% of the country's arable land and consists primarily of
owner-cultivated small farms and peasant-intensive agriculture, which resulted
both from the topography and inheritance practices. Most of the farms are not
only small--with three-quarters of them being less than 4 ha in area -- but
are subdivided into many parcels. This highly fragmented land tenure has
resulted in agriculture being practised by most small farmers either as a part
time or as a residual occupation, with relatively outmoded methods of cultiva-
tion. The South, on the other hand, is an area principally of large estates
(latifundia), extensive farming, and before the 1974 revolution, of absentee
owners and landless workers.
5.07      The 1974 revolution triggered off major reforms in the South, leav-
ing the North relatively untouched. During 1975, over 1 million ha, or one-
quarter of the agricultural land in Portugal, were taken over and latifundia
converted into collective and cooperative units of rural workers. To legalize
the occupation of lands within established limits, two Agrarian Reform Decrees
were published by the Government in 1975, and in September 1977, a more com-
prehensive Agrarian Reform Law was enacted. The new law reaffirms the prin-
ciple that expropriations and nationalizations shall occur only in formally
declared "agrarian reform zones" where latifundia are prevalent and only for
properties larger than the equivalent of about 30 ha of good land. In already
expropriated farms, an area equivalent to about 30 ha of good land will be
returned to the former owner, who will also be compensated for the remaining
expropriated land. The enactment of the compensation legislation is a major
step towards completing the land reform in the South. The Government estimates
that of 3.5 million ha in agrarian reform zones in the country, when the reform
is completed about 1.4 million ha would be under collective or cooperative
farms, 0.7 million ha would remain with former owners, and 1.4 million ha in
small and medium-sized farms. Once the complex issues of land distribution
rights and compensation are settled, much greater land use intensity should
result in the South. This will of course require a considerable amount of
capital for farm machinery and modern inputs, and major improvements in the
management of cooperatives and collectives. It is in these areas that the
Government is placing priority, in part with Bank support. The Government also
recognizes the critical need to create economically viable small farms out of
existing highly fragmented units in the North. Although the Agrarian Reform
Law of 1977 provides some incentives for the consolidation of excessively small



- 17 -
farms and holdings, more study on the possible mechanisms to achieve land
consolidation, while at the same time taking into account cultural and social
traditions, is needed. In the short term, therefore, the prospects for rapid
intensification of resource use in the North are less promising than for the
reformed sector, which is mainly in the South. Over the next few years, land
consolidation in the North could probably become a cornerstone of the Govern-
ment's agricultural policy.
5.08      Agricultural Credit:  At the end of 1975, agricultural credit out-
standing amounted to US$650 million equivalent (or only about 25% of agricul-
tural value added for the year) compared to US$12.0 billion for all economic
sectors. Such a small amount of institutional credit supplied to agricul-
ture -- in absolute terms and relative to all other sectors -- is one of the
factors responsible for the stagnation of the sector. In order to achieve a
more rational structure of fixed investment and to provide necessary working
capital, agricultural credit outstanding would need to be expanded to probably
twice the amount outstanding at the end of 1975. However, the system of agri-
cultural credit was institutionally and financially incapable of mobilizing
and administering efficiently such a large increase. Institutionally, it had
been a largely uncoordinated constellation of commercial, savings and coopera-
tive banks, plus some other 13 institutes, all of which combined covered the
needs of less than 10% of the country's 800,000 farmers.
5.09      The Government is aware of the unsatisfactory performance of the
agricultural credit system and has recently taken major steps to reorganize
its structure. To take advantage of the existing network of more than 750
commercial bank branches throughout the country, the Government, in August
1977, established an "Agriculture and Fisheries Development Fund" (Instituto
Financeiro de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento de Agricultura e Pescas - IFADAP), as
an annex to the central bank, Banco de Portugal; the new Institute would
benefit from the technical assistance of the newly created Ministry of Agri-
culture and Fisheries (MAP). IFADAP would plan, regulate, and supervise an
increasing flow of agricultural credit to farmers in compliance with overall
policy determined by the Government. Its funds would be provided by the
Government and by bond issues, foreign assistance and the commercial banks.
The banking institutions would participate in IFADAP's activities financially
and act as the channel. The Bank, through the recently approved Agricultural
Credit Project, is assisting the Government in implementing the IFADAP system
in the South (Agricultural and Fisheries Credit Project, Report No. 1946-PO
dated March 16, 1978). It is expected that, by early 1979, it will be fully
operational and by 1982 it will satisfy the agricultural credit needs of
the entire country.
5.10      Agricultural Research:  Given the relatively poor quality of soils
in Portugal and the outmoded cultivation methods still utilized in parts of
the country, agricultural research could make a significant contribution
in increasing yields. In the past, however, agricultural research has been
inadequate, played a passive role and was principally academic. The first
step taken by the Government to improve research activities was to consolidate
all agricultural research under the National Agricultural Research Institute
(INIA). Although a limited regionalized research program has already been



- 18 -
initiated by INIA, principally in the South, considerable additional work is
required, particularly on the optimal rates of fertilizer application for
different crops and different levels of complementary inputs. With the
notable exception of the pasture improvement program carried out by the
National Plant Improvement Center in Elvas, problems of soil acidity, pests,
maize and rice hybrids, planting techniques, improved seeds, optimal rotation
and crop storage all need major attention. More agricultural research stations
and human resources are required. The new structure of INIA and its staffing
level are not yet finalized. The Bank has suggested to the Portuguese authori-
ties a broad program for revitalizing this field, including (a) expatriate
technical assistance for at least 5 years for major crops such as wheat, maize,
rice, oilseeds, etc.; (b) advanced training abroad for Portuguese agricultur-
ists for 3-5 persons annually; (c) in-service training for 200 or more agrono-
mists, under expatriate specialists in the major aspects of production of major
crops; and (d) establishing one new central research center and rehabilitating
at least one experimental and demonstration station in each of the seven
regions. The Government, which is committed to improving the public research
program, is expected to shortly implement most of these suggestions. The public
research program with respect to application of fertilizers and pesticides is
complemented by research carried out by QUIMIGAL which maintains a small staff
with its own research station. QUIMIGAL gives recommendations on fertilizer
application under present conditions. However, the resources available within
QUIMIGAL are too small for it to undertake a major research effort.
5.11      Agricultural Extension:  To complement the establishment of IFADAP,
the Government has also reorganized its agricultural extension services in
their seven decentralized regional centers under the Ministry of Agriculture,
which will absorb all existing facilities. The new structure replaces a
system under which the numerous facilities for extension were working under
several jurisdictions, with limited coordination and isolated from actual
farm problems. The Agricultural and Fisheries Credit Project (para 5.09) is
also designed to help improve the extension services in the South. Under it
the extension services will be tied to the provision of agricultural credit and
the implementation of integrated medium-term farm plans. To provide adequate
extension in the country, the Government intends to train about 1,000 middle-
level technicians in the next 5 to 10 years.
5.12      Agricultural Pricing:  Until recently, a complex system of fixed and
support prices for agricultural products, complemented by increasingly costly
subsidies, was the sole de facto agricultural policy of the Government. Fixed
prices connected with compulsory delivery are set for wheat, rice and olive
oil, while minimum support prices exist for rye, maize, barley, milk, eggs
and meat. In 1976, the cost of subsidies for the agricultural sector reached
US$490 million equivalent. Milk, cereals and meat accounted for almost 50% of
subsidies. Government intervention in prices was originally deemed desirable
in order to improve resource allocation and investment in the sector as well
as to shield consumers, and to some extent producers, from the effect of
rising prices that resulted from the outpacing of food demand over local pro-
duction (para 5.02). However, such policies did not achieve their intended
impact due to the other constraints on output in the sector. The Government
realizes that such constraints on agricultural development - - land tenure,



- 19 -
paucity of credit and resources, technology, etc. -- are not amenable to co--
rections by price policies alone and in some cases subsidies even perpetuate
them. The Government, therefore, plans to phase out such price subsidies over
the medium term in conformity with the implementation of the policies mentioned
above. There are indications that, in real terms, the amount of subsidies for
basic foods, such as milk and cereals, have decided since 1976, although they
registered increases in current Escudos of the order of 27% and 31% in 1976
and 1977 respectively.

As mentioned, fertilizer consumption in Portugal per unit of arable land has
long been one of the lowest among European countries, including those (e.g.,
Greece and Spain) with similar land, climate and agricultural conditions. 1/
In 1977, Portugal used on average 37 kg/ha of nitrogen, 21 kg/ha of phosphate,
and 9 kg/ha of potash. Considerable variations in these figures occur, of
course, depending on the crop being fertilized (Annex 5-1).
1/   FAO statistics for 1977 nitrogen nutrient use are the following (kg/ha
of arable land and under permanent crop): Portugal (37), Greece (75),
Spain (42), Yugoslavia (48), Romania (75, 1976 data), Italy (55), Over-
all average for Europe (87). The average for the Northern European
countries, with different climate, soil conditions and water infra-
structure is about 130 kg/ha.



- 20 -
5.14      Nitrogenous fertilizer consumption increased at a relatively high
average annual rate of 7.4% from the early 1950s to 1972, but the growth
has substantially slowed since 1972. The slackening in fertilizer use in
the last few years was due to a combination of factors such as the land expro-
priaticns and nationalizations in 1975-76, uncertainties created by political
events, as well as the substantial increases in fertilizer prices experienced
since 1972. The implementation of land reform, as well as drought conditions,
led to the stagnation in nitrogenous fertilizer consumption in 1977. This
effect is not observed with P 205 and potash consumption, since in contrast to
nitrogen, they are not widely used in irrigated areas; these areas in which
the larger estates were located were the main target of expropriation. In the
fertilizer year 1978, nitrogen consumption rose 11.9% over the previous year,
an indication of possible growth rates when more stable conditions prevail.
5.15      Nitrogen has been the most important fertilizer nutrient, account-
ing for about 55% of the total fertilizer used. The country has an NPK con-
sumption ratio of 1:0.6:0.2, which is considered to be agronomically satis-
factory in Portugal considering soil characteristics and cropping patterns.
But increased nitrogen use should be accompanied by corresponding increases
in other fertilizers if nitrogenous fertilizers are to yield satisfactory
results. In 1977, of total nitrogen consumption, 41% was in the form of
ammonium nitrates (principally 20.5% N and 26% N), 28% in the form of compound
fertilizers, 24% as ammonium sulphate, 4% as urea, and 3% as other salts
(Annex 5-2). The low utilization of urea in Portugal is typical of Western
Europe, where climate and soil conditions favor use of ammonium nitrate.
However, with the proposed improvements in the irrigation systems, urea
consumption is expected to rise in Portugal.
E.   Demand Prospects for Nitrogenous Fertilizers
5.16      Given the institutional changes since 1974, and the erratic evolu-
tion of fertilizer consumption in the last five years, future demand projec-
tions involve considerable uncertainty and cannot be based on simple extra-
polations of past data. However, recent determined Government efforts to
improve the productivity of the agricultural sector suggest that the recent
stagnation in fertilizer consumption would be overcome; consumption increase
recorded in 1978 supports this. The completion of the land reform, the re-
structuring of credit, extension and research activities, and the improvements
in crop rotation, land use, drainage and irrigation are likely to provide
a favorable setting for increased agriculture production and fertilizer con-
sumption. Nevertheless, the relatively high annual rate of growth achieved
in the pre-1972 era would be difficult to sustain in the future. On the
basis of detailed consumption studies carried out by a joint committee of the
Portuguese fertilizer industry (Project File - Reference H), by an independent
consultant engaged by the Bank (Project File - Reference I), and by subsequent
Bank analysis, future nitrogenous fertilizer consumption is projected as on the
following page (Annex 5-3):

a/   The arable land and land under permanent crops is assumed to remain at
3.7 million ha, of which 0.7 million ha is irrigated mostly by flooding.
5.17      Since the full impact of the recent changes in Government policies
in agriculture would only be felt after some time, expected level of nitrogen
consumption in 1980 is estimated at 160,000 tons, which represents an annual
growth rate of 5.0% from 1977 but only 1.7% from 1978. Since the 1978 con-
sumption lies slightly above the historical trend line, only a modest rate of
growth has been assumed until 1980. Between 1980 and 1985, as the new Govern-
ment policies are expected to start having an impact, fertilizer use should
increase at a higher rate. It is estimated that nitrogen consumption in 1985
will range between 202,000 and 227,000 tons with a median estimate of 214,000
tons. This figure implies an annual growth rate of 6.0% between 1980 and 1985
which is considered reasonable, though still below the historical rates of
6.6% attained in the past twenty-five years. After 1985, the rate of growth
in nitrogen consumption is expected to drop to 4% per year as nitrogen use
approaches higher levels; by 1991 nitrogen consumption is expected to reach 75
kg/ha which is the present consumption level in countries such as Romania and
Greece. EIB, which has also appraised the Project, has projected demand
figures somewhat higher than those given above.
F.   Projected Nitrogen Demand and Supply Balance
5.18      In addition to nitrogenous fertilizers, there are also a number of
major industrial uses for ammonia and its derivatives in Portugal. This
industrial demand for ammonia must be added to the above fertilizer consumption
projections to derive future ammonia demand. Industrial consumption of ammonia
in 1977 totalled 25,000 tons, mainly for the production of concentrated nitric
acid and ammonium nitrate for explosives. Urea applications in synthetic
resins and animal feedstuffs totalled 18,000 tons, and are projected to reach



- 22 -
31,000 tons in 1985. Future ammonia demand in industry is also likely to
increase substantially as a number of new plants using ammonia come on stream:
(a) an aniline plant in 1978, which will use nitric acid from AMPOR (20,000
tons ammonia equivalent); (b) a methylamine plant in 1980 needing 4,000 tons of
ammonia; and (c) an acrylonitrile plant, probably in 1983, which will utilize
35,000 tons of ammonia. Annex 5-4 shows that the future build-up of industrial
demand for ammonia, as estimated on a product by product basis by QUIMIGAL, is
expected to reach 75,000 tpy in 1985 and 96,000 tpy by 1995.
5.19      The future supply and demand balance in terms of ammonia equivalent
is projected as below. It is derived from the demand estimates based on the
most likely future nitrogenous fertilizer consumption (para 5.17) and the
projected industrial demand for ammonia (para 5.18), and the supply estimates
which assume continued operations of the 550 tpd ammonia plant at EPG (para
3.09) and production from the ammonia plant included in the Project.

b/   Exports will be mainly as ammonium nitrate in the form of CAN.
c/   In 1982, QUIMIGAL's proposed ammonia plant will start operations and two
ammonia plants at QUIMIGAL and EPG will be closed down.
5.20      The projections show that after the new QUIMIGAL ammonia plant comes
on stream in 1982, there will be some temporary excess ammonia capacity above
domestic requirements; the peak excess supply would be in 1984, when 65,000
tons of ammonia (16.1% of supply) will be available for conversion into nitro-
genous fertilizers for export. Most of this will be exported in the form of



- 23 -
CAN 26%, but marginal quantities of direct ammonia sales are also envisaged.
The excess supply will rapidly decline, and after 1987, no further exports
would be necessary. Over the period 1982-87, exports would represent about
9.8% of supply in terms of equivalent ammonia. Chart C-2 shows the projected
demand/supply balance over 1978-90, in terms of equivalent ammonia, for the
low, expected and high nitrogen consumption estimates. It indicates that even
if the low estimates were to materialize exports would never exceed 18% of
total domestic production. On the other hand, if the fertilizer consumption
reached the high estimate, which now appears feasible in light of the 1978
figures (para 5.16), maximum exports in 1984 would be only 13% of total pro-
duction. Surplus for exports would disappear entirely if domestic nitrogen
demand annually increased at about 8.3% instead of 4.8% assumed above.
5.21      In the period 1975-77, Portugal exported an annual average of about
90,000 tons of nitrogen (Annex 5-5), about half of which was sold as ammonia
to Spain, Morocco, Algeria, the U.K., Greece, France and Denmark, and the rest
as calcium ammonium nitrate, nearly all of which went to EC countries. After
the Project is operational, QUIMIGAL plans to continue, until domestic demand
builds up, limited exports of nitrogen fertilizers to markets in Turkey,
Morocco and other North African countries as well as to established markets in
Europe; marginal amounts of ammonia (5,000-10,000 tpy) are also expected to be
exported for 2-4 years, mainly to Morocco and the Mediterranean countries.
Since the projected quantities available for export, based on relatively con-
servative domestic market estimates, are well below the levels of export sales
in the past, no difficulty is anticipated in finding overseas markets for
temporarily limited surplus production. With efficient and economic produc-
tion, the sales should generate substantial profits at world market prices.
G.   Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
5.22      Even before the January 1978 merger, the fertilizer companies had
achieved some degree of coordination of their sales and distribution efforts.
After the merger, QUIMIGAL started developing a plan to integrate all sales
and marketing activities under a single management to be achieved by the
middle of 1978. As there are no independent bulk blending facilities in
Portugal, QUIMIGAL carries out all formulations and sells final products for
direct use by farmers. At present, the bulk of QUIMIGAL's fertilizer distri-
bution is carried out by about 3,000 independent dealers, who receive the
fertilizers principally from QUIMIGAL's warehouses in the field, though a small
portion of sales is also effected from the plants. The Company possesses 75
warehouses, spread throughout the country, with a combined total capacity of
135,000 tons equal to about two months of storage. As a result of a detailed
study of future distribution requirements, the Company is planning to add
another 100,000 tons to its warehousing capacity. The investment cost of these
future facilities is estimated at US$10 million, which is expected to be fi-
nanced from internally generated funds. Since current storage is inadequate
for future distribution needs, agreement has been reached that QUIMIGAL will
complete, by September 30, 1979, its review of fertilizer warehousing needs
and construct sufficient warehousing capacity to handle the output of the
Project. Detailed planning is currently being carried out by QUIMIGAL to
ensure that close coordination will be effected between the marketing, distri-
bution and manufacturing functions when integration is completed.

H.   Fertilizer Study
5.23      The Government recognizes that a crucial factor in increasing future
agriculture production and in the economic utilization of the domestic fertil-
izer production capacity is the degree to which expected fertilizer demand
will indeed materialize. In spite of the Government's recent positive actions
in agriculture policy, considerable uncertainties exist as to the extent
and timing of the impact of these policies on actual fertilizer demand. For
this reason, the Government has agreed to carry out a comprehensive study of
fertilizer use in Portugal and thereafter to implement its recommendations. It
has been agreed that the study would: (i) identify the constraints to fertilizer
use and propose measures to remove them; (ii) help determine optimal applica-
tion of fertilizers by crop and region, (iii) evaluate the influence of other
complementary factors in the productivity of fertilizer use, and (iv) deter-
mine the improvements needed in fertilizer marketing, sales, pricing, and
distribution systems to support increased levels of fertilizer consumption.
The focus of the study is in line with the suggestions made in the recent
Agricultural Sector mission report (No. 1689-PO dated March 24, 1978). The
detailed terms of reference for the study (Project File - Reference J) and its
timetable of execution have been agreed; satisfactory assurances have been
obtained from the Government that it will furnish to the Bank the findings of
the study by June 30, 1980, and determine in consultation with the Bank the
actions necessary to implement the recommendations.
I.   Fertilizer Prices and Farmer Subsidies
5.24      The ex-factory price currently received by the fertilizer producers
for ammonium nitrates, the nitrogenous fertilizers most widely used in Portugal,
is slightly lower than international (FOB Mediterranean ports) prices. For
ammonium nitrate 26% N, the international price is about US$120/ton, and the
local ex-factory price is US$116/ton at the current exchange rate of 45.5
Escudos per US dollar. However, if a 15% shadow exchange rate of 52.3 Escudos
per US dollar were used, the local ex-factory price would be lower than inter-
national prices by about US$20/ton, or 17%. This differential is the same as
the differential in the raw material prices as the internal price for naphtha,
the raw material currently used to produce ammonia, is about half the interna-
tional price of about US$125/ton, FOB Rotterdam; this cost differential amounts
to about US$20/ton of 26% N ammonium nitrate. The new ammonia unit included in
the proposed Project will use fuel oil as raw material, which is priced at
US$80/ton and is equivalent to the international market price, i.e., US$75/ton,
FOB Rotterdam plus US$5/ton for freight. With the new ammonia plant QUIMIGAL
will be able to maintain parity between its ex-factory prices of nitrogenous
fertilizers and those ruling in European markets without need for subsidies on
its raw materials.
5.25      The following table compares the prices received by QUIMIGAL with
those paid by the farmer during 1978/79.

CAN 26.0              5,271        165     1,256         4,180
5.26      Although the local fertilizer companies receive prices roughly in
line with the current depressed international prices, the Government has found
it necessary since 1974 to keep fertilizer prices to farmers low in order to
maintain an adequate price ratio between agricultural products and fertilizers.
In 1978/79, the farmers' fertilizer subsidy payments amount to an average of
about 30% of railhead fertilizer prices (which are determined by the Govern-
ment on the basis of production costs). For ammonium nitrate 26% N, the
farmers are paying in 1978/79 US$92/ton compared to the railhead price of
US$119/ton. The farmers subsidy is compensated directly to the fertilizer
producers by the Government's "Fundo de Abastecimientos" on the basis of
sales invoices presented by the firms. While the overall arrangements meet,
in principle, the government objectives to give a fair price to the producers
while keeping fertilizer prices attractive to the farmers, fertilizer pro-
ducers have encountered difficulties, in the past, in obtaining timely pay-
ments from the Fundo. Delays of up to 180 days in receipt of such payments
have been experienced, forcing QUIMIGAL to resort to additional short-term
debt, which in turn leads to further increased interest costs and affects
liquidity. The situation has improved during 1978, when the Fundo started
making payments within 90 days. Since even this period leads to substantial
working capital needs and to prevent any repetition of past problems, agree-
ment has been reached with the Government, that the Fundo will adopt admin-
istrative procedures that will ensure release of compensation payments within
60 days of presentation of documents.
5.27      The total amount of compensation due to all fertilizer firms during
1977 amounted to US$48 million. Over the medium term, the Government intends
to phase out subsidies for agricultural inputs and outputs, including fertil-
izers, but recognizes that such phasing out would have to be gradual in order
to avoid an adverse effect on agricultural output or fertilizer use. The
Government's strategy regarding farmers fertilizer subsidies will be analyzed
under the fertilizer study mentioned in paragraph 5.23 above. The study will
consider such subsidies within the context of the evolution of prices of agri-
cultural goods (including agricultural subsidies) and will consider how the
fertilizer consumption growth rates can be maintained while introducing reduc-
tions in farmers fertilizer subsidies. In addition, to protect the financial
viability of the Project, and of the fertilizer industry, agreement has been
reached with the Government that it will continue with its pricing policy for
fertilizer inputs and outputs which ensures that QUIMIGAL can earn a reason-
able return on invested capital, provided that the facilities are operated
efficiently.

VI. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives, Scope and Location
6.01      As mentioned, the basic project objectives are to improve the per-
formance of the Portuguese fertilizer industry, which lacked adequate main-
tenance and reequipment investments in recent years, and to expand the pro-
duction capacity at existing plant facilities to levels necessary to meet
increased domestic market needs through the mid-1980s. The Project would,
thus, postpone the need for a new, costlier greenfield fertilizer complex
until the late-1980s (para 3.12).  The project scope was formulated after a
detailed review by QUIMIGAL of its existing physical plant to identify facil-
ities whose life could be extended through the 1980s through revamping and
those which have to be shutdown in the near future due to technical, economic
and/or ecological reasons (Project File - Reference C).  The new facilities
included in the Project are to replace the plants selected for closure and
to meet increased market needs in the future. The ammonia plant process was
selected to allow QUIMIGAL to switch its feedstock from naphtha to fuel oil.
This shift is in conformity with the Government's efforts to bring into a
better balance the future demand and supply of petroleum products (para 3.10).
6.02      The proposed Project includes (i) construction of a 297,000 tpy
(900 tpd) partial oxidation-based ammonia plant to be located at QUIMIGAL's
CUF plant at Lavradio; (ii) construction of two 119,000 tpy (360 tpd) nitric
acid plants to be located at QUIMIGAL's plants in CUF, Lavradio and NP,
Alverca; (iii) revamping of the 50,000 tpy urea plant located at Lavradio to
improve its efficiency and increase its capacity to 82,000 tpy; and (iv) re-
vamping of the ammonium nitrate facilities in Lavradio. The annual capacities
are calculated on the basis of 330 operating days per year. The new ammonia
plant will (i) replace two obsolete 18-year old naphtha-based 210 tpd ammonia
plants at Lavradio and Cabo Ruivo, which are scheduled for closure as part of
the proposed fertilizer industry modernization program (para 3.09); (ii) pro-
vide ammonia for the expanded urea and ammonium nitrate production at CUF;
and (iii) meet the increasing ammonia requirements of other fertilizer and
chemical plants in Portugal. Of the annual ammonia production of 267,000 tons
in 1985, when the Project reaches full capacity production, 202,000 tons would
be consumed within QUIMIGAL's own fertilizer production facilities and 60,000
tons would be sold to other users in Portugal. The nitric acid plants proposed
at CUF and NP will replace the old plants now in operation to improve efficien-
cies, reduce pollution and increase production to match the requirements for
expanded ammonium nitrate production. The table in Annex 6 and Chart C-1
shows the status of the Portuguese fertilizer industry before and after the
Project. Adequate land for the new plants is available within existing
complexes.
6.03      The proposed ammonia plant will be based on partial oxidation of
fuel oil or heavy residue using either the Shell or Texaco technology, to
be selected after evaluation of the engineering bids, expected in early 1979;
both technologies are acceptable. The purified synthesis gas will be com-
pressed and circulated over catalyst to produce ammonia. The oxygen for the
partial oxidation and the nitrogen for the production of ammonia will be
obtained from an air fractionation unit. The Bank has already financed two



- 27 -
similar plants of 900 tpd at Nangal (Credit No. 357-IND) and at Sindri (Credit
No. 520-IN) in India; the first plant has recently been satisfactorili o zi 
sioned and the second is under commissioning. The Bank has also financed
a 1,200 tpd partial oxidation plant now under construction at Araucaria in
Brazil (Loan No. 1256-BR). The nitric acid plants will be based on medium
pressure oxidation to reduce precious metal catalyst loss and improve ammonia
oxidation efficiency. Medium- or high-pressure absorption will be selected
after evaluation of the engineering bids. The urea plant will be revamped
to reduce unit ammonia and steam consumptions, and to increase production.
The revamping of the ammonium nitrate plant at Lavradio includes the replace-
ment of the present ammonium nitrate solution plant of 62,000 tpy capacity by
a new larger plant with a capacity of 124,000 tpy; additional ammonium nit-
rate solution storage, and replacement of the final concentration and dust
scrubber units. The Project also includes all necessary auxiliary and offsite
facilities for smooth and efficient operation, such as auxiliary steam boilers,
cooling and boiler feed water facilities, fuel oil, unloading and storage
facilities and product storage.
B.   Technology and Engineering
6.04      For revamping and expansion of the urea plant QUIMIGAL has already
received offers for a detailed study. QUIMIGAL has also invited, in consulta-
tion with the Bank, separate proposals from qualified engineering firms to
provide the technology and engineering for the ammonia and the nitric acid
plants. Based on the bid evaluation of these proposals, QUIMIGAL will select
one internationally experienced firm for each of the two plants, which will
have overall technological responsibility for plant performance. The selected
engineering firms are expected to associate with local engineering organiza-
tions in Portugal to the extent practicable for detailed engineering of the
plants. The services to be provided by the selected engineering firms will
include (i) assistance to QUIMIGAL in negotiating licensing agreements with
process licensors, if they are different from the engineering firms; (ii) basic
and detailed engineering of the battery limit plants; (iii) conceptual design
of the required additional offsite and auxiliary facilities; (iv) procurement
services for proprietary and critical equipment; (v) assistance in supervision
of erection, testing and start-up of the plants and (vi) training of the
QUIMIGAL operating and maintenance personnel. QUTMIGAL will carry out, through
its Division of New Plant Constructions (DNI): (a) the procurement of all
other project supplies in coordination with the selected engineering firms;
and (b) the civil works, foundations and erection through sub-contractors,
with the assistance of the selected engineering firms. DNI personnel have
substantial prior experience in successfully managing implementation of che-
mical plants. The arrangements for overall project management are described
in para 6.09.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
6.05      Fuel Oil or Heavy Residue:  The QUIMIGAL ammonia plant will require
about 250,000 tpy of fuel oil or heavy residue for use both as process feed-
stock and for steam regeneration. QUIMIGAL has obtained confirmation from
Petroleos de Portugal (PETROGAL) that it will supply fuel oil/heavy residue
required by the Project. PETROGAL has a total installed refining capacity of
about 18 million tpy of crude oil in its refineries at Sines (10 million tpy),



- 28 -
Porto (6 million tpy) and Cabo Ruivo (2 million tpy). The old topping unit at
Cabo Ruivo, near Lisbon, is expected to be shut down, when the Sines refinery
is fully operational, but PETROGAL plans to continue operation of the cracking
unit and other facilities at Cabo Ruivo to process fuel oil from the Sines
refinery to produce gasoline, gas oil and vacuum residue. At its rated
capacity, the Cabo Ruivo cracking unit produces about 500,000 tpy of vacuum
residue. PETROGAL would barge the vacuum residue supplies across the River
Tagus, using steam heated barges already available with PETROGAL, and deliver
it at the existing Lavradio terminal of the Electricidade de Portugal's (EDP)
power station at CUF. QUIMIGAL will construct, as part of the Project, addi-
tional fuel oil/heavy residue storage facilities to cover its requirements for
30 days. Assurances have been obtained from the Government and QUIMIGAL that
satisfactory arrangements will be made to ensure the steady supply of petro-
leum products as and when needed by QUIMIGAL. It has also been agreed that
such arrangements shall be made in respect of each plant in the Project not
later than 6 months prior to its mechanical completion.
6.06      Ammonia.  While the ammonia requirements of the CUF Lavradio com-
plex will be fully met from the new ammonia plant, the Alverca complex will
require about 102,000 tpy of ammonia from outside sources. The Alverca com-
plex now receives about 70,000 tpy of ammonia from EPG's ammonia plant at Cabo
Ruivo, through a 400 tpd capacity ammonia pipeline. The increased ammonia
needs of the Alverca complex will be indirectly met by the Lavradio complex
through product exchange agreement with EPG. Ammonia storage facilities avail-
able at Alverca and Cabo Ruivo are adequate to ensure reliable ammonia sup-
plies. QUIMIGAL has confirmed that it will conclude a satisfactory ammonia
exchange agreement with EPG, six months before the start up cf each plant in
the Project which will require this ammonia supply.
6.07      Power.  A 70 MW capacity EDP thermal station, recently commissioned
and captive to the Barreiro-Lavradio Complex, will meet the Project's power
requirements. The station at present has a load of only 25 MW power and,
therefore, has adequate spare generating capacity to meet the additional
power requirements, totalling about 30-35 MW of the Project's Lavradio facil-
ities. QUIMIGAL, therefore, intends to limit the Project's auxiliary steam
generation to match essential process requirements by us'ng electric drives
where possible. Even though the Lavradio thermal station is normally linked
to the national grid, the station includes the necessary safety system to
reduce power fluctuations, interruptions and failures; its performance so far
has been satisfactory. EDP has also agreed to uncouple the Lavradio thermal
station from the national grid, if steady plant operation requires such un-
coupling. In addition, by linking the Lavradio thermal station with the
500 MW power plant scheduled to be commissioned at Setubal in 1979, EDP in-
tends to ensure that the Barreiro-Lavradio Industrial Complex has adequate
and reliable power supply. The small additional power requirement for the
nitric acid/ammonium nitrate facility at the Alverca Complex will be supplied
from the public power supply system. The electric power supply arrangements
for the various project facilities are considered satisfactory.
6.08      Water.  The Lavradio Complex will need an additional 650 m 3/hour of
process water for the project facilities. QUIMIGAL had originally planned
to drill additional wells within the complex to meet the increased water

requirements. However, the Government of Portugal, which has been concerned
about the optimum use of underground water in and around Lisbon, has suspended
drilling of new wells until a study of the region's water resources and needs,
now in progress, is completed. If the findings of the study do not permit
additional wells within the complex and since a recent study by QUIMIGAL con-
sultants has found the use of the nearby salty river water for cooling as un-
economical, QUIMIGAL plans to install its tube wells about 20 km away from the
project site and pipe the water to the complex. Agreement has been obtained
from the Government that QUIMIGAL will be permitted to develop a water supply
system adequate for the Project's requirements. QUIMIGAL expects to decide on
the source of water supply by the end of 1978. The cost estimate for the
Project3includes the proportionate cost (30%) of wells and 20 km pipeline of
2,000 m /hour capacity adequate to meet the Project's and other requirements
at the Lavradio complex. The additional water required for the project
facilities at Alverca will be met from the public water supply system.
D.   Project Management and Schedule
6.09      The Project will be implemented by the Division, which will comple-
ment its own staff with experienced personnel allocated to the Project by DNI
- QUIMIGAL's New Plant Construction Division. QUIMIGAL has already identified
two experienced and capable project managers: one to be in charge of the
ammonia and urea debottlenecking components, and the other to be in charge of
the nitric acid and ammonium nitrate components. The project managers will be
assisted by experienced process engineers who will later become part of the
plant operating team. DNI, though newly formed, is already managing the con-
struction of several QUIMIGAL projects with total investment of about US$120
million. Within the DNI, a new department will be formed to handle the pro-
curement and construction of the Project. The new department will coordinate
with the three engineering firms who will be responsible for the procurement
of all process critical and imported supplies for the urea, ammonia and nitric
acid/ammonium nitrate facilities. Construction and erection will be sub-
contracted to local firms and will be supervised by DNI personnel, assisted
by specialists from the engineering firms. The DNI personnel for construction
supervision will be recruited from the maintenance departments at CUF -
Lavradio, and NP - Alverca, and will later form the maintenance teams for the
new plants after they are commissioned. DNI has a capable project scheduling
team and uses network scheduling to monitor the progress and identify critical
areas for immediate action. With substantial prior experience in similar
projects, DNI staff are considered capable of adequately supervising the
engineering firms and, with their assistance, the contractors. The arrange-
ments for project implementation are thus satisfactory and the transition to
the operating phase is also expected to be smooth (para 6.12).
6.10      The Project is expected to require about 36 months for completion,
after the engineering arrangements are finalized for the ammonia and nitric
acid plants--expected by January 1, 1979. A detailed implementation sched-
ule for the Project is shown on the following page. QUIMIGAL intends to award
the engineering contract for the CUF-Lavradio nitric acid plant by mid-1979,
to match its completion with that of the ammonia plant. Since the different
project components are closely interrelated, QUIMIGAL has verified the imple-
mentation schedules for all project components and agreed to monitor them

closely thereafter to ensure coordinated completion of all components. Based
on experience with similar plants elsewhere and the nature of implementation
arrangements for the Project, the schedule for achieving the completion of
the Project by March 31, 1982 is considered reasonable. Commissioning is
expected to be completed      by December 1980 for the revamped urea plant,
March 1981 for the NP nitric acid plant, by March 1982 for the CUF nitric acid
plant, and March 1982 for the ammonia plant. Performance tests for the
ammonia plant, which will be the last plant to be commissioned, are expected
to be completed by September 1982.
E.   Ecology
6.11      The ammonia and nitric acid plants will be designed to meet environ-
mental standards generally used in most developed countries. The selected
engineering firms will be required to provide conceptual designs of liquid
effluent treatment units to treat the effluents to an acceptable level for
discharge into the River Tagus. The bid invitation requires that the ammonia
plant should include facilities for the disposal of'hydrocyanic acid, if
any, and a Claus unit for the recovery of at least 95% of the total sulphur.
The nitric acid plant will be engineered to reach stack oxides of nitrogen
levels below 200 ppm. Even though the ammonia plant will be engineered for
maximum recycle of carbon, studies are being carried out to modify the power
plant steam generation units to burn carbon pellets, if required. The plants
will also be engineered to acceptable safety standards and noise levels. There
are only limited government environmental standards and QUIMIGAL will obtain
necessary government clearances after the engineering firms are selected.
Confirmation has been obtained from QUIMIGAL that the design, construction
and operations of the project facilities will comply with satisfactory envi-
ronmental and safety standards acceptable to the Bank.
F.   Employment and Training
6.12      The Project will create direct additional employment for only about
120 workers, since it is a modernization project and most of the staff required
for the ammonia, and nitric acid plants will be obtained by the shutdown of the
existing plants. The engineers required for normal operations will come partly
from the project staff and partly from the existing plants. The skilled and
semi-skilled technicians will be selected from about 1,200 chemical operators
now working at Lavradio and Alverca, taking into account their skills and capa-
bilities for learning new technologies. They will be trained both within and
outside Portugal. The engineering agreements will include provisions for
necessary training of QUIMIGAL staff outside Portugal. As mentioned, during
project construction a part of the normal maintenance crew will gain skills
and familiarity with the equipment. To ensure that all of the Project's train-
ing needs are adequately covered in time, QUIMIGAL has agreed to complete a
detailed training plan before June 30, 1980, and to subsequently implement it
in time for project start-up. The Project, therefore, is expected to have an
adequate and experienced team available in time for taking over the operation
and maintenance of the new facilities.

VII. CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
7.01      The total project financing required, including physical and price
contingencies, working capital and interest during construction, is estimated
at US$242 million, of which US$146 million would be in foreign exchange. Of
the total project cost, the ammonia plant including associated facilities is
expected to cost US$187 million (77%); the urea revamping US$10 million (4%);
the Lavradio nitric acid/ammonium nitrate plants US$24 million (10%) and the
Alverca nitric acid plant US$21 million (9%). The detailed cost breakdown by
project components is given in Annex 7-1 and the overall project costs are
summarized in the following table:

- 33 -
7.02      The base cost estimates are in June 1978 prices and were prepared
by foreign engineering firms (Lurgi for the ammonia plant and Uhde for
the nitric acid plant, both of Germany) and by QUIMIGAL's engineering staff in
April 1978. The estimate for the ammonia plant was further cross-checked and
revised upwards by Bank staff on the basis of recent capital cost information
on fuel-oil based ammonia plants financed by the Bank. The cost of urea
revamping is based on an actual proposal presented to QUIMIGAL by TECHNIP of
the US.
7.03      All imported equipment and materials for the Project will be exempt
from import duties and direct taxes. Physical contingencies equivalent to
about 10% of the base cost estimate have been added. Comparison of the base
project cost with costs of similar plants nearing completion and review of the
civil works costs in Portugal indicate that this physical contingency provision
is adequate. Price escalation is calculated on the basis of price increases
in US dollars of 7.5% per year in 1978 and 1979, and 7% per year thereafter
for equipment and materials, civil works and other items. This estimated
international price escalation rate was used for both local and foreign
expenditure (expressed in US$) on the assumption that differences in the
international and domestic inflation rates will be accounted for by adjust-
ments in the exchange rate. Such adjustments are the current government
policy, which is expected to continue. The above capital cost estimates,
including contingencies, are considered adequate.
7.04      Working capital requirements for the Project are estimated at US$12.8
million equivalent (Annex 7-2); this relatively low requirement is because a
major part of project capacity would replace existing old facilities. Interest
during construction is estimated at US$34.2 million, based on the disbursement
schedule shown in Annex 7-3 and interest rate of 10% for foreign loans. It
also includes an Interest Equalization Tax of 8% on Government's equity con-
tributions, which is payable by Law to the Government during project construc-
tion, in order to avoid any preference by public enterprises for government
equity over debt.
B.   Financing Plan
7.05      The financing plan for the Project, agreed with the Government and
QUIMIGAL, is shown below and detailed terms of each financing source are given
in Annex 7-4.

Total Financing                           96.1  146.0  242.1         100.0
7.06      The Government will provide US$87.5 million equivalent in equity
funds during the project construction period to cover 36% of financing needs.
QUIMIGAL will contribute US$15.8 million equivalent from its internal cash
generation, to bring total equity financing to US$103.3 million or 42.6% of
total financing. Satisfactory agreement has been reached with the Government
on the size and timing of its equity participation in the Project, as well as
provision of additional funds required to cover any cost overrun and financing
shortfall on terms satisfactory to the Bank.
7.07      Debt financing totalling US$138.8 million equivalent would be
obtained from four major sources. The proposed Bank loan of US$58 million
equivalent will finance an agreed list of goods and cover 24% of project cost
and 40% of foreign exchange cost. The loan would be made to QUIMIGAL for 15
years including 3 years of grace at an annual interest rate of 10%, with the
difference between the 10% and the Bank's lending rate payable to the Govern-
ment. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Company.
7.08      The European Investment Bank (EIB) will provide about US$21 million
equivalent (17.0 million units of account) for the Project. The loan, approved
by EIB's Board on October 14, 1978, will finance a separate second list of goods
agreed with QUIMIGAL. The EIB loan has an interest rate of 8.6% p.a., and a
maturity of 14 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace. QUIMIGAL will seek up
to US$31 million of additional funds for the Project as suppliers' credits at
8% p.a. for 10 years, including three years of grace. These suppliers'
credits, which the Project can financially support (para 8.05) and for which
letters of interest have already been received, would be used to finance
imported equipment and materials preallocated to a third list approved by the
Bank. The remaining financing gap of US$28.8 million is expected to be
covered by loans totalling about US$24 million from international banks, most
likely under co-financing arrangements with the Bank, and the remaining US$4.8
million from local banks. QUIMIGAL has received offers from a number of banks
in Europe and the US to participate in the Project, and confirmation has been
obtained that QUIMIGAL will finalize arrangements for commercial loans totall-
ing at least US$28.8 million before June 30, 1979. Meeting of the conditions



- 35 -
of effectiveness of the EIB loan will be a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan.
C.   Procurement
7.09      Except for proprietary and critical items, the goods and services
for the Project will be procured under international competitive bidding in
order to minimize project costs. During May 1978, QUIMIGAL issued the Invi-
tations to Bid for engineering services for the ammonia and nitric plants to
two lists of prequalified engineering firms. The Invitation to Bid and
list of engineering firms was approved by the Bank. It is expected that the
engineering contract for the nitric acid plants and the urea revamping will
be signed in January 1979. The contract for the ammonia plant is scheduled to
be signed in early 1979. Equipment purchases will start in mid-1979, in time
for project   completion in March 1982.
7.10      Procurement of equipment for the Project will be carried out in
accordance with the guidelines of the Bank and the EIB, except for goods to be
financed through suppliers' credits. QUIMIGAL will carry out the qualifica-
tion and selection of the vendors with the assistance of the engineering
firms. The technical bid documents will also be prepared with their assist-
ance. The invitation and evaluation of bids covering the imported equipment
and supplies will be carried out by the engineering firms, who will also
coordinate QUIMIGAL's procurement of domestic supplies. As desired by EIB,
procurement will be done under parallel financing on the basis of prior
allocation of packages to the Bank and EIB. The EIB loan, together with a
part of the suppliers' credits and commercial loans, will be used to finance
the Alverca nitric acid plant, and the air and nitrogen wash units and related
compressors for the ammonia plant. The proposed Bank loan will finance: (a)
the cost of engineering services; (b) the foreign exchange cost of the fertil-
izer study; and (c) equipment allocated for Bank financing. International
competitive bidding will be used for the Bank financed equipment, in accordance
with a list of goods agreed with the Bank, except for small items costing less
than US$200,000 (up to a maximum total of US$5 million) and proprietary and
critical items not exceeding US$5.0 million which will be procured after
prudent international shopping. About US$2.5 million in foreign exchange cost
of retroactive financing would be required, about US$1.5 million for engineer-
ing services and US$1.0 million for equipment. The recommended retroactive
financing would represent 5% of the proposed Bank loan and would ensure prompt
and efficient project execution.
7.11      QUIMIGAL will finance the local engineering, civil works and erec-
tion contracts with Portuguese funds. The civil works and erection contrac-
tors will be selected after competitive bidding among local contractors who
are cost competitive. The capabilities available to these contractors are
considered adequate for the timely and efficient completion of these works.
Proposed arrangements for local procurement are considered satisfactory.
D.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursements
7.12      The allocation of the proposed Bank loan of US$58 million will be
as follows:



- 36 -

Total                          58.0
7.13      It is expected that awards for about 35% - or US$12.5 million - of
equipment items will go to Portuguese suppliers after ICB; qualified local
suppliers would be entitled to a margin of preference of 15% or applic-
able import duties, whichever is lower. The Bank loan is expected to be
completely disbursed by December 31, 1982. A disbursement schedule is given
in Annex 7-3. As already discussed in para 7.10, retroactive financing
totalling up to US$2.5, is recommended to cover expenditures made after Septem-
ber 1, 1978 against the engineering contracts and some long-delivery items.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs of the Project
8.01      Key assumptions used in the financial analysis are given in Annex
8-1. It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production of urea
in January 1981 and ammonium nitrate and ammonia facilities start up at the
end of March 1982. Because of this staggered schedule of plant completion,
capacity utilization for all finished product facilities of the Project will
build up over a relatively prolonged period, from 22% in 1981 to 90% in 1984,
as shown in table below.

8.02      Revenue estimates are based on finished fertilizer sales, except
for sale of the ammonia produced by the Project in substantial quantities
for use outside the Project facilities, which are shown as "Inter-Company
Transfers." Domestic prices, including compensation payments against farmer
subsidies, currently received by QUIMIGAL are close to international export
prices plus the transport differential. It is understood that the government
policy to keep ex-factory prices close to international prices will continue,
and that where there are minor differences domestic ex-factory prices will be
brought in line with projected international standards by 1979, and maintained
in that relationship thereafter. As further discussed in paras 9.02-9.03,
there is some uncertainty as to the international long term equilibrium prices
for nitrogenous fertilizers and a range of prices has been used in making the
economic analysis of the Project. The lower end of the price range has been
used in the financial analysis in order to give a conservative estimate of the
future financial state of the Project and the Company. On this basis, it is
conservatively projected that by 1985 the domestic ex-factory ammonia price in
Portugal will be US$193/ton (in constant 1978 prices), the urea price also
US$193/ton, and ammonium nitrate US$131/ton for 26% N and US$161/ton for 33.5%
N; after 1985, the prices, which are the same as economic prices (para 9.02),
are assumed to remain constant in real terms. These prices are based on the
projected 1985 FOB North West Europe price for ammonia of US$163/ton, a
US$30/ton cost of shipping and other charges to or from Portugal for ammonia
and a US$18/ton transport cost for the other products. The domestic prices
assumed would mean an average real increase in domestic fertilizer prices of
2-3% per year between 1978-85, depending on the product.

B.   Financial Projections of the Project
8.04      Due to the uncertainties in estimating future inflation rates in
Portugal, financial projections are expressed in current US dollars, instead
of Escudos. Annual escalation of costs and revenues is assumed, both for
local and foreign costs, to be equal to 6%, which is the international infla-
tion rate in US dollar terms projected by the Bank. This approach assumes
that any difference between domestic and international inflation will be
accounted for by appropriate exchange rate adjustments, a policy currently
being followed and expected to be continued by the Government. Detailed
financial projections for the Project, are shown in Annex 8-3 and Project File
- Reference K, and are summarized in the table on the following page.
8.05      Outside revenues are expected to grow rapidly from US$16.5 million
in 1981 to US$75.9 million in 1984, the first year the Project reaches 90%
capacity utilization, and US$83.0 million in 1985. Inter-Company Transfers,
consisting of sales of ammonia to non-project related facilities are estimated
to begin in 1982 and reach US$31.3 million in 1985. These transfers, not
reflected in outside revenues, constitute a major source of revenue and
associated production costs of the Project. The Project is expected to show
a small (US$3.7 million) profit before taxes in 1981; taxes are not assessed
on a divisional basis but are calculated on a corporate basis at the rate
of 40% of pre-tax profit after the earnings and losses of all divisions have
been added together. However, profits remain low in 1982 and 1983 due to
higher interest and depreciation charges. Net income before taxes would reach
US$33.7 million or 28% of net revenues in 1986. As depreciation represents
an important share of total costs, the Project would generate a substantial,
positive cash flow even during the early years of operations. Although debt
service coverage in 1982 will be low at 1.3, when debt service requirements
would be maximum, the ratio improves steadily thereafter, reaching 2.7 by
1986. The Project is expected to contribute substantial cash to QUIMIGAL,
after it attains capacity production.
C.   Financial Projections of Non-Project Facilities - Fertilizer
Division and QUIMIGAL
8.06      Detailed financial projections for the non-project facilities of
the Division and of QUIMIGAL as a whole, which in each case include closure of
some plants being replaced by project facilities, are shown in Project File -
Reference L. The Division's non-project facilities are expected to generate a
substantial surplus cash flow, as total revenues increase 128% from US$108.7
million in 1977 to US$248.4 million in 1985. Pretax net income is expected to
grow from US$5.7 million (or 5% of total revenue) in 1977 to US$44.6 million
(or 18%) in 1985. This cash flow will assure healthy debt service coverage
and good balance sheet ratios. Debt service coverage is projected to increase
from 2.7 in 1977 to 6.4 in 1985.
8.07      Overall corporate earnings which, despite fertilizer division prof-
its, have been in deficit the past three years, are expected to be only
slightly better than breakeven in 1978 and 1979. QUIMIGAL's projections
for non-project facilities include completion of the nine new non-fertilizer
investment projects described in para 4.09. These will contribute signifi-
cantly to corporate cashflow, thereby bringing the non-fertilizer activities

from a net loss to a net profit situation. By 1981, even with the start-up of
most of these new projects, the Company is expected to show earnings, of only
US$26 million, or 5% of total revenues. Net income is expected to rise from
that level to US$60 million (9% of total revenues) in 1985. Because of
QUIMIGAL's heavy capitalization and relatively low initial debt load, it is
expected to maintain satisfactory debt service coverage throughout the fore-
cast period, rising from 1.3 in 1978 to 3.2 in 1986. However, this assumes
satisfactory completion of arrangements now underway to convert the equivalent
of about US$45 million of short-term loans into long-term obligations in the
first quarter of 1979, and the subsequent reimbursement of roughly US$20
million for properties taken by the Government from QUIMIGAL and not yet paid
for (para 4.08). It is anticipated that QUIMIGAL will not pay any dividends
during the forecast period because of the Company's large cash requirements
for its expansion plans (para 8.11).
D.   Financial Projections of the Fertilizer Division
and QUIMIGAL -- Consolidated with the Project
8.08      Financial projections for the Fertilizer Division and QUIMIGAL, in
each case consolidated with the Project, are shown in Annexes 8-4 and 8-5 and
summarized on the following page.
8.09      Consolidation of the Project with non-project facilities of the
Division and QUIMIGAL produces a strong combined financial situation. Although
during 1982-83 the Project would have a temporary adverse effect on the overall
profitability of the Division due to low initial capacity utilization and high
debt service charges, after 1983 project facilities would be more profitable
than other operations. Consequently, on a consolidated basis, the Division's
pre-tax income is projected to increase from US$13.7 million or 11% of total
revenues in 1978 to US$73.7 million or 21% of total revenues in 1986. Debt
service of the Division is covered by internal cash generation a minimum of
2.1 times in 1983 when debt service is heaviest - and a maximum of 5.2 times -
in 1981 before project debt service begins. The minimum current ratio of the
Division is expected to be 1.6:1.0 and the maximum debt/equity ratio to be
49:51.
8.10      QUIMIGAL's net income on a consolidated basis is expected to increase
from US$3.8 million (or 1% of total revenues) in 1978 to US$85.9 million (10%)
of total revenues in 1986. Most of this income would be contributed by the
Fertilizer Division, and the nine new projects currently being implemented by
other divisions would mainly compensate losses incurred by QUIMIGAL's existing
non-fertilizer operations. Debt service coverage for QUIMIGAL is expected to
improve from 1.3 in 1978 to 2.7 in 1986. The minimum current ratio for the
Company as a whole is estimated at 1.4:1.0 and the maximum debt/equity ratio
at 44:56.
E.   Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
8.11      Financial covenants have been agreed which are applicable at three
levels: (a) Covenants, relating to the financing of the Project, which
ensure the financing plan is adequate (paras. 7.06 and 7.08). (b) Covenants
which apply at the level of the Fertilizer and Pesticides Division, which has

an independent entity and maintains its own financial accounts; these covenants
relate to prices (para. 5.27) and its financial performance. (c) Covenants
which apply at the level of the Company to ensure its financial performance is
satisfactory. In addition to the covenants already referred to in paras.
4.07, 4.08, 5.27, 7.06 and 7.08, agreement has been reached on the following
covenants: (i) The Division and QUIMIGAL will both be required to follow
prudent financial practices and maintain at all times a debt/equity ratio of
at least 60/40; (ii) QUIMIGAL will not incur additional debt in any fiscal
year if by so doing the projected debt service coverage will fall below 1.4;
(iii) Both QUIMIGAL and the Division will maintain a current ratio of at least
1.3:1; (iv) QUIMIGAL will not prepay any long-term debt or make any financial
commitments to subsidiaries if this would reduce its current ratio below 1.5:1;
(v) QUIMIGAL will obtain prior approval from the Bank for all new projects,
apart from the nine expansion projects currently being implemented (para
4.09), and involving capital investments in excess of US$8 million per year.
Further, the Government has agreed that QUIMIGAL will not be required to pay
any dividend except out of QUIMIGAL's accumulated adjusted net earnings, and,
if necessary it will enable QUIMIGAL to obtain additional long-term funds in
order to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5:1. QUIMIGAL will have its
accounts audited annually in time by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and submit periodic progress reports to the Bank.
F.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.12      On the basis of above assumptions, the financial rate of return for
the Project in constant terms for the base case is estimated at 15% before
taxes (Annex 8-6). Sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return is most
sensitive to changes in revenues. If the f.o.b. Western Europe price of urea (in
1978 terms) stabilizes at US$203/ton in 1985, instead of US$175 as assumed,
and the domestic prices were adjusted accordingly, the financial rate of
return will rise to 18%. Results of the sensitivity tests are shown in
Project File - Refrence M and are summarized below:

8.14      The Project does not face any major risks which could seriously
jeopardize its technical or economic viability. The Project does face some
uncertainty relating to the future domestic market for fertilizers. For



- 43 -
domestic consumption to grow at the projected rate, the Government must
implement its agricultural policy to encourage efficient farming, and ensure
that the complementary inputs required are made available to the agricultural
sector. With the establishment of IFADAP (para 5.09), a good start has been
made in improving the credit system. The improved agricultural extension
services (para 5.11) will also play an important role in increasing agricul-
ture production and thus generating additional fertilizer consumption. Pro-
vided the policy measures mentioned in paras 5.05 - 5.12 are adequately
implemented, the projected most likely demand should be achieved. Another
aspect of the fertilizer marketing that represents some risk is the farmers
subsidy, which currently amounts to about 30% of the ex-factory price received
by the industry. The Government intends to gradually phase out subsidies.
However, for food production to increase (and food imports to be reduced), the
maintenance of an adequate ratio between food grain prices and fertilizer
prices is essential; thus, as fertilizer subsidies are phased out, food grain
prices received by the farmer must be permitted to rise, otherwise both food
production and fertilizer consumption may be adversely affected. However,
such a risk is reduced by the Government agreement to carry out, and sub-
sequently implement the findings of a comprehensive study of fertilizer
demand, pricing, marketing and distribution (para 5.23). Finally, as the
projected domestic market is based on conservative estimates and the projected
exports are substantially less than those achieved in the past, the market
related risks are considered limited.
8.15      The technical risks associated with the Project are also limited.
The use of the partial oxidation process for ammonia production from fuel oil
is not considered to present any special risk in view of the successful oper-
ation of this process elsewhere. Care will, however, be taken during the
selection of experienced engineering firms that the most appropriate process
design is selected and in ensuring that the technology transfer will be car-
ried out efficiently.
8.16      The Project might face some management related risk.  The process
of merging the three constituent companies of QUIMIGAL into an integrated
whole is now proceeding, and until this process is completed, it is possible
that some management problems will arise. While the merging process has been
tackled with efficiency and tact by the new management so far, the progress
in this area will be carefully followed by the Bank staff during the next
year to ensure that successful implementation of the Project is not hindered
because of any unresolved management issues. In summary, considering the
arrangements made by QUIMIGAL to implement the Project and the assurances
obtained from the Company and the Government, the risks associated with the
Project are considered acceptable.

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
9.01      For calculating the economic costs and benefits of the Project,
international prices have been used for all tradeable goods and services,
and domestic prices for all non-tradeable items except electric power
(Annex 9-1). No shadow pricing of non-tradeable inputs is used in the
base case, but in the sensitivity analysis a shadow exchange rate, 15% higher
than the official rate, is applied.
9.02      Currently there is some uncertainty as to the future international
prices for nitrogenous fertilizers. In the past, world fertilizer prices have
shown strong cyclical fluctuations. This was mainly because of overinvestment
in fertilizer production facilities when international prices were high and the
postponement and/or cancellation of investments when prices were low. During
the late 1960's, world fertilizer prices were depressed by excess supply and,
subsequently, investments in new fertilizer projects declined sharply. When
the world demand for fertilizers rose rapidly during 1972/73 with the spreading
of the "green revolution" based on high-yielding seed varieties, the demand was
not matched by adequate fertilizer supply. Partly as a result of this imbalance
and due to sharp increases in the price of crude oil and fertilizer feedstocks
in 1973/74, international fertilizer prices skyrocketed. For example, the
world urea price peaked at US$350-400/ton in August 1974 (from US$50-60 per ton
in 1970) and the price remained high until mid-1975. Subsequently, it declined
to a low level of US$90-100 per ton in 1976/77. This decline is attributable
to both the reduced imports of fertilizers by countries which had accumulated
substantial stocks during the panic buying of 1973-75 in anticipation of
further price increases, and the substantial investments stimulated by high
prices in the early 1970's. As a result, there is currently a surplus
nitrogenous fertilizer production capacity in the world and this situation is
likely to continue until 1981/82. The surplus as a percentage of total world
production is, however, small and likely to peak at 6-7% before declining.
After 1983/84, the world would need about 20 large-scale nitrogen fertilizer
plants a year to meet the increasing demand. These plants will only be built
if there is an expectation of prices adequate to spur new investment. Though
in recent months the urea price has gradually increased to US$140-155 per ton
bagged (f.o.b., exporting countries), it is still below the long-term equilib-
rium price level. An equilibrium between supply and demand of nitrogenous
fertilizers is expected to be reached by the mid-1980's at which time the
international urea price is likely to be determined by the economic export
price of the new natural-gas-based plants. According to the projections
by the IBRD Economic Analysis and Projections Department, 1/ the urea price
(f.o.b. Northwest Europe) is expected to reach US$203/ton of bagged urea by
1985 in 1978 terms. However, the latest data on investment and operating
costs for urea plants based on natural gas indicate that the long-term
1/   Commodity Price Forecasts, IBRD Economic Analysis and Projections
Department, April 12, 1978 and October 5, 1978 (mid-year updating).



- 45 -
equilibrium price may be lower, probably ranging between US$175-203 per ton
in 1978 terms. Based on this range for the f.o.b. price of urea and allowing
for ocean freight and insurance charges of US$12 per ton (assuming Portugal
would import nitrogenous fertilizers from North-Western and Eastern Europe if
it does not build its own plants), the projected long-term economic c.i.f.
price of bagged urea in Portugal is calculated at US$187-215 per ton in 1978
terms. The economic ex-factory price for the Project was derived by adding an
allowance of US$6/ton for local port handling, storage and internal freight
differential.
9.03      In calculating ammonia prices, it is assumed that ammonia and bulk
urea will maintain a one to one price relationship at a Baltic port; this
economic relationship has also been reflected in average market prices during
the last few years, except for periods when demand/supply factors temporarily
distorted it. To obtain the economic ammonia price in the domestic market,
US$30/ton was added to the f.o.b. Baltic port price of ammonia (to cover
transport, port and inland freight charges). The ammonia export price was
derived by subtracting US$30/ton from the f.o.b. Baltic port price. The
f.o.b. Rotterdam/Baltic port price for each grade of ammonium nitrate, was
derived from the international urea prices on nutrient basis plus a 10% factor
to allow for the better crop response obtained from ammonium nitrate. To this
price, US$12/ton freight and US$6/ton local port handling, storage and internal
freight differential allowance was added in order to obtain the price of each
grade of ammonium nitrate for the local market, while US$18/ton allowance was
deducted to obtain the ex-factory export price. The resulting economic prices
in 1978 dollars during the operating life of the Project, which are the same
as those used in the financial analysis, are shown below:

9.04      At standard capacity utilization, the project facilities will produce
267,000 tpy of ammonia, 74,000 tpy of urea, 207,000 tpy of nitric acid, 182,000
tpy of ammonium nitrate (26% N,) and 118,000 tpy of ammonium nitrate (33.5% N).
Total revenues were estimated using these production capacities and the prices
shown above.
9.05      Since Portugal is expected to remain in surplus during the Project's
life, the economic cost of fuel oil (US$70/ton in 1978 dollars), which other-
wise would have to be exported has been estimated by subtracting differential
transportation and handling charges of US$5/ton from the projected competing
f.o.b. export port price of US$75/ton. The cost of electric power is estimated
to have an economic price of US$0.035/ Kwh, which is 75% higher than the
financial cost of US$.02/Kwh.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
9.06      The base case economic rate of return for the Project as a whole is
calculated at 14% using the lower price assumptions outlined above and 18% for
the higher urea reference price (Annex 9-2). The economic rates of return for
the individual project components are calculated as follows: 13% and 17% re-
spectively, for the ammonia plant, 13% and 16% for the urea revamping, 13%
and 16% for the CUF nitric acid/ammonium nitrate plant, and 16% and 20% for
the nitric acid/ ammonium nitrate plant at NP. These return calculations are
based on the official exchange rate of Esc 45.5 = US$1. If a shadow exchange
rate of Esc 52.3 = US$1 were used to take into account the effect of distortions
in the foreign trade incentive system, for example, import duties and restric-
tions (such as import surcharges), the economic returns for the Project as a
whole increase to 16% (low price assumption) and 20% (high price assumption).
9.07      The adequate rate of return for the Project indicates that, on the
basis of expected inLernational prices for feedstocks and nitrogenous fertilizers
and capital and operating costs for the Project, it should be more advantageous
for the country to produce domestically the proposed fertilizers rather than to
import them. The economic advantage in local production comes about because:
(i) A well-developed infrastructure already exists not only in the country as a
whole but also on the project site. Since the Project represents an expansion
of existing facilities, expenditures on site preparation and offsites such as
power generation, water supply, transportation are much lower than would be the
case in a green field site. (ii) The Company possesses a capable and experienced
management and labor force. As a result, several capital cost items, such as
construction implementation and supervision, start-up and training costs should
be kept to a minimum. (iii) The Project will enjoy a significant transportation
advantage for local consumption over imported materials as discussed in para-
graph 9.03 above. The fact that fuel oil is being used instead of other feed-
stocks like natural gas (the country has no natural gas) is not a handicap
since the lower capital and operating costs of the Project due to the above
reasons would make the Project competitive by offsetting the economic advant-
age of the use of natural gas in projects elsewhere (several new projects in
Western Europe are also likely to be based on fuel oil).
9.08      The results of the sensitivity analysis on economic rates of return,
shown in the chart on the following page, indicate that the Project is highly
sensitive to changes in selling prices of its products, but less so to changes

in capital or operating costs. Sensitivity analysis should be viewed with
care since fluctuations in operating costs due to changes in feedstock prices
are normally also accompanied by fluctuations in output prices. The results
of the sensitivity analysis for the Project as a whole for both the official
and the shadow rate of exchange mentioned above are given in Project File -
Reference M and summarized below:

Operating Cost up 10%                    12       16             14        18
One Year Delay in Completion             13       16             14        17
If no exports were possible and domestic sales remained as projected, the rate
of return in the base case (low price assumption) would fall to 13% at the
official exchange rate and to 15% at the shadow exchange rate. On the other
hand, if the domestic market developed better than projected eliminating the
need for exports, the returns would increase to 15% and 17%, respectively.
The economic and financial rates of return are
close to each other because international prices have been used in both cases
with the exception that, in the economic rate of return calculations, fuel oil
is priced slightly lower and electric power slightly higher than in the
financial rate of return. The effect of these two changes almost offset each
other, bringing the two rates of return close together.
9.09      As mentioned in paragraph 5.16 - 5.17 above, the sales volume assumed
for the domestic market is reasonable and the probability that domestic demand
would be significantly lower than expected is not high. Similarly, the
probability that fertilizer prices will be significantly below forecast prices
is not very high either. An analysis of supply and demand balances expected
during the next decade, indicates that fertilizer prices are likely to steadily
increase as shown in the table in paragraph 9.01 above. Although periods of
oversupply may occur during portions of the economic life of the Project, it
is very unlikely that such periods will be long enough to cause a major depres-
sion of the average prices below the lower level assumed above. Actually, the
economic analysis assumes that product prices in real terms would remain
constant during the Project life, after they reach the equilibrium level in
1985. The other main factor determining revenues is the production level.
Considering QUIMIGAL's past performance, it is expected to maintain or exceed
the production levels assumed. Therefore, the likelihood that project revenues
will be significantly below the forecast revenues is small. On the other
hand, past experience suggests that significant changes in either operating



- 49 -
or capital costs during the Project life are more plausible. However, as the
sensitivity analysis shows, the impact of such changes individually on the
economic rate of return is limited.
C.   Foreign Exchange Savings and Other Benefits
9.10      The Project's net foreign exchange earnings, after provision of
principal and interest payments on the foreign loans, are estimated to average
US$40 million annually in constant 1978 dollars. Besides the satisfactory
rate of return, the Project will also generate other substantial economic
benefits to Portugal. The expansion of domestic fertilizer production will
ensure security of supply, thus allowing Portugal to pursue its agricultural
production growth targets with more certainty about the supply of fertilizers.
The Government has put a heavy emphasis on agricultural development, and
stepped up fertilizer supply will play a key role in increasing agricultural
production by increasing yields. This should help reduce imports of food and
ease the balance of payments constraint on the country's growth. Increase in
agricultural productivity and output should also help reduce the widespread
under-employment in the agricultural sector and, to an extent, also help in
stemming the outflow of labor from the agricultural sector to urban areas.
9.11      The Government has agreed to carry out a comprehensive fertilizer
use study under the Project (para 5.23). The study will also consider fer-
tilizer pricing within the context of the evaluation of prices of agricultural
goods, including agricultural subsidies. It is considered important for plan-
ning the future development of the agricultural sector, and the implementation
of its findings is essential for increasing agricultural productivity.
9.12      In addition to rationalizing the policies affecting fertilizer
usage in agriculture, the Project will have other important institution
building effects. Through the Project, the Bank will be working closely,
from the beginning, with the newly created QUIMIGAL and, thus, participate
in the Government's efforts in rationalizing Portugal's fertilizer subsector.
Through the involvement of local engineering firms in project implemen-
tation, a significant transfer of technology will take place and facilitate
the execution of future chemical projects in Portugal. Furthermore, of
equipment purchases totalling US$99.3 million (in constant 1978 prices),
US$26.1 million or 26% of the total are expected to be supplied by local
manufacturers. Of the project civil works, engineering and erection services,
about 72% or US$35.3 million would be provided domestically.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major assurances and agreements have been obtained
from the.Government and QUIMIGAL:
A.   From the Government that it will:

Fundo de Abasteciminetos QUIMIGAL receives payment
within 60 days of presentation of documents (para 5.26);
(e) continue to implement its pricing policy regarding
fertilizer inputs and outputs (including fuel oil,
ammonia and fertilizer products) so as to enable

for the Project's requirements (para 6.08);
(h)  provide US$87.5 million in equity funds during the
project construction period to cover an estimated 36%
of the Project's financing needs and provide necessary
funds and other resources to complete the Project, in-
cluding the provision of working capital, cost overruns
and any other expenditures needed to bring the facili-
ties to steady levels of operation (para. 7.06);
B.   From QUIMIGAL that it will:

under a single management by June 30, 1979, and intro-
duce by that date a uniform accounting system for all
the Divisions' operations (para 4.03);



- 51 -
(b)  keep under continuous review the profitability of its

(c)  complete the review of its fertilizer warehousing needs
throughout the country by September 30, 1979 and construct
sufficient warehousing capacity to handle the output of
the Project (para 5.22);
(d)  make arrangements to ensure a steady supply of inputs
required for various plants in the Project, at least
six months prior to mechanical completion of each plant

staff before June 30, 1980, and subsequently implement
it in time for project start-up (para 6.12);
(g)  obtain, by June 30, 1979, commercial loans totalling
at least US$28.8 million on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank (para 7.08);
(h)  follow prudent financial practices and abide by the
financial covenants applicable to the Project, QUIMIGAL
and its Fertilizer Division, as mentioned in para. 8.11.
10.02     The refinancing of short-term loans totalling at least Esc. 2.25
billion into longer term loans with maturities of at least seven years, the
furnishing to the Bank of a certificate from QUIMICAL that its current ratio
stands at at least 1.3:1, and the meeting of the conditions of effectiveness
of the EIB Loan would be conditions of the effectiveness of the Bank Loan
(para 4.08 and 7.08).
10.03     Based on the above assurances and agreements the Project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$58 million equivalent for 15 years, including 3 years of
grace, at an interest rate of 10% p.a. to QUIMIGAL, including a fee of 2.65%
payable to the Government. Retroactive financing of US$2.5 million for
engineering services and equipment purchases is recommended under the proposed
loan.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 1
PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PAST ACTIVITIES OF THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
1.        The following paragraphs describe the past operations of the con-
stituent companies of QUIMIGAL (CUF, NP and AMPOR), as well as Empresa Petro-
quimica e Gas (EPG) and S.A. de Produits et Engrais Chimique de Portugal
(SAPEC).
(i) Quimigal -- Companhia Uniao Fabril S.A.R.L. (CUF)
2.        CUF was by far the largest and most important of the three companies
which now constitute QUIMIGAL. Its origin dates back to 1865 when production
of soaps and vegetable oils was begun by an earlier company. CUF itself was
organized in 1898 by the Portuguese Melo family following a merger with another
soap manufacturer. Production of phosphate fertilizers was initiated in 1909,
leading thereafter to the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizers, pesticides,
jute bags, textiles, chemical acids, animal foods and metals and mining oper-
ations. Prior to its nationalization in 1975, the CUF Group had become a major
conglomerate and Portugal's largest company. The founding family continued
to be the principal shareholder of the Group, which included one of Portugal's
largest commercial banks (Totta e Acores), the country's most important
shipyards (Lisna e Setnave), important insurance companies (Imperio, Sagres
and Universal), the principal Portuguese steamship company, the largest oil
refinery project (Petrosul) and projected petrochemical units as well as
numerous other industrial, mining and service companies active both in
Portugal and its overseas possessions. Following nationalization, the CUF
group was broken up and the various parts began to be operated as independent
state-owned companies. The remaining core of CUF, whose headquarters con-
tinues to be located in Lisbon and which in 1977 employed about 8,000 people,
consists of the following divisions: (a) Fertilizers and Pesticides, con-
tributing 35% of total sales; (b) Chemical and Metal Products, (10%); (c)
Vegetable Oils and Soaps (24%); (d) Products for the Cattle industry (21%);
(E) Industrial Textiles (4%); and (f) Domestic Textiles (6%).
3.        The Fertilizer and Pesticides Division represented CUF's most impor-
tant activity. The 1977 production of this division included ammonia (62,000
tons), nitric acid (55,000 tons), urea (50,000 tons), ammonium nitrate
(100,000 tons), ammonium sulfate (200,000 tons), superphcsphate (430,000
tons) and complex fertilizers (370,000 tons), all for local consumption. The
division's production facilities are located within CUF's central industrial
complex at Lavradio, on the southern bank of the Tagus River, some 15 km by
road south from Lisbon, where most of the other divisions' manufacturing
facilities are also located (Map IBRD-13778); smaller facilities exist in
four other nearby locations.

5.        As is reflected in the above table, despite the serious effects
of the political instability following Portugal's revolution in 1973 on the
country's economy, and on CUF's profitability, the Company was able to main-
tain a satisfactory, albeit weakened, financial structure. Because of the
scarcity in long-term financing in Portugal, CUF's short-term borrowings had
to be increased substantially (the current ratio fell to as low as 1.0 by
1976) to finance cash flow shortfalls. This trend was reversed through
improved cash flow in 1977. Investments in expansion projects, begun in
1976, are being financed with capital increases and long-term debt. An
analysis of the results of the several manufacturing divisions in 1976 and
1977 shows that fertilizers and pesticides, vegetable oils, soaps and animal
foods made positive contributions to CUF's profits. Negative contributions
were made by inorganic chemicals and textiles.
6.        The prices of products representing almost 90% of sales are directly
controlled by the Government. In this context, the losses experienced by CUF
in 1975 and 1976 were, in part, the result of delays by the Government in
adjusting product prices to reflect cost increases associated with the 15%
annual rate of inflation experienced by the Country in those years. It is
expected that, in the future, product prices will be adjusted so as to allow



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
producers to earn a satisfactory return.  Such price increases will be accom-
panied by measures to rationalize production, principally in product lines
that are currently uneconomic, and will include the phasing out of activi-
ties (such as industrial textiles), which are not profitable. The Govern-
ment has already asked QUIMIGAL to study this matter urgently and to make
recommendations.  In this context, the 1976 Law on Public Enterprises gives
importance to the financial viability of Government-owned firms. It states
that "prices must provide sufficient revenues to cover the total cost of
production and to guarantee proper levels of self-financing and return on
invested capital; if lower prices are imposed for reasons of economic and
social policy, the state must provide compensatory revenues." The same
principle of viability applies to investments undertaken by the enterprises,
which should yield "a proper rate of financial return of the invested capital,
without prejudice to the possibility that, in the case of certain projects,
such return is based on an analysis of economic and social benefits."
(ii) QUIMIGAL--Amoniaco Portugues S.A.R.L. (AMPOR)
7.        This company, now also part of QUIMIGAL, is located at Estarreja,
near Oporto, in Northern Portugal, some 250 km from Lisbon. It employs about
1,000 people. In 1975, it completed a major investment program that included
the construction of a 115,000 tpy nitric acid plant, a 130,000 tpy ammonium
nitrate plant and a 160,000 tpy complex fertilizer plant. The plant also
produces ammonium sulphate in two 20-year old facilities with total capacity
of 120,000 tpy. All the ammonia needs of the plant are supplied from the
Lisbon area by EPG. AMPOR currently consumes about 60,000 tpy of ammonia
which is transported from EPG by railway cars owned by AMPOR. The ammonium
nitrate plant is about 80% utilized today, but the rest of the nitric acid
capacity will be utilized when a new aniline plant (with a cost of about
US$30 million, and a capacity of 50,000 tpy) starts operating in 1979.
The sales of aniline have already been arranged. In 1976, AMPOR exported
about 50,000 tons of calcium ammonium nitrate.

9.        The investment program carried out in 1973-75 resulted in a six-
fold increase in the Company's sales by 1977 (in equivalent US dollars) but also
imposed a heavy burden on its operations and profitability. During these
years AMPOR incurred substantial losses which were largely caused by the
cost of mostly short-term borrowings used to finance the expansion, and
negative cash flows in 1975 and 1976. Its net worth was reduced from about
US$14.0 million in 1974 to US$1.5 million in 1976. A capital increase and
the arrangement of new long-term debt in 1977 permitted the Company to
stay afloat, but measures taken were insufficient to fully stabilize its
financial situation. At year-end 1977, the current ratio was 0.8 and the
long-term debt to equity ratio, 82:18. By 1977, however, because of further
increases in sales volume, losses could be reduced and cash flow returned
to being positive.
(iii) QUIMIGAL - Nitratos de Portugal S.A.R.L. (NP)
10.       The NP facilities of QUIMIGAL are located at Alverca, 20 km north
of Lisbon and employ about 600 people. Together with some pesticide formu-
lations, the plants mainly produce nitrogenous fertilizers, principally
calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN). NP operates two 70,000 tpy nitric acid
plants, one of which was erected in 1960 and the other in 1969. The plants
receive their ammonia via an 18 km pipeline (4" diameter) from the EPG plant
at Cabo Ruivo; at present, NP consumes about 75,000 tpy of ammonia and has a
total fertilizer capacity of about 320,000 tpy of CAN, based on a mechanical
granulation process (helicoidal granulator). Production capacities, however,
are not well balanced, and there is a shortage of nitric acid capacity which
has forced the CAN production facilities to operate at about 70% capacity.
11.       In 1977, NP produced 83,000 tons of calcium ammonium nitrate 20.5% N,
128,000 tons of calcium ammonium nitrate 26% N, and 4,000 tons of calcium
nitrate. In that year, 80,000 tons of calcium ammonium nitrate 26% N were
exported to West Germany and Holland. Total sales amounted to US$22.9 mil-
lion equivalent and net profits, to US$900,000.

13.       NP has been the only profitable of the three component companies
of Quimigal, except in 1975, when production levels had to be reduced. The
Company's financial structure has remained acceptable, although because of
its need to finance repayments of long-term debt incurred in earlier years,
short-term borrowings had to be increased resulting in current ratios lower
than 1.0 in 1975 and 1976, with only a slight recovery in 1977.
(iv) Empresa Petroquimica e Gas S.A.R.L. (EPG)
14.       EPG, formerly known as Sociedade Portuguesa de Petroquimica, S.A.R.L.,
operates facilities situated at Cabo Ruivo on the outskirts of Lisbon on
the River Tagus. It employs about 500 people. Besides providing town
gas for the city of Lisbon, it operates two ammonia plants. The smaller
of the two plants was erected in 1961, has a capacity of 210 tpd (70,000
tpy), and uses the naphtha partial oxidation process; the second unit--550
tons per day capacity (160,000 tpy)--was erected in 1968 and utilizes the
ICI steam reforming process, also using naphtha as a feedstock. All company
products use the synthesis gas from the ammonia plant as raw material. Town
gas production accounts for about 10% of the plant's output in ammonia equiv-
alent or about 12% of sales. Town gas production is expected to increase
at the rate of about 5% per annum in the future, thereby reducing gradually
the amount of synthesis gas available for ammonia production. As present
EPG provides 75,000 tpy of ammonia to CUF via barge across the River Tagus,
75,000 tpy of ammonia to NP via an 18 km pipeline and 60,000 tpy of ammonia
to AMPOR via railway. In 1975, the Company exported 60,000 tons of ammonia
to Spain, England, Greece, France and Denmark; in 1976, however, because of
increased local demand, the Company was able to export only 25,000 tons of
ammonia.
(v) S.A. de Produits et Engrais Chimigues de Portugal (SAPEC)
15.       SAPEC is a Belgian-owned company which was established in 1926.  It
owns its own mines and manufactures sulphuric acid (from pyrites), single and
triple superphosphate, phosphoric acid, compound fertilizers, and ammonium
sulphate and phosphate. The plant is situated at Setubal, south of Lisbon.
SAPEC does not possess its own ammonia production facilities, and purchases
some 20,000 tons per year of ammonia from QUIMIGAL. Besides its fertilizer
interests, SAPEC also sells a variety of products, including animal feedstuffs,
seeds and industrial chemicals and mineral products. It also owns planes and
helicopters specialized in preading fertilizers, seeds and other agricultural
agents.

2.        The first four of these projects are intended to rationalize or
increase the extraction of metal from the pyrites mined and transformed by
QUIMIGAL's existing installations, which are inefficient and deficitary.
The first project would increase the extraction of copper, lead, zinc, silver
and gold from the pyrite cinders remaining after extraction of sulfuric acid
from the ore. The second one concerns a new sulfuric acid unit to complement
several existing ones, which will supply the growing needs of QUIMIGAL's
fertilizer and chemical operations. It would temporarily use imported sulfur
as its main input, to be replaced later by local pyrites. The third project
concerns the production of refined zinc to satisfy almost the totality of local
demand, now being imported. The fourth concerns an expansion of QUIMIGAL's
existing copper refinery, which in addition to increasing its capacity will
also reduce pollution and improve working conditions and profitability.
3.        Three of the new projects arebeing implemented to allow the Company
to gradually replace its jute-based textile production program by one based
on synthetic fibers, and to diversify into new inorganic chemicals for which
local demand is currently satisfied by imports. Another project concerns the
establishment of a plant to manufacture anilines at AMPOR's Estarreja
location. Raw materials will be available from a local refinery and QUIMIGAL's
existing operations. The output will be sold to a joint venture company with
a US partner, Upjohn & Co., which will manufacture MDI crude for export to
Upjohn's facilities outside Portugal. The last project is to increase
QUIMIGAL's power generating capacity to meet its increased demand at the
Barreiro industrial complex.

ANNEX 5-3
PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PROJECTED CONSUNPTION OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS 1980-1995
1.       Several studies have been made .in order to estimate the future
consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers in Portugal. A short-term plan
prepared in 1977 by the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that nitro-
genous fertilizer consumption would reach between 153,000 tons N and
192,000 tons N by 1980. However, the Portuguebe authorities later
revised their view and now believe that the higher figure will not be
attained until the mid 1980s. It now appear that the lower figure of
153,000 tons N is an underestimate as actual consumption in 1978 was
already almost 155,000 tons N.
2.       A second projection was prepared by a study group set up by the
fertilizer industry, but which included staff of the Ministry of
Agriculture. This projection is essentially a normative projection,
based on minimum targets for per capita food consumption, which are then
converted into crop requirements. The production targets, which were
made for 1980 and 1985, assume a considerable restructuring of land use,
higher crop yields, and a concomitant increase in fertilizer use.
3.       A third estimate was prepared by a Bank consultant, Professor G.
Weinschenck, and was based on a detailed analysis of the complementary
inputs required and the probable rates at which they could be made
available. He estimated that 1980 consumption levels would lie between
150,000 tons N and 160,000 tons N, that 1985 consumption levels should
reach 190,000-210,000 tons N, and that by 1990 consumption would be
230,000-240,000 tons N. These figures are in essential agreement with
those produced by the Fertilizer Industry before the economy of the ferti-
lizer market was becoming apparent. A further analysis undertaken by Bank
staff led to the view that in the light of the actual consumption achieved
in 1978, these estimates are too conservative. The European Investment Bank
has made its own projections in the course of appraising the project and has
arrived at the same conclusion. The Fertilizer Industry's estimates have
therefore been somewhat increased. Low and high projections were also made;
a comparison of the estimates are shown in the table below.

Equity from Government of Portugal -  It is estimated that about 84.7% of the
total equity requirements will be provided by the Government. The Government will
charge an 8% interest equalization tax on equity during the construction period
and this amount has been included in interest during construction.
Equity from Internal Cash Generation - About US$15.8 million is estimated to
come from internal cash generation.  This amount will be used towards working
capital build up.
World Bank Loan - The proposed World Bank loan of US$58 million will be made at
an annual interest rate of 10%, with a maturity of 15 years including 3 years
of grace.
EIB Loan - This loan of 17 million European Units of Account, equivalent to
US$21.0 million, at 1 EUA = $1.24, will be provided at an annual interest rate
of 8.6% and a maturity of 14 years, including 3.5 years of grace.
Other Loans - US$59.8 millions is expected to be provided through Suppliers'
Credits and Private Commercial Banks. For the purpose of debt service calcu-
lations, an average interest rate of 10% with maturity of 10 years, including
3 years of grace, is assumed.

ANNEX 8-1

PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Accounting Principles
1.       QUIMIGAL maintains separate books for its Fertilizer Division and
utilizes different accounting techniques on a divisional level from those
applying to the Corporation as a whole. The Fertilizer Division, like the
other divisions of QUIMIGAL, has not been endowed with cash accounts or
financial investments nor is it charged with short-term loans. Cash accounts,
financial investments and all debt are held in the name of QUIMIGAL, and the
Fertilizer Division has been allocated a certain portion of the total
indebtedness of the Corporation related to existing facilities. This debt
is owed by the Fertilizer Division to QUIMIGAL, which in turn is responsible
for actual debt service. Twenty percent of the Division's pre-tax net income
is applied to reduce its outstanding balance of debt owed to the Corporation
and 80% is paid to the Corporation as a dividend for the equity it has in
the Division. The Fertilizer Division does not pay income tax on its earnings;
this is done by QUIMIGAL after it incorporates the profits or losses from all
other divisions. Tax is then estimated at the rate of 40% of pre-tax profits.
B. ProJect Revenues
2.        Project startup is in the three stages, with urea facilities
beginning production in January 1981, NP nitric acid in March 1981 while
ammonia and Lavradio nitrate acid/ammonium nitrate will start up in the first
quarter of 1982. The ammonia content of each facility's output is used as
the basis for determining overall capacity utilization, which is expected to
rise from 22% in 1981 to 90% in 1984.
3.        As explained in the main text of this report (para 8.01), it is
expected that the Government policy of keeping ex-factory prices of finished
fertilizer products close to international prices during the forecast period
and that where there are minor differences domestic ex-factory prices will be
brought in line with projected international standards by 1979. These factors
are reflected in the summary of projected prices shown on the following page.
C. Project Operating Costs
4.       All the operating costs are calculated on the basis of prevailing
1978 prices. The resulting operating costs are then escalated at the rate
of 6% per annum to the respective year when they enter the projected income
statement. Detailed cost estimates, by product, are shown in Annex 8-2.

5.        Unit prices of the Project's main variable costs based on the
latest information given by QUIMIGAL are estimated to be as follows:
PROJECTED PRICES OF THE PROJECT'S VARIABLE COSTS
(in constant 1978 dollars)
Unit    Price Per Unit
Fuel Oil              Ton         $80.00
Electric power        KWH            .02
Cooling water         M3             .0044
Treated water         M              .055
Platinum catalyst    Grams          6.70
Limestone             Ton           3.90
6.       The estimated price of fuel oil is based on the projected fob. price,
Rotterdam plus $5 per ton for transport and handling. Most of the
electrical power required for the Project will be purchased from EPD's
70 MW thermal station captive to the Barreiro-Lavradio complex.   It is
estimated that most of the water required for the Project will come from
on-site wells at Lavradio and from new wells drilled by QUIMIGAL 20 km from
the public water supply system.
7.       With regard to labor, the Project is expected to create direct
additional employment of only about 120 workers, since it is a moderniza-
tion project. Direct labor cost attributable to the Project is thus quite
moderate.
8.       Bagging and selling costs for finished products are estimated at
$22 per ton.
9.       Interest during construction was capitalized.  Annual depreciation
and amortization was estimated on a straight line basis with ammonia and
urea facilities being depreciated over a 12-year period and nitric acid
facilities over a 15-year period.
10.      Fixed overhead and other costs were based on QUIMIGAL estimates.
D. Consolidation Principles
11.      Consolidation of the Project with existing facilities was not done
simply by addition. In the process of consolidation, inter-divisional
revenues from the sale of ammonia as feedstock from the project to other
fertilizer division facilities were dropped. At the same time that costs
of production were increased because of the new ammonia facilities, variable
costs were reduced by the elimination of ammonia purchased from third parties.
The net effect was a decrease of about $30 per ton in variable costs of
ammonia used as feedstock for existing facilities in 1982 and thereafter.
Fixed costs likewise were not simply added: many of the fixed costs would
remain basically the same with or without the Project and thus the net effect
of consolidation is a rather moderate increase in fixed costs. Debt related
to the Project is carried on the the Fertilizer Division books as a direct
liability and 100% of the debt service, on the terms established with
outside lenders is charged to the Division, contrary to the practice with
debt related to existing facilities.

ANNEX 9-1
- 87 -                                  Page 1
PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Assumptions used in the Economic Analysis
1.     All prices and costs discussed in this Annex, except where indicated
otherwise, are expressed in June 1978 US Dollars. It has been assumed that
any changes caused due to the difference in international inflation rate and
that, in Portugal, will be offset by appropriate devaluations of the Portu-
guese Escudo.
2.     Capacity Utilization.  Capacity build up for the various units is shown
in Annex 6. All units are expected to reach normal production by 1984.
3.     Economic Life. The new ammonia plant and the revamped urea plant are
expected to have an economic life of 12 years; and the two new nitric acid
plants and the revamped ammonium nitrate plant an economic life of 15 years.
4.     Capital Costs.  Capital costs for the project are shown in Annex 7-1.
These costs have been inflated at 7.5% for 1978 and 1979 and at a rate of 7.0%
thereafter. These were then deflated at the expected US. Dollar deflation
rate of 6.0%. No such adjustment was necessary for any of the other costs or
revenues as they are expected to move in line with the international inflation
rate of 6.0%.
5.     Operating Costs. Operating costs for the ammonia plant, the urea plant,
and the two nitric acid/ammonium nitrate plants are shown on pages 3 to 6 in
this Annex. The economic price of fuel oil has been estimated at US$70 in
1978 terms. This figure was obtained by subtracting transportation and handling
costs of $5 per ton from the international price f.o.b. Rotterdam of US$75 per
ton. The economic cost of electric power is estimated at US$ .035 per Kwh.
6.     Revenues.  According to IBRD Economic Analysis and Projections Department,
the price of bagged urea (f.o.b.Northwest Europe) is expected to reach US$203
per ton (June 1978 terms) by 1985. However, the latest data on investment
and operating costs suggests that prices may stabilize at around US$175 per
ton. Therefore, financial and economic rates of return have been computed
using both cases. Ammonia price is expected to stay in line with that of
unbagged urea. Bagging costs are estimated at US$12 per ton in 1978 terms.
Prices of ammonium nitrate (33.5% N) and CAN (26% N) have been estimated by
relating their nitrogen content to that of urea (46% N). A 10% premium has been
added to reflect the greater responsiveness of the soil to these fertilizers.
These prices will be the same as the financial prices including subsidies shown
in Annex 8-1. Export and domestic prices were obtained by appropriately adjusting
f.o.b. Northwest Europe prices by the cost of freight, insurance and port handling,
which is estimated at US$30 per ton for ammonia and US$18 per ton (constant 1978
dollars) for urea, ammonium nitrate (33.5% N) and CAN (26% N).
