PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(Loan 1649-PO)
PREFACE
i.         Loan 1649-PO for US$58.0 million was approved by the Board on
January 4, 1979, signed on March 14, awid declared effective on June 1, 1979.
It was fully disbursed by June 30, 1984. The Borrower, QUIMIGAL, is a large
Public sector conglomerate. The objectives of the Loan (para 2.03 of the
Project Completion Report) were to assist in the modernization and expansion
of fertilizer production, and ensure that Portugal will possess sufficient
capacity to satisfy expected increases in domestic demand for fertilizers by
the agricultural sector. T'wards this end, it provided financing for the
construction of a new ammonia plant and construction and revamping of
downstream facilities for nitrogenous fertilizers (paras 2.04-2.10). The
physical objectives of the Loan were fulfilled (paras 3.01 and 3.16-3.17), but
the Project fell short of attaining the objectives of financial/organizational
strengthening of the borrowing entity, which has been in serious financial
difficulties (paras 5.01-5.05).
ii.        The Project Completion Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department on the basis of a "Situation Report" submitted by QUIMIGAL in April
1986, and an Industry Department supervision/completion mission of July 1986.
However, throughout the period between closing of disbursements and July 1986,
the Bank had been involved in an intensive follow-up effort, working closely
with Quimigal on a restructuring plan for its operations and finances, first
in the context of an extended Project supervision work given the difficult
corporate and financial position of Quimigal, and subsequently in the frame of
the preparation of the now defunct Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL)
(paras 5.04-5.05). Preparation of the PCR was correspondingly delayed,
pending the outcome of the extended Project supervision and the PERL
preparation work.
iii.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
iv.        Following standard procedures, copies of the draft report were sent
to the Government and the borrower. The comments from the latter are shown in
Annex 6-1, and have been incorporated in this report.

PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(Loan 1649-PO)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.       The Fertilizer Modernization Project was part of the Bank'G program
to assist Portugal in it3 efforts to modernize industry and improve
agricultural production, particularly in anticipation of Portugal's possible
entry into the European Economic Community (EEC). The Bank's Loan of US$58.0
million thus helped to finance the: (i) construction of an ammonia and two
nitric acid plants using modern technology; (ii) revamping/expansion of a urea
and an ammonium nitrate plants; and (iii) carrying out of studies to improve
fertilizer use in Portugal's agriculture.
ii.      There -ere no significant changes in Project scope.  However, the
construction of the Project main component--the ammonia plant--was hampered by
(i) delays in implementation of engineering contracts; (ii) difficulties in
obtaining materials according to specifications; and (iii) untimely supply of
piping and comp-essors. (This is discussei in para 3.17 of the report.)
Other Project components were implemented with mi.aor delays.
iii.     The actual cost of the Project, excluding financial charges, am-ounts
to US$223.5 million, 7.5% higher than appraisal estimate (US$207.9 million).
However, be--ause of implementation delays, total financing required (US$265.0
million) was 9.5% higher than estimated (L'S$242.1 million). The main overruns
relate to pre-operating and start-up expenses and civil works (paras
3.18-3.20).
iv.      The two nitric acid plants, and revamped/expanded urea and ammonium
nitrate plants, had a production build-up as expected, and have been, since,
operating smoothly. The ammonia plant had a major mishap due to the failure
of a welded dishhead in the heavy pressure co-slift conversion reactor which forced a
shut down of the plant for several months and a claim presented by Quimigal
against the foreign supplier of the reactor is being arbitrated (para 4.01).
Since mid 1986, the ammonia plant has been back in operation.
v.       The market for fertilizers in Portugal did nrot develop in the
1978-1985 period as was expected. Consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers in
1985 was 123,000 tons in terms of nutrient content (N), 57.5% of appraisal
estimate and 20.6% below the 1978 consumption level (paras 4.04-4.05).
vi.      The Project physical objectives of modernizing and expanding
fertilizer production in Portugal wei,_ met, albeit with an overall delay of 18
months due to the ammonia plant problems. However, as a result of the
considerable decline in ammonia/urea prices, the economic return on the
investment now appears less promising than the appraisal forecast (para
6.01). Furthermore, the other implicit objective underlying the Project, in
terms of restructuring of a major public sector industrial enterprise, is yet
to be fully attained (para 5.04).



vii.      The most important lessons learned are:
the need in a ccmpany like the Borrower, with a large investment
beyond the Bank project, to assess the entire program, and to
make sure that the impact on the Bank project of shortcomings in
other parts of the investment program are limited (para. 8.04(a));
and
in the case of time-critical equipment, prequalification procedures
excluding netoriously delinquent suppliers should be adopted unless
proper financial guarantees are given (para. 8.04(d)).



PORTUGAL - FERTILIZER itODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 164-PO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Portugal (the Government) requested Bank
assistance in 1977 to modernize and expand industrial fertilizer production
in Portugal. Importatit components of the Government strategy aimed at
increasing fertilizer production were to (i) improve the dosages of
nutrients used in Portugal, which were low in relation to rates of
fertilizer usage prevailing in other European countries; and (ii) enhance
competitiveness in agricultural output and industrial production prior to
joining the European Economic Community.
1.02      In pursuit of this policy, the Government merged, In January
1978, three nationalized enterprises (para 2.04), which manufactured
fertilizers and chemicals, and which had prepared studies for the expansion
and improvement of production of fertilizers and related chemicals. These
studies were submitted to the Bank in mid-1977.
-I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.  Proejct Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Effectiveness
2.01      At the request of the Government, a Bank mission visited Portugal
in June 1977 and identified a Fertilizer Modernization Project as being
suitable for Bank assistance. The Project was prepared by staff of Quimica
de Portugal E.P. (Quimigal), who had experience of chemical sector
projects. On this basis, the Project was pre-appralsed by the Bank in
October 1977, and was appraised by missions that visited Portugal in April
and June 1978.
2.02      After completion of negotiations in November 1978, the Board
approved on January 4, 19,9 a loan of US$58 million equivalent to Quimigal,
at an interest rate of 7.352 p.s. and a maturity of 14 years, including 3
years of grace. The Government guaranteed the Loan for a fee of 2.65S
p.a. so that the total cost to the Borrower was 10.0% p.a. The Loan became
effective on June 1, 1979.
B. ProJect Objectives and Description
2.03      The Project major objective was to assist in the modernization
and expansion of fertilizer production to ensure adequate availabillty of
supplies to meet expected growth in demand. In this respect, it was a part
of a broad Bank-supported strategy to expand and rationalize industrial and
agricultural production in Portugal. Although the domestic industry was
meeting Portugal's fertilizer needs at the time of Project preparation,



- 2 -
many of its facilities were appre,ching the end of their useful life. In
particular, the country's capacity to produce ammonia was seriously
endangered by the precarious conditions of small, old plants with obsolete
technology, and whic';i were scheduled for early saut down due to economic
and ecological reasons.
2.04      Until 1977, five companies were produciug fertilizers in
Portugal: (i) Cia Uniao Fabril (CUF); (ii) Amoniaco Portugues SARL
%AMPORT); (iii) Nitratos de Portugal SARL (NP); (iv) Sociedade Portuguesa
de Petroquimica SARL (SPP); and (v) S.A. de Prodults et Engrais Chimiques
du Portugal (SAPEC). With the exception of SAPEC, all these firms were
nationalized in 1975 and the first three were merged in January 1978 to
form Quimica de Portugal (QUIMIGAL). The other nationalized company (SSP)
was renamed Empresa Petroquimica _ Gas (EPG) and transferred to the energy
sector because it supplied town gas to Lisbon although it continued
producing, as a co-product with town gas, ammonia for sale to Quimigal.
2.05      Before the Fertilizer Modernization Project, the following
fertilizer/fertilizer feedstock plants-all of which, except two ammonia
plants, were owned by Quimigal--were in operation in Portugal:
i)  A naphtha-based ammonia plant (550 tons-per-day (tpd)) owned
by EPG, located at Cabo Ruivo near Lisbon, and which started
operation in 1965.
(ii) Two old naphtha-based ammonia plants (210 tpd), o.ie owned by
Quimigal and located at Lavradio, and one located at Cabo
Ruivo.
(iii)  A urea plant (170 tpd) located at Lavradio.
(iv)  A nitric acid plant (115,000 tons per year (tpy)) located at
Estarreja.
(v)  Two nitric acid plants (70,000 tpy) located at Alverca,
built in 1960 and 1969.
(vi)  An old and obsolete nitric acid plant (55,000 tpy) at
Lavradio.
vii)  Three ammonium nitrate solution plants located at
Estrarreja, Alverca and Lavradio; the latter, with a
capacity of 62,000 tpy, was erected in 1963, modified in
1966/67 and in need of modernization to extend its life and
reduce pollution.
(viii)  A plant to make calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) using locally
produced lime, operating at Lavradio, and scheduled for
closing.



-3-
2.06      The Project comprised the following components:
(i)  Construction of a new 900 tpd partial oxidation fuel
oil-based ammonia plant located at Lavradio.
(ii) Construction of two new 360 tpd nitric acid plants located
at Lavradio and Alverca.
(iii) Revamping of the Lavradio urea plant and expansion of its
capacity from 170 to 270 tpd.
(iv) Revamping of the ammonium nitrate facilities at Lavradio.
(v)  Construction and installation of required off-site and
ancillary facilities.
(vi) Study to (a) identify measures to remove the constraints to
fertilizer use; (b) determine optimal application of
fertilizers by crop/region; (c) evaluate the influence of
other factors affecting productivity; and (d) recommend
improvements in fertilizer marketing, sales, pricing,
subsidies and distribution systems to support increased
levels of fertilizer consumption.
In addition, the Project addressed the problem of the Company's financial
structure and performance, through a number of covenants.
2.07      The Lavradio Ammonia Plant was intended to replace two 18-year
old, naphtha-based 210 tpd ammonia plants scheduled to be shut down in
1981. The propo6eA plant was based on fuel oil and its capacity of 900 tpd
was selected to take advantage of economies of scale obtained from the use
of centrifugal compressors. The larger capacity was also Intended to cover
future downstream expansion of production of nitrogen compounds at Lavradio
and other plants. Market projections showed that in the early years of
operation there would be a surplus of supply over demand but no difficulty
was foreseen in exporting such relatively small surpluses. The partial
oxidation process used for productton of synthesis gas from fuel oll had
already been proven elsewhere (including tvo plants in India financed by
the Bank). Although more costly and complex than steam reformlng process
in plants based on natural gas or naphtha, this feedstock was selected
because a fuel oil surplus and a naphtha deficit were forecast for
Portugal.
2.08      The nitric acid plants were designed to substitute the obsolete
Alverca and Lavradio plants, improve production efficiency, reduce
environmental contamination and expand capacity to match the expected needs
of Quimigal's revamped downstream ammonium nitrate plants. The latter
included the substitution of a 62,000 tpy ammonium nitrate solution
plant by a new 124,000 tpy plant and installing a dust collection system
to avoid pollution.
2.09      The revamping of the urea plant aimed at expanding production
from 50,000 to 82,000 tpy by increasing the reaction yield from 46X to 70X.



-4 -
The Project also comprised offeite facilities, including steam boilers,
cooling and feedwater systems, fuel oil unloading and storage facilities,
and product storage and shipping installations.
2.10      The new Lavradio Ammonia Plant requires 250,000 tpy of fuel oil
as process feedstock and fuel for steam generation. Power was scheduled to
be supplied from the 70 SW EDP thermal station, adjacent to the Lavradio
plant; the Loan Agreement stipulated that QUIMIGAL had to ensure that all
required inputs be supplied in a timely'manner.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.  Achievement of Project Obiectives
3.01      The main explicit objectives of the Project-to improve the
performance of the Portuguese fertilizer industry and expand capacity at
existing facilities to levels necessary to meet eTpected domestic needs
through the mid-1980s-have been formally attained. However, given the
sharp decline in output (fertilizer) prices, the Project economic return
appears less promising than the appraisal estimate. Furthermore, the
accompanying implicit objective of restructuring Quimigal's organization,
and improving the performance of a major segment of the public enterprise
sector in Portugal, has yet to be achieved.
B. Changes in Project Scope
3.02      No major changes in project scope took place durirg implementa-
tion, although there were minor modifications which consisted of: (i)
additional water wells drilled at the ammonia plant site ',ubstituting for
the 20 Km pipeline originally envisaged to supply water co the plant; and
(ii) a software component added in early 1983 for a "strategic study for
restructuring of the Borrower's operations and finances".
C. Proiect Management
3.03      As a result of the merger of three large industrial enterprises,
Quimigal became a major diversified manufacturing company, with an
operating organization consisting of:
(i)  Seven decentralized manufacturing divisions, each operating
as a profit center within Quimigal. These divisions are
responsible for: Agricultural Products (fertilizers and
pesticides), which generate about 40% of Quimigal's sales;
Inorganices and Metals; Plastics and Chemical Specialities;
Organics; Oils and Soaps; Feed-stuffs; and Textiles.
(ii)  Two service divisions, namely: Services and Maintenance and
New Projects.
(iii) Three central divisions (Directorates), namely: Finance;
Planning; and Personnel.



-5-
In addition, Quimigal has over 20 subsidiary companies, generally majority
or wholly-owned, operating in Portugal (10), Hozambique (3), Angola (3),
Brazil (1), USA (1), Switzerland (1) and Spain (1).
3.04      Quimigal was responsible for the implementation of the Project
through its Fertilizers and Pesticides Division and the New Plant Erection
Division (DNI).  It also secured assistance from engineering companies
engaged early on in the Project cycle. At the time of appraisal, QUIMIGAL
had underway nine projects (Annex 3-1) entrusted to various divisions of
the company.
D.  Employment and Training
3.05      Since the Project was not a greenfield undertaking but largely a
modernization project, additiqnal employment required after start-up was
relatively minor. It resulted In an increase of about 10% in the staff
(1,200) of the Fertilizer Division. The production engineers required for.
normal operations were, to a large extent, drawn from the existing plants
and from the implementation group being assembled at DNI. However,
specialists in instrumentation, heavy rotating equipment and welding of
high pressure vessel were recruited in 1980/81 and spent over a year in
training. Chief operators and panel supervisors could not be drawn from
existing personnel. The need to retrain staff drawn from other operations
was recognized during project preparation and the engineering agreements
included provisions to this effect. Quimigal agreed to complete a detailed
training plan before June 30, 1980 (SAR paras 6.12 and 10.01 (f)) which was
implemented.
RE  Use and Performance of Ensineering Firms and Consultants
3.06      At the appraisal stage, Quimigal had already received offers for
a study for revamping and expanding of the urea plant and had invited, in
coasultation with the Bank, proposals for technology and engineering
services for the ammonia and n.etric acid plants comprising: (i) assistance
in negotiating licensing agreements as needed; (ii) basic and detailed
engineering for battery-limit plants; (iii) conceptual design of offsite
and auxiliary facilities; (iv) procurement services for proprietary and
critical equipment; (v) assistance in supervision of plant erection,
testing and start-up; and (vi) training of operating and maintenance
personnel. DNI was responsible for procurement of remaining supplies in
coordination with the selected engineering firms, as well as for contract-
ing and supervision, with assistance from the engineering firms, of all
civil and erection works. A study of fertilizer use in Portugal was part
of the Project scope (para 2.06 (vi)), for which the Secretariat of SLate
for Planning was given responsibility.

3.07      The engineering firms contracted for the project were the
following:

Profabril/Kaltenbach
The performance of the-firms responsible for basic design and engineering
has been evaluated by the sponsor as having met Project needs in a
satisfactory way, and the Bank concurs in this opinion. The performance of
the detailed engineering and erection work contractors used for the ammonia
plant--which, due to the borrower's interest and desire to maximize
technology transfer, relied heavily on local companies--was hampered by the
limited number of skilled and experienced staff available for such a large
undertaking. Lack of sufficient preparatory work and labor problems also
created difficulties for the erection contractors.
3.08      The study on fertilizer use prepared by consultants was submitted
to the Bank in October 1980. Based on this study, a Government appointed
working group produced a report containing a set of constructive
recommendations, which, for the most part, have yet to be implemented by
the Government.
F. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.09      Procurement of Bank-financed goods and services was carried out
following Bank's Guidelines. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) was
followed in the acquisition of equipment except for: (i) proprietary and,
subject to Bank approval, critical items, which were procured directly from
a single source or through appropriate international shopping; and (il)
items costing less than US$200,000 which were purchased through prudent
international shopping. Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement stipulated that
the amount of the Loan to be used in the above categories, should not
exceed US$5 million each; Quimigal requested that the two categories be
merged because the proprietary and critical equipment allocution was going
to be overdrawn while some items costing less than US$200,00'J had already
been procured though ICB. This modificatLon of the Loan Agreement was
formally approved on March 29, 1983.
3.10      The only problem related to procurement during Project
implementation was in the tender for the turbo-set of the nitric acid plant
in which the bid award recommendation made by Quimigal on the basis of the
engineering firm's report was initially questioned by the Bank. The
recommendation was for a bid from a Swiss supplier, the capital cost of



-7-
which was 21.1X higher than the lowest priced bid (Italy). Operating
expenses of the latter were projected however to be highet over the life of
the equipment. Nonetheless, the second-lowest evaluated bid (Italy) was
overall 6.5Z higher than the lowest (Switzerland). As s result of Bank's
inquiry and a visit to the lowest-priced bidder by Quimigal and the
engineering firm, changes were made in the compressor speed and number of
stages, resulting in maximum power demand being increased by 0.9% and steam
consumption lowered by 1.8% without loss of performance. As a result,
overating costs were reduced and the award was made--at the initial bid
price with Bank approval--to the lowest-priced supplier. The second lowest
bidder presented protests to the Sponsor and the Bank. After careful
consideration of the case, the Bank decided that the procedures followed
were correct and the complaint was not pursued by the complainant
(Annex 3-2).
3.11      The performance of suppliers during project implementation was
generally satisfactory. The two salient exceptions were the suppliers of
the ammonia plant piping, and the turboset in the nitric acid
plant. The order for piping was placed following ICB but the supplier was
able to fulfill only part of its commitment, so that many orders had to be
placed with other suppliers.
3.12      The foreign firm selected to manufacture the specialized
nitric acid turboset (para. 3.10) was reportedly plagued by
strikes, and could not overcome the delays and obstacles in construction.
Although the Bank and the engineering firm intervened at the request of
Qulimigal to reduce delays, delivery of the compressor was several months
behind schedule.
3.13      The Appraisal Report estimated that 73.72 of the equipment and
62.32 of the engineering and licensing costs would be in foreign exchange:
Actually, most of the equipment was imported with no significant supply
from Portuguese firms. Of the value of consulting and engineering
services, 38.22 was paid to foreign firms, and the balance to Portuguese
fitms subcontracted by the major engineering firms. Distribution of the
Bank loan by country of origin of the goods and services is shown in
Annex 3-3. The main suppliers were from the FRG (54.0S), Italy (12.4X),
France (12.2X), the Netherlands (7.82), and Portugal (4.52).
G. Environmental Considerations
3.14      The Borrower was required to maintain and operate the Project
facilities in accordance with air and water environmental standards
acceptable to the Bank. For this purpose, the Bank specified in a
memorandum on August 22, 1978 the limits on chromium concentration in
effluent water, and nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in the stack gases
and at ground level in the plants' areas. The engineering firms were
requested to consider generally acceptable ecological and safety standards
in the preparation of their bids. The project was implemented according to
these recommendations.

At appraisal, the implementation of the ammonia plant was expected to take
45 months from the selection of the engineering consultant to final testing
and commissioning. Since delays in implementation of the downstream plants
have been much less significant, the delay of 18-month In the start-up of
the ammonia plant has been the defining event for overall completion of the
Project.
3.17      The main reasons for the ammonia plant delays were:  (i) a
3-month postponement in sigring the engineering contract; Ili) substantial
delay in detailed piping engineering; (iii) problems in purchase of
materials according to US standards by local fabricators; (iv) failure of
the piping supplier to deliver the order on time and problems encountered
during commissioning, including failure of radiant tubes In the steam
superheater, and high water vapour and carbon dioxide leakage from the air
separation plant's molecular sieves.
J. Project Cost and Loan Disbursement

a/   Included in the above.
Cost overruns in engineering and licenses were due, In part, to the need to
reinforce field services because of (i3 difficulties encountered in
detailed piping designs, (ii) procurement of materials according to U.S.
standards; and (iii) need to cross-reference the different standards used
in Portugal and the suppliers' countries. A substantial overrun in the
cost of civil works (187.1%) is partially compensated by a 37.42 underrun
in erection works. One of the reasons is that some costs, such as
foundations, which have been included as part of erection costs in the
appraisal report, have late  been allocated to civil works. The main
reasons for underrun in equipment a.ad spares costs are (i) lower prices
obtained for major items of equipment; and (ii) lower than normal stock of
spares. TIf the latter were to be built up to the normal 10% of the total
cost of equipment, an additional expenditure of US$7.2 million would have
been incurred and the underrun reduced to 6.22 of appraisal estimate.
Finally,the large overrun in pre-operating and start-up expenses are due to
the short-term stoppages during testing and start-up of the ammonia plant
as well as to the serious stoppage of 12 months which took place as a
result of the welding failure of the dished head and wall of the
high-pressure co-shift conversion reactor.
3.20      Actual disbursements in the first year of effectiveness were only
a fraction of appraisal estimates. As provided in Annex 3-6, actual
disburs_tments continued to lag behind projections by a margin of about one
year, that widened to about 18 months by 1983. Last withdrawals of loan
.proceeds took place in the second quarter of 1984, as compared to the
original estimate of the fourth quarter of 1982. Actual disbursements and
commitments of the EIB and other loans, and of Government capital
allications are given in Annex 3-7.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      After overcoming initial implementation delays, the ammonia plant
was commissioned and final performance tests took place during September/
November 1984. Unfortunately, a major mishap due to failure of the welding
of the dished head to the walls of the high pressure vessel in the co-shift
conversion reactor, led to plant shut down on August 15, 1985, after an
acceptable average production level had been reached. The defective vessel
had to be reshipped to, and replaced by, the supplier, and a claim has been
made by Qutmigal to the insurance company which bore the cost of renlacinpz
the defective equipment.
4.02      Mechanical completion-of the revamped urea plant (June 1981), and
start-up (July 1981) had a six-month delay.  The nitric acid plants were
similarly behind schedule in commissioning due to delays in delivery of
equipment and, in the case of the Lavradio plant, to difficulties in
material take-off. Similar problems affected the commissioning of the
ammonium nitrate plant.
B. Production Build-uP
4.03      Physical production and sales of the various plants have beca
different from estimates essentially as a result of the delay/mishap of the
ammonia plant, and consequently the lag in production. The results of the
ammonia plant operations over a full year are not yet available to the
Bank, so that long-term capacity utilization cannot be assessed accurately,
although the indication so far is that It would be soon reaching rated
capacity. The urea and amonium nitrate plants have been operating at
capacity.
C.  Market Development
4.04      nata from the PAO show  a shortfall in fertilizer consumption in
Portugal, as compared to appraisal estimates, with in fact an overall
decline of about 122 in the 1985 consumption level as compared to 1980.
Domestic consumption figures for the fertilizer years 1980-85 are detailed
in Annex 4-1 and, for nitrogen fertilizers, given in the following table:

- i2 -
4.05      The main reasons for the decline in fertilizer consumption in
Portugal can be attributed to (i) the recession of the world agricultural
economies, given the availability of large stocks of supply; (ii) the
failure in the policies to increase fertilizer application levels in
Portugal, inter-alia in removing existing sector constraints, enhancing the
performance of the agricultural credit system, and strengthening and
expanding extention services and bring them closer to those prevailing in
other European countries. The recommendations of the study on fertilizer
use in Portugal are yet to be implemented. In addition, Portugal has
experienced severe drought in 1981-82 with an attendant reduction in
fertilizer use. Finally, the increase in domestic prices of fertilizers as
of 1983 has also taken its toll of fertilizer demand by farmers.
V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Company Performance
5.01      The vulnerable financial position of Quimigal at the time of
appraisal led the Bank to saek, from the Government and Quimigal, assur-
ances which went beyond maintaining standard financial ratios usual in this
type of projects. The Bank thus required that studies be carried out on
the profitability of the Company (Section 4.05 - Loan Agreement) and of ito
non-fertilizer operations (Section 3.03(a) - Guarantee Agreement). The
study on Quimigal's profitability was presented for Bank review in January
1984, and served as the starting point for the preparation of Quimigal's
restructuring plan.
5.02      Quimigal has not been immune to the recession which has affected
large segments of the world chemical industry. Following massive invest-
meats in the early 1980's, in projects which later proved to be of dubious
merit and some of which are now closed down, the financial structure of
Quimigal has been weakened, and large losses were associated with these
operations. The financial performance of Quimigal (table below) consider-
ably worsened in 1983 leading to a depletion of Quimigal's equity. The
main reasons for this situation relate to: (i) the low producer prices for
fertilizers then set by the Government, and late payments, by the Govern-
ment, of offsetting compensations to producers; (ii) Government's failure
to pay-in its agreed contributions to capital expenditures including those
under the Fertilizer Modernization Project; (iii) mounting debt with
interest payments at levels well above those sustainable by the compaAy's
business; (iv) world-wide recession of the bulk chemical/fertilizers and
metal industries; and (v) heavy losses in most of the non-fertilizer-
particularly metal-related-operations more than offsetting the earnings in
Quimigal's profitable units. Delays in adjusting fertilizer prices and
untimely payment of related compensation funds had been recurrent problems
for Quimigal. The provisions of Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement,
referring to the continuous review by the Government of the profitability
of Quimigal's fertilizer and non-fertilizer operations were not
satisfactorily fulfilled.

B.   Strategic Studies a8d Financial Restructuring Plan
5.03      Upon the Bank's request, Quimigal commissioned on a Strategic
Planning Study for which consultants were contracted in March 1983, and
which was completed in October 1983. The main conclusions of the study, as
reviewed and discussed with the Bank, were to highlight the major role that
Quimigal plays in the Portuguese economy, and that (i) Ouimigal financial
situation was no longer tenable without major restructuring, given a
considerable debt burden and depletion of equity; (ii) the structural roots
of the problem are-in QUINIGAL's economically unviabl.e and financially
unprofitable businesses, which account for about 552 of net assets, and
less than 15X of total sales; and (iii) a main part of the Company's
activities, mainly fertilizer production, is economically viable with a
positive cashflow that can contribute to cover general overhead and
financial !harges.
5.04      The Bank undertook, first through the Project's regular-although
intensive--supervision, and subsequently under the Public Sector Enterprise
Review, to make an in-depth analysis of QUIMIGAL's problems. A
Rehabilitation Program was prep.sred by QUIMIGAL with Bank assistance, which
included:
(a)  Physical Restructuring, under which those activities
yielding a positive cashflow would continue operating as
part of QUIMIGAL, while the main loss-making operations
(Kowa-Seiko, metal refining, glass fiber, aniline and syngas
plants) would be formally sepatated, the first three being
shut down and the last two being restructured within ISOPOR
in which QUIMIGAL has an equity holding.
(b) Performance Improvement, with a plan to enhance operational
- and financial performance of the remaining operations



- 14 -
including (1) further reduction in labor costs, mainly
overhead, above those already accomplished by simple
attrition; (i1) overall increased efficiency; and (iii)
reduction In working capital through improved inventory
control, billing and collection procedures, etc.
(c) Strategic Development Program, outlined on the basis of
QUIMIGAL's competitive position and growth potentials, and
(i) comprising modest investments focussing on replacement
and capacity balancing aimed at increasing productivity; and
(il) targeting growth along more selective lines of business
based on QUIMIGAL's strength in technical areas and specific
markets.
(d)  Financial Restructuring Plan, which in addition to the
substantive physical action program, called for prompt and
massive financial support to offset the accumulated losses
and liabilities. Failing such support, It would be
impossible for QUIMIGAL to recover and pursue its
activities. The funds required (in equity, long-term ioans
or debt rescheduling) were massive given the naeed to achieve
effective restructuriag of the Company's capital base and
allow a more efficient borrowing policy.
Quimigal's restructuring plan was approved by the Government in March
19E4. In parallel, the Bank had initiated a review of the public
enterprise sector In Portugal, and Quimigal's corporate restructuring
program became linked to a potential Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan
(PERL) aimed at broad policy and institutional reforms through a global
approach to the public enterprise sector. Difficulties In reaching
agreement with the Government on basic Issues of pricing policies,
investment decisions, system of control and proredures to settle arrears,
led, after considerabl delays, to halting the PERL program, as the
Goverdment was not prepared to undertake the structural reforms sug4-ested
by the Bank. Unfortunately, the action on Quimigal's restructuring plan
was also stalle1, &lthough the Government did allocate to Quimigal's part
of the required eqtaity.
B. Financial R,.te of Return
5.05      For the calculation of the financial rate of return (IRR) for the
Project's various components, capital and operating costs have been
adjusted to constant 1985 US$ terms, and actual unit consumption figures of
inputs have been used in the calculation of costs. The value of sales
derived from the volume of product sold, through 1986, are also adjusted to
1985 constant terms. Fertilizer sales and feedstock costs (in constant
1985 terms) from 1987 through 2000, are derived from the Bank's EPD
projections. Other operating costs are assumed to be constant in 1985
-US$ terms. The revised IRR has been calculated under these conditions for
the Project's various components, namely the ammonia plant - which accounts
for about 752 of the total investment - with an IRR of 42; the urea
revamped unit (13%); the ammonia/urea complex as a whole (52); and the



- 15 -
CUF-nitric acid/ammonium nitrate unit (13%) (Annex 5-1). The revised IRt
before tax for the aggregate investment Is equal to 8% against the
appraisal estimate of 15%. Despite a decline in fertilizer prices compared
to appraisal forecasts, the analysis shows acceptable returns (i) on the
urea unit given the revamping nature of the investment with 1w associated
capital outlays; and (11) on the nitric acld/ammonimum nitrate complex
given the premium --assumed to be 10% on a nutrient content basis compared
to urea--which is commanded by ammonium nitrate.
VI. ECONOMIC PERPORMANCE
A.   Economic Rate of Return
6.01      For the calculation of the economic rate of return (ERR) in con-
stant 1985 terms for the Project's various components, traded items have
been priced based on Bank's projected international prices adjusted for
transportation and handling costs. For non-tradeable items, financial
prices have been used. As a result of the progressive increase in fertil-
izer prices in Portugal, which has brought domestic prices closer to inter-
national levels, revenues in economic and financial terms are projected to
be closely similar. As a result, the ERR for each project component is
equal to the (pre-tax) financial rate of return (pars 5.05). The revised
ERR are thus as follows: (i) the ammonia plant with an ERR of 4X against
the apprsisal estimate of 13-17%; (11) the urea plant with 13% against the
appraisal estimate of 13-16%; (iii) the ammonia/urea as a whole with 5Z;
and (iv) the nitric acid/ammonium ritrate complex with 13% against the
appraisal estimate of 13-16%. The revised ERR on the total Project Is
calculated to be 8% against the appraisal estimate of 14-18X. The analysis
sho-ws the influence of the ammonia plan: related investment on the Project
overall economics.
B.   Foreign Exchange Savi.gs
6.02      Taking into account imported fuel oil feedstock (based on the
latest Bank EPD commodity price projection) the foreign exchange savings
amount to US$28.20 per ton of ammonia produced, or US$7.6 million annually
when the plant is operating at full capacity. Thus, over the Project
lifetime of 15 years, total foreign exchange savings are estimated at
about US$250 million.
C.   Technology Transfer
6.03      Although Quimigal had a broad and solid technical base,
implementation of the Project has been conducive to further absorption of
modern technology in the production of ammonia and other products and new
technology has been successfully transferred through the execution of the
Pro4ect. There has also been a considerable technology transfer to local
engineering companies that were heavily involved in the detailed
engineering and erection under the supervision of the foreign engineering
companies.



- 1t -
VII. BANK ROLE
7.01      The Bank has worked closely with Quimigal and its Consultants
t-'oughout all phases of Project implementation. The Bank's
rp-ommandations related to financial and organizational issues affecting
the Company, in addition to technical aspects. Quimigal was well managed
and receptive to Bank recommendations aimed at improving execution of the
Prcject as well as at overcoming the serious obstacles encountered for
efficient operation of all the Company's activities. In the course of an
unusually intensive and lengthy Project supervision, the Bank played a
crucial role in the preparation of Quimigal's restructuring plan with the
dual aim of (i) restoring the financial integrity of the Company with an
acceptable degree of creditworthiness and level of liquidity; and
(ii) developing a sound strategic business plan.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
A.   Conclusions
8.01      Quimiga' utilized to the full extent the setvices and advice of
the main engineering firms for the execution of the Project. Except for an
accidental failure in one key equipment item, the Project was well
implemented physically.
8.02      The market potential/projections for fertilizers as assessed at
appraisal did not materialize, particularly as regards tbe timely
implementation of poliies that would bring the productivity of Portuguese
agriculture to levels more iv line with those of othter Buropean countries.
Bowever, the failure of the domestic market to expand as anticipated at
appraisal did not, and is not expected - given export opportunities - to
result in a limitation of Quimigal's fertilizer sales, although the issues
of price controls and delays in compensatory payments to fertilizer
manufacturers did put an additional strain on Quimigal's financing.
8.03      Finally, the Company suffered the consequences of having in
parallel embarked on a large program of investments in a variety of
fields. Most of these investments, some of which now closed, proved to be
uneconomic, with associated losses offsetting che relatively modest profits
made by some profitable units. The analysis of these investments
(Annex 3-1) and their viability was at the core of the strategic study and
restructuring program proposed for Quimigal (para 5.04).
B. Lessons Learned
8.04      The Fertilizer Modernization Project particularly illustrates
the problems encountered in financing large enterprises with several lines
of business and operations, as well as a large investment program under
way. The main lessons drawn from this case are:



- 17 -
(a) The need for a critical company-wide review of ongoing/planned
investments with large potential impact relative to the size of
the Bank-financed project, or to the Entity's existing assets.
If the merit and impact of such a parallel investment program
cannot be accurately assessed, measures should be deviced to
allow the operation of the Bank-financed project in a way that it
could be isolated from the vagaries of other operations.
(b) The need to enforce third parties (Government or shareholders)
commitments to (i) make equity contributions in the Project
sponsor's capital to maintain an acceptable financial structure;
(ii) reschedule debt as required to strengthen the Project
sponsor's financial base; and (iii) set prices at appropriate
levels or make prompt payments to compensate for losses that the
Project sponsor may suffer as a result of inadequate
pricing/compensation system.
(c) The relative cha. ge in input/output prices, particularly the
collapse of world fertilizer prices, has dealt a considerable
blow to the Project profitability, and further weakened the
vulnerable structure of Quimigal at the very time when several
investments of dubious merit were taking their toll of the
company's finances. However, with the (limited) restructuring
that has taken piace in Quimigal, and the forecast recovery of
the fertilizer market, the worst may have already been weathered
-by Quimigal. Finally, despite the sensitivity analyses carried,
but under which the possibility of such a considerable decline in
ammonia/urea prices was not captured, this evaluation once more
shows the difficulty of accurately predicting developments that
might affect the world prices of commodities, and reinforces the
need for considering the effects of sharp prices decline, and
building adequate safety margins, in particular when designing
the financial structure of a capital intensive investment, to
withstand cycles of depression.
(d) In the case of time-critical equipment, tighter prequalification
procedures should be followed to ensure that firms with records
of serious failures in complying with delivery terms should not
be considered in the vendors lists unless financial guarantees of
sufficient value to compensate for potential production losses
can be obtained.

i.                  PROCUREMENT OF TURBO-COMPRESSORS FOR QUIMIGAL
1.        In its telex of Nobember 6, 1979, Quimigal informed the Bank that
the following bids for Turbo Sets had been received and evaluated:
Bidder Country                Quoted Price          Evaluated Bidaf
1.    Italy                       US$3.8 million          VS$12.4 million
2.    FRG/Switzerland                 4.6 million             13.2 million
FRG/Switzerland                 6.3 million             14.9 million
FRG/Switzerland                 6.2 million             14.8 million
FRG/Switzerland                 5.9 million             14.7 million
a/   After adjustments specified in the bidding documents for consumption
of utilities during a five-year period.
2.        The bidding took place under the two envelope system, after
technical evaluation. The engineering firm (E. F.) concluded that the bids
were formally in accordance with the technical specifications issued with
the bidding documents and all commercial envelopes were therefore opened.
E.F. expressed, however, some reservation on the proposals. On the
PRG/Swiss (G/S) offer, E.F. felt that the turbo set requried more
flexibility in the start-up point. Regarding the Italian offer (ITY),
while the company's bid complied with the technical specifications, E.F. in
its final review did not feel comfortable with the fact that the compressor
required an automatic inlet-guide-vane speed adjuster in order to achieve
partial load operation. E.Y. felt that further detailed discussions on
this matter were necessary before it could accept the ITY speed control
system. The Italian supplier in turn invited E.F. and Quimigal to have
these discussions.
3.        In view of E.F.'s reservations and since Quimigal had some doubts
about the ability of the Italian supplier to deliver the orders in time,
Quimigal recommended to the Bank that this supplier be disqualified and the
contract awarded to FRG/Swiss. The Bank questioned the disqualification of
the Italian supplier since Turbo compressors from this firm had been
accepted for other Bank-financed projects*
4.        Since the Italian was the lowest priced and lowest evaluated
bidder, E.F. and Quimigal, with Bank's agreement held further discussions
with this firm. During these discussions it was agreed that in order to
avoid the use-of the automatic speed adjuster, it would be better if the
Italian design was modified to widen the range of operation (by Increasing



- 20 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 2 of 2
the number of stages, an alternative with which E.F. was familiar). This
avoids the use of the automatic adjuster and provides for a more reliable
operation. The Italian supplier agreed to make the change requested by
Quimigal without changing the price and reconfirmed its ability to deliver
the equipment as desired the Italian supplier Quimigal.  With Bank's
concurrence, the contract was awarded to the Italian supplier in December
1979.
5.        On Jdnuary 25, 1980, the G/S supplier complained that the
competitor submitted a technically different proposal after bid opening and
therefore the new proposal should be considered null and void. The Bank
indicated that the holding of discussions with ITY was correct since the
ITY bid complied with the technical specifications of the bidding documents
(as confirmed by E.F.'s recommendations to Quimigal to open their
commercial bid), was the lowest price  and was the lowest evaluated.  The
modification in the equipment (to further improve its operational
reliability) was not a reason for disqualification of ITY since it was
requested by the engineer after accepting the original technical bid as
being formally in conformity with the technical specifications. As a
matter of fact, if ITY had been disqualified and the order placed with GIS,
the Bank would have had to consider whether misprocurement had taken place.
6.        While discussions between Quimigal and the Bank were taking
place, G/S was apparently led to believe (by E.F. presumably) that the
contract would be awarded to them and therefore went to Lisbon to negotiate
a contract. Quimigal conveyed to them at that time that no decisin on the
order had yet been made. Quimigal assured the Bank that it had not given
G/S any indication that the order would be placed with them. GIS was very
unhappy having been invited to Lisbon, only to learn there that it had not
been awarded the contract.
7.        The Bank concluded that the procurement for this purchase was
correct and so informed G/S by letter dated February 5, 1980.

1.        In summary, a delay of about one and a half year, between planned
and real date, has occurred.  One of the reasons has been the incapacity of
some of the Portugese engineering firms that had no sufficient skilled
staff, to shoulder the workload they had to perform. This limitation gave
rise to both direct delays (on the delivery of technical documentation) and
indirect ones (during erection), given the required corrections that had to
be made.
2.        Although to a limited extent, a reason for the delay can be found
in the low productivity of local erection companies mainly because of
deficiencies in work preparation and deterioration of labor conditions.

3.        In this case the delays are also related to the detailed
engineering, particularly for the rehabilitation of existing units.

reasons silmilar to those which occurred for the ammonia and urea plants.

Re:  PORTUGAL PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FERTILIZER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(DRAFT)
1 - Comments on Technical Aspects
a) In what -oncerns 1985 accident appears wrongly referred
"Synth sis Reactor"   (Page IV, paragraph IV) and   "Ammonia
Converter" (Page 10 - paragraph 3.19 - last line and also
pdge 11 - paragraph 4.01). In both cases the correct desig
nation must be "CO SHIFT CONVERSION REACTOR".
b) It is related on page 6, paragraph 3.10,   an  incident  of
"Procurement" which must be applyed to the "Turbo-Set"   of
the Nitric Acid Plant and not to the "Ammonia Centrifugal
Compressor".
Such correction is necessary on  the paragraphs  3.11   and
3.12 of the page 7, where the references "Ammonia Compressor"
and "Centrifugal Compressor for Ammonia" must be replaced
by "Nitric Acid Turboset".
2 - Comments on Fertilizer Consumption
a) Page 11 - Please correct as follows:
1985  (Actual)  ..........   131.1
1986  (Actual)  ..........   135.5
b) The Annex 4-1 must be replaced (see correct figures).
It must be stressed that the 1987 total consumption is prac
tically equal to 1980 maximum which means   an  interesting
consumption recovery.
