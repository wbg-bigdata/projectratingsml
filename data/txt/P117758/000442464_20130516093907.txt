1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. At the time of the Appraisal of the First Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG-1), the first in a
   series of three proposed operations in support of Rwanda’s social protection and community health
   programs, the country was one of the most densely populated, and among the poorest, despite
   significant progress in the previous decade. National household surveys had shown that the
   population classified as poor had declined from 60 percent in 2000-01 to 57 percent in 2005-06.
   Nevertheless, due to rapid population growth the estimated number of people living in poverty had
   increased from 4.8 million to 5.4 million during these same periods. Over 90 percent of the poor
   were concentrated in rural areas, where poverty remained pervasive and deep.

2. The Government of Rwanda (GoR) had adopted its Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
   Strategy (EDPRS) for 2008-12 that built on strong achievements in human development and
   promoted three flagship programs to accelerate growth, including, encouraging growth that created
   jobs and increased exports, strengthened governance, and introduced the Vision 2020 Umurenge 1
   Program (VUP). The VUP aims at accelerating poverty reduction “by promoting pro-poor
   components of the national growth agenda….by releasing the productive capacity of the poor in rural
   areas through a combination of public works, credit packages and direct support?.2

3. Rwanda’s macro-economic environment was conducive for the reform program. The economy had
   grown on average at 6.8 percent annually between 2001 and 2008 and real GDP growth was forecast
   at 8.5 percent in 2008. The Government had outlined a renewed poverty focused reform agenda in
   terms of the strategic vision, a high level VUP program and this was backed by financing
   commitments in budgetary planning. Nevertheless, with the population growing at 2.7 percent, the
   realized per capita GDP growth rates had been much lower than the GDP growth rates.

4. The pro-poor VUP flagship had attracted strong donor commitment to support the reform program
   and the sector as a whole, including support from the World Bank. Prompted by the Government
   commitment and the renewed inclusive growth agenda, development partners had committed both
   financing and technical assistance to support introduction of good practice in the VUP, financing of
   its expansion plan and providing technical assistance to enable undertaking necessary evaluations to
   inform design improvements over time. In addition to the World Bank, the DFID, Swedish
   Development Cooperation (SIDA), the European Commission, and later on UNICEF, provided firm
   and/or indicative commitments for program support to the VUP.

Social Protection

5. Rwanda’s target for the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG I) is to reduce the proportion of
   the population under the poverty line to 30 percent by 2015. The GoR’s EDPRS aims to lower the
   population living under the upper poverty line to 46 percent and those living in extreme poverty to 24
   percent. Based on the 2005-06 household survey, only modest improvements in poverty levels had
   been achieved as explained above.

  GoR progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized levels of the administration---Province,
District, Sector (Umurenge), Cell (Akagari) and Village (Umudugudu). Of these, the last three are subordinate tiers of the district
governments. The VUP was to be implemented through this newly restructure decentralized local government system.

6. In the absence of systematic policy development in the area of social protection, many government
   and private programs assisted the country to meet its social protection objectives, including those of
   the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI), Ministry of
   Education (MINEDUC), Ministry of Health (MoH), development partners and non-governmental
   organizations. The myriad of programs by several ministries made coordination difficult and time-
   consuming. On the recipients’ side, it was hard to asses who had access to which programs, and
   difficult to detect “double-dipping?, and errors of inclusion and exclusion as the targeting mechanism
   used was based on the Ubudehe classifications whose definition dated back to 2002.

7. A Social Protection public expenditure review carried out by MINALOC in late 2006 had concluded
   that: (1) public expenditures contributing to social protection objectives could be found in numerous
   budget line items, though absolute levels were small; and (2) donor contributions, mostly off-budget,
   for social protection had been extensive. The largest shares of donor spending went to direct support
   for orphans and vulnerable children, and food for work programs; the largest share of public spending
   went to genocide victims, social insurance contributions for public employees, Ubudehe 3
   expenditures, premium subsidies for mutuelles health insurance, and support for households affected
   by HIV-AIDS. Several studies had suggested that more efficient or sustainable ways of delivering
   social protection benefits could be found. The GoR’s VUP aimed to address these issues. But
   program implementation was itself challenged by lack of national level policy framework –
   particularly on direct support and public works interventions that adhered to international practices on
   safety nets programs.

8. Specifically, the VUP implementation design lacked insights on policy and institutional guidance in
   areas of (i) effective targeting of the extremely poor and vulnerable segments of the population, (ii)
   payment mechanisms that would ensure timely delivery of benefits to the poor and minimize leakages
   especially in low capacity and remote environments, (iii) needs based budgeting to both adhere to the
   nationally determined proportion for budget allocation across the VUP components while allowing
   flexibility to respond to varied needs across participating geographical areas and (iv) savings
   promotion to encourage voluntary savings and potential modest investments. In additional, there was
   no guidance on (v) wage setting processes that would minimize distortionary adverse effects on local
   labour wage markets for similar activities for unskilled labour, (vi) grievances and redressal
   mechanisms and (vii) benefits determination approaches. There was also a challenge of the
   institutional set-up for the VUP to be implemented as a flagship as program development preceded
   institutional development, creating a huge management gap to cope with implementation, and as the
   gradual scale-up was implemented.

Health

9. Rwanda had made considerable progress in health, with several indicators confirming improvements.
   Specifically, under-five mortality had declined from 196 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 103 per

  An important, relatively early aspect of social protection development within Rwanda was the reestablishment of Ubudehe, a
traditional Rwandan process of village-level community decision making based on discussion, gathering of systematic
information, and decision-making through community meetings in which all villagers participate. Development partners played a
significant role in the redevelopment of Ubudehe, by providing technical support for the development of related skills within
local communities and by offering operational funding for each village community to select, design, and oversee the contractual
implementation of a substantial locally selected investment project to address what each village perceived to be its most
challenging solvable problem. Resulting projects included modern market premises, road-building, new primary health care or
education facilities or even a small, hydroelectric system powered by a local stream.
                                                                    3

       1,000 in 2008; incidence of malaria had decreased by two-thirds since 2000; modern contraceptive
       prevalence had increased from 4 to 27 percent between 2000 and 2008, and deliveries in health
       facilities had increased from 28 percent in 2006 to 45 percent in 2008. Nevertheless, maternal
       mortality continued to be high, estimated at 750 per 1000,000 live births during the period 2000-04,
       and child mortality remained high, child malnutrition remained persistent, and the prevalence of
       stunting among under-five children was 45 percent in 2005-06.

10. Reform initiatives that had been implemented included: (1) fiscal decentralization with performance-
    based block grants under contracts between districts and the President of the Republic (Imihigo) that
    include health service utilization indicators as measures of performance; (2) civil service reform,
    including decentralization of the wage bill and devolution of personnel management authority to the
    service provider level (health centers and hospitals); (3) scale-up and institutionalization under the
    national budget of the Performance-Based Financing (PBF) Program that provides financing to health
    facilities on the basis of performance in terms of service utilization and quality indicators; (4) scale-
    up of the community based insurance program (Mutuelles), reducing financial risk and burden on
    enrolled households and increasing utilization of health services; (5) increased domestic and
    international public financing for health, rising from US$3 per capita in 1998 to US$33 per capita in
    2008; and (6) improved harmonization of international support to the sector through on-budget
    financing (including budget support and other more ring-fenced mechanisms) and initiation of a
    SWAp (sector-wide approach) process.

11. Public financing of health services had been significantly reformed on both the supply and demand
    sides. On the supply side, health services were publicly-financed through the following mechanisms:
    (1) needs-based transfers in the form of monthly block grants to health centers and hospitals
    determined by formulae that include catchment population size and poverty level; (2) history-based
    transfers based on previous funding levels, designed for the maintenance of existing assets; (3)
    performance-based financing of facility-based services in the form of quarterly transfers to the
    facilities on the basis of a set of indicators; (4) performance-based financing of community health
    workers through transfers to district administrations; (5) investment expenditures for construction and
    equipment; and (6) a variety of off-budget donor support, often in-kind transfers of technical
    assistance, drugs and medical supplies, equipment and infrastructure investment, as well as staff
    incentive payments sometimes through performance-based mechanisms. On the demand side, health
    services were financed from public and private sources through: (1) user payments for services,
    medication and supplies, mostly going to private pharmacists and other providers, but also including
    payments and co-payments for services provided by government facilities; (2) formal insurance
    payments, particularly from the civil service and military insurance systems; and (3) payments for
    services by the community health insurance (Mutuelles) system, which has an office in each health
    center, involves risk-pooling at the sector 4 (Umurenge), district, and national levels, and was reported
    to have attained coverage of over 75 percent of the population.

12. Despite the impressive progress described above, implementation of important reforms remained a
    challenge. These included: (1) access to health care service by the poorest in rural areas, where
    services remained poorly accessible and of low quality; (2) health human resources in rural areas, as
    health facilities in those areas were likely to be under-staffed with less access to higher-skilled
    providers; (3) access to maternal health care services due to a complex set of determinants at the
    household, community and facility levels, whereby poor women in rural areas were less likely to go
    to a health facility for delivery; (4) coverage of high-impact interventions, such as malnutrition and
    child mortality delivered at the community level, in part as they were affected by a variety of socio-

     economic factors related to household economic status and food security; and (5) mitigating the risk
     of donor dependency, through greater on-budget and predictable international financing, prioritization
     of the most cost-effective services, and better alignment of off-budget support with these priorities.
The Government’s Program

13. Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy. The 2008-12 Economic Development and
    Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) emphasized economic growth and poverty alleviation,
    continuing to build on achievements in human development and basic social service, with an
    emphasis on decentralization and a greater role for the private sector. As the country’s second
    Poverty Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP), the EDPRS emphasized accelerating progress towards
    the MDGs. Of particular concern to policy makers were the hard-to-reach MDG 1 (reducing poverty
    and malnutrition) and MDG 5 (reducing maternal mortality). The GoR sought to continue to build on
    progress with MDG 4 (reducing child mortality) and MDG 6 (combating priority diseases including
    HIV/AIDS and malaria), as well as improving education outcomes and gender equality (MDGs2 and
    3). The EDPRS encompassed three flagship programs: (1) Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports;
    (2) Governance, including expanding decentralization and enhancing accountability; and (3) the
    Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) (further explained below).

14. Reform Initiatives. GoR’s reform initiatives had focused among others on: (1) decentralization
    reforms, especially a National Decentralization Policy adopted in May 2000 5 with three goals: (a)
    good governance; (b) pro-poor service delivery, and (c) sustainable development; (2) social protection
    reforms, including: (a) the institutionalization of the Ubudehe process of village-level community
    decision-making, in what was essentially a poverty-mapping process, with a systematic methodology
    that allocated each household to one of six ordinal income and poverty-related categories
    differentiated by pre-defined qualitative criteria, and (b) the carrying out of a broader review of the
    social protection policy framework and pursuit of a Joint Action Development Forum to improve
    coordination of government, civil society, and development partners’ social protection activities at
    both national and local levels, and (3) health reforms to improve the equity and efficiency of health
    financing that have translated into increased funding into improvements in outcomes, through the
    community health insurance system (Mutuelles) and performance-based financing (PBF) of
    preventative and curative services provided by health facilities.

15. Vision 2020 Umurenge Program. The Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) aimed at ensuring
    that economic growth was pro-poor and that the majority of the population took part in the
    improvements in living standards that the country was experiencing6. The VUP, earlier managed
    under MINALOC and currently an integral part of the Rwanda Local Development Support Fund
    (RLDSF), is implemented through local government structures, namely, the administrative sectors
    (local government administrations below districts). The program is organized around: (1) labor-
    intensive public works that provide support to extremely poor families with able bodied persons to


5
  The National Decentralization Policy resulted in the restructuring of local governments into 5 provinces, 30 districts, 416
sectors and 2,148 cells, covering an estimated total of 15,000 villages across the country. The provinces serve as the coordinating
arm of the central GoR. The districts each have their own elected council and mayor, prepare their own budget, and are
responsible for service delivery, economic development, coordination and planning. Sectors and cells, through elected
representatives, serve as constituencies within districts and as an important vehicle for citizen’s voice. Sectors have more fiscal
and service-delivery responsibilities; cells’ main responsibilities remain community mobilization.                To support the
decentralization reforms, the GoR was strengthening monitoring and appropriate oversight of transfers to the districts to ensure
accountability and performance and to align these transfers with monetary and fiscal policies.
6
  The VUP was launched in March 2007. Its implementation started in 2008. The program has since undergone a steady and
ambitious expansion and is slated to cover 100 percent of the country (Direct Support) and at least 50 percent of the country
(Public Works and Financial Services) by 2018.
                                                               5

    supply labour and encourage savings and development of productive activities 7; (2) direct support to
    the most vulnerable households with no labour supply that was intended to smoothen their
    consumption and alleviate poverty; and (3) micro-credit initiatives for investment in income-
    generation and entrepreneurial activities. Community-based participatory process would play
    important roles in the identification of VUP beneficiaries and the selection and implementation of
    local public works processes. The program was to be piloted in the poorest sector (Umurenge) in each
    of the 30 districts, for a total of 30 sectors starting in calendar year 2008. Lessons learned would be
    applied to gradual national scale-up of the program.

16. Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The CLSG/F series was grounded in the Bank’s Rwanda
    Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2008-12, specifically under the second strategic theme of the
    CAS: reducing social vulnerability. In line with this theme, the operations would support
    Government objectives to “ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to
    help Rwanda make further progress in building a more stable society?, help Rwanda get on track on
    child and maternal mortality goals. .

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

17. The Program Development Objective of the Community Living Standards Program was to support
    the GoR’s social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in
    30 pilot sectors, and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population interventions at
    the community level. The CLSG-1 would help Rwanda integrate international good practice within
    its poverty-reducing policies under the EDPRS flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge Program.

18. The Program was to be financed through a programmatic series of three single-tranche development
    policy operations, estimated to total the equivalent of US$30 million. The financing would include an
    IDA US $18 million and a US $12 million grant from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund
    (HRITF) supported by the Governments of Norway and the Great Britain and managed by the World
    Bank.

19. Progress under the three operations was to be assessed by seven indicators namely:

    (i) of those households eligible for support, the percentage that are granted public works in the VUP
    pilot sectors,
    (ii) of those households eligible for support, the percentage that are granted direct support in the VUP
    pilot sectors,
    (iii) the proportion of households in the bottom two categories of extreme poverty in a sample of VUP
    pilot sectors (as identified by the Ubudehe process),
    (iv) increase in the proportion of married women aged 15-49 using modern contraceptives from 27%
    (2008) to 38% (2011),
    (v) increase in proportion of under-five children with diarrhea who receive oral rehydration therapy
    (ORT) from 30% (2008) to 50% (2010-11) 8,
     (vi) increase in the proportion of births that are cared for in an accredited health facility from 45%
    (2008) to 50% (2011) and


7
  While level of land ownership was also considered as a criterion for eligibility to the VUP PW and DS benefits, a targeting
review conducted in the second year of implementation in 2009 recommended that this criterion was not means tested and It was
subsequently dropped.
8
  This indicator was dropped in the second year of the series given that it was not accommodate in the CPAF which this operation
had to be consistent with on evaluation indicators.
                                                    6

    (vii) increase in the annual per capita allocation to performance-based financing (PBF) for health
    facilities and community health cooperatives from US $1.45 (2008) to US $2.25 (2011).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

20. The PDO was not revised. The overall substance of the reform program did not change from what
    was anticipated at the time of the first operation in the series implying a high level of precision in
    designing the right series of prior actions over the three years period of the program. Minor changes
    in the wording of Prior Actions were incorporated in the Program Documents (PD) for CLSG-2 and
    CLSG-3, mostly to further elaborate on the early description of Prior Actions as more definition
    became available during implementation of the Program. These changes in wording in no way altered
    the substance of the originally defined Prior Actions.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

21. The policy actions that were to be supported under the Program focused on ensuring that the GoR’s
    policy reforms followed international good practice relating to public-works employment; cash
    transfers to extremely poor, landless, labor-poor households; and delivery of high-impact health,
    nutrition and population interventions at the community level using performance-based financing
    mechanisms.
Policy Area: Social Protection

22. The VUP aimed to pursue important reforms to expand social protection assistance while promoting
    and maintaining an efficient private labor market. The Program would enable the GoR to adopt
    policies that incorporated good international practice policy principles into the design and
    implementation of the VUP program. These included:

    •   Adopting a wage policy for public works that would not distort the labor market, by ensuring that,
        throughout the country, the public-works wage rate was set regularly no higher than the private
        wage rate for similar labor-intensive works in the same geographic labor market area. Potential
        and eligible workers would select available private employment in preference to public-works
        employment, promoting self-targeting of the poor households.

    •   Putting into practice the GoR’s policy adopted in December 2008 that all wage payments and
        other payments made by the Government to individuals be made by direct deposit into an account
        in the individual’s name in a financial institution (bank, micro finance, SACCOs, or other
        approved financial institutions). By eliminating the use of intermediaries, this policy aimed to
        eliminate the possibility of private contractors skimming off part of the intended wage of public-
        works employees, taking advantage of an improved system of financial services that existed,
        including in rural areas. Private contractors could be used within the VUP for other purposes
        such as providing technical advice or supervising specific activities.

    •   Adopting the household, rather than the individual or family, for purposes of determination of
        award levels, duration of support and related matters in the area of direct support (cash social
        assistance). This policy aimed to support achieving a better match of needs and resources among
        recipient units and minimize incentives for manipulation of household structure to maximize the
        level of new direct support payments received.
                                                                7

    •    Encouraging incentive-driven voluntary savings rather than mandatory savings, as earlier
         envisioned under the VUP. This policy aimed to avoid possible issues with respect to extremely
         poor households not being able to meet their immediate and basic needs, while at the same time
         inducing a savings-habit, and at least for some households, opening up the possibility of
         launching small-scale income-generating activities.

    •    Ensuring a process for determining eligibility that was both clear and transparent to all potential
         recipients and non-recipients. This policy aimed to establish program rules that were widely
         known and would make selection outcomes publicly available.

    •    Putting in place at all levels a rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework, with a baseline at
         the beginning of CLSG-1. This reform focused on a key objective of the Program (strengthening
         institutional capacity), and would support policies to: (1) strengthen financial management of
         VUP at decentralized levels; (2) facilitate regular monitoring and evaluation of direct support and
         public works programs, further strengthening the existing VUP monitoring and evaluation system,
         including policy on upward feedback of related outcomes in pilot sectors, and (3) strengthen the
         coordination between VUP and other social protection programs.
Policy Area: Community Health, Nutrition and Population Services

23. The Program was designed to support a series of policy reforms in the GoR’s community health,
    nutrition and population policies that complemented the VUP in addressing challenges relating to
    access to basic services by the poor, access to maternal health services, coverage of high-impact
    interventions, and health human resource gaps in rural areas, all issues that were considered critical
    for making progress on the hard-to-reach MDGs. The policy reforms included:

    •    Developing a performance-based mechanism to provide incentives for CHWs, based on a
         redesigned strategy that took into account a performance-based financing mechanism for CHWs
         piloted since 2006, and scaling-up the mechanism nationwide. Under this strategy, sector
         administrations would sign performance-based contracts with CHW cooperatives and incentive
         payments would be made on the basis of reported health service indicators, with technical support
         and supervision provided by the health centers 9.

    •     Addressing gaps in health resources in rural areas by evaluating community health training to
          inform development of a supplementary training program that would progressively increase the
          skills of CHWs, with the intention of providing in the medium term a staffing pool for Basic
          Health Units in rural areas that were planned to be built under the VUP. The GoR’s Community
          Health Policy involved integrated training of CHWs in provision of a package of high-impact
          preventive and curative services.

     •    Developing an innovative strategy that included incentives for pregnant women, CHWs, and
          health facilities to encourage safe deliveries in health facilities that would address factors that
          affected maternal mortality.


9
  The Facility PBF is a supply-side results-based financing program that provides financial incentives to staff at health centers
and district hospitals financed by the MoH and faith-based organizations to deliver a higher quantity of priority maternal and
child health services, conditional on the quality of the services delivered. CHWs are provided incentives to reporting progress on
the following indicators: (1) women referred to a health center for prenatal care in the first trimester; (2) women referred to
deliver at a health facility; (3) referral of children monitored for the nutrition status (conditioned on correct referral of
malnourished children to the treatment facilities); (4) referral of new family planning users; and (5) women referred to health
center for sustained use of modern contraceptives.
                                                                 8

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

24. Neither the Policy Areas nor their Medium-Term Objectives were revised. However, based on
    implementation experience with each operation, wording for the Policy Actions for the second and
    third operations were slightly modified to make them more explanatory.

25. The additional/adjusted key policy challenges for Social Protection, included:
• Establishing a framework to handle appeals and complaints by beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries,
    since public confidence in the Ubudehe selection process required that the public fully understood
    and accepted the system.
• Improving targeting and reducing potential inclusion and exclusion errors in view of household
    baseline survey data from December 2008 that suggested that there were divergences between the
    intended targeting of poor households under the existing Ubudehe structure and the actual patterns of
    inclusion and exclusion of households found in the analysis of relevant data.
• Strengthening the design, planning and management of VUP budgetary processes in an evolving
    decentralized budgetary framework since challenges emerged as MINALOC sought to implement the
    coordinated but disparate elements of public works, direct supports and financial services. The
    challenges involved: (1) managing budgets across and within Districts and sectors, reflecting
    population size and local poverty rates in the geographic distribution of expenditures; and (2)
    managing local area outlays so that the entitlement character of direct support expenditures was
    respected and the intention of allocating 50 percent of total VUP funding to public works was realized.
    Efforts were needed to: (1) design budget allocation criteria, inter-program and inter-sector
    distributional rules, and processes that accurately disbursed funds to those deemed eligible, while
    protecting the position of poor households; and (2) improve the consistency between the distributions
    of poverty and program funding, using evolving data.
For Community Health, Nutrition and Population Services, these included:

•    Improving coherence and articulation of the family planning policy to remove the financial barriers
     that prevent access to modern family planning methods, especially among rural poor women.
•    Improving demand for reproductive and maternal health services (as opposed to only incentives to
     pregnant women) to reduce fertility and maternal mortality, through an incentive strategy that would
     target women of reproductive age (to stimulate demand for family planning) and pregnant women (to
     stimulate demand for antenatal and delivery care) 10 . This would be in addition to continued
     improvements on the supply side in the quality of services and to extending coverage through the
     community health program.
•    Promoting community-based action to complement facility-based efforts to achieve the hard-to-reach
     MDGs (including, adoption of a Community Health Policy, approval of an annual implementation
     plan, and budgeting for community health as reflected in the annual MTEF).
•    Evaluating policy innovations to ensure that they were cost effective in achieving improvements in
     health services and outcomes, especially to assess the effectiveness and impact of extending the PBF
     strategy to community-based services, and using in-kind incentives on a large scale to encourage
     demand for reproductive and maternal health services.


10
  An impact evaluation of the Facility PBF showed important successes, but also the limitations of supply-side incentives.
Recognizing the importance of demand-side and community-level factors in determining demand for key maternal and child
health services and the need for innovation to ensure improvements in indicators, the MoH designed the Community
Performance-Based Financing Program that includes both supply-side incentives to CHWs and demand-side in-kind incentives
for uptake of predetermined services. The indicators/incentives on the demand-side are to: (1) pregnant women to attend
prenatal services within the first trimester; (2) deliver at a health center; and (3) mothers who have recently given birth to attend
postnatal services within 20 days of delivery.
                                                               9

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

26. The Community Living Standards Program was designed as a series of three operations with the
    Program Document for the first operation describing the entire reform program. The Program was
    implemented as planned over a three-year period, with each of the operations approved in one-year
    intervals. A summary of the operations is provided in Table 2 below. All Prior Actions were met
    before the negotiations for each operation. These Prior Actions and their status (including minor
    changes in wording), by operation, are presented in Annex 7.

              Total                    18.0                 11.8

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

27. Several factors had an impact on the Program’s implementation, including strong government
    commitment, its design as a component of an integrated Bank strategy, beneficiary involvement, the
    macroeconomic environment in which it was implemented, continued donor support and a
    coordinated accountability framework.

28. Strong Government Commitment. The GoR has demonstrated strong, sustained and unwavering
    commitment to poverty reduction and to expanding access to basic health services to its population
    through implementation of its EDPRS, including the VUP, as supported by the CLSG/C Program. It
    has also been zealous in building upon progress and experience under its EDPRS and the Program in
    pursuing scale-up and policy reforms, over and above those specifically included under the Program,
    that were designed to further the Program’s PDOs. The VUP is currently in its fourth year of
    implementation, and has gradually scaled up from 30 to 180 administrative Sectors (direct support) 11
    and 150 administrative Sectors (public work and financial services) as of July 2012. A National
    Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) was developed and approved by cabinet in January 2011 drawing
    on lessons from the VUP, to build coherence and complementarities among various programs that
    contribute to social protection. It is built around seven key social protection outcomes: (i) leadership,
    coordination and capacity across government; (ii) evidence-based policies; (iii) coverage expansion of


11
  The VUP has gradually scaled up by adding the next extremely poor Sector in each District every financial year through July
2011. Starting in July 2012, two Sectors will be added each year under Direct Support to stay on track with its rapid scale-up
plan (Public Works/Financial Services expansion will remain according to original plan of adding 30 more Sectors). The Sector
uptake in each district will also no longer be uniform but depend on poverty ranking based on the Third Household Survey results
(February 2012) effective July 2012. Total coverage for Direct Support and Public Works/Financial Services was therefore 180
and 150 Sectors, respectively, as of July 2012.
                                                            10

       gender-sensitive programs in support of minimum income for families; (iv) systems strengthening for
       delivery and monitoring of programs; (vi) social development support to family and communities to
       move out of poverty; and (vii) awareness and dissemination of lessons learned.

29. A Community Health Strategy, developed and validated through a consultative process in 2010, aims
    at providing an important overarching framework for the numerous technical areas spanned by
    community health (reproductive, maternal and child health, nutrition and population, etc.). The GoR
    has gained international recognition for several of the pioneering reform initiatives, including the use
    of PBF in health and community-based health initiatives.

30. More importantly, perhaps, has been the GoR’s unrelenting commitment both to ensuring that partner
    support for its EDPRS, including that provided by the Bank, be provided within a coordinated fashion
    (see below) both of efforts and resources allocation to promote efficiency, and continuous monitoring
    and evaluation of results that serves to inform progress and advise adjustments in implementation.
    Additionally, the efficient coordination has enabled effective mobilization of technical assistance
    from development partners to support the GoR in low capacity environments, a factor that has
    contributed to the acceleration of policy development and implementation. The GoR is in the process
    of formulating its follow up EDPRS2 (2013-2018), to which its NSPS is being aligned.

31. Integrated IDA Strategy. The GoR and the Bank have an integrated, comprehensive, and sustained
    engagement (supported also by other international partners) in support of poverty reduction and
    provision of social services that encompasses a wide variety of Bank instruments. The Program was
    fully aligned with and complementary to the Poverty Reduction Support Grant/Credit series, the
    Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP), and the Land Husbandry, Water
    Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project (LWH). The PRSG 1-3 supported health sector reforms
    that mainly included scaling up of community health insurance, decentralization of health services
    management and PBF. It also supported initial efforts to implement social protection interventions
    before the VUP was introduced. The PRSG/C 4-7, inter alia, consolidates gains in human
    development and addresses the growth elements of poverty reduction and economic development.
    The policies supported under the CLSG/C Program complemented the PRSG/C by boosting
    Rwanda’s potential for positive progress towards achieving poverty reduction faster and more
    efficiently, and promoting inclusive and pro-poor growth. The DCDP expanded the notion of
    community-driven initiatives, and supported capacity building at the District level and orientation
    programs at the Sector levels to help create infrastructure assets (e.g., health facilities) in remote areas.
    The LWH Project includes a component on labor-intensive public works that provides both
    employment and earning opportunities for the poor and contributes to creation and maintenance of
    community assets. Lessons from implementation of the VUP under the Program provided useful
    lessons for the LWH Project, especially regarding setting and re-setting wage rates and criteria for
    selecting beneficiaries in the public works program.

32. Throughout, the Bank has also maintained a strong program of knowledge and advisory services, in
    coordination with other partners, in support of Rwanda’s poverty reduction efforts. 12 These
    instruments have been complemented by financing and technical support from the Health Results
    Innovation Trust Fund, managed by the Bank, which has provided continuous funding for
    implementation and evaluation of the health PBF and other initiatives, including US$1million for
    evaluations under the Program. Finally, continued support to the GoR’s NSPS, including the VUP,
    has been provided under a series of two programmatic DPLs, Support to the Social Protection System
    (Section 2.4). More than the size and composition of the Bank’s assistance program, it was the

     CLSC-3 Program Document, Table 3: Analytical Underpinnings for CLSC-3, page 25.
                                                   11

    diversity of vehicles, the timing of its support to coincide with the implementation of the EDPRS, and
    the constant learning from lessons of experience of earlier support that provided a synergistic impact
    that benefited the Program’s implementation.

33. Beneficiary Involvement. Rwanda’s practice of Ubudehe, a traditional process of village-level
    community decision-making based on discussion amongst villagers, gathering of systematic
    information, and decision-making, has been institutionalized. This community driven mechanism has
    been successful in securing beneficiary involvement in prioritization and implementation of the
    Program. The results of a 2006 Ubudehe survey show that it is an approach that benefits the poor,
    promotes social capital and unification, increases participation in planning and decision-making, and
    empowers the poor and women. Under Ubudehe, two village committees are elected: one to oversee
    implementation of communal decisions, and the other to function as an oversight committee that
    activates itself only if concerns arise about the functioning of the first committee. The community-
    driven processes have been used in all villages for multiple purposes, including identifying and
    overseeing projects to address community problems, identifying village priorities as part of local
    government planning processes, and identifying the poorest households in the village that would
    receive community-managed income support (based on a poverty mapping process that takes into
    account geographic and social maps of each village, households’ incomes and codes for relevant
    socioeconomic characteristics of each family).

34. Macroeconomic Environment. The Program was implemented in a difficult macroeconomic
    environment, in the midst of the international financial and economic crisis, and a global slowdown in
    growth. Nevertheless, this difficult environment did not adversely affect the GoR’s allocations to and
    implementation of the Program. At the time that CLSG-1 was prepared, the main identified possible
    impacts of the global slowdown on the Rwandan economy had been a possible slowdown in
    Rwanda’s previously robust GDP growth rates, a possible widening of the trade deficit, a possible
    increase in inflation due to then rising commodity prices, and, most importantly, a possible reduction
    in grants should budget support donors, in response to the effects of the international crisis,
    substantially curtail their commitments. Rwanda’s macroeconomic framework was remarkably stable
    throughout implementation, although real GDP growth fell from 11.2 percent in 2008 to 4.1 percent
    in 2009 before rebounding to a healthy rate of 7.5 percent in 2010. In addition, the deficit including
    grants, narrowed due to higher than expected donor assistance during 2009-2010, mainly from
    budgetary grants in response to the global economic crisis. The core donors supporting the social
    protection sector in particular sustained and increased their support during program implementation.

35. Donor Support. Rwanda has a high level of donor engagement and throughout implementation the
    GoR consistently attached a high priority to aid coordination and effectiveness (see below). Despite
    concerns that grant funding could decrease during implementation of the Program in response to the
    international crisis, in fact, budgetary grants increased as a percentage of GDP as well as social
    protection sector and program financing. The GoR has worked closely with budget support
    development partners to increase aid predictability---budgetary grants are expected to decrease to
    near pre-crisis levels, to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2013-14, from 9.2 percent in 2009. The Government
    aims to increase as much as possible the proportion of international funding that is on-budget and
    allocate to the highest priority activities the more predictable on-budget domestic and international
    financing. Nevertheless, unlike financing under the Program that was on budget, a considerable
    amount of bilateral aid—about 45 percent of aid delivered by development partners--was still
    delivered outside of the GoR’s budget system in 2009-2010.

36. The VUP was jointly financed and otherwise supported by donors and GoR in an increasingly
    coordinated manner, especially through the VUP Development Partners’ Meeting. The Bank
    maintained consistent consultations with the donor community during supervision missions. In
                                                    12

    addition to budget support under the Program, the Bank provided technical assistance for
    implementation through the DCDP. Bilateral and multi-donor support continued to grow since the
    beginning of the VUP’s implementation. DFID, SIDA and the European Commission all provided
    budgetary support totaling approximately US$___equivalent for VUP implementation through 2012.
    DFID and UNICEF have provided technical assistance support as well. The Program’s support to
    community health was closely coordinated with partners providing budget support as well as other
    development partners involved in the sector. Development assistance accounts for over half of total
    health expenditures, and through SWAp arrangements, technical working groups and a joint
    GoR/donor process of performance reviews the MOH has proactively managed the risk of donors
    skewing sectoral priorities. Prominent donors under the Program included the Global Fund, UNICEF
    and USAID, for both financial and technical assistance.

37. Coordinated Accountability Framework. Financing under the Program was provided in the context of
    a unified framework in which Bank financing along with complementary financing provided by
    donors was channeled and monitored in a harmonized manner. In September 2008 all budget support
    donors and the GoR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) governing the provision of
    direct budget support in the implementation of the EDPRS. The MoU replaced the previous 2003
    Partnership Framework, and outlined monitoring and performance management responsibilities and
    guidelines, that would be carried out according to the Harmonization Calendar in the context of three
    complementary frameworks: (1) the Common Performance Assessment Framework, which
    summarized GoR’s performance in the implementation of the EDPRS; (2) the Donor Performance
    Assessment Framework (DPAF), which summarized donor performance in adhering to the various
    commitments related to the aid effectiveness agenda; and (3) the Joint Governance Assessment (JGA),
    which would be revised and agreed upon annually by the GoR and the development partners,
    summarizing the GoR’s performance in the implementation of governance reforms. In accordance
    with the MoU, the Results Indicators selected for the Program were fully aligned with the CPAF, with
    the exception of one health indicator that, by mutual agreement, was drawn from the agreed health
    sector matrix.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

38. Design. The PD for CLSG-1 presented a Results Framework that described immediate and short-
    term outcomes as well as indicators to measure progress during the three operations under the
    Program, and responsible agencies that would be accountable for reporting. The matrix and
    indicators were consistent with the CPAF and sector-specific frameworks, with the exception of one
    health indicator that by mutual agreement was drawn from the agreed health sector matrix.

39. The Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) was responsible for implementation of the VUP
    public works and direct supports elements and its monitoring and reporting over time. Monitoring of
    the VUP program and policy was to draw on data and findings from a variety of sources to monitor
    progress on various expected outcomes for the Program. This was to include the existing information
    system at the District and Sector Levels, the VUP M&E system, baseline and follow-up household
    surveys in a sample of 10 Sectors among the 30 pilot VUP Sectors and a sample of 10 Sectors among
    non-VUP Sectors, regularity of financial flows, data on wages and employment in public works and
    in the private sector for unskilled labor, assets created and the maintenance scheme, appeals process,
    etc.

40. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was responsible for implementation of the community health,
    nutrition and population strategy in support of the VUP, in conjunction with the VUP through the
    decentralized administration, notably the District and Sector administrations, as well as health centers
    at the Sector level. The GoR intended to scale-up at the District and health center level nationwide
                                                            13

     implementation of the community health, nutrition and population policy, including in the 30 VUP
     Sectors, that took into account the lessons learned through implementation of a pilot program to
     provide incentives to CHWs in several Districts since 2006. The scale-up would make use of already-
     established information system capacity in health centers to meet the data requirements of the
     community-based PBF strategy 13.

41. Impact evaluation was built into the Program’s design. The evaluation, scheduled for three years
    after the Program’s inception, would examine the impact of the VUP and the modified policy
    framework under the Program on households’ socioeconomic status, and health and education
    outcomes. A baseline survey would include: (1) a Household Survey; (2) a Village Survey on major
    characteristics of villages such as access to roads, schools, clinics, banking outlets, post offices,
    distance to main roads/district headquarters, etc. (3) key information interviews with unstructured
    schedules that provided insights into the prevailing poverty, health and employment situation; and (4)
    focus group interviews to get feedback on the implementation arrangements. The impact of the
    community health, nutrition and population policy reforms would also be rigorously evaluated,
    including a randomized design and baseline and follow-up Household Surveys, as part of a global
    study in nine countries that was supported by the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. This was to
    build upon a then ongoing impact evaluation of the facility-based PBF scheme.

42. Implementation and Utilization. Throughout implementation, the GoR assigned (and continues to
    assign) high priority to monitoring and evaluation of both the VUP and the community health
    programs. For community health, monitoring results is built into the system of PBF financing. For
    the VUP, monitoring program results has relied on a basic, quarterly Excel-based monitoring system,
    with information provided by the districts and Sectors on beneficiaries, payments, hours worked, etc.
    This system provided information for the Program, but is now being strengthened in the form of a
    full-scale MIS with support under the proposed second phase of the SSPS.

43. The GoR has also assigned high priority to continuously monitor the efficiency of targeting, and to
    evaluation of the program’s results at a broader level through its series of Integrated Household
    Living Conditions Surveys and its Demographic and Health Surveys carried out by the National
    Institute of Statistics of Rwanda in conjunction with the MOH. 14 These surveys were complemented
    by a First Targeting Assessment, carried out by the Bank, and all together were used as input in
    refining targeting, prioritizing Sectors and districts, and adjusting the VUP program. For the
    Community Health PBF, three Baseline Surveys were conducted in February – May 2010 to build
    evidence on the two models, namely demand-side, supply-side or demand plus supply-side incentives,
    sing a randomized experimental design: (i) a Household Survey that captures the key indicators of
    maternal and child health, socioeconomic status, and other basic demographic information; (ii) a
    Community Health Worker Survey that captures information on inputs and resources available to
    community health workers, their supervision, PBF and non-PBF payments, their knowledge and their
    satisfaction and motivation with their mission, and (iii) a Community Health Worker Cooperative
    Survey that captures key characteristics regarding the scope of the cooperatives, their infrastructure
    and capacities, their financing, their activities, and their ability to generate income and transmit

   The 2010/11 Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV3) is the third in the series of survey which started in
2000/01 and is designed to monitor poverty and living conditions. In 2010/11, for the first time the achieved sample size of
14,308 households in the EICV3 was sufficient to provide estimates which are reliable at the district level
                                                              14

     income from the cooperative to community health workers 15. The follow up Surveys for each of the
     above as well as a health facility survey are expected to be conducted in February – May 2013.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

44. The Government has implemented a gradual annual scale-up of the VUP implementation with a
    roadmap for country-wide coverage in the medium to long term. Indeed, the pro-poor growth agenda
    remains an important part of the overarching Government strategy. A national social protection
    strategy that takes forward the VUP implementation as part of the social protection system
    development agenda was approved by cabinet in January 2011 and is being updated consistent with
    the EDPRS-2 priorities with a stronger focus on poverty.

45. Consistent with the Government evolving sector orientation, the Bank provided a three year
    programmatic development policy support from FY2012 to FY2014 through the Support to the Social
    Protection System (SSPS) DPL. The series provides support that seeks to consolidate gains of the
    VUP and support a systems development agenda. The operations support prior actions that are
    focused on four main thematic policy areas namely: (i) strengthening policy development and
     management capacity of the social protection (SP) sector; (ii) consolidation of the SP management information
     systems (MIS); (iii) expanding the coverage and enhancing the harmonization of SP interventions in the
     country; and (iv) establishing operational links between SP and early warning systems with the ultimate
     objective of climate-proofing SP programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46. The Program’s objectives, design and implementation were closely linked and aligned with the GoR’s
    EDPRS, its NSPS and the Bank’s 2008-2012 CAS. On a broader level, the continued relevance of the
    Program’s objectives to Rwanda’s efforts to make progress towards the MDGs is unquestionable.
    The Program’s design and its implementation through decentralized administrative structures
    (Districts and Sectors) was a direct and appropriate response to the Government decision to
    strengthen services targeted at the extremely poor people at the point of service delivery. These
    features were and continue to be highly relevant, and continue to count on Bank and donor support
    given the GoR’s strong commitment towards continuous refinements and improvements to its social
    protection system, incorporating lessons of experience and results from evaluations.

47. The inclusion of both social protection and health in a single operation brought mutual benefits in
    delivering broad-based pro-poor policy reforms in a complementary manner, providing a set of
    human development services to the poor at the same time and rationalizing resources in target areas



15
  In the Community Health PBF, Community Health Workers (CHWs) are grouped into cooperatives, and each Sector where the
community PBF is implemented has at least one CHW cooperative. Cooperatives are autonomous and set their own rules.
Cooperative members determine all internal functions, including membership fees (if any), responsibility sharing, income use and
sharing, the degree of involvement of each CHW in the cooperative, etc. The primary role of the cooperatives is to facilitate the
PBF payments to CHWs; payments are disbursed to cooperatives by Central and District-level Government based on
performance. Each cooperative receives a payment proportional to the performance of the member CHWs. CHWs are entitled to
30 percent of this income, and the remaining 70 percent is to be reinvested in the cooperative to set up income generating
activities that will supplement CHWs’ income. In parallel, women receive in-kind gifts of a predefined value of money when
they resort to certain key maternal and child health services. This demand-side incentive is linked to the CHW cooperative
supply-side incentive through the fact that CHWs are, among other things, rewarded or incentivized to refer women to health
centers for those same MCH services.
                                                    15

    by maximizing cross cutting benefits like promotion of community health awareness programs within
    implementation of the public works component of the VUP. The design of the Program’s results
    framework comprised indicators that were both measurable in the short term and achievable, and
    policy actions that were directly related to progress in the outcome indicators selected. The
    Program’s timing, to coincide with the adoption of the EDPRS, including the VUP, and with the
    Bank’s CAS was propitious to its strong results.

48. The use of a programmatic DPL provided a powerful instrument for supporting specific programs
    (the VUP and the community health program) and sectoral policies while contributing to the
    overarching GoR’s poverty reduction efforts. It also provided an instrument through which donors,
    despite original concerns regarding possible declines in grant funding, were able to support priorities
    for Rwanda within a consistent assistance framework. In social protection sector, the program
    provided such a convenient and effective window to focus on safety nets policy reforms relevant to
    build a strong foundation for development of a social protection system. In addition, the health sector,
    having been among the sectors of focus under the first series PRSG had achieved impressive progress
    in reforms, which needed to be deepened and the program was successful in deepening community
    health reforms that focused on strengthening demand and supply side aspects of the poor’s access to
    services at the community health center level. Last but not least, the program contributed effectively
    to the GoR’s harmonization and aid effectiveness agenda by reducing transaction costs consistent
    with the EDPRS objectives.

49. The social protection sector has significantly evolved with strong achievements in policy
    development. Community health reforms have also been deepened and further developed. Whereas
    more policy development may be needed to strengthen service delivery at the periphery and
    strengthen the systems agenda, policy development is now as important as sustaining results on the
    ground. The base that was laid out by this project is enabling further development in the sectors,
    which could be achieved both through further DPL or Program for Results (P4R) operations.

50. The program thus fully achieved its development objectives to support the GoR’s social protection
    and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 30 pilot sectors, and to
    expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population interventions at the community level.
    Significant results were achieved in reducing maternal and child mortality, and reducing the total
    fertility rate through increased use of family planning, and this should in the future lead to further
    progress in the reduction of poverty. The relevance of the Program’s objectives, therefore, continues
    to be extremely strong, and the GoR’s proven record of incorporating lessons of experience, results of
    evaluations, and international best practices into its social protection system bode well for the
    continued relevance of the Program’s design and implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

51. The CLSG/C Program’s effectiveness was high. It achieved its objective that was to support the
    GoR’s social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 30
    pilot sectors, and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population interventions at the
    community level. The policy actions supported by the Program led to important results in poverty
    reduction in the near-term and social development, through improved health services, in the longer-
    term. The Program was carried out in a difficult, but solidly managed macroeconomic environment
    (Section 2.2).

Social Protection Policy

52. Under CLSG-1 and CLSG-2 the GoR ensured that social protection policy reforms followed
    international good practice. Under CLSG-1, policy reforms included the adoption of a non-
    distortionary wage policy for public works, direct payment of workers and beneficiaries without
    intermediaries, and determination of direct support benefits to poor families with no adult labor based
    on the household as a unit. Under CLSG-2, policy reforms included shifting to voluntary savings,
    and a process for determining eligibility that is clear and transparent to all potential recipients and
    non-recipients because it make program policy and procedures widely known and selection outcomes
    publicly available. Under CLSC-3, policy reforms included establishing and operating an appeals and
    complaints mechanism to strengthen public confidence in the Ubudehe selection process, developing
    and adopting a VUP budget allocation policy that supports a 20-30-50 percent split between direct
    support, financial services and public works programs, while allowing for variations across Sectors
    depending on need, and developing a new targeting policy for beneficiaries of the Ubudehe program
    so that it remains consistent with the objectives of VUP, reducing potential inclusion and exclusion
    errors.
Health Nutrition and Population Policy

53. Under CLSG-1 and CLSG-2, health policies and strategies were implemented to expand poor
    households’ access at the community level to selected reproductive, maternal and child interventions.
    There is clear evidence of evolution over the series, from policy approval of concept to detailed
    program design and piloting, refinement and implementation of Community PBF under CLSG-2 and
    CLSC-3. The policy actions included: (1) financial reforms (e.g., tariff reforms to remove user fees
    for long-term family planning methods; increased budget spent on results-based financing principles);
    (2) improved planning and budgeting for community health (adoption of a Community Health Policy;
    approval of an annual implementation plan and budgeting for community health as reflected in the

 This baseline was revised from 28.7% to 34% at the end of 2008 based on administrative data cleaning by the Program.

 The actual per capita allocation is based on the allocation to the Facility PBF program only. The per capita allocation to the
Community PBF has not yet been included in that calculation.
                                                           17

    annual MTEF); (3) the design and adoption of the Community Performance-based Financing program
    (Community PBF) and development of related institutional mechanisms that provide demand-side
    incentives targeting women and complementary supply-side incentives targeting CHWs with the
    overall goal of stimulating demand for contraceptive use, pre-and post-natal care and institutional
    deliveries; and (4) a rigorous evaluation of the impact of these reforms.

54. The adoption of the above policy actions resulted in the Program’s progress towards the targets for
    PDO indicators under the series of CLSG/C operations, as presented below, which in turn had an
    important contribution towards the achievement of the Program’s objectives as described above.

55. Since the beginning of the Program, the VUP has been scaled up to 180 pilot Sectors and the health
    interventions to 150 Sectors. The Ubudehe system was effective in targeting the poor, and the impact
    on the population was positive. A Household Poverty Survey carried out in October-December 2009
    in 90 Sectors (30 Sectors from each cohort of VUP Sectors), analyzed together with the 2009
    targeting survey, confirmed VUP’s findings that the Ubudehe system was identifying poor
    households well and was better than many other countries’ community-based systems. The findings
    were based on examining certain facets of poverty and vulnerability with categories 1 and 2 of the
    Ubudehe system, such as female-headedness, disability, illiteracy, etc. The possible issues revealed
    by the findings, such as potential errors of exclusion (e.g., children in poor households), and
    incorporating other facets of vulnerability in the categories were addressed in CLSC-3.

56. VUP’s analysis of the survey data indicated strong poverty reduction results. Extreme income
    poverty 18 was 35.1 percent across all VUP Sectors, a fall of 3.9 percent from 39 percent in 2006. The
    fall in extreme income poverty was much stronger in more dynamic 1st cohort pilot Sectors, 35.7
    percent to 25.6 percent. The 10.1 percent reduction in the 1st cohort pilot Sectors was twice the
    reduction in the two other cohort Sectors. The reduction was concentrated in male-headed
    households (from 37.9 percent to 33.1 percent). Female-headed households reported a smaller fall
    from 42.6 percent to 40.8 percent. The analysis also showed that the numbers of households in the
    bottom two Ubudehe categories decreased globally by 6.4 percent between 2007 and 2009 (from 34.7
    percent to 28.3 percent). The decrease was highest in the 1st cohort Sectors (from 32.7 percent to 23.9
    percent); in other Sectors the decrease was from 35.7 percent to 30.4 percent. Net Ubudehe
    graduation (i.e., the percentage of households that move to a higher category less households that
    move to a lower category) between 2007 and 2009 was 18.3 percent. Net Ubudehe graduation was 52
    percent as strong for male-headed households (20.5 percent) compared to female-headed households
    (13.5 percent). Different analysis revealed that direct support had a significant and pronounced
    impact in increasing food consumption of poor households, although public works was not producing
    the same significant impacts, possibly due to the small number of days of work provided and low
    uptake rates for eligible households due to insufficient works that are planned every financial year.
    Finally, a qualitative assessment of the VUP conducted by UNICEF found that, overall, beneficiaries
    reported a positive impact of the program, and that it helped them in becoming eligible for other
    government programs, including health. Fifty-five percent of households reported saving a portion of
    the VUP benefit; fifty-four percent of beneficiaries reported spending on food commodities, whereas
    others reported also using funds to purchase productive assets, health products, farm inputs and
    education.

57. The 4th Demographic and Health Survey, reflecting 2010 data, reveals similar, impressive
    improvements in social indicators. The maternal mortality rate was more than halved in ten years,


18
   Income poverty is calculated using a basic expenditure approach measuring the value of food consumption and other basic
expenditures.
                                                    18

    dropping from 1051 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 750 in 2005 and 476 in 2010. These outcomes
    were achieved through efforts to expand and improve antenatal care, to increase the number of
    deliveries assisted by skilled providers to increase deliveries in health facilities (see below), an
    important component of the GoR’s to improve the supply and quality of health services, and to efforts,
    also supported under the Program to increase demand for health care services. The 3rd Household
    Living Condition Survey reports an increase in health insurance coverage from 43.3 percent of the
    population in 2005/06 to 68.8 percent in 2010/11, and a reduction in time (in minutes) to reach the
    nearest health center from 95.1 minutes to 59.9 minutes over the same period (with proportionately
    greater declines in rural areas). In 2010, 98 percent of pregnant women received prenatal care, up
    from 94 percent in 2005; the percent of deliveries assisted by skilled providers increased from 39
    percent to 69 percent, and the percent of deliveries in a health facility increased from 30 percent to 69
    percent over the same period. The proportion of married women using a modern method of
    contraceptive increased from 35 percent in 2007/08 to 45 percent in 2010/11. And, the total fertility
    rate for women aged 15 to 49 for the three-year period preceding the survey dropped from 6.1 in 2005
    to 4.6 in 2010.

58. The pilot of demand-side incentives in 30 VUP Sectors from January to June 2010 provided
    important experience to guide its roll out to 150 Sectors, and promising results as well. The
    preliminary data suggested a significant uptake of the incentivized services. The pilot review found a
    48 percent increase in prenatal services in VUP Sectors during the first four months of pregnancy
    between the periods January-June 2009 and the same period in 2010. Although not all of this
    increase is attributable to the introduction of demand-side incentives—other sectors have also
    witnessed an increase, but not of the magnitude seen in the VUP Sectors.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Program Rating: Satisfactory

59. The Program’s relevant objectives and design, and the satisfactory achievement of all seven outcome
    indicators, with significant overachievement of four of them, and marginal miss on only one of them
    proves the Satisfactory outcome of the project series.I addition, the GoR has institutionalized it in
    both the MOH and the RLDS, and embraced it in the NSPS, and plans to place both social protection
    and health (in addition to education) at the center of its EDPRS2, confirm this. The CLSG series was
    fundamental not only in attaining the results it was designed to achieve, but more importantly for
    placing social protection at the center of the Government’s priorities, and in constantly analyzing and
    improving both the VUP and community health programs in the process. Overall Outcome is rated
    Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60. The Program’s objectives were very much aimed at tackling poverty and inequality. The social
    protection policies were designed to contribute to a reduction in the income-poverty gaps in pilot
    Sectors and provide greater opportunities for beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate into
    income-generating activities from public works and direct support programs. The Community PBF
    policies were designed to improve access to selected reproductive, maternal and child health services,
    especially among poor rural households and to contribute to addressing persistent socio-economic
    disparities in utilization of health services and in health outcomes. Preliminary results show that the
    program accomplished the objectives in both of these areas (Section 3.2).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
                                                   19

61. As a programmatic DPL, the Program did not support any policies aimed at institutional
    strengthening, per se, although the Prior Actions and other policies supported all aimed at
    strengthening the policies, structure and functioning of key social programs, including health, by
    enhancing their quality, transparency and outcomes. Technical assistance and other institutional
    support was provided through the DCDP in early stages, and then through grants provided by donors,
    including the Bank managed Rapid Social Response (RSR) Trust Fund (Section 2.2).

62. When the Program was approved, the VUP was in its earliest phase, managed by a five-member
    National Coordination Team under a VUP Program Manager in MINALOC which was fully
    supported by the DCDP for the first 2 years and later the RSR. The Rwanda Local Development
    Support Agency, established in November 2010, is now entrusted not only with the administration of
    the VUP, but with the coordination and consolidation of the GoR’s social protection programs more
    broadly. The RSR has continued to be the main source of funding key operational and technical
    assistance costs.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

63. During the ICR mission, GoR officials highlighted that the Bank intermediated their participation
    and presentations in different international conferences, including an International Conference on
    Public Works in Tanzania (June 2010), a Conference on Social Protection, Targeting and Funds Flow
    of VUP in Addis Ababa (June 2011), and a presentation on Social Protection and linking the VUP to
    Early Warning for climate disasters in the UK.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

64. The main forums for stakeholders’ engagement and coordination are the (i) the sector working group,
    (ii) budget support harmonization group and (iii) the joint sector reviews. All the policy actions
    supported under the program were discussed and supported by all stakeholders through the sector
    working group and budget support harmonization groups. Stakeholders valued the policy reform
    introduced under the program as an important catalyst for enhanced policy reform in the social
    protection sector and appreciated the Bank support in this regard. Stakeholder also valued the
    consistency displayed on donor coordination during the preparation of the Bank support operations
    and implementation of the Government reform program. More excerpts on stakeholder collaboration
    views are presented in Annex 3.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Program Rating: Negligible to Low

65. The GoR has achieved impressive results under the VUP and community health initiatives in the
    recent past (see Section 3.2), and, given its continued commitment to poverty reduction and provision
    of social services, it is difficult to imagine that it would not sustain, and continuously improve the
    effectiveness of these successful programs. These programs have been solidified, institutionalized in
    the RLDSF, institutional capacity for implementation has been strengthened despite some need for
    further improvements at the decentralized levels, monitoring and evaluation have been used to
    routinely follow-up and adjust implementation for increasingly effective results, and the framework
    for public financial management has improved greatly. The participatory planning and poverty
    assessment through the Ubudehe practice, itself builds stability into the priorities supported by the
    Program, and preempts risks of internal unrest due to unequal access to and distribution of resources.
    The GoR has established a record of prudent macroeconomic management, and although indirectly
    affected by the global financial crisis, has emerged from the crisis affected only through lower
    exports, foreign direct investment and tourism receipts. Although the GoR is maintaining a strict
                                                    20

    control on expenditures, it has so far protected priority programs, including those supported under the
    CLSG/C from potential reductions in total spending while it continues to pursue measures to increase
    revenues.

66. However, with GoR budget heavily reliant on grant financing, including financing of the Program, a
    main risk to development outcome continues to be possible decreases in budget support by Rwanda’s
    main partners, especially given the prolonged effects of the global financial and economic crisis, and
    recently, the donor cuts especially on budget support. Nevertheless, there is optimism that donors
    should continue to provide direct support to the sector, even in light of the risks related with donor
    financing cuts, especially if these programs can continue to show strong results.

67. The community health initiatives are grounded in the MOH’s programs. Similarly, the VUP is
    grounded in the GoR’s NSPS, and targeted poverty programs will be prioritized as an integral part of
    its EDPRS2 (Section 2.2). In addition to the need for counting upon continued grant financing, the
    greatest challenge to the VUP is precisely a consequence of the priority that the GoR has stated for
    expanding the VUP to all sectors of the country by 2017. Such a large expansion calls for extra
    resources, capacity, dissemination, staff and systems. As a Government official mentioned to the ICR
    Mission, because of the program’s decentralized implementation, in scaling up the VUP to new
    sectors, it is always a “new program? in those new sectors, with a need to sensitize local leaders,
    recruit and train technical assistants and other staff. Nevertheless, all Government officials have been
    adamant in emphasizing that they realize the capacity constraints that they will face and are willing to
    work incessantly to address them, but, more importantly, that the GoR has the drive to make its
    strategy a reality.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory

68. The Bank program of support to the GoR’s EDPRS, and especially to the Program constitutes an
    excellent example of engagement with a committed lower-income client that has poverty reduction
    and social equity at the center of its agenda, and with a continuous desire to search for better ways to
    achieve results. The preparation and approval of the CLSG/C was timely, thereby seizing the
    opportunity to engage with the GoR since the earliest phase in the development of the EDPRS, and
    then immediately support it technically and financially from its inception. The Bank preparation
    teams selected an appropriate instrument, established a realistic Results Framework, with PDO
    Indicators which the Program could reasonably be expected to impact throughout implementation,
    identified key risks, identified lessons of experience with and results from implementation in each
    subsequent phase, and assured coordination of Bank assistance under the Program with that provided
    under other Bank-financed operations and by donors. In this way, it was able to leverage needed
    technical assistance to keep the program on track.

69. For social protection, the Bank’s support succeeded in engaging the GoR in viewing social protection
    as an important priority for the country, and contributed to making the VUP the Government’s core
    social protection program that shaped its NSPS. During the ICR mission, several Government
    officials involved with the Program mentioned they “didn’t know that social protection was that
    special, demanding and unique?, and that they did not see the importance of some of the policy
    actions supported. They mentioned that while not initially understanding why several manuals, such
                                                   21

    as a Public Works Manual were required, they now, in retrospect, understood how the process of
    developing several manuals and procedures, with Bank support, was instrumental in building
    institutional capacity and ownership.
(b) Quality of Supervision
   Rating: Satisfactory

70. The Bank conducted periodic missions throughout the Program’s three-year implementation period,
    focused on progress towards results in accordance with the Results Framework, and on the provision
    of technical and implementation support in the practical aspects of its implementation, including in
    adjusting the Program during each of the subsequent operations in the series based on lessons and
    experience. The Bank maintained constant supervision through preparation of subsequent operations,
    with the flexibility to refine, adjust and adapt Prior Actions and specific programs based on
    implementation experience and findings of monitoring and evaluations, while maintaining the same
    Results Framework otherwise, only updating data on the basis of recent information. The Bank also
    coordinated routinely with all donors. During the ICR mission, GoR officials mentioned that
    although the Program was supported by a development policy operation, they felt that it was
    supervised as an investment project given the constant, hands-on technical support provided by the
    Bank, and the fact that preparation missions routinely made visits to the field, consulted with
    beneficiaries and incorporated findings in the refinement of subsequent stages. Supervision of the
    community health component was co-managed by another task manager, and the GoR commented
    that the two task managers worked well together, although there was less continuity in supervision of
    this component which made preparation of the community health component of subsequent phases
    more challenging.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

71. Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on similar ratings for Ensuring Quality at Entry
    and Quality of Supervision. This is justified in view of the strong partnership that has developed
    between the GoR, the donors and the Bank, that has led to a fundamental change in how the
    Government now views social protection, to the enrichment of the Program, and the enhancement of
    its capabilities for designing and delivering an ever expanding program.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
   Rating: Highly Satisfactory

72. Rwanda’s commitment to the Program was unwavering throughout (see Section 2.2). Despite fiscal
    constraints, budgetary allocations to the program were unaffected, and the GoR, from the highest
    level provided strong and unconditional support to the Program even before any donor financing was
    realized. Not only did the GoR implement the Program, as designed, it internalized the Program and
    used experience to incorporate and institutionalize it in its future priorities. Most noteworthy were
    the GoR’s strong commitment to areas that were complementary to Program implementation
    throughout (e.g., public financial management, donor coordination, grievances mechanisms to
    promote transparency and accountability), that provided a strong enabling environment for
    implementation, its sustained budgetary commitment despite fiscal constraints and its strong results-
    based culture, based on an incessant thirst for monitoring and evaluation to guide continuous
    improvements.
                                                    22

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Highly Satisfactory

73. The Program’s main implementing agencies were MINALOC and the MOH. Implementation of the
    VUP was initially the responsibility of a small VUP Coordination Team in MINALOC. The core
    group that started the VUP has since been structured and mainstreamed into the RLDSF on a
    competitive basis which ensures stability in staffing since then. Now, the VUP has been
    institutionalized in RLDC (Section 4), in an effort to harmonize and mainstream social protections
    programs, and reduce administrative costs. The VUP Team, and later RLDSF and the MOH worked
    well with the Bank, sought technical advice and support, and ensured the appropriate monitoring and
    accounting of resources under their respective programs.

74. The Government teams have been able to work with international technical assistance to conduct
    operational and process reviews that were successful in identifying main policy and program design
    areas for refinements. The teams were successful in taking forward implementation of
    recommendations. The gradual and sustained scale-up of implementation of the VUP and the fact that
    the program has been institutionalized is testimony to satisfactory performance by the implementing
    agency. At the same time, the fact that the reforms supported under the community health have been
    mainstreamed into the ministry of health and local government budgetary plans reflects satisfactory
    performance by the implementing teams both the ministry and local government levels.

75. It is however important to mention that capacity enhancement remains an important challenge that the
    RLDSF and Ministry of Health have to cope with continuously. Staff turnover remains high,
    management of technical assistance needs significant improvements, and Government is hopeful for
    improvements in these areas through implementation of sector capacity building plans developed in
    2012 and earlier.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
   Rating: Highly Satisfactory

76. Overall Borrower Performance is rated Highly Satisfactory, based on ratings for Government
    Performance and Implementing Agencies’ Performance.

6. Lessons Learned
77. Targeting is a key element of implementing successful social protection interventions. Targeting
    is a learning-by-doing process and can both draw from unique community-based systems, like the
    Ubudehe system in Rwanda, while complementing them with more scientific systems like the proxy-
    means testing for more efficiency in reaching intended beneficiaries, which was shown in other
    countries. Assessments of the Ubudehe system indicate that it was successful in identifying poor
    households, but also showed that there was room for improvement. Filtering the results of the
    Ubudehe system by the land possession criteria seemed at face value to be an effective way of yet
    enhancing the targeting. However, implementation revealed that this criterion was causing distortions
    since land productivity and value vary from one area to the other, and some of the poor population
    rent land. It will be imperative that further targeting reviews are done to the VUP and other key social
    protection programs, particularly, given that the most recent household survey (February 2012) shows
    that there is more room for improving targeting effectiveness. Such reviews should be encouraged as
    part of implementation both at the geographical and household levels and results used to make design
    improvements in the programs.
                                                    23

78. Harmonization and alignment of donor and GoR interventions reduce transaction costs for the
    GoR and translate into better programmatic interventions. The programmatic approach to the
    VUP support by donors and GoR facilitated strong results on the ground. While this approach
    presents significant donor coordination demands and challenges, results proved beneficial to all
    stakeholders and allowed timely and quality response to GoR demands as program implementation
    expanded.

79. Timing of Bank support, especially in a program with far-reaching impacts, to coincide with
    Bank’s CAS and the inception of a Government program, can be critical. The Bank’s
    involvement with the Program since its planning stages allowed for a partnership in its design and
    early implementation. Phased support over time allowed for minor adjustments to the subsequent
    operations, based on implementation experience and early results, to ensure maximum impact of the
    Program’s policies and actions.

80. The existence of decentralized governance and management structures highly facilitates
    successful implementation of community-targeted social protection reforms. This is particularly
    true when related targeting systems draw on community-driven development (CDD). Under the VUP,
    the lowest level of administration below Districts has played a significant role in the entire
    implementation process. While decentralized structures present capacity challenges, use of
    decentralized systems helps to identify those capacity challenges and to ensure proper follow-ups in
    addressing them. Generally, the case of VUP shows that systems and administrations that are closer
    to the people help facilitate easier provision of basic services.

81. Parallel technical assistance support to a development policy lending (DPL) operation is key to
    successful reforms. The DCDP’s support provided at the sector level played a key role in allowing
    the VUP to take off and capture lessons learnt. While agreeing on policy reforms is important,
    without this type of support it would have been difficult for the VUP to achieve results. The TA
    support proved even more important to a sectoral DPO given that this kind of DPO demands more
    detailed and deepened policy dialogue and thus presents need for more intense technical support.
    However, equally important is the need for Government to take actions that facilitate skills transfers,
    including for managing TA that will continue to be used into the foreseeable future. Staff turnover
    and some times, lack of a solid capacity enhancement programs constrained continuity in short term
    when TA was absent.

82. Continuous systems analysis and taking corrective action should be part and parcel of the
    implementation process. Initial implementation was significantly hampered by delays in processing
    sub-projects for public works through community and local government procurement systems, as well
    as by inefficiencies both in delivery of direct support to beneficiaries and in fiscal relations between
    the central and local governments. Preliminary but unsystematic systems analyses helped to iron out
    some of the delays and inefficiencies in payments systems, fiscal transfers and the processing of
    public works sub-projects. Systematic assessment of administrative interactions between central and
    local governments levels and development of action plans to address related challenges could further
    increase the efficiency of the program implementation.

83. Incentives matter. There is a growing body of empirical evidence of the use of incentives to reward
    health service provides for specific types of results and to motivate individuals for health-related
    behaviors. The experiences in the health sector have been led to a large extent by findings of the
    impact evaluation of the PBF in Rwanda. These finding follow the experiences with conditional cash
    transfers, and confirm that individuals (whether it is mothers, pregnant women or service providers)
    respond to incentives and that these incentive-effects can be used to yield sustainable health results.
                                                   24

84. Valuable lessons can be learned from a process evaluation of pilot implementation. A process
    evaluation was conducted of the pilot of the incentive strategy in 30 VUP Sectors. The findings
    yielded important lessons in several areas, and were applied when planning the scaling up to 150
    Sectors, including: (1) the process of implementing the demand-side incentives; (2) the effectiveness
    of the training of Steering Committee staff in design of Community PBF; (3) effectiveness of the
    publicizing the program to communities; (4) the flow of funds to health centers and quantification of
    funds allocated to health centers; (5) the procurement system of in-kind incentives, and (6) the
    experience with implementing the verification mechanisms.

85. Investing in collaboration with a national research team not only strengthens in-country
    capacity in this technical area, but also contributes greatly to the successful implementation,
    management and ownership of an evaluation. A team from the National University of Rwanda
    School of Public Health was competitively selected in 2009 to provide in-country technical support
    on the hands-on participation in design and implementation of the evaluation (development of the
    impact evaluation concept note, the questionnaires, and training of enumerators with the survey firm
    to ensure quality). In addition, the national research team served as a key focal point between the
    Bank’s task team and the MoH counterparts in order to advise on midcourse corrections, trouble
    shoot during data collection, and ensure the evaluation responded to the key policy questions of the
    MoH. By establishing a key local research partner, the Bank task team was able to develop and
    ensure local ownership of the study and commitment to the quality of data collection.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

86. The borrower’s summary assessment was provided (see Annex 4) and provides useful feedback on
    achievements of the reforms implemented under the program. In general, the borrower agrees with
    the relevance of the program to the Government reform agenda in social protection and health. In
    addition, the assessment reveals that the Borrower is highly satisfied with the achievements of the
    program as well as sustained Bank engagement in the sector. Please refer to Annex 4 for more details.

Annex 2. Beneficiary Survey Results
Two recent assessments are summarized below: (i) Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP) Intermediate
Assessment (July 2012) and (ii) Rapid Assessment of VUP 2020 Program (June 2010):
1. Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP) Intermediate Assessment 2008-2011
In July 2012, RLDSF commissioned an independent firm, IMANZI Ltd, to undertake an assessment of the VUP
program for the period 2008-2011.
Below follows a summary of the methodology used and main findings:
Summary of Methodology Used
The assessment covered 180 villages in 90 sectors in all (30) districts of the country. The study has used both
qualitative and quantitative methods for understanding the impacts and outcomes. It covered 2,700 households,
included 180 focus group discussions, and 360 interviews with key informants in both state and field levels. The
assessment reviewed VUP in 90 sectors based on four key dimensions – demographic, economic, social, and
institutional. There are two levels of change measured in the impact assessment study - primary (ultimate impact)
and intermediate (outcomes and results). The assessment drew its conclusions based on five evaluation criteria:
Relevance, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Impact and Sustainability.
Findings and Recommendations
The graduation rate of poor beneficiaries shows a 17% reduction in the lowest category of Ubudehe. This is a
laudable achievement. Promoting women’s economic empowerment through the three components translates into a
positive example set for communities. Furthermore, the use of community mechanisms throughout the process
promotes solidarity, a key component for social protection.
Analysis of the profile of sample areas and households suggest that a large proportion of villages are inaccessible
and are distant from markets. A large proportion of the households are either landless, and 80% are marginal
farmers. 40% of the VUP beneficiary households are female-headed. The area and socio-economic profile shows
that more than half of the households are categorized into vulnerable groups, under the 3rd Ubudehe category.
Public Works
In 2008, Public works had 18,304 beneficiary households on 38 projects, growing to 70,000 beneficiary households
on 226 projects by June 2011. 75% of participants stated that the quality of PW is good, in particular because
community-based elected committees are responsible for implementation and oversight. However, 29% of
beneficiaries stated that it takes them more than 1 hour to reach the worksite of the project and 94.4% of PW
beneficiaries require a salary increase to facilitate the graduation of beneficiaries from this programme. This
assessment recommends that project prioritization be more participatory and directly involve beneficiaries.
Direct Support
During the January-June 2009 mini-budget year, transfers were made to 6,850 households, increasing to 9,692
households during the 2009/10 financial year. 53% of households receiving DS were female-headed. 85.6% of DS
beneficiaries reported that they use the funds to purchase food, 73% to purchase clothes, 63.1% to purchase animals
and 26.6% use the funds for school fees for their children or relatives. 72.9% of beneficiaries stated that the transfers
arrive on time, suggesting that there is still a significant challenge in the transfer of funds to DS beneficiaries. Direct
Support should consider methods to reduce delays in receiving transfers, such as shortening the administrative chain
or adopting the use of mobile money.
Financial Services
The largest proportion of loans given were individual loans (69%) followed by group loans (30%) and finally
cooperative loans (1%). The average loan amount taken by a beneficiary was RwF 77, 480. The most common types
of income generating projects financed to date are farming, livestock and agricultural wholesale/trade. Other types
of projects include non-agricultural trade, handicraft, tailoring and petty-trade.
Initially, the requirement to repay the loan was not very clear to recipients and many beneficiaries treated the loans
as grants. As a result of this, monitoring mechanisms have been put in place. The average repayment rate of 54%
presents a particularly dangerous shortfall, given that it accounts for more than a quarter of VUP’s budget. A revised
                                                         28

approach to the FS component is required in order to be effective. Specifically, the addition of a Village Savings and
Loan component into the Financial Services portfolio is recommended.
Other key recommendations focus on the need for the distribution of funds per sector to be based on an assessment
of need and relevant information should be stored in a central system, in particular to support monitoring and
evaluation of the Programme. In terms of VUP Management, the RLDSF should budget for one Programme
Manager and one Financial Manager per sector. There are challenges related to monitoring the implementation of
activities, and the lack of a standard reporting format for sectors. Community sensitization and ownership should be
prioritized moving forward to enhance ownership and participation in VUP. VUP must coordinate better with other
national and international actors working to reduce poverty to prevent duplication and enhance effectiveness.
Overall the VUP was shown to have resulted in some important achievements, including the graduation of the
poorest category of beneficiaries, the use of a community-based selection method and a largely positive review of
the Programme by beneficiaries. The study noted key challenges in monitoring and evaluation and in managing the
implementation of the Program, leading to delays in transfers of funds and challenges with accountability,
particularly in the Financial Services component, and in some cases in the selection of beneficiaries at the
community level.
2. Rapid Assessment of VUP 2020 Umurenge program
In June 2012, UNICEF commissioned on behalf of MINALOC an independent firm, KIMETRICA Ltd, to undertake
a rapid assessment of the VUP program for the period 2008-2011.
Below follows a summary of the methodology and main findings:
Summary of Methodology Used
This rapid assessment addressed the DS and PW components of the VUP pilot programme in 30 pilot areas. The
assessment results were intended to inform the Government on project scale-up and help to define the M&E
framework and impact evaluation questions. The study was not meant to provide a definitive answer on impact; but
rather to provide some feedback on programme success and to illuminate possible issues that may hinder scale up.
The study involved two research methods:
    •    Quantitative Structured Household Questionnaires of beneficiaries
    •    Qualitative Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries
The structured household questionnaire was used during interviews with 489 VUP beneficiaries. A control group
was not included in the survey because of limited resources. Moreover, the objective of this rapid assessment is to
review to date programme performance and community perceptions on programme value, highlighting any critical
issues which may impede scale-up.
Focus group discussions were undertaken at the village level. In each selected village, enumerators conducted four
meetings: (i) One group of women beneficiaries; (ii) One group of men beneficiaries; (iii) A group of women non
VUP beneficiaries; and (iv) A group of men non VUP beneficiaries. The groups were kept relatively small (5-8
people), allowing everyone to participate in discussions.
Findings
The assessment indicated that overall perception of the VUP program were consistently positive among
beneficiaries. Generally, beneficiaries reported a positive impact by the VUP program.
VUP was found to help households become eligible for other GoR programs, such as Savings and Credit
Cooperative (SACCO) and the health scheme. Fifty-five percent of households reported saving a portion of their
VUP benefit; the average amount saved is RwF 11,272.70. Fifty-four percent of VUP beneficiaries reported
spending (or intend on spending) on food commodities. Beneficiaries also reported using funds to purchase
productive assets such as livestock (24.5 percent), health products (19.9 percent), farm inputs (18.3 percent) and
education (13.1 percent).
However some variations in the PW wage rates were noted. Sixty-one percent of PW beneficiary households
reported that the PW wage rate was higher than the market rate for similar non-VUP supported job, while 26.1
percent reported that this wage was lower. The average daily public works wage was 944.6 RWF. There was some
indication of ‘crowding out’ other gainful employment although it is unclear what this ‘other work’ involves. Top

three activities mentioned by VUP public works participants on work foregone in favor of VUP were Labor on own
farm (30.5 percent), childcare (9.2 percent) and other paid work (5.7 percent). About 18 percent of household
members reported participating in the VUP public works program of which 60 percent indicated working on a VUP
project in the past month. The average number of days worked is 11.2 days but with variations at provincial levels.
However during the focus group discussions there was "a consistent complaint that the wage rate is not high
enough?.

Annex 3. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
The CLSG/C series benefited from continuous interaction with donor partners to ensure close collaboration and
consultation of the proposed interventions with the donors involved in these critical sectors and to ensure ownership
in the program’s outcomes, alignment of other stakeholders’ objectives, and the provision of complementary
interventions. Over the course of the CLSG series, the dialogue and trust amongst donors and between donors and
Government was strengthened.
The CLSG/C series also drew from a strengthened harmonized budget support framework in Rwanda, supported by
the Bank’s first PRSG series, which originally included five development partners: Africa Development Bank
(AfDB), Department for International Development (DFID), European Commission (EC), Germany, and the World
Bank.
At the time of the first CLSG operation, there was relatively little systematic policy development in the area of
social protection while the health sector policy dialogue was somewhat more advanced. Due to emerging social
protection sector in Rwanda, numerous programs where managed and implemented by various line ministries, some
with donor assistance but the programs and policies remained scattered and uncoordinated. A diverse range of civil
society activities also existed. For social protection in particular, data on these activities, if available, were often
non-comparable.
Since the inception of the CLSG-1, both the health and social protection policy framework has evolved with
significant, regular interaction and feedback from donor partners and bilateral donors (mainly WB, UNDP, WFP,
UNICEF, DFID, GTZ, EC, Netherlands). For example, one of the most significant policy developments under
CLSG series included the Government’s development of a comprehensive National Social Protection Strategy
(NSPS), which was approved by Cabinet in January 2011 to build coherence and complementarities among various
programs that contribute to social protection including the VUP.
There are several established mechanism for dialogue with development partners and other relevant stakeholders
and the Government in Rwanda. Two key mechanisms include (i) the Budget Support Harmonization Group and (ii)
the Sector Working Groups.
Budget Support Harmonization Group: In September 2008 all budget support donors and Government signed a
Memorandum of Understanding governing the provision of direct budget support in the implementation of
Rwanda’s EDPRS. The MoU, which replaced the 2003 Partnership Framework, outlined monitoring and
performance management responsibilities and guidelines. Under this MoU, monitoring and performance
management was to be undertaken according to the Harmonization Calendar in the context of three complementary
frameworks: (i) Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF), which summarizes GoR’s performance in
the implementation of the EDPRS; (ii) Donor Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF), which summarizes
donor performance in adhering to the various commitments related to the aid effectiveness agenda; and (iii) Joint
Governance Assessment (JGA), which will be revised and agreed upon annually by GoR and the development
partners, which summarizes GoR’s performance in the implementation of governance reforms.
The Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG) brings together GoR and budget support donors relating to the
provision of budget support for the implementation of the EDPRS and its related flagship programs. 19 The dialogue
in the bi-annual Joint Budget Support Reviews (JBSR) is based on the joint assessment of progress in EDPRS
implementation, including governance indicators and PFM reform, using the CPAF as the single framework. In line
with this MoU, the CLSG/C series was fully aligned with the CPAF unless otherwise agreed with development
partners and donors and explicitly noted in the Government’s Letter of Development Policy. For example, under
CLSG-1, one health indicator drew from the agreed health sector matrix following mutual agreement. The alignment
to CPAF and any exemptions to this framework were achieved through ongoing, close collaboration with
Government and other budget support donors.
Sector Working Groups: At the outset of the CLSG-1, the Social Protection sector, supported by the Government
and development partners’ interventions, existed but was not fully operational and coordinated. The sector was
scattered but the dialogue had begun to define a social protection framework around commonly agreed objectives


19
   Membership of the BSHG in a given year is restricted to partners contributing a minimum of US$10 million of budget support
(general or sectoral) per year.
                                                             31

and priorities. Also, the social protection framework had inadequate focus on measuring results and impact. With the
VUP program emerging as a key flagship program under the EDPRS and with commitments to the program through
the CLSG series, the sector was able to mobilize both financial and technical support around clearer common
objectives and priorities. Today, and with support from the Support to Social Protection System series - which builds
on the CLSG series in social protection - the social protection working groups is well-coordinated around the new
NSPS, a common results framework and with technical committees that provides input on all relevant policy issues
in the sector. This increased harmonization in policy dialogue and common vision helped the sector strengthen its
funding mechanism for the sector, with DFID, UNICEF, EU and SIDA emerging as key development partners
alongside the World Bank.
Similarly in the health sector, the sector working group was strengthened. The sector working group was already
operational with clear objectives at the outset of CLSG-1 and an MOU between Government and partners was
signed to introduce a SWAp process and a sector-specific policy framework and outcome indicators were jointly
agreed to govern “sector budget support? financed by several donors. In the policy areas covered by the CLSG, the
Bank worked closely with UNICEF and USAID in supporting the GoR’s community health policy reforms, with
particular focus on results-based financing innovations.
Overall, coordination of partners through sector working groups includes annual joint sector reviews, centered on
assessing progress towards the EDPRS and sector strategy objectives, and sector-specific input into the Common
Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) and beyond.
Sector Financing: The increased coordination among development partners over the course of the CLSG/C series
around improved policy dialogue and technical input from Bank and donors has also allowed development partners
to support the Government financially in an increasingly coordinated manner. Below follows an overview of the
overall sector support and complementary technical assistance that has complemented the financial support of the
social protection and health sectors under CLSG/C series.
DFID announced a firm commitment to provide support of approximately $US31.8 million 20 (£19.7 million) to the
VUP program over four years (2009-2012) covering the remaining EDPRS period. This, was coupled with
additional funding from EC of approximately $US 14.5 million 21 (€10 million) over a 2-year period (starting with
fiscal year 2011-12) and provided additional financing to facilitate implementation of the VUP. In addition,
UNICEF provided computers for Sector staff and there was an agreement for UNICEF to fund a consultant to work
on the beneficiary training and sensitization component of the VUP. UNICEF also undertook a rapid assessment of
the VUP program in ten Sectors, in addition to providing technical assistance to ensure that the interests of orphans,
vulnerable children (OVCs) and women are considered under the VUP.
In the health sector, several donors provided general budget support while four partners provided sector-specific
budget support. In the health sector, this included AfdB, Belgium, DFID, and Germany. The CLSG/C series was co-
financed by a multi-donor trust fund, the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund 22 following a competitive process
that awarded Rwanda a grant to finance the community health reforms with particular focus on results-based
financing and impact evaluation. 23 Several other partners financed on- and off-budget support to the community
health policies supported by the CLSG/C, in particular the Global Fund, UNICEF, and USAID.

   An estimated $4 million has been allocated by the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund which, together with the IDA grant of
$6 million, would bring the CLSG-1 operation to US$ 10 million.
23
   This is part of a global initiative in nine countries that is being supported by the multi-donor financed Health Results
Innovation Trust Fund. Significant technical assistance for the impact evaluation of the Community PBF is financed by an
additional US$1 million from the trust fund over the three-year period of the CLSG series.

            Dear Mr. Zutt,


            Re: Community Living Standards Grant/Credit Series (CLSG/C 1-3): Summary
            Government
                Assessment on Project Completion (Borrower's ICR)


            On behalf of the Government of Rwanda, I am pleased to transmit the Community Living
            Standards Grant/Credit Series (CLSG/C 1-3): Summary Government Assessment on Project
            Completion (Borrower's ICR):

            1. After the war and Genocide in 1994, the Government of the Republic of Rwanda has
               initiated several strategies and policies to promote peace, national reconciliation and
               poverty reduction. These policies and strategies have included those, which are targeted
               to the poor and vulnerable segments of the Rwandan population through specific
               programs. The World Bank funded Community Living Standards Grant/Credit was one of
               such Bank and donor programs that have played an important role in complementing and
               accompanying the Government reforms.

            2. At the time of preparations of the First Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG-1 ),
               Rwanda was one of the most densely populated countries, and among the poorest, despite
               significant progress in the previous decade. National household surveys had shown that
               the population classified as poor had declined from 60 percent in 2000-01 to 57 percent in
               2005-06. Nevertheless, due to rapid population growth the estimated number of people
               living in poverty had increased from 4.8 million to 5.4 million during these same periods.
               Over 90 percent of the poor were concentrated in rural areas, where poverty remained
               pervasive and deep.
                                                       33



                                                     -2-


    In addition, Government had recognized that the impressive growth levels ranging over
    an average of 6% annually had attracted minimal poverty reduction rates of only 4
    percentage points during the period 2002 to 2006, implying low levels of poverty
    reduction efficiency.

3. To address the deep challenges facing the country and to tackle the pervasive poverty in
   the country, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) had adopted its Economic Development
   and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for 2008-12 that built on strong achievements
   in human capital development and promoted three flagship programs to accelerate
   growth, including, encouraging growth that created jobs and increased exports, strengthen
   governance, and introduce the Vision 2020 Umurenge 1 Program (VUP) focused on
   initiating interventions targeted at the most poor Rwandans. The VUP was expected to
   accelerate poverty reduction "by promoting pro-poor components of the national growth
   agenda....by releasing the productive capacity of the poor in rural areas through a
   combination of public works, credit packages and direct support". 2

4. To support the Government's ambitious poverty agenda and to continue the momentum
   of achievements in human capital development achieved to date, the Government
   requested the World Bank's support in various areas, including health and social
   protection, the latter focused essentially on reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing
   resilience for the extremely poor segments of the population.

5. At the time of the first CLSG 1, the social protection sector was scattered and lagged
   behind other sectors in terms of sector-specific coordination; clear development
   objectives and a common vision; and capacity and knowledge of best practice
   components of an effective social protection system. The sector lacked a common
   strategy but the Government had made a clear statement to the sector through its
   endorsement of the VUP as a flagship program under its EDPRS.

6. At the time, the health sector had made significant strides toward better coordination and
   - with support from the World Bank under the PRSG series - had seen significant
   achievement in some key health areas through targeted interventions. However, Rwanda's
   progress toward key MDGs, including child mortality and maternal mortality, was uneven
   and further efforts were needed to ensure continued momentum in addressing challenges
   in human development. One of the innovative health interventions that had been
   introduced in Rwanda was the 'performance-based financing' program that had shown
   promising results by linking service providers to performance-based indicators. But
   further efforts were needed to accelerate the progress. With technical support from the
   World Bank, the Government had therefore put together an innovative proposal for
   demand-side performance-based financing and had been granted a $12 million from the
   Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. The CLSG/C series now became an important
   instrument for which this funding in the health sector could be clearly linked with other
   community-initiatives, including the VUP and the broader EDPRS objectives.



I GoR progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized levels of the
administration---Province, District, Sector (Umurenge), Cell (Akagan) and Village (Umudugudu). Of these, the
last three are subordinate tiers of the district governments. The VUP was to be implemented through this newly
restructure decentralized local government system.

7. To introduce ambitious and innovative programming in the country as set forth in the
   VUP and to reach progress toward key MDGs, the Government needed both financing
   and technical assistance. The CLSG series provided by the World Bank therefore became
   the main vehicle for guiding the Government in these areas and lay the groundwork for a
   stronger strategic, institutional and financial framework in the area of social protection
   and health.

8. The overall Program Development Objective of the CLSG/C series was to support the
   Government of Rwanda's social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce
   extreme poverty, initially in 30 VUP pilot Sectors, and to expand access to high-impact
   health, nutrition and population interventions at the community level. 3 Specifically, the
   CLSG supported introduction of the cash transfer and public works policy reforms that
   adhered to internal good practice and to complement these with initiatives on needs based
   budgeting, appeals and complaints mechanism that promoted transparency and
   accountability in the VUP. In addition, the CLSG supported health policies and strategies
   to expand poor households' access at the community level to selected reproductive,
   maternal and child interventions. The achievements have been impressive in both sectors
   and the Government of Rwanda is fully satisfied with the results on the ground.


  I.     ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES WHICH REMAIN

9. The Government social protection agenda has evolved from a host of fragmented projects
   and programs to an increasingly coordinated sector with significant and increasing
   government financing over the last five years. At the same time, the community health
   interventions have been intensified in a more programmed and informed way. Despite the
   Government leadership, current results in the policy areas mentioned and the visible
   results on the ground have been made possible by the development partners' support. The
   Bank funded CLSG/C series coupled with the technical assistance and advice that
   accompanied the operations played an important role. Results achieved with the Bank
   support and the remaining challenges are summarized in the paragraphs which follow.

10. The CLSG/F series of operations have been instrumental in introducing the important
    institutional and policy design actions to strengthen the VUP implementation, mainly
    focused on the cash transfer and public works interventions, which have resulted in
    improvements in the VUP redesign drawing on the lessons from implementation.
    Implementation of recommendations from the lessons have not only facilitated the
    gradual but steady scale-up of the VUP that has happened over the last 4 years, but also
    shaped the development of the Rwanda's first National Social Protection Strategy that
    was adopted by the Cabinet on January 19, 2011.

11. Specifically, the policy reforms under the VUP included the adoption of a non-
    distortionary wage policy for public works, direct payment of workers and beneficiaries
    without intermediaries, and determination of direct support benefits to poor families with
    no adult labor based on the household as a unit for the first in the series of operations.



3 "lligh-impact" interventions are those that have had high impact on reducing disease burden in developing
countries. Examples include: immunization, use of insecticide-treated bed-nets (!TN), integrated management
of childhood illnesses, pre- and postnatal care etc.

                                              -4-



   Under CLSG-2, policy reforms included shifting to voluntary savings, and a process for
   determining eligibility that is clear and transparent to all potential recipients and non-
   recipients because it make program policy and procedures widely known and selection
   outcomes publicly available. The final and third series supported policy reforms on
   establishing and operating an appeals and complaints mechanism to strengthen public
   confidence in the Ubudehe selection process, developing and adopting a VUP budget
   allocation policy that supports a 20-30-50 percent split between direct support, financial
   services and public works programs, while allowing for variations across Sectors
   depending on needs, and developing a new targeting policy for beneficiaries of the
   Ubudehe program so that it remains consistent with the objectives of VUP and reducing
   potential inclusion and exclusion errors.

12. In a nutshell, the above policy reforms have ensured that after its introduction, the VUP
    has become aligned to international good practice and embraced widely acceptable
    principles, which have greatly informed its ambitious scale-up and facilitated access to
    the program by an increasing number of extremely poor households. Since inception from
    scratch in 2008, VUP is currently implemented in 43% (cash transfers) and 36% (public
    works and micro credits) of Rwanda's 416 geographical sectors, with a combined
    population coverage of about 0.5 million people (over 110 households).


13. In the health sector, the CLSG/F successfully introduced implementation of specific
    community level health reforms, which have enabled expanded access to selected
    reproductive, maternal and child health interventions by the poor households.
    Specifically, there is clear evidence of evolution over the series, from policy approval of
    concept to detailed program design and piloting, refinement and implementation of
    Community performance based financing. This has led to other institutional policy
    actions which removal of user fees for long-term family planning methods; increased
    budget spent on results-based financing principles, improved planning and budgeting for
    community health (adoption of a Community Health Policy; approval of an annual
    implementation plan and budgeting for community health as reflected in the annual
    MTEF), the design and adoption of the Community Performance-based Financing
    program (Community PBF) and development of related institutional mechanisms that
    provide demand-side incentives targeting women and complementary supply-side
    incentives targeting Community Health Workers with the overall goal of stimulating
    demand for contraceptive use, pre-and post-natal care and institutional deliveries. A
    complementary important achievement under the health sector has been introduction of a
    rigorous evaluation of the impact of these community health reforms whose baseline
    survey was already implemented and an end-line survey is planned soon.

14. The above said, a number of challenges still remain. Most of them are second generation
    challenges prompted by current achievements in both sectors:

       •   The Government is eager to build a sustainable social protection system capable
           of delivering transfer benefits to the extremely poor households in an effective and
           efficient manner. Building such a system requires putting in a place a credible
           management information system that is capable of producing adequate
           information to underpin robust monitoring and evaluation exercises for the main
           social protection programs and ultimately the sector.

                                            - 5-


           Although the Government has already undertaken a systems requirements
           assessment and designed the MIS, an important step to develop and install the
           MIS is urgently needed.

       •   The coverage of the poor by the social protection programs is still low. The main
           means tested program, the VUP, remains below 50% geographical coverage,
           which implies an urgent need to increase coverage of the extremely poor. The
           uptake levels for the public works programs is also low implying that some of the
           eligible poor are not necessarily benefitting from the intended programs.

       •   The community health interventions introduced under the CLSG/F series need to
           be expanded country wide. Although measures were introduced to mainstream
           them into the government plans and budgets, there may be gaps in terms of
           financing and technical assistance to fully maximize benefits for the poor at the
           community level. Despite, sustainability of the community health system will
           need more investment at the community level both in faci lities and community
           workers cooperatives.


 II.   CONCLUSION

15. The Government of Rwanda is highly satisfied with results achieved under the CLSG/F
    operations and the progress with its predecessor Support to the Social Protection System
    series of operations. We are eager to sustain investments in social protection and
    community health for the poor and to expand current initiatives to reach majority of the
    target segments of the Rwanda population. We thus commend the CLSG series and are
    happy that the work initiated by the reforms supported by the operation has been
    expanded. We look forward to continued collaboration with the Bank to ensure
    sustainability.
