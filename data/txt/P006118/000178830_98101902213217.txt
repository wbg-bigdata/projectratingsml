REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC CF BOLIVIA FOR A
MINING CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submlt the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of US.36.2
million on standard IDA terms, to help finance a project consisting of a
Credit Program for the development and expansion of private mediam-size
mines, a National Survey of Snall Mines, and a Technical Assistance Program
for the mining sector. Of the credit proceeds US$5-o miillion would be relent
to Banco Industrial S.A. (BISA) with interest at no less than 7-1/4 percent
per annum; US$850,000 would be made available to the Servicio Geologico de
Bolivia (GEOBOL) for the National Survey of Small Mines, and US$350,000 to
the Ministry of l4ining and Metallurgy in support of a Technical Assistance
Program for the mining sector.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "C3urrent Economic Position and
Prospects of 2olivia" (WH-213a, dated November 9, 1972) was distributed
to the Excecutive Directors on November 20, 1972 (R72-254). Subsequent
developments were reviewed by an economic mission in Mlarch 1973.  A sum-
mary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Bolivia is the poorest country in South America.  The majority
of its population is engaged in traditional agriculture; only a small part
of the labor force partuicipates in salaried activities in mining, petro-
leum and commaercial agriculture. The infrastructure is still very primi-
tive and the road and rail networks cover only a fraction of the country.
The combination of strong traditional social ties within the Indian com-
munities and the economic obstacles to the development of a national
market have perpetuated the demographic concentration on the Altiplano,
a region rich in minerals but with low agricultural potential. As a
result, about two-thirds of Bolivia's population live  a physically,
culturally and economically isolated existence in one of the world's
most inhospitable regions: the Altiplano, a barren, windswept and dry
plateau perched at 10 - 15 thousand feet between the Andes' Western
Cordillera and the Cordillera Real.
4.        GNP per capita reached US$180 in 1970, but this figure hides
the true dimension of Bolivia's poverty: while the richest 20 percent
of the population enjoy a per capita income of around US.500 the per
capita income of the remaining 80 percent is about US$100,  providing for
a standard of living similar to that of the rural inhabitants of Africa
or Asia. Poverty is reflected in inadequate nutrition levels, high in-
fant mortality and illiteracy -- about 60 percent of the population is
illiterate.



-2-
The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual economic
stzmctre  which had characterized Bolivia s economy since colonial times.
-t iught to deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic
base& Thnis objective was only partially achieved. Despite the social
ach-iaverants in eradicating feudal relations, distributing the land and
eliminating obstacles to social mobility, the power vacuum left by the
destutuction of the oligarchy led to political instability. In the
economic sphere, the agrarian reform and the nationalization of large
Lanes were followed by declines in agricultural, mining and manufacturing
production. GDP declined in the 1950's and did not recover to its pre-
1952 level until 1961. During the subsequent decade, output increased
steadily at an average annual rate of around 5 percent, providing for
average annual per capita income increases of 2.5 percent. As a result,
GNP per capita which had fallen by 24 percent in the 1952-60 period had
recovered, by 1970, to the 1952 level and was better distributed.
6.        Ln 1971, the momentum of economic growth was again lost because of
political instability and deteriorating public finances. Private investment
fell and public investment was unable to fill the shortfall due to lack of
financial resources. The deterioration of public finances reflected a
structural flaw in the economy.  Since the expropriations of 1952, Bolivia's
public sector became proportionately one of the largest in South America and
a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment of the population. With the
scarcity of employment opportunities in the private sector, pressures to
expand the ranks of public servants proved difficult to resist. Increased
expenditures on wages and salaries, combined ivith a weak tax system, left few
resoarces for investment. Moreover, the inability of the public sector to
generate cdequate savings limited its capacity to utilize external assistance.
The gravity of the situation was accentuated as a result of increased hiring
of personnel and earnings' increases in the public sector.
Pecent Developments and Prosects
7.        Bolivia s growth prospects have been enhanced by recent economic
policies. Cn coming to power in 1971, President Eanzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the uneigloyed and to set the basis for investment growth.
This need was faced in the context of a sharp deterioration in Bolivia's
terms of trade which declined by about 20 percent in 1971. In late 1971,
the Government put into effect an "Eaergency Program" aimed at creating
jobs on public works. To establish a more favorable climate for private
investment, new laws offering guarantees and incentives to private investors
were promulgated; in addition, the Government settled claims arising from
earlier nationalizations. At the same time, the Government improved public
administration, and the pricing policies of some public undertakings.
These policies were successful in increasing private investment and in
bolstering the rate of growth to 7 percent in 1972. They also resulted,
however, in a large budgetary deficit and losses of international reserves.



To         t-ac folrf.fei-. c.nrha,ge 9psition and improve the bud-
get.ary situation., the Go1Fern.ument introduced in October 1972 a "'Stabiliza-
tion and DSVelOn aent' Tn lar"   ae Flan included a devaluation of the peso
fromr $bIl.88 tc $b23C pa-; US dollar; taxes on exports, a general wage
increase of $bl35 uer rionth, to be followed by a one-year wage freeze and
a freeze on residentiai rents. WIile the Plan's results have not been as
successful as eavisaged, positive results have been achieved.  The growth
of GDP in 19713 is expected to be 7 percent. Private investment and savings
appear t5o bQ growng, Public i._ estment? which was 10 percent higher in
1972 than in the precedirg year, is expected to fuirther increase in 19730
Tbhe Government succeeded in attracting inflows of capital from bilateral
and international lenders.  Dtring the eight months after the devaluation,
the balance of payments benefited from the increased inflow of foreign
assistance and fror improved export prices. However, these positive
achievements havre to be weighed against the shortcomings of fiscal policsy
the Government hs not reached the objective to increase revenues as
envisaged. -tile it maraged to increase its command over resources at
the expense of the higher-paid wage earners, leaving the lower-paid wage
earners and the iural noor somewnhat better off than before, much of the
devaluatiorn benefits were captured by Bolivia's exporters. These shifits
in inecome, combined with an expansionary monetary policy, produced excess
liquidity and led to price inflation.  This situation threatened to reduce
t;he benefits of the Plan. However , in October 1973 , the Government took
corrective measures, including the reduction of subsidies and other currernt
expenditures, and a tax reform.  unfortunately, the new tax struct.u.re may
not yield the reqaired. increase in revenues in the short run.
9.        Additional decisions are needed to improve mediu-term develop-
ment prospects and to assure financial stability through 1974. A reaeonable
policy objective would be to raise public savings from an average of 3.7
percent of GDP during 1965-71 to 6 percent during 1973-77. This level of
public savings would make it possible to implement a public investment
program averaging about 105 percent of GDP over the period.  This level
of capital formation (Iwhsich would be consistent with GDP growth of between
6 and 7 percent per annmm during 1973-77) should help Bolivia accelerate
its process of development. For the Government to be successful in its
efforts to improve cond.itions in the countryside, it would have to achieve
greater investment in agriculture, extension of public services in rural
areas and encouragement of rural population shifts to more fertile areas.
Carrying out such programs, designed to improve tIE living standards of
the majority of the Bolivian population, and thus to achieve a more
equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growith, will be a long
and difficult process,
External Assistance Requirements
10.       To sustain an annual growth of GDP by 6 to 7 percent, gross
external capital inflows will have to average some US$80 milliorn in 1973-77
as Compared with US$2 nilli.Lon in 1961- 71. Provided public savingrs in-
crease in line with these targets,, Bolivia's public sector may expect to
obtain an average of about uS$50 nillion annually during 1973-77 from
uLndisbursed loan balances and new loans from multilateral and bilateral
agercies.  The remainder may be expected to come in the form  of suppliersX



credits and from private investors.  aiould this pattern of external
financing materialize, Bolivia Is outstanding external public debt would
increase slowly, from TIS$628 million in 1972 to US$780 million in 1977.
The debt service burden, however, is expected to fall from 19 percent of
exports of goods and non-factor services in 1972 to about 15 percent in
1977, mainly on account of Bolivia's favorable export prospects: earnings
from exports may reach about US475 million by 1977, up by some 50 percent
in real terms from the 1972 level, mainly as a result of increased earnings
prom hydroclrbon and rinerp.l exports.
11.       The Boliviarn Government has made good efforts in the past two
years to remedy the difficult fiscal situation although the results have
fallen short of expectations. Provided additional fiscal measures are
implemented in the near future, they would justify external financial
assistaxice of the magnitude indicated above.  In the meantime, given
Bolivia's great poverty, its recently improved performance, as well as
its substantial debt burden, external capital needs should be met on as
soft ternms as possible.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS EN BOLIVIA
Introduction
12        Bolivia is an original mem'oer of the Bank but did not receive
Bank Group resources until 1964.  Bank Group assistance to Bolivia has
had to take account of the countryts tight budgetary situation and its
limited capacity to service external debt.  Except for a Bank loan to help
finrance an "enclaveIr project, lending to Bolivia has been in the form of
IDA credits.  Moreover, with the exception of an IDA credit made in
Decefber 1972 in suppo.r of the Bolivian Railways, Bank G-roup financing
has been 1,r-ited to proAects reouiring no contribution from the Covernment.

*ank Group Pole in External Capital Assistance
.40         iehe proposed credit would be the Bank Groupts tenth operation
in Bolivia, bringing the amount of IDA assistance to US$52.8 million.
Lncluding undisbursed balances, Roliviats debt to the Bank and ID.P now
represents about 10 percent of its external public indebtedness; by 1980
t,his ratio might increase to about 15 percent.  The share of the Bank



Group in total debt serrice is now abeut 5 percent and is expected to
increase to about 8 percent in 1980. As a source of financial assistance
to Bolivia, the Bark Groirp raiks well below the US Government and the IDB.
Nonetheless, its activities have been expanding: Bank/IDA lending which
in the five years 196-1658 amounted to US$17 rnillion, reached US$52.8 mil-
lion in the 1969-73 period, a threefold increase.
Future Direction of Bank Group Lending
15.       In the nex' few years, the Bank: Group will endeavor to support
the Bolivian Government's efforts to remedy imbalances in the distribution
of the benefits of econadc growth concurrently with those ensuring con-
tinued ecnomic growth and expanding eMloyment opportunities.  Thus,
preparatory work has been initiated for possible Bank Group support of
projects forming part of the Govermnent 's rural development progran which
aim;s at improving the quality of life on the Altiplano.  In addition,
preparatory work has been started on a project aimed at the developnent
of Bolivia's small mines.  Under cooperative arrangements with UNEESCO and
WHNO, assistance is being provided to the Goverment for the preparatian
of educational and rural water supply programAs which might provide oppor-
tunities for Bank Group lending.  Bnk Group activities would also support
the Govemment7s production, export and employment objectives.  Thus, we
would expect to contiue lending for electricity servrices, railways, pipe-
lines, and commercial agriculture.  In doing this, we would stress the
need for adequate tariffs to be charged by the power and railway enter-
prises, thus freeing Govermment resources for pressing developmental needs,
including programs supporting the underprivileged sectors of Bolivia's
population. We would also continue stressing the need for charging posi-
tive rates of interest on capital (indexing has already been introduced
on sub-loans under the livestock projects), thereby changing the price
relationship between capital and labor, and inducing the adoption of more
labor-intensive invesitment and production techniques.
Two lending proposals may reach the negotiation stage in the
neSt twelve mionths or so.  One is a credit program which would benef'it
agricultural producers, mainly cotton and sugar planters in the Santa
Cruz area and dairy farmers in the Cochabamba area. This project has
been delayed by a deterioration in the organization and financial position
of Banco Agricola, raising doubts about its capacity to handle an addi-
tional credit program at this time. IDA and other lending agencies are
presently discussing with the Government a plan of action., which would
remedy the adninistrative and financial shortcomings of Banco Agricola.
IDA may also be able to help finance expansion of the electricity trans-
mission and distribution network in and around La Paz. The Government
does not wish to move forward with this project until it has worked out
arrangements for the purchase of the assets of the Bolivian Power Company,
and a possible IDA credit will only be considered after the Government
puts the electricity supply operation in La Paz on a sound financial basis
by allowing the introduction of adequate rates.

PART III - MN=JG TN BOLIVIA
17.       The mining tradition in Bolivia stretches into pre-Columbian
times.  Yining has had a decisive :impact on Bolivia's political history, on
the layout of its transportation system and on its pace of development.
Thousands of Bolivians are employed by the mining cmpanies, and a few
hundreds of thousands indirectly depend on mining for their living. About
80 percent of Bolivia's foreign exchange originates from mineral exports.
18.       In 1952, three private mining groups, responsible for 80 percent
of Bolivia s mineral output, were expropriated, and Corporacion Minera de
Bolivia (COMIBOL) was set up to operate their properties.  This took place
at a time when the richer tin veins were exhausted and tin production was
declining, and large investments in exploration and mine modernization
were required.  In the years that followed, beset by low tin prices, labor
unrest, feather-bedding, violence and political activity in the mines,
COMIBOL saw its position deteriorate. In 1964, the Government launched
a program tc reorganize COMIBOL and restore the economic exploitation of
the mines.  Although the program helped to prevent its collapse, COMIB0LTs
basic problems -- high production costs, labor and Government interference
in management -- did not disappear and have continued to the present.  The
potentially serious impact of the COMIBOL problem on the economy was
alleviated by an important development which took place in the 60ts:  the
private,  ostly Bolivian-owned, yrmning sector expanded vigorously and today
accounts for 50 percent of Bolivia's output, compared to 20 percent in 1952.
19.       Tiining is a capital-intenssive activity in which there is a need
for continuous investrent in exploration.  lining in Bolivia is costly
because of the difficult terrain, but it is, however, one of the sectors
in which Bolivia has a ccmparative economic advantage.  Bolivia has not
beer, able to generate the steady flow of capital which is required to
carry out, a methodical explorationr program and to modernize mining facil-
ities. external funds have onlyv t-riclkled into the countrJ, drying up during
aonvg neriods.  Since B-livia ts prospects for development largely depend on
the taxes and foreign currency generated by the mining sector, investments
-in exploratio  and equpment modernization are essential to prevent a
"eecline in rineral production.
20.       .'ri xzate cap-ital li tihe sector has been often discouraged by
-.,.at _appeared  o be a tendenc- towards increased state control, ar-sing
an acivreroc reaotnonrlto i-,re exo-'tation of natural resources by

.s<.  . ninua7 l for mining development, but that this participation
;, o oncv- stai-e st pervis on to ensure that mnineral resources are
exploited in tnie best interests of Bolivia.
Market Outlook
21.       Bolivia is a high-cost producer of minerals and the project
would help the sector to become more competitive.  The mining companies
partici-pating in the proposed Credit Program would expand production and
exports mainly of antimony, tin and tungsten.  The additional exports of



- 7 -
antiniony would net exceed 3 percent of world supply, and those of tin
and tungsten would be of the order of 1 percent.  In view of gradually
expanding demand in industrialized countries, Bolivials additional sales
should be absorbed r.ith little effect on the world price situation.  For
antimony any major long-term price increases are unlikely and increase
in demand is expected to be 1-1/2 to 2 percent per annum. For tin it is
expected that the price will fluctuate between the lower and middle price
ranges of the International Tin Agreement and demand will grow at a rate
of 0.5 to 1.5 percent per annum. Tungsten prices are likely to remain at
the current level and demand is expected to grow at a rate of 5 to 6 per-
cent per annum during the next decade.
Organization of the Sector
22.       The mining sector in Bolivia could be divided into:
(a)  COMIOL, the state mining enterprise;
(b) about 40 privately-owned medium-size mining companies
carrying out technically and financially viable
operations; and
(c) over 2,000 small privatte mines, most of which are marginal
family operations.
23.       COA-130L, because of its high costs arising from excessive per-
sonnel and many years without exploration work and inadequate investment
in equipment, has too many problems to take the lead in the sector. The
privately-owned medium-size miring companies, however, have been a most dynamic
group in Bolivia.  They have shown the entrepreneurial spirit and the technical
competence to give mining steady imomentum. Their constraint is shortage
of credit. The small mining sub-sector has potential insofar as many
small mines could be expanded and made more efficient; it faces two con-
straints: shortage of credit and lack of technical expertise.
24.       A distinct feature of the Bolivian mining sector is the weakness
of the Ministry of Mini'ng and Metallurgy, which should be the directing
and coordinating center for the sector. The Ministry, although de jure
controlling COMIBOL and other institutions in the sector, lacks up-to-date
information about the sector and sufficient qualified staff to exercise
control and to carry out an integrated mining policy. This is reflected
in the lack of data about the sector, and in the lack of consolidated
planning for the sector.
The Bank Group's Role in the Mining Sector
25.       In 1971, a Bank mission visited Bolivia to examine the mirdng
sector and to identify a development program which external financing
agencies might consider for financing. From the findings of the mission,
contained in a report entitled "The Mining and Metallurgical Sector 
Bolivialt (No. PI-14a of December 7,, 1972) which was distributed to the



- 8 -
Executive Directors on December 29, 1972 (R72-277), and subsequent con-
versations with the Bolivian Governient, it was concluded that the impact
of Bank Group assistance would be greatest if it was first directed
towards the financing of expansion of private mines, since this was the
part of the mining sector where increases in production could be achieved
most rapidly. The first phase of the program, to be assisted by the pro-
posed credit, comprises the financing of projects in the medium-size
mining sub-sector and a survey to identify and prepare small mining pro-
jects suitable for development, which would in turn be financed in the
second phase of the program by a second credit.  The third phase could be
the formation of an exploration fund following the enactment of appropriate
legislation to encourage prospecting. These phases, of course, should be
acconpanied by the strengthening of the institutions in the sector, pri-
marily the Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy, and by the implementation
of measures tending to create a climate favorable for mining investment.
During negotiations the Government agreed to promulgating, no later than
.rmid-1974, a revised mriing code which would largely be a codification of
the existing code and subsequent legislation.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project has three components:
(a)  A Credit Program to help finance about 25 development
and expansion projects for about 'CO mining enterprises
from among the 40 private companies mentioned in
paragraph 22 (b);
(b) a 'Nati onal Sarvey of 3nall Mines, designed to prepare
an inventory of smlall mines, select mines with the
best potential, and provide them with technical and
exploration assistance;
C)  a program of technical assistance to strengthen the
inistry of Xining and Metallurgy.
2Te project was appraised by  BDA i-n June 1973; negotiations were held from

(uS$0.77 million), by BISA sub-borrowers (US$1.93 million) and by a small
Government contribution of US$0.37 million.



9_
The Credit Program
28.       The funds for the Credit Program (Us$5.0 million equivalent)
would be lent through BISA, a private development finance company, 60 per-
cent owned by private Bolivian shareholders, 26 percent by ADELA and 10 per-
cent by Banco Popular del Peru, and established in 1963. BISA was selected
after evaluating a number of other potential intermediaries. A Sxmnary
Income Statement and Balance Sheet of BISA is attached as Annex IV. At the
end of 1972, BISA's resources were US$o.48 million equivalent in equity and
US$3.85 million equivalent in long-term borrowings.  BISA has been success-
ful in obtaining long-term resources from external agencies, i.e. the US
Agency for International Development (AID), the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).
29.       Most of BISA's lending has been to private manufacturing firms.
BISA has been the major source of term financing to this sector in Bolivia
having made almost 700 loans. BISA has also helped clients to improve
their appraisal and financial practices. BISA s interest rate to sub-
borrowers is 10 percent, the ceiling established by the Government in 1972
for development loans. Most sub-loans are repayable in foreign currency
or, if repayable in local currency, contain a maintenance of dollar value
clause.
30.       BISA has a competent and experienced management.  In connection
.ith BISA's entering the mining sector, its shareholders have approved new
by-laws and a revised statement of lending and investment policies. Be-
cause of its broadening responsibilities, the company has agreed to reinforce
its staff, which will provide it with sufficient capability to appraise and
supervise mining projects.
31.       BISA is creditworthy and, with the proposed strengthening of its
organization, a suitable intermediary.. Ihe company's prospects are good:
it erpects to iencrease lending operations substantially while maintaining
sournd financial situation. Profitability would remain at a rather modest
evel, whi.le licuidity would continue to be good.  BISA would need to
mobilize considerable amounts of fresh share capital, and has received
assurances to that effect from several existing and potential shareholders.
It would be a condition of the effectiveness of the credit that additional
subscriptions in the amount of $blO million have been received providing
for $b5 million to be paid in by December 31, 1974 and $b5 million by
December 31, 1975.  In the Project Agreement, BISA would commit itself not
to exceed a 6:1 ratio of total debt to equity.
32.       BISA would receive the IDA funds for the Credit Program from the
Covernment at no less than 7-1x percent and lend at no less than l-1  L!
percent in foreign exchalige, resulting in a spread of 4 percent for BISA.
This spread is reasonable in view of the costs and risks associated with
BISA entering into a new field.  SLb-loans are expected to number about 25
and would have a maximum term of 15 years, including a grace period not
expected to exceed three years, with the subborrowers bearing the foreign
exchange risk.  BISA's repayments to the Government would be based orn a



- 10 -
composite amortization schedule made up of the amortization schedules for
the individual sub-loans.  Considering that BISA has not had an opportunity
to build up its business to an adequate level, and that it is entering foI
the first time into the mining sector, BISA would be granted concessional
treatment regarding commitment charges, which would accrue to the Govern-
ment at 3/4 percent per annum on the sums authorized for withdrawal by IDA
with respect to specific investment projects. The limit for subprojects
not requiring IDA's prior approval (the "free limit") would be US$250,000
equivalent and the aggregate limit for subprojects below the free limit
would be US$2 million; the first three subprojects would be submitted to
IDA irrespective of their amounts. Ihis is expected to result in 8-10 sub-
projects being submitted to DA for approval.
33.       Sub-borrowers would come from a group of about 40 medium-size,
mostly Bolivian-owned, mining enterprises which are generally capable of
preparing and executing investment projects. In a limited number of sub-
projects, technical assistance would be required.  The potential sub-
borrowers are generally financially sound and creditworthy.  The proposed
subprojects would include underground mine development and modernization,
construction and modernization of beneficiation plants, electrification
and installation of camp infrastructure, and surface mine development.
34.       The subprojects are not expected to have an adverse effect on
the environment.
National Survey of Sia2l Mines
35.       The aurvey would collect and analyze available data on the
operations of small mines, suapplemented by field inspections, to identify
small mi,nes whose expansion would be economically justified and which
could benefit from future external financing.
36.       ?reparatory work for the Survey has been initiated.  The Survey
would. be condbcted b-y (G,BOL, a semi-autonomous Government agency, with
its ovn sta'f, in coordination with other agencies operating in the mining
sec or   F'ur foreigr advisors would be required to help carry it out.
-he k-rvey , ouId be completed by mid-l975.

TJGeOIOeg` c L SuLrvey.'J, 7has. a -pennanent staff of approximately 250
cf whicn aboru  120 arc professionals.  With the technical assistance
nrcv~ded, GEOOL should be able to carry out the Survey satisfactorily,
s szstance Prcgrani
30e       Lanie Technical Assistance Program comprises:
(a) technical assistance to, and equipment for, the Ministry
of Mining and Metallurgy with the objective of strengthen-
ing the Ministry;



- 11 -
(b)  a study of taxation of mining enterprises aiming at a
more equitable tax systen, which would contribute to
sector development, while at the same time assuring an
adequate contribution of the sector to Government revenue;
(c) preparatory work for a proposed mining exploration fund,
which would supplement risk capital now only available
in very limited amounts for mining exploration.
The Program is expected to be completed in about three years.  Foreign
consultants would be employed to help carry out the Program.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Equipment for the Credit Program would be purchased by sub-
borrowers from foreign sources as off-the-shelf items, mostly costing less
than US$50,ooo0 BISA normally requires that subborrowers obtain quotations
from at least three suppliers. Sabborrowers would use local contractors
for civil works and rm-ne development who would also need to make some
purchases abroad.
40.       Except for diamond drills and accessories valued at about
UJS$2h0,000 which would be subject to international competitive bidding,
equipment for the Sirvey, owing to the large number of items, would be
procured on an international basis by requesting quotations from at least
three foreign countries. Advisory services required under the Survey and
the Technical Assistance Program would be obtained on the basis of inter-
national recruitment.
Rate of Return and Project Justification
41.       Because of the nature, variety, and different stages of prepara-
tion of the subprojects, it is difficult to estimate in advance the imoact
of -.he Credit Program on the Bolivian economy.  It is estimated that the
sio-rojects will have a financial rate of return ranging from 15 to 40 per-
cent.  The economic rate of return, however, would be higher, inter alia
because of the significant contribution which the project bene7TciarTes
would make towards Government revenues in the form of tax and royalty pay-
ments. The Credit Program would increase substantially Bolivia's exports
of antimony, tungsten and tin and, to a lesser extent, of other minerals,
resulting in additional annual net export earnings of about US$7 million a
year. It would also help to improve health and safety conditions in the
mines and the plants, and living conditions in some camps through electri-
fication, erection of housing and other social facilities.
42.       The benefits from the Survey of Small Mines will be realized in
the identification and preparation of projects involving small mines which
could be economically expanded, thus increasing the country's mineral out-
put, and in improved knowledge of the sector. The benefits of the Technical
Assi.stance Program would be realized mainly in the form of greater effi-
ciency and increased technical competence of the Ministry of Mines and
Metallurgy.  The Ministry and GEOBOL would become more effective and betWer

equipped to plan the development of the sector, particularly exploration
and small mine development which are key features of the Government's
long-term plans for the mining sector.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRJMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and
the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
Banco Industrial S.A., the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. rfhe draft Agreements conform to the
normal pattern for credits to assist development finance companies,
except that they provide for the Borrower to retain a portion of the
proceeds of the Credit to help finance the National Survey of 9mall Mines
and the Technical Assistance Program.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOLMMENDATION
454       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C    PROJECTS IN EXECUTIMON
Credit 148 - Second ENDE Power Project, US$7.4 million, April 28, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
The Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant was inaugurated on
September 15, 1973. The revised estimates show a cost
of US$12.4 million as compared to the original estimate of
US$104. million. The causes for the overruns were adverse
geological conditions in tunnelling and substantial wage
increases granted by the previous Government. At the
revised cost, the Santa Isabel project is stilll the least-
cost alternative for meeting the load forecast for discount
rates up to about 18 percent; this compares favorably with
the opportunity cost of capital in Bolivia.
Credit 261 - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June 25, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project started slowly and to date little has been
withdrawm from the credit account.  In view of substantial
price increases in Bolivia in late 1972 and early 1973, and
in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement,
the Government, IDA and Banco Agricola agreed at the end of
April 1973 to introduce indexing of loans to ranchers which
would assure a 6 percent real rate of interest. The indexing
arrangements were put into effect on December 5, 1973.  Mean-
while, sub-loan conmitments by Banco Agricola have accelerated
and there seems to be a good prospect of the credit proceeds
allocated for lending to beef and sheep ranchers being fully
committed by the end of 1974.  The study by consultants who
are formulating recommendations for an appropriate meat policy
has been completed and is about to be submitted to the
Governurment.  The Government is preparing measures to improve
the acinistrative and financial position of Banco Agricola
which deteriorated during the last 18 months.
i/  IThese notes are designed to inform the Excecutive Directors regarding
The progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in tuhis sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 3h6 - Railway Project, UTS-~imillion, December 1, 1972;  Closing
Date:  December 31, 197,
The project - aimed at the technical and financial rehabilitation
of the Railways (ENFE) - started well, but cost overruns of about
20 percent are expected for equipment and for technical assistance,
due to changes in currency exchange rates and higher prices for
rolling stock and rail.  Low availability of diesel locomotives
remains a serious problem. One uneconomic line has been closed
and the closing of the second one is being studied. Freight
and passenger traffic and revenues are much as expected. A
substantial tariff increase was put into effect last November.
Credit 133 - Third ENDE Power Project, USL6 million, October 17, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The credit was made effective December 11, 1973. Bids for the
gas turbines were opened December 14, 1973.
