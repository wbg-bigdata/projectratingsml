A. BACKGROUND
Agriculture in the Economy
1 .    Prior to the civil war, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) had a population of about 4.4 million people,
of whom some 68 percent or 3.0 million were of employable age (15-64). Of these about 2 percent were
employed by the organized agricultural sector while a further 16 percent were private sector farmers or
farm workers. Per capita income for BH which had grown at over 5 percent p.a. in the 1970s and 2
percent p.a. in the first half of the 1980s has declined since 1986 and in 1991 was of the order of
US$1,900. Agriculture's performance was much less impressive than that of the economy as a whole
in the 1970s (annual growth of 0.6 percent compared with 5.2 percent), but it grew at 3.6 percent p.a.
in the first half of the 1980s compared with 1.9 percent p.a. for the whole economy and only fell
moderately (by an average of 1.1 percent p.a.) between 1986 and 1990. Forestry, which had grown by
about 2 percent p.a. from 1971 to 1986 has fallen sharply over the 1986-1990 period. In 1990,
agriculture's share of GSP' comprised 14 percent and that of forestry, 2 percent (see table below).
Overall, BH was a net 'importer' of temperate agricultural products. The net 'export' of livestock
products, particularly milk to the Dalmatian coast, would have been outweighed by 'imports' of grains,
and protein meals, as well as products for human consumption.

2.    Because BH is essentially rural, with only 20 percent of the population living in the 10 largest
towns prior to the war, agriculture impacts on a large proportion of households. The 1981 census
indicated that there were some 540,000 farm households. Thus, at that time, over half of all households
were agricultural. It is likely that until 1991, the situation was broadly similar.
3.    Unlike some other former Yugoslav republics, only a relatively small part of BH's agricultural
resources were in the 'social sector' - 6.1 percent of agricultural land, negligible numbers of ruminant
Within the former Yugoslavia, the measure of national income was Gross Social Product (GSP), a measure
which excludes services, except those involved in the transport and distribution of goods.

livestock, and about a quarter of the intensive livestock. Forestry, on the other hand is largely socially
owned. Over three quarters of the forest area, 88 percent of the timber stocks, 88 percent of the annual
growth increment and about 90 percent of the offtake are within the social sector. Until the late 1980s,
agro-industry of any significant scale was entirely a social sector business. Only on-farm processing such
as kitchen-scale production of meat and milk products, or local slaughtering could have been categorized
as private.
4.     Largely as a result of the war, BH's overall GSP and agriculture and forestry sector performance
have all deteriorated sharply. No reliable measures of sectoral output are available; however, since
industrial GSP fell more precipitously, agriculture's importance within the economy as a whole may have
increased. Shortly prior to the war, measures were taken to liberalize the economy by removing
restrictions on land ownership and on the number of persons which could be employed by private firms.
Additionally, some measures had also been taken to privatize the social sector units. Because of the war
situation, these measures have not yet had a significant effect on private sector expansion in agriculture
and agro-industries.
Agricultural Resources and Performance
5.     Land. BH comprises some 20 percent of the land area of former Yugoslavia. About half (2.5
million ha) of its total area of 5.11 million ha is agricultural land and a further 45 percent (2.3 million
ha) is forest. Of the agricultural land, just over 1 million ha are arable fields and gardens, about 100,000
ha are orchards and vineyards, some 470,000 ha are meadows and 930,000 ha are pastures, mainly in
mountain regions. The quality of land in BH is varied. Although some of it, around Banja Luka and
along the Sava River is relatively flat, good quality arable land, most is in hilly areas where there is
cultivation in the valley bottoms and grazing on the hillsides. Much of BH is mountainous with peaks
rising to nearly 2,400 m. However, a significant part of this mountainous land is classified as forest
rather than agricultural area. In general, the better quality arable land is in regions of the Republika
Srpska.
6.     Climate. BH is between 42 and 45 degrees North, roughly at the same latitude as Central Italy.
Mostly, its climate can be classified as continental and is affected by altitude, being particularly harsh in
the iniand mountain areas where the topography is rugged. Annual average rainfall in BH varies
depend-ng on altitude, and proximity to the coast. In central Bosnia, it is typically between 800 mm and
1,000 mm per year and distributed fairly evenly; in winter, much of the precipitation is as snow.
Towards the coast, however, the climate is more mediterranean with very limited summer rainfall, but
wet winters - Mostar has annual rainfall of about 1,500 mm, but less than 200 mm from June through
September. Temperatures in the center of Bosnia typically average 22C in July and around OC in
January; in Mostar however, they are higher at about 25C degrees in July and 5C in January. The hot
continental summers mean that parts of the country, particularly the south west, would benefit from
irrigation, although overall the amount of irrigation currently used is small. Drainage and flood
protection are important issues along the Sava River.
7.     Land ownership in BH had previously been largely private with about 94 percent of agricultural
land belonging to individuals2. As a result of the war and considerable movement of refugees, the issue
of land ownership is critical within an agricultural development strategy in the short- and medium-term.
2  The pasture area which accounts for some 37 percent of private land is thought not to be generally owned
by individual farmers but rather to belong to farmers communally.

With an average size of 3 - 5 ha, the average fann is small and largely inappropriate for modern
mechanized fanning. This is exacerbated by land fragmentation. While no direct evidence on
fragmentation in BH is available from the literature, surveys in former Yugoslavia as a whole and
observations in the neighboring Macedonia and Serbia suggest that the average farm may well have about
10 disparate parcels of land. This fragmentation is particularly constraining in the flatter areas where
mechanization would otherwise be possible. In the hill areas, farm size is typically larger than in the
plains and units are more often consolidated. The substantial movement of population which has taken
place during mnore than three years of war has caused that in many areas, people who are occupying land
are not those with legal title to it. Estimates indicate that, for the time being, up to one third of the
farmers with land title no longer occupy their own land.
8.     Private farming systems in BH are largely mixed. In 1981, there were 370,000 full time workers
on the 233,000 private farms with workers - about one worker per three hectares of cropped land.
Generally, low output mixed farming systems are followed; small areas of cereals and other crops are
produced as well as vegetables and fruit (principally plums and apples) for the household. Most farms
tend to have some livestock also, cattle being the most widely held type. Indeed, in 1981 more than
seventy percent of all private farms had at least one cow. Additionally, over half of all farms exceeding
3 ha in size, kept pigs. Sheep were less widely owned with only 20 percent of farmers owning any
sheep at all, but among these, some 24,000 farmers (about 5 percent of all farms) had at least 20 head.
SubFtantial sheep flocks are most common in areas with access to communal mountain pasture.

9.     Cropping. The agricultural land use, and the areas under different crops is summarized below.
Over the twenty years 1981-1991, the cropping pattern had changed slightly with the cereal area
decreasing but the area of forage crops increasing (see table above). Overall, about 45 percent of arable



Technical Annex
Page 5 of 34
land was in cereals in 1991, with a large figure of 22 percent of the area either fallow or uncultivated
(up from 18 percent in 1971).
10.   Crop yields are typically good indicators of technical performance. The table below shows
development of BH's crop yields over time and in 1988 compares BH figures to those of Yugoslavia as
a whole. Technical performance for crop production, compared with Yugoslavia is generally poor.
Yields of cereals, which cover some 45 percent of the cropped area in BH, averaged nearly 20 percent
below those for Yugoslavia as a whole. Performance of potatoes and vegetables was relatively worse,
while clover (hay) yields were 13 percent below the national average. Only with tobacco did BH achieve
a higher average yield than Yugoslavia as a whole. Compared with western Europe, BH average yields
are only about half for cereals, potatoes and vegetables, and less than half for clover. Although BH
conditions are not ideal for the crops grown, yield levels reported on some of the more efficient units in
the past suggest there is substantial room for technical improvement.

11.   As would be expected, production of crops fell considerably as a result of the war and the
consequent reductions in available inputs. A well-organized seed distribution program which was
implemented by humanitarian relief organizations and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
during the 1994 fall and 1995 spring planting seasons, was able to stop the continuous decline in wheat
production in Federation territory. However, 1995 production of wheat and maize continued to drop
considerably in the Republika Srpska, where the FAO program was not available, causing total 1995
grain production in BH to fall by one quarter from 1994 harvest levels.
12.   A comparison between FAO/WFP estimated production of wheat and maize in 1994 and 1995
and the official statistics for 1990 is set out in the table below. Estimates covering BH as a whole for
wheat, maize, pulses and potatoes indicate production falls of between 1991 and 1995 of 43 percent, 47
percent and 40 percent respectively. Fruit production is also estimated to be down by about 50 percent,
with 5-10 percent of trees destroyed. There has also been considerable damage to commercial vineyards
and wine production facilities in the south, particularly in the Mostar area.

and municipal levels is in a state of transition. The former structure, with agriculture as part of the
Ministry of Energy and Industry, changed as of February 1, 1996, when a new Ministry of Agriculture,
Water Management and Forestry at the Federation was created. The intention is to also form departments
with the same sector responsibilities at the Canton level.
14.    Before the war there were some 1,200 professional agriculturalists (including animal husbandry)
in BH; details of the present situation are not yet available. The available professional agricultural staff
is estimated at only about 250. Of these only a few are at the central and Canton levels, with the bulk
of the agricultural staff employed at the municipal level. Municipal agricultural staff, typically consisting
of about 3-5 specialists in agriculture and livestock development, are working in the office of the Mayor.
In view of the difficult employment situation in the industrial sector, agriculture is given high priority
in the work program  of the municipalities.  Agricultural extension to private farmers is not yet
operational. The Municipal agricultural staff is providing advice to farmers, but not in a planned and
structured manner. Agricultural research is to be carried out in Agricultural Institutes, but due to staff
and funding shortage and destruction of facilities, little research is presently being undertaken.
Farm Mechanization
15.    No recent data is available on the current level of mechanization on private farms in BH, since
statistics had been published on tractors held on private farms but ceased being collected in 1991. Based
on 1991 fligures of about 60,000 two-axle tractors and some 32,000 motor-cultivators and single-axle
tractois (or about one tractor per 17 ha of cultivated land), it is likely that in the aggregate the degree
of tractorization in BH was adequate prior to the war. For a 40 hp standard tractor, an area of 12 to 15
ha in hilly areas and up to 30 ha in flat land was considered appropriate. The major part of the farmland
in BH is on slopes, only about 20 percent of the farmland is on flat areas.
16.    More than 97 percent of tractors were on private farms (see table below). Because of the small
farm size structure, however, there were still likely to be many farmers who did not have access to
mechanical equipment; this could account for the high horse population then (1 horse per 9 ha of cropped
arable land). The main aggregate mechanization problem previously observed within Former Yugoslavia
was the shortage of specialist equipment at the farm level.
17.    The other main problem was the very small farm size and the difficulty farmers have in

establishing sound commercial arrangements for tractor sharing/hire, particularly on mixed farms where
daily (but limited) use of tractors is the norm. Effective systems of contracting agricultural services or
hiring equipment need to be developed to allow individual farmers access to suitable seeders, planters,
mowers, sprayers, harvesting equipment etc., without having to invest themselves. As a positive step
towards more efficient agricultural production, the previous restriction on the maximum farm size of 15
ha has been lifted. Hence, it can be expected that more suitable, larger farm structures would emerge
in the medium term, especially as soon as alternative sources of household income become available and
part-time farmers would decide to lease or sell their land to others.

18.    The war has affected the major part of the existing farm equipment. An estimated 70-80 percent
of the tractors and implements including single-axle tractors and combine harvesters has been destroyed
or stolen. Of the remaining equipment, only about 50-70 percent is in working condition due to
maintenance problems and lack of spare parts in the war situation. The equipment is mostly aged and
in many cases major rehabilitation work will not solve the mechanization problem in the medium term.
The reliability and quality of work of this equipment is not adequate.
19.   It is estimated that in many areas up to 30 percent of the arable land is not cultivated. The main
reason given by farmers for that circumstance is the shortage of farm equipment, ranking ahead of other
factors such as the presence of land mines, or issues of disputed land ownership. Lack of combine
harvesters has led to delayed harvests and low crop yields, and the provision of combine harvesters is
therefore considered as high priority. Lack of farm equipment is also responsible for insufficient land
preparation and planting, especially for cereal crops and potatoes. The remaining farmers are generally
cultivating those areas where they presently live, provided they have the inputs and equipment to do so.
With the few remaining farm machines, a system of private contracting of machinery service appears to



Technical Annex
Page 8 of 34
be developing gradually, which will make possible the economic use of machines even with BH's small
farm sizes.
20.   A high percentage of the rural population, which was formerly employed in industrial enterprises
and was running srnall farms of 0.1 - 3 ha as a part-time business, are now left to survive from the
returns of their farm land. These farmers are heavily affected by the loss or destruction of their farm
equipment, which in most cases were motor-cultivators or single-axle tractors. The horse population has
also been heavily reduced since January 1992, by an estimated 36 percent, from 90,000 to 58,000. The
remaining horses are mainly used for transport.
21.   A high percentage of the agricultural land is dedicated to forage production for livestock. In
some areas, over 50 percent of the arable land is used for artificial meadows, maize or rape production
for forage purposes. The productivity in forage production is extremely low. Of 5 to 7 possible cuts
on the artificial meadows, only 2 cuts are actually performed. This not only translates into lower yields
but also results in poor quality of the hay. Most of the hay harvest is done by hand, with an output of
no more than 0.3 ha/day. This compares to an output with a motorized single-axle mower of about 2.7
ha/day. Most of the maize and rape as well as the grass grown at present cannot be used for the
production of silage because of lack of shredders. Better quality forage for animals is urgently required
to enable the rehabilitation of the livestock. This bottleneck towards animal feeding requires urgent
addressing.  There are indications that the reproduction rate of cattle suffers due to insufficient
alimentation.
22.   While the availability of spare parts and workshop services is in general not satisfying, there are
regional differences. For the present stock of machinery, no inventory or listing of required spare parts
exists. There is also uncertainty whether some of the required parts are still in production because much
of the existing equipment is outdated. Spare parts were formerly distributed on a centralized basis, and
new channels of distribution have to be developed. Dealers for agricultural equipment and spare parts
are already emerging, and they will require training for new machines and technology, to be provided
by the respective machinery suppliers. As an alternative to commercial farm equipment dealers, farmer
cooperatives, base on the initiative of private individual farmers, are also emerging. These cooperatives
are mainly input supply and output marketing associations, and they represent an excellent potential to
develop as a dealer network for farm equipment.
Livestock Production
23.   Livestock are important in BH, particularly cattle and sheep. While the area of main crops grown
in BH only represented 12 percent of that in the former Yugoslavia, its herd of breeding cows and of
breeding sheep amounted to 25 percent and 18 percent respectively of the former national totals. The
table below indicates the numbers of livestock in BH and the proportion held in the private and socialist
sectors. The vast majority are in the private sector (see table below). Only with intensive livestock,
especially poultry (37 percent) and pigs (19 percent) did the socialist sector control a significant
proportion of the herd.
24.   Technical performance from livestock is quite poor and was generally below that in other parts
of the former Yugoslavia except in the case of sheep meat production. For example, the milk produced
per cow per year, which is a key dairying performance indicator, is under 1,500 liters in BH and only
83 percent of the average for the former Yugoslavia. This is only about one third of that achieved by



Technical Annex
Page 9 of 34
average dairy farms in western Europe. Similarly, with one of the key indicators for pigs - number
slaughtered per sow per year, the BH performance of 10.4 is 93 percent of that of the former Yugoslavia
and only about 50 percent of that achieved on successful western European farms. Poor livestock
performance is due to limited availability of feed as well as the almost complete lack of extension service
to private farmers; professional agricultural services were devoted to large-scale farms in the socially-
owned sector on which extensive management systems were practiced and where reasonable yields,
regardless of economic considerations, were obtained.

25.   Livestock numbers are estimated by FAO/WFP to have fallen sharply by August 1994 at which
time, the total populations had fallen, compared with the January 1992 levels as shown in the table below.
Estimates as of end-1995 indicate a possible reduction of livestock to only 30 percent of pre-war levels.
Import requirements suggested by the Government equal 60,000 pregnant heifers, 70-100,000 sheep, and
45-50,000 goats. The potential for sustained livestock production, in the absence of livestock imports,
is now likely to be well below that in 1991 as a result of the considerably diminished herds.

26.   Cattle husbandrv. The pre-war cattle population of BH of some 950,000 head were largely
maintained by private farmers. These were kept on small-holdings and individual herd sizes were small,



Technical Annex
Page 10 of 34
frequently of less than six heads. Sinimental and Brown Swiss dual purpose type cattle were kept for the
production of meat and milk. During the summer months, cattle graze on natural and in some cases
improved sown pastures, but the long winter requires their housing for six months of the year. Winter
feeding is on locally conserved hay which is harvested late and, as a result, of poor digestibility and
quality. Due to the necessity to keep as many productive cattle on the premises as possible, calves are
sold at a young age for veal, only the minimal number of female calves being kept as replacements.
Some 4 percent of the cattle population were maintained on State farms. These institutions kept Holstein-
Friesian type cows, largely on intensive zero grazing systems, typically making corn silage as the
maintenance ration and feeding concentrates for production. A limited number of Holstein-Friesian cattle
are also kept by the private sector.
27.   Milk is mostly sold privately, also to milk factories at Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica which are
operating at low levels of capacity at the present time. Thriving peri-urban dairy industry is reported
surrounding Sarajevo, including a State farm. Simmental cattle are considered very suitable for the areas
around Tuzla, Zenica and north towards Tesanj, with Brown Swiss being more popular in the areas of
Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres. The husbandry standards to achieve good performance from Holstein-
Friesian cows and the demand for a dual purpose breed suggest that importation of this breed in large
numbers is inadvisable at the present time.
28.    Sheep husbandry. Prior to the war, the sheep population of BH is estimated at 1.3 million.
Sheep fulfil a triple purpose role producing milk for cheese making, a light yield of coarse wool, and
meat. Production systems are typified by the system adopted for the Pramnenka breed in the areas of
Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres. During the winter months flocks are maintained on the lowland pasture
of valley bottoms with limited additional feeding of poor quality hay. Multiple births are rare and the
occasional twins that are born are usually fostered on to ewes that have lost their lamb. However,
Pramenka breeders in the Herzegovina region report that strains of the breed may lamb twice a year.
In this area, limited selection, controlled breeding and hormonal treatments are under investigation aiming
to produce up to six lambs in a two year period. Milk production is approximately 150 kg per lactation,
yielding 15 kg of cheese. Flocks, which are entirely in the hands of private owners, range in size from
20, to as large as 1,000 head. The breed is extremely hardy and uniquely adapted to the demanding
production environment. The replacement or dilution of this breed type could be detrimental to the use
of this harsh production environment.
29.   For example, information from authorities in Travnik details a 1992 population of 50,000
Vlasicka Pramenka3 which now equals about 20,000 only. Prior to the immediate past, this decline is
attributed to the nationalization of winter valley grazing land for industrial development, housing and for
cultivation. To combat this, transport of sheep flocks to winter grazing areas as far away as Slovenia by
rail and road transport, had been practiced in the past. This opportunity has now been lost by recent
political events. An Association of Private Farmers in Travnik represents 158 members, primarily sheep
farmers who own flocks ranging from 40 - 1,000 heads. The Association provides credit, advice and a
limited range of inputs. It is also marketing wool, cheese and milk. Over the war, members' flocks have
been reduced from 50,000 to 10,000 and many of the grazing areas are known to be heavily mined.
30.   The Association of Private Farmers in Travnik represents a potential focus for both the expansion
and improvement of the Pramenka breed. Due to the limited income available from the sale of wool and
3  Vlasicka Pramenka are a local sub type located in Travnik and grazing the Vlasic mountain pasture in the
summer. Other local types are the Privorska and Kupreska Pramenka located at Bugojno and Kupres,
respectively.



Technical Annex
Page 11 of 34
cheese, farmers are obliged to also sell male and female lambs for income, limiting their opportunity to
increase flock size. To allow breed expansion, the Association is prepared to buy better quality female
lambs and superior ram lambs, to distribute to small flock owners and to new farmers. Beneficiaries
would need to become members of the Association and would need a sufficient loan grace period before
production and hence debt repayment could be expected. Shepherding is essentially a family occupation,
with younger men taking the flock to the mountains for summer grazing and older family members
tending the lowl'and holding. The areas of Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres have suffered heavy war
damage and are target areas for assistance of this kind.
31.   Goat husbandry. The pre-war goat population is estimated at 95,000. In 1951, the goat
populations in various regions were, however, considerably larger; 250,000 has been cited as the
population for the Travnik region alone. In 1951, an edict was issued by the Government of the former
Yugoslavia prohibiting the keeping of goats. At the time this was probably considered a conservation
measure to conserve forestry stocks. It is now more widely accepted that the potential of correctly
managed goat flocks is substantial. There seems no prejudice about the consumption of goat meat and
the recognition of the value of goat milk is increasing. Private farmers have expressed interest in goat
production and the re-establishment of goat flocks is occurring. Individual flocks of up to 200 goats are
managed commercially in the Herzegovina region.
32.   Goat husbandry would be complementary to cattle and sheep husbandry. Goats may utilize much
of the waste vegetable fodder from the horticultural industry, crop stovers, hillside and wayside browse
which is not readily used by alternative ruminant livestock, providing the opportunity to expand both milk
and meat production. The reproductive capability of goats, being unrestricted by seasonal influences
would also allow the more rapid expansion of population numbers in selected areas. Provided
beneficiaries can be identified with a willingness to adopt satisfactory goat husbandry methods, the
importation of goats should be strongly supported. The population of indigenous goats has been so
reduced that the risks of breed degeneration is of less significance than in the case for sheep.
33.   Pig and poultry husbandry. Pigs were kept on a fairly large scale in BH by State farms, more
commonly in the north of the country. Most farms fattened two or three pigs, slaughtered their own pigs
and produced smoked meat and sausages for the winter period. Pigs are mostly of large white and
landrace breeds or hybrids of these types. Poultry were also produced on State farms both for eggs and
broiler production. Poultry keeping is common throughout the country in backyard systems, but also in
larger numbers in cages and in deep litter houses. Poultry and rabbit keeping have received noteworthy
assistance from humanitarian agencies, to the extent that some producers are now finding that it is
difficult to market eggs. Individual farmers have small incubators, as does the State farm at Visoko.
With the rapid reproductive capabilities of pigs and poultry, importations of these species appear not be
of priority.
34.   Feed Balances. An examination of livestock numbers in January 1992 compared with the feed
availability for them indicates that BH was in significant livestock feed deficit. As to protein meals,
annual needs were about 300,000 tons but with no significant domestic production. Assuming that most
of the wheat was used for domestic consumption, the availability of cereals for livestock feed was only
about 61 percent of the level needed. On the bulk feed front, calculations indicated availability of about
81 percent of the amount needed, although if straw and vegetable waste were included, the bulk feed
requirements would be met, albeit with low quality products. The apparent shortage of feed is consistent
with the poor livestock performance achieved. Clearly the development focus within the livestock sector
should be to equate numbers with feed availability, specialize and concentrate on improving technical
performance.



Technical Annex
Page 12 of 34
35.   Destruction of livestock during the war period has largely corrected the livestock food imbalance.
With the new livestock numbers (assuming similar herd structure), but 1991 crop production levels, there
would be adequate availability of cereals and roughage (on aggregate, 120 percent and 143 percent of
estimated needs) and the protein meal deficit would have halved.
Animal Health and Veterinary Services
36.   The animal health situation in BH used to be comparable with western Europe and disease control
measures have been implemented for many years. Bovine tuberculosis is at a low level and prior to the
war cattle were tested annually. Testing and eradication programs also existed for brucellosis and bovine
leucosis. Trichinosis (Trichinella spiralis) occurs in pigs and is the subject of porcine meat inspection.
Canine rabies is controlled by regular vaccination and the main rabies vector is the red fox. Recently
a number of positive cases have been recorded in Herzegovina in this species. Where war has disrupted
vaccination programs there is concern about the re-emergence of rabies; response to calls for vaccination,
which has to be paid for, is low. In Herzegovina, when rabies has been diagnosed in a locality, free
vaccination in the vicinity has been provided. An outbreak of classical swine fever was recently recorded
in Herzegovina, originating from an importation of pigs from Poland. The disease has been rapidly
controlled by a policy of slaughter on infected premises and ring vaccination. Helminthiasis and
fascioliasis are important production limiting diseases. This disease status does not, however, allow for
complacency as illustrated by the aforementioned outbreak of swine fever. With the unsettled situation
in the area, with refugee movements with livestock continuing, and with the prevailing disease situation
in countries to the east, FMD and possibly rinderpest are potential threats.
37.   The administrative structure of the veterinary services in BH is currently represented by two
offices in Sarajevo and Mostar. The administrations have regulatory and supervisory responsibilities.
Field veterinarians are engaged at the municipality (district) level; there may be one or more veterinary
stations within a municipality depending on size of the town, with ancillary field stations in smaller
townships. A variable number of veterinarians work from these stations providing clinical services, food
hygiene inspection, artificial inseminations, sale of animal health requisites and in some areas pest control
particularly for rodents. Due to the population movements that have recently occurred no accurate
estimate of the number of veterinarians in BH is available. There are known to be 86 in the Herzegovina
region. But no single figure is available for the total number of veterinary stations or sub-stations for
BH as a whole.
38.   The condition of veterinary stations varies from complete destruction or severe damage, to
adequate and, in a limited number of cases, elaborate. A number of stations have suffered from long lack
of maintenance or care, but in some cases, even in war damaged areas the premises are more generous
than a private practice providing the same services would expect to work from in other countries. This
is undoubtedly a legacy from the former system of government, where more wealthy administrations were
prepared to provide superior facilities. The group of veterinarians operating from a station enjoy
considerable financial autonomy. A work plan for the year is prepared and fees for the full range of
services are specified subject to approval of the municipality. The fees are economic and the income
accruing from the services delivered is used to pay professional and ancillary staff, purchase drugs and
requirements, operate vehicles and maintain premises. This also attributes to the disparity of premises
and equipment; vets in war-torn areas have lost their source of income as livestock numbers have declined
and clients have been unable to pay for their services. In general the availability of curative drugs is
rather adequate and veterinarians have shown great initiative in obtaining supplies from medical sources,
NGOs and other channels, but preventative vaccines for farm animals are limited. This reflects the



Technical Annex
Page 13 of 34
demand for treatment in emergency, but a reluctance on behalf of farmers to pay for preventative
medicine when resources are scarce.
39.   In the past the main diagnostic support has been provided by the Veterinary Institute attached to
the Faculty of Veterinary Science in Sarajevo which is reported to have suffered light war damage.
Regional Veterinary Institutes are located in Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica. The Mostar institute had been
previously located on the east side of town and is entirely destroyed without any equipment left. These
regional veterinary institutes were historically conceived to provide food hygiene services and provide
bacteriological culture, heavy metal determination, parasitological examinations and limited serology (at
Mostar and Tuzla only). All institutes are severely limited for want of diagnostic reagents, chemicals,
antigens and equipment. There are no facilities for immuno-fluorescent microscopy, ELISA testing or
blood analyses for metabolic profiles at the regional stations, although staff are familiar with the
techniques and appreciate the value that would be provided. A reliable and rapid diagnostic capability
will be essential within BH and although reference may be made to outside international services, a much
improved domestic service appears essential. The institutes again are reliant on fees raised for their
remuneration and operation of their institute.
20.    Throughout BH artificial insemination services are provided by the field veterinary stations.
Prior to the war 170,000 bovine inseminations were performed annually. This service is important to
small scale farmers who cannot maintain a bull, for breed improvement and disease control. Under war
conditions the Al service has been maintained by local initiative, with the help of NGOs and other donor
agencies. Communications and lack of vehicles for response to calls will undoubtedly have reduced
achievements with Al and poor fertility suspected to be associated with poor nutrition and timing of
insemination are problems. Liquid nitrogen supply is currently the major problem in the center of the
country. There is no central Al service structure as yet and semen is purchased by stations, most
commonly from Zagreb. Limited numbers of sheep and pig inseminations are also performed. All
services are paid for by the beneficiary.
21.   The system of delivery of veterinary services indicates that a private service is already being
provided, constrained only by the prescription of standardized charges and the inability of poor and
deprived clients to pay for the services provided. Under these circumstances providing free or subsidized
drugs to veterinarians or to farmers in war-damaged areas is likely to distort the emerging market. As
such areas are frequently localized and drugs are readily transportable, they are likely to circulate quickly
into other areas that have no need for such benefits. Established importers such as Bosna Vet, an
association of veterinarians at Zenica, could find their business threatened by unfair competition from
concessional aid. There will be other unidentified groups or individuals also dependent on such trade for
their livelihood. (There is no veterinary drug or vaccine production in BH, supplies commonly originate
from the company Plivu, Zagreb; medical drug manufacture in Sarajevo has the capability of formulating
and manufacturing some antibiotics that could be used for veterinary treatments).
Bank Pre-war Involvement in Agriculture
40.   BH has been involved in some 28 World Bank funded projects since the early 1970s. Five of
these were agriculturally related. A sixth loan, which was for forestry, was appraised, approved by the
Bank's Board but not signed by the Government. In each case, the participating BH agency was Privedna
Banka Sarajevo. Total Bank lending to BH's agriculture has been about US$96 million, some 15 percent
of total Bank lending to BH.

41.   A review of the completion reports of BH agricultural projects indicates that, as with other
projects in Yugoslavia, most were financed in an unstable macroeconomic environment involving a
distorted incentive system and weak intermediary financial institutions. Most of the funding under these
World Bank projects was to the socially-owned farm and enterprise sector. The limited amount of
financing available under the second and third agricultural credit projects, which were targeted to private
farmers, was normally only available to farmers having long-term contracts with social sector units. To
date, therefore, the Bank has had little experience in lending to the truly private agricultural sector within
BH. The proposed project would be the Bank's first operation in BH specifically aiming at this sector.

management advice, as well as agricultural aid coordination, to help with medium term programs and
establish the economic basis for agriculture in the future. Projects with a medium term perspective would
deal with rehabilitation and development of the forestry sector, vineyard and orchard replanting, the
creation of agricultural extension and other farmer support services, and would address specific issues
of agricultural and rural finance as well as those of agro-industries.

IBRD/ IDA Assistance Strategy
46.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-funded
reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the World Bank, IMF, EU, EBRD, and USAID in
late 1995 resulted in the preparation, with the Government, of a priority reconstruction program which
was presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels on December 20-
21, 1995. This program identified some US$5.1 billion of external financing needed to meet BH's urgent
reconstruction needs, of which US$1.8 billion would be needed in the first year, 1996. This first donor
meeting led to new donor conmmitments of some US$500 million for priority reconstruction activities for
the first quarter of 1996. Another conference is scheduled for spring of 1996 to seek financing pledges
from donors for the remainder of 1996 as well as to present needs for the entire reconstruction program.
47.   The Bank's own assistance strategy for BH consists of a two-track approach: First, prior to
financial normalization and membership in the World Bank Group, the Bank will support selected
immediate assistance programs through the special World Bank Trust Fund for BH (TFBH) in the amount
of US$150 million. Of these Trust Fund resources, US$125 million is to be extended at concessional
terms identical to those offered by IDA and US$25 million is to be provided as a grant. Second, once
the country becomes a World Bank Group member, a program of lending and technical assistance would
be initiated to support reconstruction and development, as well as economic transformation. The current
pipeline of operations in CY 1996-1997, to be financed both from the TFBH as well as subsequently from
regular World Bank Group resources, comprises a number of emergency-type projects, including this
proposed FRP, the above-mentioned Emergency Recovery Project, and prospective operations in gas,
district heating, transport, war victims rehabilitation, and water supply, followed by additional projects
in education, health, housing, employment generation, de-mining, electric power supply, forestry and
agricultural services, and a structural adjustment operation.

C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
48.   The urgent need to rebuild war-damaged private farms and to replace lost farm assets, in an
economic and social environment overburdened by the presence of displaced persons and refugees where
rural employment opportunities are scarce and food security is at stake, constitute the circumstances that
this Bank operation is designed to address. The objectives of the project are to jump-start agricultural
production, improve food security, and create employment and income for the war-affected rural
population including returning displaced persons. The project will primarily aim at the private farm
sector, with a priority for full-time farmers. The current emergency reconstruction phase calls for
projects with fast, direct impact on the ground; hence project design has been kept straightforward such
as to allow for speedy implementation.
49.   To achieve the above objectives, the project includes four components: (i) import of farm
mechanization equipment; (ii) import and domestic transfer of livestock; (iii) rebuilding and strengthening
of animai health services; and (iv) support to implement the project. Details of these components are
given below. Bank-financed project cost are estimated based on implementation in the Bosniac-Croat
Federation. An inclusion of the Republika Srpska under Bank-financing would require a revision of
project costs. Detailed cost tables are included in Appendix 1.
Farm Mechanization Component
50.   The project would provide an initial emergency supply of critically needed farm mechanization
equipment, including motor-cultivators, small- and medium-size tractors, tractor spare parts associated
with new machinery, tractor implements, and grain-combine harvesters, in order to replace lost farm
assets in war-affected areas of BH. Spare parts for existing machinery are not considered at the moment
because (i) the machinery is rather aged and does not merit major repairs; (ii) the project would aim to
provide farmers with only major equipment that they cannot afford from their own financial resources
at the present time; (iii) the cost of logistics required to provide the needed spare parts through the project
would probably not justify the expected benefits since, even after repair, most of the remaining farm
equipment is likely not to deliver satisfactory performance.
51.   The total base cost of this project component is US$ 31.4 million equivalent (see table below).
All equipment would be provided on the basis of in-kind supply and credit arrangements. A description
of the sub-components is provided below. Through the project, only a small fraction of the destroyed
and needed machinery (about 1.5 percent of two-axle-tractors and 14 percent of single-axle tractors) will
be covered. Hence, it will be possible to select among the target group full-time farmers with prior
experience in farming, such as to aim at maximum benefits from the equipment. A priority was given
to small-size, single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators, which are very popular in BH and most suitable for
the small plot sizes in the country, and also in order to maximize the number of private farmer-
beneficiaries under the project. Summary technical specifications are provided in Appendix 5.
52.   The supply of machines and implements through the project would involve, where appropriate,
existing dealers or workshops for agricultural machinery in order to promote private sector initiatives in
this sector. Suppliers of machines would be obliged to provide training for dealers and workshops
regarding repair, maintenance and handling of the new machines. They would also ensure that the future
supply of spare and replacement parts is guaranteed through commercial channels.

53.    Two-axle tractors (US$ 9.25 million equivalent base cost). Lack of farm power is one of the
major constraints to increase agricultural production in BH. As a result, large areas of arable land are
not cultivated at present. In view of the difficult topography of BH and the small farm structure, large
tractors cannot be used. Under the project, a total of about 750 two-axle tractors would be provided in
three ranges of tractors: 250 units of small standard tractors in the range of 18-26 kW with four-wheel
drive especially suited for farmers in hilly areas; and standard tractors in the range of 27-37 kW, both
with (200 units) and without (300 units) four-wheel drive, for larger farms in flat and slightly hilly areas.
54.    Accessory tools for two-axle tractors (US$ 1.5 million equivalent base cost). Along with the
tractors, a similar percentage of tractor implements has been destroyed or stolen. However, to simplify
project implementation, the rnumber of different implements for two-axle tractors, to be purchased under
the project, has been minimized and reduced to tractor trailers only. If additional cofinancing becomes
available during project implementation, more implements, such as tools for soil tillage and seed-bed
preparation, planting seeding and harvest would be purchased as well. The project would finance the
import of transport trailers, provided as a package together with the two-axle tractors. Since all trailers
are standardized and of rather simple technical nature, and as the power range of the provided tractors
is similar to those remaining operational at present, the imported implements would also fit to existing
tractors. Hence, farmers who only lack implements could obtain those under the project as well.

55.    Single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators (US$ 11.98 million equivalent base cost).  For the
provision of single-axle tractors, the same rationale applies as for the two-axle tractors. The main
objective is to increase availability of farm power, especially for very small farms or in extremely hilly
areas. As the use of these single-axle tractors is mainly for agriculture, and in view of the heavy soils
that are predominant in some parts of BH, a total of 3,700 medium and large size single-axle tractors will
be provided under the project, as follows: a total of 1,400 units each in the ranges 5-7 kW and 7-9 kW,
and 900 units in the 10 kW range.
56.    Accessory tools for single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators (US$ 4.93 million equivalent base cost).
Since single-axle tractors of the above size tend to lack standardization, each tractor will be delivered as
a package with a basic implement set comprising wheel ballast, plow, rotavator, ridger and a trailer.
Regarding the trailer, farmers will have a choice between free wheel trailers for flat areas and trailers



Technical Annex
Page 19 of 34
with wheels driven by the tractor for hilly areas. The total cost of these accessory tools provided in
packages would be US$ 3.73 million. Apart from these sets of standard implements, the project would
offer for about 50 percent of the single-axle tractors imported a pesticide sprayer attached with a 10 m
spray boom, at a combined cost of US$ 1.2 million. This would enable those farmers operating with
single-axle tractors on fairly flat land to properly apply pesticides on their field crops.
57.   Combine harvesters and grass mowers (US$ 1.81 million equivalent base cost). Grass and hay
harvest in hilly areas is at present done mostly by hand. The use of walking type self propelled grass
mowers would increase the output from 0.3 ha/day up to an estimated 2.7 ha/day. This technology is
known in BH and used on a limited basis so far. As forage harvest is considered a major bottleneck in
livestock areas, those machines provide a very useful input to increase harvest capacity, and the project
would finance 200 units at a combined cost of US$ 0.3 million. Untimely harvest, caused by a severe
lack of combine harvester capacity, has led to low crop yields, specifically in wheat combine harvesters.
Due to the difficult topographic situation and limited plot sizes, the smallest standard combines available
with working widths of about 2.5 m are envisaged for financing under the project. Only for flat areas,
larger combines of 3-4 m width will be provided. For the combines under the project, maize headers
for grain maize harvest will be included. The total cost of 10 combines with implements under the
project would be US$ 1.51 million.
58.   To assist in the review of specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the procurement
of equipment and spare parts, the project would finance expatriate (6 man/months) and domestic (12 m/ni)
mechanization experts, at a total cost of US$ 96,000. Farmer training and education (12 m/m) would
be provided at a cost of US$ 180,000, focussing on the most productive use of the supplied equipment
in the soil conditions of BH. The project would also finance fees of the procurement agent (2 percent
of the import cost of goods), the cost of domestic transport (2 percent), handling and storage (0.5
percent), and local distribution to farmers (1 percent), at a combined estimated cost of US$ 1.62 million.
Livestock Production Component
59.   To assist in the initial rebuilding of the national herds for milk and meat production, the project
would finance the purchase of livestock such as cattle, goat, and sheep, to be kept by private individual
small-scale farmers. The total base cost of the component would be US$ 14.0 million equivalent (see
table below). To the extent available and suitable, livestock would be procured from regional or domestic
sources, such as for Pramenka sheep. All livestock would be distributed to farmers on the basis of in-
kind supply and credit arrangements, described in sections further below. The livestock production
component has the below-described four sub-components.
60.   Importation of cattle (US$ 8.8 million equivalent base cost). A total of about 5,000 pregnant
heifers of the Simmental, Brown Swiss and Grey Tyrol breeds at an estimated average unit cost of US$
1,760 would be imported for distribution to farmers who have lost cattle and have the experience and
capability of caring for them. These breeds are well accepted in the respective areas and being dual
purpose breeds have both meat and milk potential. Additional costs would arise from cattle procurement,
transport and international travel for specialists from BH to approve selection of the appropriate type of
animals, feed costs whilst in reception and quarantine, and for veterinary attention at the same time.
Provisional technical specifications and required sanitary conditions for the importation have been
prepared and are provided in Appendix 5. The number of imported cattle for this emergency project is
substantial, but nevertheless modest enough to take into account the considerable logistic problems of the
transport of large numbers of animals to war-torn areas in the first year of recovery, the recent



Technical Annex
Page 20 of 34
experiences of cattle imports by international donors, and the problems of animal quarantine in the first
year. This component would be implemented in two stages of about equal financial value, with the
second stage depending on successful implementation of the first stage.

61.   Goat importation (US$ 0.99 million equivalent base cost). A total of 3,000 goats of the Alpsko-
Srnaste, Sanksa and Toggenburg breeds would be imported at an average cost of US$ 330 each. These
animals would be young does and bucks of breeding age, in a ratio of 10 females to one male. The high
ratio of dows is advised as goats will be distributed to small scattered households and a lower ratio may
limit breeding success. Technical specifications are provided in Appendix 5. Pregnant females are not
categorically specified; with the shorter duration of pregnancy in this species, in contra-distinction to
cattle, it may be difficult to assemble pregnant goats at suitable times for shipment. Although goats have
a wider breeding stason than sheep, many goats kid in the spring months at which time the main
shipments will be made. For health reasons, the transport of heavily pregnant does is to be avoided.
62.   Sheep importation (US$ 2.1 million equivalent base cost). While, in some cases, importation of
sheep has proven unsuccessful in the past, technical experts in the Government point out that sheep of
the Wuerttemberg type is most suitable for the climatic conditions in BH. Under the project, it is
envisaged to import up to 3,000 sheep of this type, at a unit cost of US$ 700.
63.   Pramenka sheep breed conservation and expansion (US$ 0.48 million equivalent base cost). As
set out further above, the various types of Pramenka sheep are uniquely adapted to the production
environment of the interior of BH. Under the project, a scheme would be established to conserve and
expand the Pramenka breed. Existing sheep farmers with surplus female lambs of good quality would
be encouraged to sell these lambs for onward distribution to beneficiaries with small flocks to build up
head numbers. A purchase price of US$ 120 equivalent is envisaged for weaned lambs which would
allow the conservation of some 4,000 breeding females. A comparable scheme already operates in the
Herzegovina region, and advice on the implementation and full consistency with this scheme will be
essential. The Association of Private Farmer in Travnik, given adequate accountability, would be a focus
for participation and implementation of this scheme.
64.   To assist in the review of specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the procurement
of animals, including inspection of suitable animals and suppliers abroad, the project would finance
expatriate (6 man/months) and domestic (12 m/m) livestock experts, at a total cost of US$ 96,000. The



Technical Annex
Page 21 of 34
project would also finance fees of the procurement agent (2 percent), the cost of domestic transport (5
percent), handling/ storage/ quarantine (5 percent), as well as local distribution to farmers (1 percent),
at a combined estimated cost of some US$ 1.53 million.
Animal Health Services Component
65.    To quickly restore vital animal health services in areas of wide-spread destruction, the project
would finance the equipment, drugs, as well as basic building repairs for veterinary stations, veterinary
institutes, and artificial insemination (AI) services. The total base cost of this component would be US$
2.1 million equivalent (see table below). Drugs and vaccines would be provided to private, damaged
veterinary stations against nearly commercial credit arrangements, such as not to interfere with competing
private veterinarians that have not suffered war damage. Investment goods such as equipment for
veterinarians, including equipment for Al services, would be provided at concessional credit terms, while
building repairs for veterinary stations would be grants. Assistance to veterinary institutes would also
be grants. This project component has the below-described five sub-components.

66.    Eguipment for veterinary stations (US$ 0.51 million equivalent base cost). The project would
support the supply of 40 damaged veterinary field stations with essential animal health instruments and
equipment, at a package cost of US$ 12,750 (see Appendix 5 for a detailed listing). The equipment
would be shared by groups of about 4 veterinarians working from one field station, hence a total of 160
veterinarians would benefit from this sub-component. The equipment would cover clinical diagnosis, as
well as medical and surgical treatments of both farm and companion animals.
67.    Drugs and vaccines for veterinarv stations (US$ 0.39 million equivalent base cost). The project
would finance the import of selected, critical drugs for bovine fertility (US$ 41,000), sera (US$ 7,000),
as well as vaccines (US$ 190,000). A contingency provision of US$ 150,000 is included to meet
emergencies and re-order vaccines for endemic diseases as initial supplies are used up.
68.    While comprehensive lists of vaccine requirements have been provided by the Government, these
represent the complete range of diseases known to occur in the country. However, BH is not isolated
from commercial traffic and emergency supplies of vaccines may be ordered to specific requirements and



Technical Annex
Page 22 of 34
delivered rapidly by air in the face of epidemic disease. Furthermore, due to the non-intensive livestock
husbandry methods adopted, infectious diseases are not a primary issue. The list of vaccines presented
for immediate procurement in Appendix 5 reflects this evaluation and the capability of the veterinary
services to deliver the vaccinations. The therapeutic drugs selected address problems of bovine post
partum infertility, for use by veterinarians in the war damaged areas.
69.   Building repairs of veterinary stations (US$ 0.4 million equivalent base cost). War damage to
veterinary stations ranges from complete destruction to only minor damage. The project would finance
building repairs to 40 selected stations with light to medium damage to put them back to work. A lump
sum of US$ 10,000 per station is budgeted. The exact amount to be spent on each station would be
subject to structural and quantitative surveys. Implementation would be carried out by local contractors.
70.   Equipment for veterinary institutes (US$ 0.35 million equivalent base cost). The restoration of
sufficient veterinary diagnostic within BH capability is of priority. Detailed study of the specific
requirements of the Veterinary Faculty in Sarajevo and the regional veterinary institutes will be carried
out under the project to determine their specific diagnostic requirements and range of equipment to be
provided in order to restart their diagnostic activities. This would include an emergency budget of US$
50,000 for the immediate purchase of diagnostic reagents, chemicals, antigens, etc. to restore diagnostics
with the limited equipment currently available. A budget of US$ 300,000 under the project would
subsequently finance required veterinary diagnostic equipment.
71.   Eguipment and supplies for Al services (US$ 0.35 million equivalent base cost). While Al field
equipment is generally available with veterinary stations, there is a severe lack of liquid nitrogen. On
the basis of a further field survey of the precise needs of Al service providers in BH, the project would
finance emergency supplies and equipment for Al services up to a budget limited of US$ 0.35 million.
72.   To assist in the review of veterinary specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the
procurement of equipment and drugs, the project would finance expatriate (3 man/months) and domestic
(6 m/m) veterinary experts, at a total cost of US$ 48,000. The project would also finance fees of the
procurement agent (2 percent), the cost of domestic transport (2 percent), handling and storage (0.5
percent), as well as local distribution (1 percent), at a combined estimated cost of some US$ 88,000.
Project Implementation Support
73.    Given the tight fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from the war, the
project would finance all required incremental foreign and local cost of implementing this operation, as
set out in the table below. At a total base cost of US$ 1.55 million equivalent, this will include office
equipment and vehicles (US$ 0.49 million), technical assistance, training and studies (US$ 0.9 million),
as well incremental local staff cost and incremental office operating cost (US$ 0.16 million). This would
cover, for the first project year, the operations of the central PIU in Sarajevo and of the regional
implementation units, after which the project is expected to be substantially implemented. Government
resources would be used to extend implementation support activities beyond the first year, if required.

Project Cost and Financing Plan
74.   Project Cost. The total estimated cost of the project equals US$ 70.4 million equivalent,
including physical contingencies of 3 percent on goods and 7 percent on works. No price contingencies
have been included given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Project costs
are summarized in the table below and presented in more detail in Appendix 1.

75.   Financing Plan. The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be the Recipient of the funds to be
provided by various donors. Of the total project cost, the Bank would finance US$ 20.0 million
equivalent at IDA terms. Donor financing (US$ 15.6 million) has been secured from the following
sources: European Commission (expected contribution of about ECU 4.0 million, to be disbursed in two
tranches, equivalent to some US$ 5.2 million); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD,



Technical Annex
Page 24 of 34
US$ 7.3 million equivalent); German Government (US$ 2.2 million equivalent); and Dutch Government
(US$ 0.9 million equivalent). Additional financing of US$ 14.8 million equivalent is being sought from
other donors (see financing plan table below). In the event such additional financing could not be
mobilized by the time of effectiveness of the Bank Credit, the project scope would be adjusted through
a reduction of imported farm mechanization equipment and imported livestock. A respective project
module has been identified for exclusion from the project.

76.   Taxes. The Trust Fund resources provided by the World Bank cannot be used to finance local
taxes (such as customs duties, sales tax, income tax, etc.). For this purpose, the BH government will
set up a special fund with contributions from donors, including support from those of balance of payment
lending or grants. This donor-financed fund would allow the financing of tax payments for those
beneficiaries who cannot afford this payment.
77.   Retroactive Financing. Since the project is expected to be considered by the Board of Directors
in March 1996, with effectiveness not before April 1996, retroactive financing in an amount equivalent
to 10 percent of the Bank Credit will be included for urgent purchases of priority farm machinery as well
as selected office equipment. In particular, retroactive financing is necessary for the purchase of selected
farm equipment such as accessory tools for those motor-cultivators and tractors that are existing in the
country, which would be put to use during the late spring of 1996 even before other machinery under
the project would be financed and imported. Retroactive financing will also be used for office equipment
and key technical assistance required to set up the project implementation infrastructure. Procurement
for retroactive financing will follow the overall procurement guidelines agreed under the project,
described further below. To advance delivery/ completion further, advance contracting will be used to
the maximum extent possible, subject to approval and effectiveness of financing.
Financial and Economic Justification
78.   The project is designed to meet about 10 percent of the urgent needs to re-install farm power and
provide livestock breeding material and veterinary support to make up for war damage. The resulting
benefits of these activities refer both to a return to productive use of land currently not in production, and
to increased output on land already in production. In addition to incremental farm and food output, the
project would generate employment and income for the rural population. This would also and particularly
benefit demobilized soldiers and former industrial, now unemployed workers, through increased



Technical Annex
Page 25 of 34
opportunities for full-time work and farming on lands formerly farmed on a part-time basis only.
79.   The expected production increase from farm mechanization is being supported by the supply of
donor-financed urgent farm inputs for the 1996 spring and autumn planting seasons within the framework
of the above-mentioned ERP. The machinery provided under the proposed project would typically be
used to cultivate land not planted during the previous year. The 750 two-axle tractors and 3,700 motor-
cultivators are likely to result in incremental cultivation of some 35,000 ha (20 ha per tractor and 5 ha
per motor-cultivator). The increase in food crops (mainly cereals and potatoes) is estimated at some 100-
120,000 tons of grains and some 20,000 tons of potatoes. With benefits valued at current international
prices, the farm mechanization component is expected to yield high rates of return. Incremental
production as a result of the livestock component would consist of additional milk, cheese, meat, and,
to a lesser extent, wool. Rates of return on the livestock component would also be high. Additional
substantial benefits would arise from the reduction and eventual phase-out of donor-financed food aid
deliveries into BH through substitution of the incremental domestic agricultural production for imported
food.
Environmental Aspects
80.   The project has been placed in environmental category B. Any project components which present
an opportunity for environmental enhancement will be designed accordingly, and all components will be
monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no degradation to the environment.

D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION
Project Organization
81.   MOF/ MAWF. Under the overall guidance and supervision by State-level Ministry of Finance
as the Recipient of the Bank Credit, the newly created Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and
Forestry (MAWF) at the Federation level will be responsible for implementation of the project, with
respect to project beneficiaries situated within the Federation. The new MAWF has been established as
of February 1, 1996 and will draw on staff and expertise from the previous Department of Agriculture
and Food Production in the Ministry of Energy and Industry, as well as from the Ministry of
Construction and Natural Resources. An agricultural ministry with the same name and functions existed
before the war; however, given the tight budgetary situation and the reduced number of sector specialists
available in the Government, strong initial support from external experts is required to assist MAWF in
timely project start-up and implementation.
82.   The PIU. A central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in Sarajevo is to be operated jointly by
the State-level Ministry of Finance and the new MAWF and is scheduled to continue operations for an
initial period of 12 months, to be extended using Government resources if required for project
completion. The PIU is headed by a Director (12 m/m) and would include two Logistics officers (12
m/m each). The PIU would also have four Staff Assistants, including a project accountant (total of 48
m/m). During the initial procurement phase, the PIU would engage two domestic Farm Mechanization
experts (6 m/m each), two Livestock specialists (6 in/m each), and two Veterinary advisors (3 m/m each).
The PIU would be supported by internationally recruited staff including a Farm Mechanization Adviser
(6 m/m), a Livestock Procurement Adviser (6 m/m), an Animal Health Expert (3 m/m), a Financial
Controller (6 m/m), and a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist (6 m/m).
83.   Procurement Agents. Procurement of project items would be initiated at the earliest possible
time. The farm mechanization advisor to the PIU will be recruited by April 1996, using Dutch grant
funds. Based on the existing technical specifications for farm equipment to be imported under the project,
bidding documents are being developed by domestic procurement advisors that are already in place under
the above-mentioned ERP which is in implementation since early March 1996. Arrangements will be
made to engage an experienced domestic or international trade firm as Procurement Agents (PAs), or a
respective joint-venture, by about May 1, 1996. The PAs would work in close collaboration with the
PIU, as well as with technical staff at MAWF and project. implementation staff at the Canton level.
84.   RIUs. In the Federation of BH, project implementation in the regions will be under the
responsibility of the (to-be-created) Canton departments of agriculture, water resources and forestry,
coordinated through four Regional Implementation Units (RlUs) at the Canton level in Bihac, Mostar,
Tuzla and Zenica. Two additional regional units at the District level would be established in the
Republika Srpska, following very close coordination with the international donor community and in
consultation with key institutions of the peace process, including the Office of the High Representative;
RIU-related funds have been budgeted for this purpose under the project to allow for quick start-up of
these 2 additional RIUs. RIUs will each be headed by a Director (8 m/m) and would be supported by
one professional Technical Expert (8 m/m), two Staff Assistants (8 m/m each), and an internationally
recruited Regional Project Officer (8 m/m). The RIUs would cover project activities in those neighboring
Cantons which do not have an RIU. RIUs are scheduled to operate for an initial period of about 8
months, to be extended using Government resources if required to complete project implementation.



Technical Annex
Page 27 of 34
85.    Municipalities. Final distribution of imported farm equipment and livestock will be carried out
through and by the municipalities. A two-stage selection process will be followed to select ultimate
beneficiaries under the project, as follows:  Based on farm  damage and needs surveys in each
municipality, a group of municipalities with heavy war damage to agricultural production will be selected
by the PIU to participate in the project. The imported items will be allocated by the PIU to specific
municipalities within this group. Subsequently, each of the selected municipalities will be in charge to
identify interested and eligible private farmers within their community to obtain the goods and livestock
provided under the project (the agreed farmer eligibility criteria are described further below).  In
coordination with and under supervision by the RIUs, municipalities will select these farmers, and
organize the final delivery of goods and livestock against signature of supply and credit agreements.
Project Implementation
86.    Project Implementation Schedule. To allow for swift implementation of this emergency-type
operation, procedures for project implementation have to be kept highly straightforward. The two main
project activities are procurement and distribution of farm machinery and livestock. In order to secure
early arrival and expedient distribution of procured items, a detailed Project Implementation Schedule has
been developed and is attached as Appendix 2. The early start of project activities will ensure that many
project items can already be utilized for the 1996 summer harvest and fall planting season. The project
is designed to allow for comp!etion of all activities relating to procurement and distribution within a 12-15
month time frame.
87.    Recruitment of local project staff and the setting up of the PIU and the RIUs has already started,
and would be finalized as soon as the new MAWF is fully operational. In order to ensure an early start
of activities, some of the international staff positions may be filled through alternative interim funding
(such as donor trust fund arrangements, if available) until the project is approved and the Bank Credit
as well as donor funding becomes available. Some grant resources of the Dutch Government have
already been made available. Identification of potential beneficiaries, following an agreed set of criteria,
has also been initiated. This will start through an overall damage assessment in all 60+ municipalities
of the Federation, which would be the basis for an emergency needs assessment and for the selection of
municipalities to be included under the project. In parallel, RIUs will initiate the identification of dealers
for farm machinery distribution, and of farmers as mechanization and livestock recipients.
88.    Farm machinery. For farm machinery, preparation of tender documents is underway through a
team of domestic procurement advisors (in place under the ERP), based on the list of equipment and
technical specifications already established. International Competitive Bidding, Limited International
Bidding, and International Shopping will be used. Tender documents will include provision for delivery
of equipment through transport agents to delivery depots at the four RIU locations. From there,
machinery will be delivered, via the selected local dealers, to recipient farmers through in-kind credit
arrangements at concessional terms (10 year maturity, 2 years grace, up to 2 percent interest, based on
DEM import value of items). RIUs would develop and provide standardized, simple supply and credit
agreements. Credit repayment would be through local credit institutions, selected based on their fees and
quality of service in handling accounts for the PIU/RIUs. No equipment would be distributed to State-
owned farms or enterprises (more than 50 percent of capital in State ownership).
89.    Supply and credit agreements. Disbursements under the Bank Credit for farm equipment will
start once the PIU will have entered into supply and credit agreements with eligible farmers representing
at least 10 percent of the value of farm equipment to be financed by the Bank Credit. The specific



Technical Annex
Page 28 of 34
eligibility criteria for farmers mentioned further below will apply. The supply and credit agreements will
set out: (i) the value of the goods supplied, based on the import value, expressed in convertible currency;
(ii) the total value of the supply and credit agreement, not to exceed US$ 250,000 equivalent per
agreement; (iii) the fact that the in-kind credit carries low interest (up to 2 percent) and no other charges;
(iv) the need for the borrower to obtain adequate guarantees and collateral; (v) the credit term (for farm
equipment: 10 years maturity, 2 years of grace); (vi) credit repayment arrangements through local credit
institutions; and (vii) requirements for adequate servicing and storage of items, including the need to
maintain service and performance records.
90.    Livestock importation. Detailed specifications for imported livestock (cattle, goats and sheep)
have been established. Tender documents will be prepared by the PIU/PA with assistance of the
international livestock expert. Selected pre-qualified livestock agents will carry out a market survey to
identify suitable international suppliers of livestock. The selected livestock would be inspected on-site
by a team including representatives of the PA and MAWF, including the expatriate Livestock
Procurement Advisor to the PIU. Tender documents would specify delivery in two groups in May/June
and in September/October of 1996, to ensure that livestock is arriving during suitable weather conditions;
international delivery would be to specified at quarantine stations in the four RIU locations. By end-April
1996, quarantine stations will need to have been identified and prepared for this delivery up-front by
MAWF and PIU staff. Final delivery of livestock to eligible farmers would be arranged through local
veterinarians, with RIU staff finalizing the in-kind credit arrangements (repayment to RIUs through the
first female off-spring of equal quality; no interest). Local veterinarians will provide subsequent
extension to recipient farmers, to be paid for by the farmers themselves.
91.    Pramenka sheep. The local production and delivery of Pramenka sheep will be arranged in close
cooperation with local farmers associations such as the Association of Private Farmers in Travnik. They
will identify suitable producers of lambs and inform them of the possibility to rear lambs for sale for
breeding rather than slaughter. Procurement of lambs will be arranged through pre-arranged market days
for this purpose, where inspection of lambs by veterinarians and procurement by staff from RIUs and PAs
would take place. The procured lambs will be delivered to eligible farmers through the farmers
associations in close cooperation with the RIUs and local veterinarians. The latter will provide required
extension advice. Lambs would be distributed to farmers in the same vicinity as they were produced
since Pramenka sheep are sensitive to changes in locality. The same in-kind credit arrangements would
be used as for imported livestock.
92.    Veterinary drugs and equipment. civil works.  The procurement of veterinary drugs and
equipment, including for Al services, would be based on an established list of items. Preparation of
tender documents will be carried out by PIU/PA, with assistance by the expatriate Veterinary Expert to
the PIU. Veterinary equipment will be delivered to RIU depots for further delivery to relevant veterinary
stations. Drugs and vaccines will be delivered from RIU depots to veterinary stations against in-kind
credit arrangements at 3 months maturity, with no interest, while equipment for veterinary stations will
have concessional terms (2 year maturity, no interest). The rehabilitation of veterinary stations through
building repairs would be based on a simplified survey of required civil works for each station. RIUs
would pay directly to the contractors. These works are grants for veterinary stations. Equipment
supplied to veterinary institutes would be grants as well.



Technical Annex

Eligibility Criteria for Farmers
93.    Selection of farmers to receive imported farm machinery and livestock in order to quickly rebuild
their war-damaged farms will be based on the following criteria.
Farmer Selection Criteria:
First, farmer-beneficiaries need to be located in areas that have suffered substantial war damage;
substantial war damage is defined as areas where more than 50 percent of farm machinery/ livestock
has been destroyed. Second, in addition to the first criterion, farmer-beneficiaries must have suffered
the loss of a tractor/ of livestock due to the war. And third, in addition, priority will be given to
farmers who are currently refugees or internally displaced persons, and who intend to return to their
farms. Beneficiaries fulfilling all three criteria will be given highest priority. Secondary priority will
be given to farmers fulfilling the first two criteria. Third priority will be given to farmers fulfilling
only the first criterion.
General Eligibilitv Criteria:
a. Farmers or potential farmers must have title or some form of user rights to the land;
b. Farmers must demonstrate their intention to rebuild and operate the farm by starting repairs and/or
beginning crop production;
c. Farmers must demonstrate their capacity to repay the in-kind loan, based on expected farm cash-flow;
d. Farmers must provide guarantees from family, friends or neighbors, or provide property as loan
collateral;
e. A minimum farm size of 10 hectares (owned or partially leased land, or share agreements with
neighboring farmers) is required for the supply of two-axle tractors;
f. Farmers must have adequate servicing/storage conditions for the new tractor;
g. Farmers must have adequate shelter for the new livestock and be able to provide sufficient feed of
suitable quality;
h. Farmers with tractors must be able to hire/purchase some tractor implements and buy spare parts;
i. Farmers with livestock must have access to veterinarian support and artificial insemination services;
j. Farmers must have access to adequate marketing facilities (farmer/cooperative markets, cooperative
processing centers, agro-processing enterprises, etc.);
k. Farmers must agree to maintain service records for tractors and machinery and/or performance
records for livestock.
Procurement
94.    The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below and are in line with
the agreed procedures for "Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Procurement under Emergency
Projects", as issued by the Bosnia Ad-hoc Advisory Committee on January 4, 1996. The proposed
project procurement plan is attached in Appendix 3. In case of parallel financing (such as funding by the
European Commission, IFAD, or by bilateral donors), the applicable procurement procedures of the
respective financiers would be applied. To respond in a timely fashion to the post-war emergency
situation in BH, the below-described procurement methods would be used.

95.   Goods. For goods, the following procurement procedures will be followed:
(a) ICB.  For procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$ 5 million each, simplified
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used. Regarding advertisement, a General
Procurement Notice (GPN) has been published in the Development Business in March 1996
(the GPN is attached in Appendix 4). This notice includes information about the nature of
goods and services to be procured and invites interested and eligible suppliers to send their
expression of interest to the PIU. The GPN will also be published in the local press. The
GPN will be followed by specific advertisements for individual contracts in the local press.
Bidding documents will be sent to suppliers who respond to the GPN. For ICB packages,
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used, to be customized by the PIU and
approved by the Bank prior to bidding. The period allowed for submission of bids may be
reduced to four weeks. Bid and payment currency will be limited to one currency widely
used in international trade.
(b) LIB.  Limited International Bidding (LIB), tendering by invitation, will be used for procurement
packages estimated to cost over US$ 2 million and up to US$ 5 million each. Exceptions to
this threshold will be applied in cases where there will be only a limited number of suppliers.
The List of LIB bidders will be based on the expressions of interest received in response to
the GPN as well as other sources, such as PAs' own experience, etc. The list will be as
broad as possible. Geographical distribution will be considered to the maximum extent
possible. For LIB packages, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used. In order
to gain speed, LIB bidding documents will be sent by fax and bidders will be allowed to send
their bids by fax as well. However, the PIU and the PAs will be required to put in place a
mechanism, satisfactory to the Bank, to ensure transparency and fairness and to avoid any
manipulation of bids received by fax. LIB contracts will require prior approval of the Bank
relating to the list of suppliers and technical specifications.
(c) IS/NS. International Shopping (IS) will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard
specification commodities, estimated to cost between US$ 200,000 and US$ 2 million per
contract. IS procedures are based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least
three suppliers in two countries. An IS document, including contract conditions, has been
prepared and will be used for IS contracts. National Shopping (NS) will be used for goods
available within BH, such as office furniture and supplies, up to an estimated cost of US$
200,000 per contract with at least three quotations from national suppliers.
96.   Consultant and commercial services, incremental operating cost. Consultant and commercial
services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both cotnpetition and
sole sourcing. Given the emergency nature of the project, services of procurement agents may be
procured through direct, separate negotiations with a few qualified agents, as there are only a limited
number of contracts that could be handled at minimum cost. Sole sourcing of services should be justified
in each case. Such justification may be the timing constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and lack of
candidates given the situation in BH. No assignments have been pre-identified for sole sourcing. Any
sole sourcing during implementation will be subject to the Bank's approval. Follow-up assignments will
be permissible to the extent that this will be indicated in the initial Terms of Reference for assignments.
Incremental operating cost, such office rent, utilities, and incremental local staff cost, would be procured
in accordance with local practices.



Technical Annex
Page 32 of 34
97.   Use of specialized agencies of the United Nations. The services of the United Nations specialized
agencies can be engaged on a sole-source basis for those items which are in their programs. For the
proposed project, this may apply to expert consultant services in the agriculture sector offered by FAO.
Speed and reasonableness of price should be considered when contracting these agencies.
98.   Procurement implementation capacity. As the Recipient of the funds is likely to be short of the
capacity essential for carrying out procurement of goods and services in the timely manner required, the
services of procurement agents (PAs) would be engaged to assist the PIU in this task. The PAs would
be responsible for carrying out all procurement of goods in accordance with the agreed procedures. The
PAs would also be responsible for carrying out inspections of delivered goods and for certifying payments
in accordance with contract conditions. The individual procurement advisors in the PIU would be
responsible for day-to-day coordination of procurement work. They would be responsible for contract
management and supervision, and for cooperation with the World Bank and PAs. Procurement training
of PIU staff is included under the project.
99.   Prior and post Bank review of procurement documents. Bank Standard Bidding Documents will
be used for ICB and LIB procurement packages. The Bank has also prepared the invitation to quote and
contract document for IS. These documents will be used for procurement under the project. For LIB
below US$ 5 million and IS, the documents and awards would not require any further prior reviews by
the Bank. Technical specifications and data sheets of ICB documents, and documents for LIB above US$
5 million, will require prior Bank review and approval. For consultants' contracts, the Bank's standard
form of consultant contracts would be used. Consultant contracts exceeding US$ 100,000 per contract
for firms and US$ 50,000 per contract for individuals will require prior Bank review of budgets, short-
lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals received, evaluation reports and contracts. Sole
source contracts not included in the procurement plan would be subject to the Bank's prior approval.
100.  Post reviews of procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly basis by Bank supervision
missions. Furthermore, post review monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through quarterly
reporting, which will be part of the regular quarterly progress reports described further below. These
reports would include, inter alia, the type of items and value of procurement packages, the kind of
procurement method followed, the numbers and values of bids received, the name of the winning
supplier, as well as the key dates of the bidding, award and contract completion process.
Disbursements
101.  The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Appendix 1. Disbursements are expected
to be completed within a period of two years from the date of effectiveness. The project and the Bank
Credit would finance the categories of expenditures outlined in the table below.
102.  Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Recipient would establish a
Special Account in the central bank or a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. The Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be US$ 4.0 million, representing about
three to four months (average) of the Bank's share of estimated expenditures expected to be paid from
the Special Account. Therefore, for this emergency operation, the standard limit for the Authorized
Allocation of 10 percent of the Credit amount would be exceeded, to take account of the expected rapid
pace of disbursement. Under the same rationale, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be
equal to the Authorized Allocation of US$ 4.0 million. Replenishment applications would be forwarded
to the Bank monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.



Technical Annex
Page 33 of 34
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described
in the Bank's Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account
which have been reconciled by the Recipient would accompany all replenishment requests. For large
contracts of farm equipment, the Bank would make direct payments to suppliers. The minimum size of
application for direct withdrawal from the Credit account, or for issuance of a Special Commitment, will
be 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation to the Special Account.

103.  Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs) for goods-related contracts of up to US$ 5.0 million equivalent, for which detailed documents
evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the PIU and made available for the required audit as well
as to Bank supervision missions. Disbursements for contracts exceeding US$ 5.0 million equivalent
would be made against presentation to the Bank of full contract documentation. In the case of contracts
for consultant services, the SOE contract limit will be US$ 100,000 equivalent for firms and US$ 50,000
equivalent for individual experts.  The SOE limit for contracts for commercial services and for
expenditures relating to incremental operating cost will be US$ 100,000. The project completion date
would be December 31, 1997.
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting
104.  Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established with the PIU within MAWF/
the State Ministry of Finance. These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the Bank
Credit with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying documentation; (ii) a record of transactions
on the Special Account and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical assistance to
the PIU has been included under the project to establish proper accounts and financial controlling
procedures.
105.  Audits. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors and under terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account
and for Statement of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest



Technical Annex
Page 34 of 34
six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year after they
have been audited.
106.  Reporting. The PIU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly progress report showing
the status of implementation of the project, including summary information on procurement contracts,
as well as a financial report in a format acceptable to the Bank. The detailed outline of the quarterly
progress reports has been agreed during Credit Negotiations.
Supervision Plan
107.  Project implementation would incorporate a large degree of flexibility in view of the fact that it
will need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances in the country. Implementation progress would be
formally evaluated at mid-term, i.e. approximately 6 months after effectiveness. In addition, during the
first 6 months of implementation, the Bank's new Resident Mission in Sarajevo would continuously
supervise all initial project implementation steps, and would assist closely on matters requiring advice and
rapid decisions by the Bank. In particular, procurement and disbursements would require intensive
supervision, given the flexibilities built in implementation. The PIU would collect data from the RIUs
which would compile short monthly activity and progress reports.
Agreements Reached
108.  During negotiations, the following agreements have been reached: The State Ministry of Finance,
as Recipient, represented through the PIU, will allocate project funds for the purchase of goods, works
and services, according to the project design. The Recipient will maintain the PIU and regional
implementation units with adequate staffing to ensure timely and orderly project implementation. Farm
mechanized equipment financed under the Credit will be supplied to farmers selected in accordance with
the agreed priority and eligibility criteria for project beneficiaries. Supply and credit agreements between
the PIU and beneficiaries will be used. These agreements will be limited to US$250,000 each and will
specify: the value of the equipment, expressed in convertible currency; the interest charge of up to 2
percent per annum; the term of the credits of up to ten years maturity and two years of grace; credit
guarantees or collateral provided by the beneficiary; credit repayment arrangements through local credit
institutions; and requirements for adequate servicing and storage facilities as well as for maintenance of
service and performance records. Project accounting, audits and reporting will be carried out in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
