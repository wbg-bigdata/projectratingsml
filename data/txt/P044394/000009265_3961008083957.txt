MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION, ACTING AS
TRUSTEE FOR THE TRUST FUND FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA,
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF US$20 MILLION EQUIVALENT
TO BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
FOR AN EMERGENCY FARM RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit
to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the amount equivalent to US$20.0 million to help finance an Emergency
Farm Reconstruction Project (FRP). The proposed Credit would be on International Development
Association (IDA) terms, with 40 year maturity, including 10 years of grace. Cofinancing and parallel
financing in an amount of US$30.4 million equivalent is also expected from other donors.
2.    Background. The results of more than 3 years of war have been devastating in all economic
sectors. In agriculture, the decline in farm production and the breakdown of normal food processing,
distribution and marketing systems has led to a major threat to the survival of millions of displaced
persons, refugees and other war-affected population segments. Only the joint efforts of the international
community prevented large-scale hunger and malnutrition in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). With the
Dayton-Paris peace agreement signed and peace implementation forces in place, it is imperative to revive
quickly BH's domestic agricultural production in order improve food security, reduce the dependence on
food aid, and generate urgently needed rural employment for displaced persons and refugees who will
depend on agriculture as their only temporary source of income.
3.    The war has caused a major disruption of agricultural production because of very large population
movements that have occurred since 1992, and due to the damage to and destruction of farm equipment,
livestock, crops and input supplies. War damage occurred both on individual, small-scale private farms,
as well as on State-owned farms and former socially-owned agro-processing enterprises. Farm equipment
was stolen or destroyed, irrigation systems vandalized, livestock taken or slaughtered, houses and barns
burned, while vineyards and orchards in war areas were not cultivated for several years and are generally
damaged to an extent that complete replacement of plants is required. Many fields along confrontation
lines are heavily mined, putting the lives of returning farmers at risk. The country's few agricultural
research and animal health institutions were also vandalized and many qualified staff have left the
country. Clearly, a first priority to jump-start production is to help farmers obtain seasonal inputs and
other resources necessary to restart farming. The Government estimates total, direct war damage to
primary agricultural production in BH at US$4.5 billion, or about 9 percent of total estimated war
damage in all sectors of the economy.
4.    Even before the war, BH needed to import some half of required basic foods from the outside,
mainly from other Yugoslav Republics. By the end of the war, domestic food production has fallen to
only about one third of needs. Well-organized seed distribution programs, which were implemented by
humanitarian relief organizations, UNHCR, and the Office of Special Relief Operations of the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) during the 1994 fall and 1995 spring planting seasons, have stopped the
continuous decline in wheat production in Federation territory. However, 1995 production of wheat and
maize continued to drop considerably in the Republika Srpska, causing total 1995 grain production in BH
to fall by one quarter from 1994 harvest levels.



- 2 -
5.    With a decline of domestic food production, the disruption of transportation channels preventing
commercial imports, and the population's lack of purchasing power to buy food, donor-provided food
aid has kept BH alive over the years of war. Food aid will remain vital to ensure food security in the
first years of peace. Under organization by the World Food Programme (WFP) with logistical support
from UNHCR, up to 2.7 million people or 80 percent of the estimated current population benefit from
food aid, including 1.3 million displaced people/refugees and 1.4 million other war-affected, at a monthly
import cost to donors of about US$20 million. Many of the most vulnerable groups remain fully
dependent on food aid as their only source of nutrition. For 1996, donor-imported wheat is estimated
to account for as much as 50 percent of wheat consumption in the Federation, with commercial imports
(15 percent) and domestic wheat and maize production (35 percent) accounting for the balance. Food
aid will also remain critical to the survival of the large number of displaced persons in the Serb-controlled
areas. While, today, practically all population segments are eligible for food aid, those that are war-
affected but not internally displaced would be the first to obtain less aid once household incomes start to
rise with economic recovery. BH's estimated 1995 per-capita GDP equals US$525, compared to a pre-
war figure of about US$1,900 in 1991.
6.    Sector Issues and Policies. Agriculture has always been a central part of the Bosnian way of
life, with nearly 20 percent of the pre-war labor force working full-time in the sector and at least a
similar number of people working part-time. Because of the mountainous topography, good agricultural
land is scarce at only 0.25 ha of arable land per capita (1991), and livestock production predominates.
Of BH's total area of 5.11 million ha, some 1.02 million ha (20 percent) are arable land, of which
792,000 ha were planted before the war. In 1991, 58 percent of the planted area were in grains, half of
which in maize with the balance in wheat and barley, while livestock feed and fodder (26 percent) and
vegetables (15 percent, mostly potatoes and sugar beet) were grown on the remaining area. Grains are
mostly grown in the plains north and east of Banja Luka, in the areas around Tuzla and Zenica, and in
some eastern parts of the country. Yields and productivity in private agriculture have traditionally been
low due to inadequate inputs and poor technology. The about 540,000 small private farms that make up
most (969,000 ha, or 95 percent of total arable land) of the sector had remained relatively backward over
the years prior to the war because government development efforts had ignored the private sector.
7.    The immediate problem in agriculture is the lack of seasonal inputs and investment means to carry
out farming. In the medium term, it will be important to grapple with the historical problems of BH's
agriculture which are resulting in poor technical performance, causing unacceptable yields and low food
output. The main factors are: (i) small farm size and substantial fragmentation (average farm size of less
than 5 ha); (ii) poor genetic material, particularly with cattle; (iii) little equity capital and lack of credit
access; and (iv) underdeveloped systems of extension, training, input supply, and lack of access to
organized output markets. These constraints mostly resulted from the former socialist policy of
discriminating against private businesses, although farm fragmentation also stems from the ethnic custom
of dividing land upon inheritance.
8.    Elements favorable to the development of BH's agriculture include: (i) labor - because of limited
off-farm opportunities, the economic cost of the agricultural labor force will remain low in the short and
medium term. After the war, many non-viable large-scale industrial enterprises will not reopen, while
new investment and employment generation will take time, hence further reducing labor alternatives
outside agriculture; (ii) breeding livestock represents valuable sunk capital investment which, with
improved feeding and management, could yield significantly greater output; (iii) availability of a strong
domestic market - unusual for a European country, BH is in food deficit, allowing agricultural expansion
without having to promote exports; (iv) a variety of niche opportunities exist for specialized products or
markets, such as spring lamb, the Dalmatian coast market, high value fruits and wines, Mediterranean



-3 -
products, medicinal herbs and organic foods; and (v) the country has substantial forest resources which
have probably been under-exploited before the war.
9.    In the medium term, past the current emergency reconstruction phase, BH's agriculture will need
to develop in a market environment, with few if any subsidies and little State-financed support. The role
of the Government needs to be an enabling one and short-term interventions, resulting from the war and
transition situation, will need to be in harmony with long-run policy objectives. A strategy will be
required towards financing those services which justifiably should be provided by the public sector (such
as agricultural research and extension); while handling competitively in the future others, such as
veterinary and artificial insemination services, input distribution, and processing of agricultural products,
which in the past had been offered by a monopolistic socially-owned enterprise sector. Permanent
subsidy support for agriculture should be avoided to the extent possible. However, it will initially be
necessary to provide short-term support to assist in recapitalizing private agriculture. Food aid should
be better targeted to allow for a gradual reduction in quantities, while developing cash benefit systems
for poor and vulnerable groups; food aid could probably be eliminated altogether within three to five
years. The early tendency will be for farmers to achieve self sufficiency first, while low income urban
dwellers, pensioners, and refugees will continue to survive on food aid for several years.
10.    Successful development of private agriculture will eventually require changes in the small and
fragmented pattern of land holdings. For efficient labor use, full-time family farms should cover some
15 to 20 ha. Part-time farming could be expected to redevelop, especially near towns offering other
employment, and among retirees. At the same time, it will be important to move quickly towards
privatization of agro-processing industries and related services. Given the semi-monopoly situation, in
the past, of some of the now State-owned agro-processing enterprises, it will also be important to twin
the privatization program with an active encouragement for the start-up of new private sector enterprises
to compete with existing ventures. This would help generate a demand pull for many farmers which,
today, sell their surplus production within their rural community or on local green markets in nearby
towns.
11.    A key issue to raise production will be to ensure that farmers return and start working on the land
as quickly as possible. Unlike in other Balkan countries, BH has very little State farm land on which to
settle new farmers. De-mining will be necessary for farm land located near former confrontation lines.
There are substantial areas on which the title to the land is uncertain, or where the original owners have
left and may never return. Temporary usufruct rights could be issued by local authorities to present farm
housing occupants and land users, based on general leasing legislation to be developed by the
government. A Land Commission should be set up to investigate land claims and ownership rights,
possibly combined with a similar body to investigate property rights to urban housing real estate. The
Commission would receive claims to the restitution of land rights; investigate claims; mediate and settle
disputes, including compensation, wherever feasible; and submit unsettled claims to an applicable court,
such as a specialized Land Claims Court. Principles of court settlement and responsibilities of the Land
Commission would be covered by a law on land restitution. The aim would be to confirm longstanding
ownership claims within about two years, and to deal with contested rights within five years.
12.    Sector Recovery Strategy. A reconstruction and rehabilitation programfor agriculture and the
rural areas of BH of about US$330 million over 3 to 4 years was presented in a report on reconstruction
priorities for BH, prepared by the Bank and others, and is currently under consideration by the
international donor community. The program calls for an energetic campaign to restore devastated farms
and to intensify ongoing efforts to provide the desperately needed equipment, livestock, and seasonal farm
inputs that will restart agricultural production. At the same time, efforts will be made to establish a solid



- 4 -
policy framework and provide other key investments to assist agriculture to evolve into a competitive and
productive economic sector in the future. The proposed project will be the first major element in this
program, aiming to ensure availability of key farm equipment and livestock needed to rebuild war
damaged farms. The provision of seasonal farm inputs financed by grants from bilateral donors for the
1996 spring and fall planting seasons is already covered under a parallel, multi-sector operation, the
Emergency Recovery Project (ERP), approved by the Board of Directors on February 29, 1996. The
latter project also provides credit financing to both micro-entrepreneurs and small- and medium-sized
enterprises in the agro-processing sector, such as to revive demand for farm outputs and create marketing
opportunities for farm surplus production.
13.   Under further projects in the agriculture sector planned for the immediate future, employment
would be generated and broken infrastructure repaired in rural and sub-urban areas by setting up a
rural/urban rehabilitation fund to organize and finance works programs and micro enterprise development
in different communities.  A technical assistance program will provide agricultural policy and
management advice, as well as agricultural aid coordination, to help with medium term programs and
establish the economic basis for agriculture in the future. Projects with a medium term perspective would
deal with rehabilitation and development of the forestry sector, vineyard and orchard replanting, the
creation of agricultural extension and other farmer support services, and would address specific issues
of agricultural and rural finance.
14.   Relations with the World Bank. Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved
in developing a donor-funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the World Bank, IMF,
EU, EBRD, and USAID in late 1995 resulted in the preparation, with the Government, of a priority
reconstruction program which was presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU
in Brussels on December 20-21, 1995. This program identified some US$5.1 billion of external financing
required to meet Bosnia's urgent reconstruction needs, of which US$1.8 billion would be needed in the
first year, 1996. This first donor meeting led to new donor commitments of some US$500 million for
priority reconstruction activities for the first quarter of 1996. Another donor conference is scheduled for
the spring of 1996 to seek financing pledges from donors for the remainder of 1996 as well as to present
needs for the entire reconstruction program.
15.   The Bank's own assistance strategy for BH consists of a two-track approach: First, prior to
financial normalization and membership in the World Bank Group, the Bank will support selected
immediate assistance programs through the special World Bank Trust Fund for BH (TFBH) in the amount
of US$150 million, approved by the Board of Governors on February 23, 1996. Of these Trust Fund
resources, US$125 million is to be extended at concessional terms identical to those offered by IDA and
US$25 million is to be provided as a grant. Second, once the country becomes a World Bank Group
member and following the clearance of arrears to the Bank, a program of lending and technical assistance
would be initiated to support reconstruction and development, as well as economic transformation. The
current pipeline of operations in CY1996-1997, to be financed both from the TFBH as well as
subsequently from regular World Bank Group resources, comprises a number of emergency-type projects,
including this proposed FRP, the above-mentioned Emergency Recovery Project, and prospective
operations in gas, district heating, transport, war victims rehabilitation, and water supply, followed by
additional projects in education, health, housing, employment generation, de-mining, electric power
supply, forestry and agricultural services, and a structural adjustment operation in support of structural
reforms to enterprises, banks and public finance.
16.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The urgent need to rebuild war-damaged private farms and
to replace lost farm assets, in an economic and social environment overburdened by the presence of



- 5 -
displaced persons and refugees where rural employment opportunities are scarce and food security is at
stake, constitute the circumstances that this Bank operation - one of the first Bank projects in BH - is
designed to address. From very relevant experience of recent, comparable operations in Albania (Critical
Imports Project, FY92) and Croatia (Emergency Reconstruction Project, FY94), the Bank is well placed
to assist the Government of BH to define priorities for agricultural reconstruction and to ensure that
priority tasks are tackled first and implemented swiftly. Furthermore, through its major role in the
overall reconstruction effort of BH, the Bank is in a position to advise the Government so that
reconstruction expenditures for agriculture are committed within a framework consistent with
reconstruction and reforms planned for all economic sectors.
17.    Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to jump-start agricultural production,
improve food security, and create employment and income for the war-affected rural population including
returning displaced persons. The project will aim at the private farm sector, with a priority for full-time
farmers. The current emergency reconstruction phase calls for projects with fast, direct impact on the
ground; hence project design has to be kept straightforward such as to allow for speedy implementation.
18.    Project Description. To project will provide funds for the following components:
(i)    Farm Mechanization: provision of motor-cultivators and single-axle tractors for farmers
with small land holdings of up to 10 ha; replacement of lost two-axle tractors, including
tractor implements, for small- and medium-scale farmers with land holdings above 10 ha
(owned or leased land); replacement of selected combine harvesters; and provision of
related technical assistance and training;
(ii)    Livestock Production: assistance in rebuilding the national herds for milk and meat
production, through the import of cattle, goats and sheep, and through domestic purchase
and redistribution of sheep; also provision of related technical assistance;
(iii)   Animal Health Services: support in strengthening veterinary services by equipping and
rebuilding private veterinary stations, rehabilitating veterinary institutes, providing
equipment for artificial insemination services, and offering related technical assistance;
and
(iv)   Project Implementation:  assistance to start-up and implement the project through
provision of equipment, technical assistance, training and studies, and through financing
of incremental recurrent expenditures.
Details on the project components are given in the attached Technical Annex.
19.    Beneficiaries and Cost Recovery. The project would be exclusively aimed at private sector
farms, private service providers of animal health, and selected veterinary institutes; State-owned farms
and enterprises would be excluded from the project. The Bank-financed part of the project would focus
on beneficiaries located within the Federation. In close coordination with the international donor
community and in consultation with key institutions of the peace process, including the Office of the High
Representative, the project could include investments in the Republika Srpska. Partial cost recovery from
beneficiaries, through credits at long maturities and at a low interest charge of up to 2 percent, will be
aimed at for the cost of mechanization equipment and livestock, also for veterinary equipment and
supplies in the case of private sector veterinarians. This would satisfy the dual objective of generating
State budget revenues through credit repayments by project beneficiaries, while allowing for sufficient



- 6 -
time for economic recovery in the agriculture sector. Materials, equipment and livestock would be ceded
to beneficiaries directly, following bulk procurement.
20.    Eligibility Criteria for Farmers. Farmer selection for imported items to rebuild war-damaged
farms will be made on the following principles: Priority will be given to individual farmers and groups
of farmers in heavily damaged areas along former confrontation lines, and to refugees or displaced
persons returning to regions where they formerly farmed; farmers must also have suffered substantial
damage in the war, including loss of a tractor and/or some or all of the livestock. Within this priority
group of farmers, the following eligibility conditions would apply: farmers need to have title or use rights
to the land; farmers must demonstrate their intention to rebuild and operate the farm by starting repairs
and/or beginning crop production; farmers must have adequate shelter for the new tractor and/or livestock
and be able to provide sufficient feed for livestock of suitable quality; farmers must have access to
veterinarian and artificial insemination services (for livestock) and necessary tractor implements (for
tractors); farmers must have access to adequate marketing facilities (i.e., agro-processing enterprises,
farmer markets, cooperative processing centers); a minimum farm size of at least 10 ha will be set for
supply of two-axle tractors (owned or partially leased land, or service/sharing agreements with
neighboring farmers), while no minimum farm size is set for motor cultivators; farmers must demonstrate
sufficient capacity, based on expected farm cash-flow, to repay the in-kind loan; farmers must provide
guarantees from neighbors or friends, or provide property as loan collateral; and farmers agree to
maintain records on the performance of livestock.
21.    Project Financing. For all components, the project will cover the import cost as well as all
expenditures of foreign and domestic transport, handling, storage and distribution to final beneficiaries.
Local and foreign costs will generally both occur in hard, convertible currency since, for an interim
period, the DEM is expected to be the only domestic currency accepted throughout BH. Given the very
tight fiscal situation of the State budget, until economic recovery would generate significant tax income,
and in light of the need for swift implementation, the project will finance all incremental local recurrent
costs, excluding local taxes. Retroactive financing in an amount of 10 percent of the Bank Credit will
be included for urgent purchases of priority farm machinery as well as office equipment. Donor
financing (US$15.6 million) has been secured from the following sources: European Commission (US$5.2
million, equivalent to ECU4 million); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD, US$7.3
million equivalent); German Government (US$2.2 million equivalent); and Dutch Government (US$0.9
million equivalent). Additional financing of US$14.8 million equivalent is being sought from other
donors. In the event such additional financing could not be mobilized by the time of effectiveness of the
Bank Credit, the project scope would be adjusted through a reduction of imported farm mechanization
equipment and imported livestock. A respective project module has been identified for exclusion from
the project. On the other hand, if, during implementation, additional donor financing becomes available,
further farm equipment and livestock could be procured and distributed through the implementation
structures established by the project.
22.    Project Implementation. The current implementation capacity in the central Government for
agricultural policy and projects is very limited; a new Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and
Forestry at the Federation level has only been established as of February 1, 1996. To fill this institutional
gap, the Government would seek assistance from qualified external advisors. Project implementation will
be coordinated through a small central project unit in Sarajevo, with initially 4 regional implementation
units at the Canton level in Bihac, Mostar, Tuzla, and Zenica. Two additional regional units would be
established in the Republika Srpska for subsequent project preparation activities, financed by those donors
interested in funding of such activities. Procurement will be centralized in Sarajevo and handled by
experienced personnel, including domestic and international professional procurement agents, to ensure



- 7 -
speed, efficiency and economy of purchases. Distribution, pricing and cost recovery, supervision and
auditing will be dealt with at the regional level. Information about agriculture is not yet available evenly
for all areas in BH. Implementation arrangements for the project are expected to improve that situation
through a regional approach towards project management across former confrontation lines.
23.   Using agreed emergency-type procurement procedures, imported items for this project will be
procured and distributed as quickly as possible, but within a maximum of up to two years. Distribution
and pricing arrangements will be as follows: In coordination with the procurement agents, the central
project unit in Sarajevo will arrange for import and delivery to regional warehouses; whenever feasible,
imported goods will be handled and stored by private trade enterprises on a commission basis, otherwise
government warehouses would be used; through the municipalities, regional implementation units will
organize and supervise distribution to farmers, and monitor loan repayments and utilization of imports.
The staff of the Agricultural Institutes in Sarajevo (which lost its building and facilities during the war)
and Mostar, as well as private-sector consultant firms in Tuzla, Zenica and Bihac, will identify potential
beneficiaries along the agreed eligibility criteria. Ultimate selection of beneficiaries would be within the
responsibility of each municipality. The regional implementation units will prepare and arrange for the
signature of supply and credit agreements with individual farmers. A small number of local banks with
operative branch network and, in some cases, post offices will be used to collect repayments from
farmers. For livestock, loans will be repaid over two years in cash, or through the first female offspring
of equal quality, with no interest. For tractors, loan maturity will be 10 years with 2 years of grace and
up to 2 percent interest. All loans will be based on DEM import values plus handling and storage cost.
24.   A temporary central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been set up within the former
Ministry of Energy and Industry. It will be transformed into a joint unit including representatives of both
the State and the Federation governments that were established as of February 1, 1996. Representation
of the State will be through the Ministry of Finance, while the Federation would be represented through
the new Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry. The Government will appoint a full-
time PIU Director by April 1996. Technical specifications for all items to be procured under the Credit
have been finalized, bidding documents are being prepared. The first regional implementation units
would start to operate by end-April, 1996. During March and April of 1996, the PIU is carrying out
farm damage assessments in all municipalities as a basis for a geographical, needs-based allocation of
imported items to farmers. In parallel, the agricultural institutes in Sarajevo and Mostar have started to
develop lists of potential beneficiaries fulfilling the eligibility criteria.
25.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations, the following agreements have been reached: The
State Ministry of Finance, as Recipient, represented through the PIU, will allocate project funds for the
purchase of goods, works and services, according to the project design. The Recipient will maintain the
PIU and regional implementation units with adequate staffing to ensure timely and orderly project
implementation. Farm mechanized equipment financed under the Credit will be supplied to farmers
selected in accordance with the agreed priority and eligibility criteria for project beneficiaries. Supply
and credit agreements between the PIU and beneficiaries will be used. These agreements will be limited
to US$250,000 each and will specify: the value of the equipment, expressed in convertible currency; the
interest charge of up to 2 percent per annum; the term of the credits of up to ten years maturity and two
years of grace; credit guarantees or collateral provided by the beneficiary; credit repayment arrangements
through local credit institutions; and requirements for adequate servicing and storage facilities as well as
for maintenance of service and pedformance records. Project accounting, audits and reporting will be
carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
26.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been placed in environmental category B. Any project



- 8 -
components which present an opportunity for environmental enhancement will be designed accordingly,
and all components will be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no degradation to the
environment.
27.    Participatory Techniques. Project preparation focussed on active participation of relevant local
stakeholders in developing project objectives, scope and components. Field interviews were held with
farmers during preparation. A farm damage and needs survey in each municipality throughout BH will
be carried out in order to allocate the equipment and livestock to be financed under the project towards
selected municipalities that have suffered substantial war damage.
28.   Benefits. Major benefits would include increased farm yields and production, which are expected
to lead to a rise in surplus farm outputs that are marketed on local and regional farmer markets;
generation of additional income for farm households; as well as improved food security within isolated
regions and for the country in general. Rates of return on farm investments are expected to be high,
given the substantial degree of decapitalization in agriculture, and hence the prospects for immediate
productive use of the capital goods, combined with a rising demand for food on local fresh produce
markets and by the emerging private agro-processing sector. Without the project, the revitalization of
domestic farm production would be delayed considerably since farm credit facilities as well as commercial
supply structures for farm inputs, equipment and livestock will not be in place for some time to come.
The project would contribute significantly to the phase-out of donor-financed food aid deliveries by
substituting domestic agricultural production for imported food.
29.   Risks. Project risks include a resumption of hostilities in the region and a possible delay in
economic revitalization of the country. Both could threaten the ability of farmers to safely invest into
their farm production, and to market surplus produced on local markets. However, as for reconstruction
investments in all economic sectors, these risks have been accepted by the international donor community
as the Dayton-Paris peace agreement is being implemented in its first year. Other risks relate to possible
delays in project implementation, caused by slow procurement, delivery, transportation, and distribution
of goods to final beneficiaries. To reduce these risks, preparation for project implementation has been
advanced considerably: standard procurement documents have been drafted, technical specifications have
been developed, the assistance of qualified professional procurement agents is being sought, the
institutional capacity at the central level in Sarajevo has been established, and prospective beneficiaries
are being selected. Close assistance and project supervision by the newly created World Bank Resident
Mission in Sarajevo would further improve prospects for swift project implementation.
30.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Resolutions of
the Executive Directors of IBRD (Resolution No. 96-1) and IDA (Resolution No. IDA 96-1) establishing
the Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
