SMALLHdLDER RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I
(CREDIT 984-IND)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) of the Smallholder
Rubber Development Project I (SRDP I) in Indonesia, for which Credit
984--IND was approved on February 2, 1980 in the amount of US$45.0
million, reduced to US$27.0 million in August 1985, and closed in
March 1986. The last disbursement was made on October 1986 and US$0.8
million of undisbursed funds was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Project Management Unit (PMU) of
the Smallholder Rubber Development Project for the Director General of
Estates, Ministry of Agriculture (DGE), and submitted to the Bank in
December 1986. The PCR was supplemented by an Overview, prepared by
the Asia Regional Office. Both documents are based upon the PCR and a
review of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR No. 2721-IND, dated January
22, 1980); the President's Report (No. P-2696-IND); the Loan Agreement
of April 3, 1980; supervision reports which have been prepared by the
Regional Office in Jakarta; project progress reports prepared by the
PMU, and various project-related Bank files.
The report was not subjected to an audit by OED, but was sent
to Government for comments  on  ScMtember  21, 1987; comments received
have beer. incorporated into the report and reproduced in Annex 8.

SMALLHOLDER RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I
(CREDIT 984-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
In support of Government's obfectives, the project was formu-
lated to: (a) create productive employment to raise incomes of rural
poor; (b) expand smallholder export crops; and (c) ensure productive
use of natural resources.   At  the  time of project formulation, some
15.6 million smallholder families produced subsistence and cash crops
on 15.8 million ha, while about 1,800 estates occupied some 2.2 mil-
lion ha producing mainly rubber, palm oil, sugar, tea and tobacco.
Perenn,tal crops occupied about one third of total cropped land with
coconuts and rubber accounting for about 80%, and generating about 43%
of total non-oil export revenues. Smallholders cultivated some 801 of
the rubber area and virtually all coconuts, coffee, cloves, and
pepper.
The project provided to smallholders the necessary resources
for new planting, replanting and maintaining rubber trees and also
provided for associated essential infrastructure of roads, buildings
and extension services. It was identified by GOI with IDA assistance
and prepared by FAO/CP with assistance from Indonesian consulting
groups. The project was appraised in June/July 1979, was presented to
the Board on February 2, 1980, and became effective on May 23, 1980.
Total project cost was initially estimated at US$70.5 million of which
tba IDA credit was to provide US$45 million, or 641 of the total cost.
In August 1985, a sum of US$18 million was cancelled, with the revised
IDA credit amounting to US$27 million. The cancellation became neces-
sary mainly because of reductions in project costs as expressed in US$
arising from the major devaluation of the Rupiah in March 1983.
Oblectives
The major project objectives were to raise the incomes of
32,000 smallholder families, increase foreign exchange earnings from
rubber, and build the institutional framework and database for the
national smallholder rubber  programs.   Specific project achievements
are as follows:
(a) new planting and replanting of 38,500 ha of smallholder
rubber--36,200 ha were planted;



- iv -
(b) maintaining 8,000 ha of rubber planted fGom 1975-79--3,400
ha were brought under the project;
(c) 775 ha of nursery development--a total of 1,037 ha were
developed (rootstock nurseries increased by 280 ha);
(d)  construction of 200 km  secondary village roads--100 km w,re
constzucted;
(e}  construction  of   900   km   estate   roads--380   km  were
constructed;
(f)  upgrading  of  300  km   village  roads--121  km  have  been
upgraded;
(g) construction of 52 staff houses and 9,000 m2 of warehouses,
workshops and storage were constructed;
(h) purchase of vehicles--all were purchased; and
(i)  purchase of tractors, trailers, sprayers and chainsaws--most
of which and a small amount of other equipment were
procured.
Implementation Experience
The project was implemented through three geographically
separate Project Management Units (PMUs) with an intermediate level of
management, and direct supervision and control from the headquarters
in Jakarta.    It  demonstrated  that  large-scale  smallholder rubber
plantinglreplantitig programs can be developed effectively, and for
situations where resettlement is not required, at lower cost than the
Nucleus Estate and Smallholders (NES) program. However, the project
experienced management and technical problems, particularly in earlier
years, due to shortages of qualified and experienced staff, which led
to delays of procurement of vehicles, equipment and input materials,
and slow progress of nursery and field development.
Major problems encountered during project implementation
included continuously delayed project fund release from the GOI and
the state commercial bank (Bank Rakyat Indonesia--BRI), which delayed
tree plantings, maintenance and overall project works. Other problems
included lengthy procurement procedures, and shortage of qualified
personnel at field  supervision  level.    These  adverse factors were
alleviated to some extent by the resourceful, flexible and able SRDP
management.
The IDA credit was disbursed as of October 27, 19a6, except
for US$0.8 million which was  cancelled.   Several small components of
the project, which were not completed, are being continued under SRDP
II (Ln. 2949-IND) which became effective on October 24, 1985.



-v-
Results
Agricultural Performance. It is still rather early to assess
the project's full impact. However, despite the maintenance difficul-
ties which arose from the problems of fund release, field establish-
ment of high-yielding trees over the majority of the project area will
mean that generally, yields and production are e*pected to b- in line
with or above the SAR's  projected  levels.   The project prompted the
use of high-yielding planting materials and improved technical pack-
ages, and also of improved field management and on-farm processing.
Incremental rubber production at completion is estimated at about
607,500 tons compared with 675,000 at appraisal. The difference is
mainly attributed to the larger production foregone due to more
replanting than expected at appraisal.
Economic Rate of Return.   At appraisal the ERR was estimated
at about 14Z. Based on the actual yields and future yield assump-
tions, the ERR at completion is estimated at about 11%, which is lower
than the SAR's estimate mainly due to depressed rubber prices.
Issues
Credit Conversion.   The  BRI  has  been  the executing bank.
Under the pzoject, the Financing Agreement between BI and BRI speci-
fied the use of the IDA credit; the Sub-Financing Agreement (SFA)
between BRI and DGE specified the management of total project funds;
and the Smallholder Credit Agreements (SCA) between BRI and participa-
ting smallholders specified the use of the farmers' credit and repay-
ment. Upon acceptance by the project, participating smallholders were
to enter into credit agreements with SRDP and DGE, and field develop-
ment costs were charged by the project to individual accounts. Upon
fulfilling the required criteria specified in the SFA, the individual
smallholders' credit accounts were to be converted to individual loan
accounts with BRI, and this conversion was to be processed between the
fourth and seventh year after field development. Before the conver-
sion the credit risk was to be borne by MOF and GOI would provide a
direct interest rate subsidy to the lenders at 14.5% p.a. However,
after the conversion, BRI would bear the credit risk equivalent to 25%
of principal and full interest due and would receive a 3.5% p.a. inte-
rest rate subsidy from GOI.   Although  some 8,000 ha were ready to be
converted, there had been no conversions or write-offs of farmers'
accounts at project completion.    Particulerly delays in issuing land
titles and lack of incentives for BRI to complete the loan conversion
have been the major cause.    Since  September 1986, however, with the
agreement between MOF, DGE, BRI and SRDP, the conversion process had
begun in all three PMU locations. As of March 1987, about 100 ha were
converted. The problem of credit conversion is not unique to this
project, but is an issue of the treecrop sector in general. This
issue is being addressed during supervision of the follow-up project
(SRDP II), and preparation of another project, the Smallholder Estates



- vi -
Crop Development Project will consider whether further support to
conversion activities is needed.
Change of Smallholder  Loan  Terms.    The  credits to small-
holders were initially to be repaid in 20 years, with a seven-year
interest-free grace period and an interest rate of 6Z p.a. thereafter.
With the advent of and consistent with the new SRDP II, the loan terms
were unilaterrnlly changed by MOF on September 6, 1986 from a seven-
year grace period to a three-year grace period and from 62 to 12% p.a.
to be effective April 1, 1986.
Sustainability
The project built the foundations for a follow-up project,
SRDP II, and for other treecrop development in terms of project
design, scope, strategy,  and  management.    The rubber areas planted
and/or maintained under this project will be serviced by the PMU, with
ir-'^,ure areas qualifying  for  continuing  credit under the follow-up
pr. -. The sound programs of training and establishment of exten-
sion i pability which have been undertaken during the project period
will   an that PMU project staff  are in a position to ensure continu-
ing at ention is paid to immature areas and to upgrading sub-standard
areas prior to loan conversion, where justified. Project staff should
also continue to provide advice to project participants on tapping and
primary processing procedures, beyond the project period. Although
PMU staff are capable of providing continuing extension after the
closing date, longer-term extension arrangements need to be resolved:
should such long-term services be provided by existing PMU staff or by
staff of the Provincial Estate Services? Equally important during the
post-project phase is the formulation of appropriate input supply
arrangements on a continuing basis.
Findings and Lessons
The main lessons learned from this pr-ject are as follows:
(a) Since 1959, when the rubber replanting fund was established
from cess payment, the Assisted Replanting Project (ARP) and
Group Coagulating Center (GCC) programs were partly financed
from cess funds. In the late 1970s, GOI decided to change
these programs to be financed by credits fro. BRI to make the
system more equitAble, replicable, and to tap assets of the
banking system for financing the programs. In retrospect, it
seems i:hat it was the right decision for providing the appro-
priate incentive framework for good rubber management, but
more work is needed to make the credit system operational and
achieve the cost recovery anticipated at appraisal. The
follow-on project should benefit from this experience.
(b) Technical loan conversion criteria should have been reviewed
during the project implementation in the light of farmer

repayment  capacity,  field   development   expense  and  the
requirements for cost recovery.
(c) The project demonstrated that the PMU system is an effective
means of developing and implementing planting and replanting
programs. The project also demonstrated that the intensive
supervision and management in the limited geographical areas
under the PMU system were successful.
(d) Problems of fund release and procurement procedures led to
significant delays in project implementation, and require
improvement.

INDONESIA
SMALLHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I (Credit 984-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Overview
Introduction
1.1       This overview is largely based on the PCR for the Smallholder Rubber
Development Project (Cr. 984-IND) which was prepared by the SRDP Project
Management Unit (PMU) under the Director General of Estates. The report was
submitted to the Bank in December 1986. The PCI reflects views and opinions
of PMU staff and Government officials who have been closely associated with
the Project. In general, the PCR presents a detailed and objective view of
the Project, project implementation, performance, and its impact on project
participants, community and on the economy. Some of the more important
aspects of Project implementation are highlighted in this overview.
Project Objectives
1.2       The project's main objectives were to:
(a) raise the incomes of some 32,000 smallholder families, some 30X of
which were in absolute poverty group;
(b) increase Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings from rubber; and
(c) build the institutional framework and data base for the national
smallholder rubber programs.
Project Formulation
1.3       Indonesia is the second largest rubber producer in the world after
Malaysia. At the time of Project formulation, some 15.6 million smallholder
families produced subsistence and cash crops on some 15.8 million ha, while
only about 1,800 estates occupied some 2.2 million ha producing mainly rubber,
palm oil, sugar, tea and tobacco. Nearly 70Z national rubber production came
from 1.25 million smallholder families, with average rubber holdings of
1.5 ha, mainly in Sumatra (70Z of total) and Kalimantan (191 of total). A
major problem was the low yield of rubber from aging treer planted in 1940's
or earlier, and the lack of maintenance. The project's main activity was to
plant and replant w th high yielding planting materials and provide inputs for
maintenance.
1.4       The Project was identified and prepared by the o0r with IDA assis-
tance, based on feasibility studies conducted by FAO/CP. Originally, the
Project was to be limited to replanting; however, in view of the favorable
farmgate prices due in part to the rupiah devaluation, new planting appeared



-x -
attractive, and therefore about 30-40X of all plantings were to be new
planting under the project.
1.5       With the favorable experience from the North Sumatra Smallholder
Development Project (NSSDP) and Assisted Replanting Project (AIUP), SRDP I was
designed to utilize the Project Management Unit (PMU) system. The NLcleus
Estate and Smallholders (NES) system was considered inappropriate for the
development of widely dispersed existing smallholdings with individual
ownerships. The NSSDP had demonstrated that high quality smallholder rubber
could be effectively developed under PMU system, and the ARP had shown that
PMU system could carryout large-scale smallholder planting programs at lower
cost, compared with the NES system in situations where resettlement is not
required.  It had not, however, established a national framework for
smallholder rubber development.
1.6       The Project was pre-appraised in May/June 1978.  Because of the
change of financing arrangements for smallholder development cost from a cess
financed grant to a credit system, it was necessary to reappraise in June/Jvly
1979.
The Project
1.7       The Project was designed to finance a five-year (April 1980-March
1985) time slice of smallholder rubber development in West Kalimantan, South
Sumatra and West Sumatra. The main component included:
(a)  planting and maintaining to maturity about 38,500 ha of smallholder
rubber, including intercrops, and maintaining to maturity a further
8,000 ha planted during 1975-79;
(b)  developing about 775 ha of nurseries to provide the material for the
planting program;
(c)  constructing about 200 km of secondary village roads and 900 'm of
estate-type roads, and upgrading about 300 km of village roads, to
provide access for inputs and for rubber marketing;
(d)  strengthening the PMUs and a newly created Smallholder Rubber
Development Project Unit (SRDPU) in Jakarta, which would supervise
and assist them, through recruitment and training of some 200
technical and administrative staff (in addition to about 100
existing), employment of four consultants (on rubber production,
training, finance and organization), and provision of vehicles,
warehouses and staff housing; and
(e)  carrying out studies, pilot programs and start-up activities for
f!lture projects, both along the lines of the proposed Project and
for minimal assistance to spontaneous planters.
1.8       To ensure that each participating family could develop and process
its rubber, and that the maximum impact would be achieved, a two-hectare
planting limit was imposed.

Project Management
1.9       The DCE had overall responsibility for Project implementation.  The
SRDPU in Jakarta was created in 1979 to implement the Project. Units of
SRDPU, headed by Provincial Unit Mangers, were established in the provincial
capitals. Each unit included a treasurer responsible for the PMUs' accounts,
and a supplies officer to facilitate delivery of project inputs. An
inspector, assisted by the provincial unit manager, coordinated between PMU
and other agencies at the provincial level, served as Secretary of a
Provincial Coordinating Committee, chaired by the BAPPEDA head, including
representatives of local government, BRI, Agraria, Public Works, DG Foodcrops,
farmer groups and PMUs. The Committee reviewed the PMUs' annual performance
and plans, and made arrangements for support from other agencies. By
appraisal, GOI had created seven Assisted Replanting Projects (ARP) based on
the North Sumatra Smallholder Development Project (NSSDP) management concept
of PMUs. Three of the most advanced PMUs under ARP were expanded under the
project, and these PMUs at Taluk Kuantan, Prabumulih and Anjungan became the
projects' field implementing units, headed by a manager and assistant managers
covering nurseries, administration, finance and equipment. The Special Team
for Externally-Assisted Projects in DGE, Tim Khusus, was to assist the SRDPU
on budgeting, procurement and recruitment matters.
1.10      At appraisal incremental staff requirements were estimated at 280 in
1980/81, increasing to 516 in 1986/85. Recruitment was delayed from the
beginning of project implementation, due in part to unattractive salary scale
for qualified candidates. In the first year (1980/81), 79% of SAR estimated
staff were recruited. In 1981/82, about 90% of required were recruited; how-
ever because of the budget constraint in 1982/83, only about 323 new staff or
77% of the SAR estimated staff were recruited. In 1985/86, 478 new staff
(against 516 SAR estimates) were recruited.
1.11      The shortage of personnel, particularly the shortage of extension
workers and field supervisors, adversely affected project support to partici-
pants. The project implementation could have been more effective, if all
necessary staff were recruited in time. The Borrower's PCR suggests that
based on Project's experience, the upper limit for one PMU appears to be about
10,000 ha (5,000 farms) for effective management in terms of field supervision
on extension support.
Project Revisions
1.12      The major Rupiah devaluation in March 1983 (38%) and delays of fund
release from GOI and BRI contributed to under-disbursement of IDA funds and
corresponding project cost reduction. In August 1985, a sum of US$18.0 mil-
lion of the SRDP I credit was cancelled so that the total credit was reduced
from US$45.0 million to US$27.0 miliion. The credit terms for smallholder
project participants were initially 20 years repayment period, with a seven-
year interest-free grace period, and the interest rate at 6% thereafter.
However, to bring the credit terms into line more with commercial rates and to
be consistent with new SRDP II project, the credit terms were changed by MOF
in September 1985, to 20-year credit period with a seven-year grace on
principal and interest-free period of three years. Interests from year 4 to 7

r~pr';icL L(tr* SRDP II, as they did not fulfill their TORs in terms of
v.{*r, daIqta support, and in-depth analysis of policy and design issues.
LicL geeyst x,ieakness of these reports stemmed from consultant's lack of
ep~i-I:c  in tackling these typds of study.  In retrospect, the Bank should
liave lil.-ved a more active role in selectisng consultants and provide guidaance
for tlhoii- tork as it progressed.
tCr Coonents Not Implemented
1.15      Several components not implemented under the project include:
(a)  the pilot program for minimal assistance to spontaneous planters.
Failure to undertake this component arose in part from the fact that
project efforts were concentrated on major priority areas due to
resource constraints.  There was also a lack of Government committ-
uent to the partially assisted programs;
(1;)  the study on rubber taxation to be implemented under the supervision
of the MOF, was not carried out. MOF apparently attached low
priority to this work. There is no immediate plans to undertake
this study; and
l-)  Lie SRDP II start-up activities, which were to be funded by the
SRDP I, were financed by SRDP II.
;_yaicai aro ress of Project rmplementation
1.16      Despite a slow start due to lack of experience with IDA funding and
procureaSht procedures and the problems of delay of fund release, particularly
in FY 1983/84, the project achieved 13,600 ha new planting (SAR's target,
13,500 ha), and 22,600 ha replanting (SAR's target 25,000 ha), a total of
36,200 ha ia 6 years compared with 38,500 ha targeted in 5 years by appraisal
achieving 94X targets. The construction of manager's and field staff houses
were completed in 1983/84, one year behind schedule; warehouses and .workshop/
storage buildings also completed schedule in 1985/86 and 1983/84 respective-
ly. Road construction and upgrading works subitantially reduced mostly due to
lack of funds. Projected and actual completion of civil works is given in
Table 4.



- xiii -
Contracts and Consultants
1.17      Design and supervision of civil works were satisfactorily carried
out by local Public Works Department staff and consultants. Most civil works
were carried out under contracts with no major problems ercept in T. Kuantan
where half completed buildings were left by original contractors in which case
new contractors were engaged with much delay. Land surveys and titling works
to be carried out by the Agraria were delayed by 2-3 years mainly because of
the large area which had to be covered. Several contracts of: (a) Rp 10.3
million contract of land utilization survey and Rp 204.9 million contract of
titling; (b) land utilization survey contract for some 2,400 ha and land
titling of some 4,600 ha estimated cost Rp 36 million and Rp 137 million, were
transferred to the SRDP II.
Training
1.18      A detailed completion of the report on the training component, "SRDP
I Training Completion Report" was completed in June 1984, and is available in
the Project File. Despite delayed implementation, unavailability of
counterpart staff, shortage of funds and initially inactive institutional
support, the training component was successful in terms of design and teaching
quality, but less successful in terms of numbers covered.
1.19      At Project effectiveness, no provision had been made to create a
training section or to assign staff to implement the function. Training
assistance was sought from existing training institutions outside the
project. A training consultant was appointed in February 1981 and spent
approximately two years developing and designing a comprehensive training
program, implementing guidelines, and getting the training program to project
and other concerned agency staff. In June 1983 the Project's training-unit
organization was formally approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and a
training manager appointed in July. Under the leadership of the Training
Manager, a total of 10 persons--mostly administrative-were recruited to
undertake the comprehensive training program. These staff represented 45% of
the required total of 22 positions. To fill the personnel gap, successful
efforts were made to involve staff of other functional divisions at
headquarters, provincial officers and PMUs in the training effort.
1.20      Training Accomplishment.  The training program emphasized training
of extension workers PLPTs and smallholders using the T and V system. Train-
ing was also provided for senior and junior managers. Working with minimal
funds--28Z of requested funds were made available--the project achieved 50% of
the appraisal target. The program is summarized below:

Staff subtotal       15,981             33.733           47
1.21      In addition to conducting training for SRDP I, the training staff
provided preproject training for personnel to be appointed to the next phase
project SRDP II. Some 6,000 man-days of on-the-job training was provided
during 1984 and 1985 at three SRDP I PMU sites and training booklets and
pamphlets for field staff and trainees were prepared.
1.22      Ir. retrospect, it is evident that the project manager's active
support was a key to the success of the component. The training program
development followed a logical pattern of needs analysis, program design and
implementation. The time invested in this developmental phase was essential
to good implementation. The involvement of other non-training Project staff
in the implementation of the program supplemented resources and increased
awareness of the importance of the function. Decentralization of training to
three PMU locations enabled the program to maximize its limited financial
resources and put training in a realistic work environcent. Creation of a
project training section with the capability of planning, designing, imple-
menting and evaluating the short T and V type training required by Project
staff was essential to the program success.
The Issue of Credit Conversion
1.23      Although field plantings established under the project have been
largely of good quality, conversion of credit accounts had been much slower
than expected. Under the Project, smallholders entered into a credit agree-
ment with SRDP/DGE, and field development costs for labor, planting materials
and fertilizers were charged by the project to individual farmer's account.
The credits released by BRI to SRDP/DGE were charged to the loan account of
DGE in the books of BRI. Upon fulfilling the conversion criteria, the indi-
vidual smallholders' credit a, wunts were to be converted to loan accounts
with BRI. The Project Finanicing Agreements (PFA) stipulated that the conver-
sion would occur by no later than three years after smallholders entered into
the project. This conversion process has important consequences because it is
the primary mechanism for cost recovery. Some 8,000 hectares were ready for
such conversion, but no actual conversions had been made at the time of
project completion. However, conversion is now underway and as of March 1987,
about 1,600 ha were prepared for conversion, and about 100 ha had b3een
converted. Conversion under the project has been delayed for a number of



-xv-
reasons, including low number of trees per hectare. If existing conversion
criteria (400 trees/ha for SRDP planting and 320 trees/ha for ARP planting)
were used, only about 65X of the project area would be eligible for the con-
version. If the tree density criterion for SRDP planting were lowered to 320
trees/ha, about 80% of the project area would be eligible for the conversion.
It will be necessary and important to re-examine the tree density requirement,
taking into account revised forecasts of production revenues, and if need be
adjusting the smallholders'credit amount to a level supportable by the revenue
forecast 5.
1.24      As the conversion of farmer credit accounts is a necessary mechani.am
in such a smallholder credit scheme, it is vital that technical conversion
criteria should match attainable objectives if conversion is not to be further
delayed. While the existence of 400 and 320 well-grown rubber trees per hec-
tare for SRDP-planted areas and PRPTE-planted areas respectively appeared to
be reasonable criteria for conversion at the time of project appraisal, strict
application of these rules would mean that as much as 35% of plantings estab-
lished and or maintained under the project would fail to be converted.
1.25      Clearly, conversion should progress as quickly as possible to make
the credit arrangements and responsibilities of DGE, BRI, and farmers
transparent. To facilitate this process it might be necessary to reevaluate
the technical conversion criteria ensuring that conversion can take place and
that farmers are treated equitably. An early assessment of farmers' fields
and upgrade them where necessary during the implementation period and also the
incentives on the part of the BRI for its involvement as executing bank and
the timely conversion should have been considered in the project design.
Although non-conversion of farmers' loan accounts reduces the risk on the part
of executing bank, it at the same time increases the burden upon Government, a
burden not easy to bear in the light of current resource constraints.
1.26      Under the project design, positive aspects of BRI's executing bank
arrangements includeds (a) lowering the Government's own financing require-
ments by tapping and mobilizing the banking system to finance development
costs; (b) lowering the Government's credit risk by making BRI accountable for
principal and interests of non-collectable credits; and (c) providing a
mechanism for direct cost recovery from beneficiaries. However, BRI's passive
stance in converting credits into loan accounts suggests: (a) consideration
be given in future project design to early involvement of BRI in the project
design so that its view would be an integral part of the participant's
selection process; and (b) individual accounts be opened with BRI from the
beginning of the farmers' involvement in the project and supervising of the
credit by BRI during the implementation.
Project Cost and Financing
1.27      At appraisal, the project cost was estimated at US$70.5 million of
which US$45.0 million, or about 64%, was to be financed by the IDA. However,
due to delays in fund release which caused project reduction in scope in terms
of planted/replanted area; field maintenance required; some project components
not implemented including reduction civil works and farm inputs; and
continuous Rupiah devaluation, the total project cost in dollar terms was



- xvi -
reduced to US$43.9 million, or 621 of the SAR estimate. In March 30, 1983,
the Rupiah was devalued from Rp 703 to Rp 970 per dollar; and in September
1986, it was devalued again from Rp 1.125 to Rp 1,644 per dollar. In Rupiah
terms, the project cost was reduced from Rp 44,000 million to Rp 38,800
million, or 88% of SAR estimates. A sum of US$18.0 million was cancelled in
August 1985, so that the IDA credit amounted to US$27.0 million. At the
credit closing, the undisbursed $0.8 million was cancelled. Table 3 and Table
6 show annual disbursement amounts and historical exchange rates
respectively. Important factors which contributed to the delayed fund release
would include that (a) annual budget approvals were about four to six months
'ate; (b) the GOI and BRI funding system was such that the initial delay
caused a chain of delays in succeeding years; (c) additional conditions were
required by GOI and BRI in releasing their funding; and (d) the Government had-
budget crunch since FY83/84 due to depressed oil prices. Contrary to this
overall trend in costs, delays of project fund releases adversely affected
field maintenance standard'and consequently tree growth and have resulted in
some higher field development costs. The PHU was also forced to resort to
temporary financing measures involving inter-account borrowings, allocating
limited available funds only to high priority activities, deferring family
labor cash payments and advancing use of approved budget for next period. At
appraisal, the exchange rate was Rp 6251per dollar.
Cost Recovery
1.28      At appraisal, cost recovery for the project was mainly expected from
milling and export taxes, and IPEDA taxes on production, and was estimated at
55% (discounted at 10X p.a.). In addition, repayment of subloans was expected
to increase the cost recovery by 131; and furthermore, with the 'expected'
additional export tax on rubber (about 51 of f.o.b. value), the cost recovery
was expected to increase to 911. During the project implementation, several
factors have changed: farmers' credit terms were changed (para. 1.12), and
the imposition of the expected additional export tax has not materialized, in
view of depressed export market prices and the equity for non-participating
rubber producers. As a consequence, the cost recovery from the combined taxes
and debt-services is estimated at 631 compared with 681 at appraisal.
Project Impact - Agricultural Development
1.29      Overall, field plantings of rubber under the Project reached 36,201
hectares, or 94% of SAR estimate, and an additional 3,400 hectares of rubber
established under a previous project were absorbed and maintained under the
Project. Of the rubber planted under the Project, 22,567 hectares represented
replanting, with the remainder being new planting on lands, which were previ-
ously secondary jungle, scrubland and grassland (Table 1). As a result of
efforts to make up shortfalls in two preceding years, actual planting up to
and including 1982/83 was about 981 of the SAR estimate. However, from
1983/84, the planting started to decline because of the problem with timely
fund releases.
1.30      Although all field activities were hampered by slow fund flow and
procurement delays, agricultural standards as measured by tree stands per ha
and by girth, were generally satisfactory, due in large part to able/ and



- xvii -
strong leadership and staff morale of the implementing team. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, some 35X of rubber trees established and/or maintained under
the Project may fail to meet the technical criteria for the loan conversion.
A portion of such sub-standard areas will need upgrading.
1.31      Notable technological changes supported by the Project have be.'n the
use of environmentally appropriate land clearing and crop establishmeDt
methods (where warranted, land was cleared manually and with chemicals to
prevent soil erosion rather than by heavy equipment), the use of high y-ielding
rubber planting material, the proper use of fertilizers, herbicides,
fungicides and insecticides, improvement of other cultural practices and the
use of appropriate tapping and primary processing systems.
1.32      The formation of farmer's associations which were created and
managed by the farmers themselves under the guidance of PMU, has been instru-'
mental in strengthening their market position and self-confidence.
1.33      Incremental rubber production resulting from the Project at comple-
tion is estimated at 607,500 tons compared with 675,000 tons at appraisal,
mainly due to larger production foregone by more replanting than expected at
appraisal.
Economic Rate of Return
1.34      At appraisal the economic rate of return for the project was esti-
mated at 14%. At completion, the rate of return was estimated by Borrower at
15%. This high rate of return was based on expected better yields due to
better planting materials used in the project (about 25% higher than SAR esti-
mates in terms of peak and total yields).  Many areas are only recently com-
pleted, and actual yield is available over two years only. In view of mainte-
nance difficulties during the project implementation, the need for upgrading
of some 35% of rubber trees (para. 1.30), and the prevailing economic con-
ditions in which international rubber prices are still depressed, the Region
considers that the project yields used in Borrowers' PCR to be optmistic.
Region's revised yield projection are more in line with those of SAR's (Table
7). The revised ERR is estimated to be 11%. The reduction is caused mairnly
by the lower price projections since the project was appraised.
Bank Performance
1.35      A total of seven 'ank supervisions, amounting to about 184 marn-days
was carried out largely by staff of the Jakarta Resident Mission. These were
supplemented by short problem solving and consultation missions.
1.36      Interaction between Bank and Project staff has, with the exception
of early limited instances of intercultural friction, been most cooperative,
positive and constructive throughout the Project period; it has done much to
ensure satisfactory Project implementation under the PMU, which had beep. faced
with fund flow and procurement constraints. In retrospect, the Borrower felt
that the impact of the Bank's Supervision Missior. could have been greater had
there been less frequent changes of mission members.  The PMU felt c:hat ".
it would have been better, during the early stages of Project impleme\h1ona



- xviii -
if the Bank had warned its personnel to consider cultural sensitivities in the
Asian region and to use tact in dealings with Project management and resident
consultants." (PCR, para. 6.63).
Future of the Project
1.37      Rubber areas planted and/or maintained under this Project will be
serviced by the PMU, with immature areas qualifying for continuing credit
under the follow-up Project (SRDP II).
1.38      The sound programs of training and establishment of extension
capability which have been undertaken during the Project period, will mean
that PNU Project staff are in a position to ensure continuing attention is
paid to immature areas and to upgrading sub-standard areas prior to loan
conversion, where justified. Project staff should also continue to provide
advice to Project participants on tapping and primary processing procedures,
beyond the Project period.
1.39      Although PMU staff are capable of providing continuing extension
advice to Project participants after the closing date, longer-term extension
arrangements need to be resolved: whether such long-term services should be
provided by existing PMU staff or by the staff of the Provincial Estate
Services. Equally important during the post-project phase is the formulation
of appropriate input supply arrangements on a continuing basis.
Lessons Learned
1,40      The main lessons learned from this Project are as follows:
(a)  Since 1959, when the rubber replanting fund was established from
cess payment, the Assisted Replanting Project (ARP) and Group
Coagulating Center (GCC) programs were partly financed from cess
funds. In late 1970s, GOI decided to change these programs to be
financed by credits from BRI to make the system more equitable,
replicable, and to tap assets of the banking system for financing
the programs. In restrospect, it seems that it was right decision
for providing the appropriate incentive framework for good rubber
management but more work is needed to make the credit system
operational and achieve the cost recovery anticipated at
appraisal. The SRDP II project should benefit from this experience.
(b)  Technical loan conversion criteria should have been reviewed during
the Project implementation in the light of farmer repayment
capacity, field development expense and the requirements for cost
recovery.
(c)  The project demonstrated that the PMU system is an effective means
of developing and implementing planting and replanting programs.
The project also demorstrated that the intensive supervision and
management ia the limited geographical areas under PMU system was
successful.



- xix -
(d) Problems of fund release and procurement procedures lead to
significant delays in project implementation, and require
improvement.
(e)  The PHU approach is suitable for replication provided PHUs are
responsible for about 10,000 ha.

SMALLHOLDER RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I
(Credit 984-IND)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Agriculture contributed 24% of GDP in 1984 and continues to be of
great importance to the majority of Indonesians. Nearly 80% of the popula-
tion lives in rural areas, and agriculture is the major source of income for
about two thirds of rural households. The GOI's major objectives for the
sector have been to create productive employment, increase domestic food supply,
expand exports (particularly of smallholder tree crops) and ensure productive,
sustainable use of natural resources. To meet these objectives agricultural
investment has concentrated on irrigation, tree crop development, transmigra-
tion and agricultural support services.
1:02     Tree crops and industrial crops (such as sugar and cotton), in 1984,
occupied about 8.8 million hectares in Indonesia, and support for these crops
has been provided by the Directorate General of Estates (DGE) within the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Of these crops, about 85% were owned by small-
holders while 152 were managed by public and private estates. Yields on
smallholdings are relatively lower than those of public and private estares
due to past neglect and weak institutional support.
1.03     Recognizing the importance of tree crops and industrial crops for
increasing smallholder incomes and non-oil exports, the GOI planted over 1.0
million hectares of industrial crops and tree crops, including about 435,000
hectares of rubber and coconut, the two most important smallholder crops, in
Repelita Ill, the Third Five-year Development Plan (April 1979 - March 1984).
1.04     Indonesia is the world's second largest rubber producer (after
Malaysia) and the crop is a major contributor to the economy. In 1980, the
peak year for export earnings, rubber earned US$ 1.1 billion, 51% of total
estate crop exports, and was surpassed only by oil and timber in foreign
exchange earnings.   By 1983, however, export earnings dropped to US$ 614
million or 46Z of total estate crop exports.   Indonesian rubber production
climbed from 682,000 tons in 1961 to 1,017 tons in 1983. In spite of growth
in the subsector, Indonesia's share of the Southeast Asian rubber market fell
from 43% in 1961 to 32X in 1980, due mainly to the success of programs in
Malaysia and Thailand.



2
-2-
1.05     By 1983, about 68% of national rubber production came  from some
1.25 million smallholders owning 1.5 hectares of land on the average. Most
smallholder rubber fields, however, were planted in the 1940's or earlier
and have turned into rubber jungle renewing itself through natural regera-
tion. With lack of input and proper maintenance, the low yield of small-
holder rubber ha*; continued to decline further.
1.06     Cognizant of the desirability of large-scale upgrading of small-
holder rubber, the Government had given high priority in PELITA III (April
1979 - March 1984) to smallholder rubber development. Since smallholders
lack financial resources, access to high yielding planting materials and
technical knowledge, a major Government effort was required.
1.07     SRDP I was implemented by a semi-autonomous project unit with head-
quarters in Jakarta, under the supervision of the DGE which was assisted by
the Special Team for Externally Assisted Projects. The Special Team (Team
Khusus) was set up in DGE to assist externally assisted tree crop projects
in procurement, budgeting, recruitment, project start-up and legal advice.
About mid - 1986, however, the PMU type externally assisted tree crop projects
were taken out of the scope of Team Khusus and placed under the daily super-
vision of the Director for Tree Crop Rehabilitation and Development of DGE.
1.08     SRDP I was the second (NSSDP being the first) World Bank assisted
tree crop development project utilizing the PHU system. In conceptualizing
the Project, a desirable balance among development cost, intensiveness of
management and expected future benefits was being sought for replication on
a larger scale.
1.09     The Project as formulated included the planting of 38,500 hectares
of smallhoider rubber, with credit assistance to farmers, in the provinces
of Riau, South Sumatra and West Kalimantan. The Project was supported by
IDA Credit (No. 984-IND) of USS 45 million (later reduced to US$ 27 million)
to Lighten the financial burden on GOI in financing the originally estimated
total project cost of US$ 70.5 million (actual cost totalled USS 43.8 million).

2. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     The Project was identified and prepared by the Government of Indo-
nesia (GOI) with IDA assistarce, based on feasibility studies conducted by
IBRD/FAD Cooperative Program and by Indonesian consulting firms. In view
of limited available development funds, GOI requested IDA for financial
assistance to plant/replant 38,500 hectares of smallholder rubber in the
provinces of Riau, South Sumatra and West Kalimantan.
2.02     The Project was initially appraised by the World Bank in May-June
1978. Hc.ever, in view of GOI's decision in December 1978 to change finan-
cial assistance to smallholders for direct field development costs of tree
crop establishment from a grant to credit basis, the Project was reappraised
in June-July 1979.
2.03     Based on previous experience with the North Sumatra Smallholder
Development Project (NSSDP) and the Assisted Replanting Project (ARP), SRDP
was designed utilizing the project management unit (PMU) system with an
intermediate level of management.  NSSDP, with very intensive technical and
management expertise, demonstrated that high quality smallholder rubber could
be developed under the PMU system, while the ARP proved that PMUs organized
at much lower cost could implement large-scale rubber planting, but with con-
siderable sacrifice in quality. The ilucleus Estate and Smallholders (NES)
system was considered inappropriate for the development of widely dispersed
existing smallholdings already under individual ownership.
2.04     At the time of credit negotiation in December 1979, the IDA Team
expressed some concern that the low rates charged to farmers (interest free
for 7 years and 6Z thereafter) could adversely affect the credit market
particularly in those areas where BRI and other banks were lending to small-
holders at 104 % per annum.



4
-4-
With the ibsorption of SRDP I plantings by SRDP II, the interest rate
chargeable to farmers, based on a decision by the Minister of Finance,was
changed effective April 1, 1986 to 122 per annum, and the interest-free
period was reduced from seven to three years, with the interest from the
fourth to the seventh year of field development accrued and capitalized
at the end of the seventh year.
Targets and Goals
2.05     In Indonesia, of the total rubber area of 2.5 million hectares,
802 is grown by smallholders, while the remaining 202 of the area is divided
evenly between Government-owned and private estates. It is noteworthy that
over 70% (1.8 million hectares) of the total rubber area is characterized by
low-yielding and overage trees.
2.06     In almost all Government-owned and private estates, senile rubber
trees have been replaced with high yielding clonal planting materials. On
the other hand, the smallholders still maintain extensive senile and jungle
rubber areas. Therefore, the Government-owned and private estates have
substantially higher dry rubber yields per hectare than the smallholders
areas which average some 350 kg/ha per annum.
2.07     The Government of Indonesia has long been aware that the key to
increasing rubber production is to improve planting material and practices
in the smallholder sector. One strategic option being pursued ia development
of smallholder rubber through PMU projects such as SRDP, which are designed to
assist the poor low-income rubber smallholders in the outer islands of the Indo-
nesian archipelago. Such projects are supportive of the GOI goal of equzitable
distribution of the benefits of economic development.
2.08     In accordance with GOI policy, financial assistance to smallholders
for direct field development costs under SRDP I was provided on a credit
basis in order to: (1) make the program more equitable, replicable and
consistent with other programs, (2) teach farmers not to expect handouts
from the Government and to make good use of the investment to enable them
to repay, and (3) tap the resources of the batiking system for financing
the program. Thus, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), as partial financier and
risk taker, became the executing bank under the Project.



-5-                                         5
The Project's main long-range objectives were: (1) to raise the
incomes of some 32,000 snallholder families, about 30% of which were in the
proverty group, (2) to increase Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings
frcm rubber, and (3) to build the institutional framework and data base
for the national smallholder rubber program.
2.09     The quality of planting materials and input levels for field
development were based on agriculturally sound standards in order to ensure
acceptable future rubber yields. Field development cost, however, was
lowered by making cash incentive payments to participating farmers at 50Z
of prevailing farm wage rates.
Project Description
2.10     The Project covered a six-year (April 1980 - March 1986) time slice
of rubber development in Taluk Kuantan (Riau), Prabumulib (South Sumatra)
and Anjungan (West Kalimantan) under the responsibility of three PMUs at the
field level, with Provincial Offices providing coordination functions at the
provincial capitals. Project Headquarters at Jakarta was responsible for
centralized management control.
2.11     The main components of the Project as appraised were:
(1)      planting and maintaining to maturity 38,500 hectares of smallholder
rubber, including intercrops, and maintaining to maturity about
8,000 hectares planted in 1975 - 1979 under the ARP;
(2)      developing about 775 hectares of rubber nurseries to provide planting
material;
(3)      constructing about 200 ba of secondary village roads and 900 km of
estate-type roads, and upgrading about 300 km of village roads, to
provide access for inputs and for rubber marketing;
(4)      strengthening the PKUs and newly created SRDP Unit at Jakarta (with
a monitoring and evaluation section) through recruitment ar.d
training of some 200 technical and administrative staff (in addition



-6-                                            6
to about 100 already employed), employment of four consultants
(on rubber production, training, finance and organization),
and provision of vehicles, warehouses and staff houses; and
(5)      carrying out pilot programs for minimal assistance to spontaneous
planters, and conducting studies and start-up activities for a
future follow-up project.
2.12     To maximize the number of beneficiaries and to ensure that each
family could properly develop and tap its rubber, a two-hectare plantins
limit per family was imposed. To ensure that smallholders could develop
their land without hired labor, one hectare was cleared and planted initial-
ly, and the second hectare three years later. Where mechanical land pre-
paration was used, some farmers planted both hectares in the same year.

3.   IMPLEMENTATION
Start-Up
3.01     The Development Credit Agreement was signed on April 3, 1980 and
became effective on May 23, 1980, and the first of the five planting years
was scheduled in fiscal year April 1, 1980  Miarch 31, 1981.
However, project start-up activities were rather slow and picked up
momentum only toward the end of 1980, because of (1) the inexperience
of Project management and staff in implemencing World Bank assisted develop-
ment projects and (2) the late release (in September 1980) of project
funds. The later was to become a chronic problem which contributed signifi-
cantly to the delay in carrying out the planting program.
Revis ions
3.02     In 1985, project cost updating was undertaken in common with other
GOI projects financially assisted by the World Bank, due to large amounts
of unutilized loan balances. Eighteen million US Dollars (US$ 18 million)
of the SRDP I credit were cancelled in August 1985 to reduce the total
credit from US$ 45 million to US$ 27 million. The reduc on of the require-
ment for external financing was caused mainly by the continuing rise.in the
Rupian - US Dollar exchange rate from Rp 625 = US$ 1 at the time or appraisal
up to a high of Rp 1,134 - USS 1 in 1985/86.
3.03     SRDP I components not implemented were (1)  the pilot program for
minimal assistance to spontaneous planters, because of concentration of
project efforts and attention toward field planting (2) the study on rubber
taxation which was envisaged to be implemented under the supervision of the
Ministry of Finance, and (3) the start-up activicies for SRDP II which was

3.04     Items not in SAR but funded by the Project after obtaining prior

Implemeatation Schedule
3.05     Overall field planting reached 36,201 hectares (94Z of 38,500
hectares per appraisal) over a period of six years (five years per appraisal)
up to 1985/86(Annex 1, Table 1) as presented in the table below.  The
Project closing date (March 31, 1986), however, was not extended.

3e06     Field planting peaked in 1982/83 when actual planting covered up
shortfalls in the two preceding years. Unfortunately GOI rinancial con-
straints slowed down the pace of field planting starting in 1983/84.
The extension of the planting period could be attributed to the following:
(1) Until 1985/86, the GOI budgetary system used to allow the
implementation of a year's budgeted activities over a four-
year period (the year for which the budget was approved plus
three succeeding years).   In any one year, four approved
budgets could be effective and be implemented.
(2) The initial fund releases for each budget year were. delayed
n-incipally because of the late release (ranging from 2 to 9
months) of the approved budget document (DIPP).

(3)  Credit closing date was March 31, 1986.   Iuplementation of
physical activities continued luntil March 1986 which necessi-
tated a six-month extension of credit closing to accotmodate
project disbursements and submission of withdrawal applications
after closing date.
3.07     Individual PMUs performetd with varying degrees of success in meeting
planting targets, as follows:
Table 2: Total Planting by PMU

Total                 36,201                   38,500
X===m=
During implementation, project management shifted a portion of the planting
target from T. Kuantan to Prabumulih in order to reduce any overall short-
fall. In hindsight, the planting zarget should have been more evenly
distributed among the three PMUs.
3.08     In sumary, thz overall planting target and the original schedule
could have been fully realized had delayed fund releases not been a dominant
feature during the project period.
Monitoring and Reporting
3.09     The monitoring systems to regularly compile inforuation and to
report on baseline data concerning participating smallholders, institutional
development, physical implementation and quality of fieId development have
not been formalized. However, the Project has been submitting information
as requested by World Bank missions on project supervision and follow-up
project appraisal.



-10-                                           10
3.10     SRDP had been submitting quarterly statement of receipts and dis-
bursements, and audited annual financial statements (balance sheet and
statement of expenditures) to the World Bank. These reports, together
with monthly and quarterly financial reports, had been also submitted to
GOI agencies (Bappenas, MOF, BI, BRI, MOA/DGE and Team Khusus). As agreed
during negotiations, the State Auditors (BPKP) have been examining the
project accounts. The last audit released was for 1984/85; the audit field
work for 1985/86 is in progress. Annual progress reports were submitted
only for the first two years of the Project.
Proci.rement
3.11     Procurement procedures followed both the World Bank guidelines and
GOI regulations. Changes in procedures during the period of implementation
were: (1) the increase (from US$ 200,000 to US$ 320,000) of the amount of
any one contract requiring pre-review by the World Bank, the increase (from
US$ 16,000 to US$ 20,000) of the amount for LCB (per RSI letter dated May 8,
1981), and (2) the direct purchase (formerly through ICB) of TSP and MOP at
GOI standard subsidized prices (per RSI letters dated April 16,1981 Novem-
ber 15, 1982 and January 11, 1983).
3.12     The lengthy procurement procedures (6 months for LCB and 12-16 months
for ICB), together with delays in the approval of annual budgets, resulted
in late delivery of required farm inputs, which in turn caused reduction in
the total quantities of fertilizers purchased since dosages cannot be doubled
up to compensate for missed applications. Other causes of reduced total
volume of materials procured (Annex 1, Table 7) were: (1) lower hectarage
of ARP planting (3,435 hectares against 8,000 hectares per appraisal)
absorbed by SRDP because of low technical standards and unqualified farmers,
(2) unavailability of certified seeds for upland rice for intercropping and
the prohibition of intercropping in Anjungan due to the steep gradients of
developed fields, (3) GOI funding difficulties starting 1983/84 which
resulted in a slow-down of all project activities.

3.13     All motor vehicles and agricultural equipment planned at the time
of project appraisal were procured (Annex 1, Table 6), except for cnainsaws
which were reduced from 430 to 198 units due to the reluctance of farmers Co
use chainsaws for tree felling. Additional equipment procured, although not
in the Staff Appraisal Report, were approved by the World Bank - RSI on a
case to case basis.
3.14     Concerning civil works, initial problems encountered were in co-
ordinating with the Provincial Governments as to overall plans and determining
which sections would be funded by the Project. In general for two years the
programmes could be adhered to with varying quality due to different methods
of implementation (whether mechanical or manual) and the experience of the
contractors. Unfortunately in succeeding years, budget constraints delayed
further construction. A total of 580 km of roads were constructed which is
much lower than the SAR estimate of 1,200 km (Annex 1, Table 5 and Table 3
below).
3.15     Emphasis was continually placed on the importance of a good infra-
structure both for implementation and future marketing with particular
attenCion to placement of culverts and bridges of solid construction (steel
or concrete). Some highlights were the construction of a major bridge in
Prabumulih, the opening of some 40 kilometres of primary roads at Taluk
Kuantan, and the construction on force account of a road linking up Sub Units
1 and 2 in Anjungan, using the project buldozer to fill in the swampy areas.
3.16     In the absence of interested contractors, maintenance c  roads has
been done by the PMUs on force account. With the concentration of PMU
attention to rubber field development, however, road maintenance was
progressively accorded less attention than ideal.
3.17     Buildings constructed during the project period are generally
adequate to meet operational requirements, although the number of warehouses
and workshops constructed was lower than envisioned in the Staff Appraisal
Report (Annex 1, Table 5 and Table 3 below).

Costs
3.18     Actual project cost (Annex 3, Tables 1  and 2) up to the credit
closing  date reached a total of Rp 38,764 million equivalent to US$ 43,850
thousand broken down as follows:

3.19     The total cost expressed in Rupiahs reached 88% of appraisal estimate,
while project cost reckoned in US Dollars represents only 62% of appraisal
estimate.  The difference in the above percentages is attributable to changes
in currency conversion rates during the project period, since about 67% of
total cost represented local currency expenditures.  At the time of appraisal,
the conversion rate used was US$ 1.00 - Rp 635; actual conversion rates
reached a high of US$ 1.00 - Rp 1,134 (before 12 September 1986 devaluation)
because of the progressive depreciation of the value of the Indonesian Rupiah.

3.20     Total project cost was lower than the appraisal estimate, because
of the following:
(1) Lower total planting - 36,201 hectares or 94% of the 38,500
hectare target
(2) Less hectarage of ARP previous planting taken over by SRDP due
to the quality of fields   3,435  hectares against appraisal.
estimate of 8,000 hectares
(3) Components not implemented - assistance to spontaneous planters,
rubber taxation study, and start-up of SRDP II (Para 3.03)
(4)  Less civil works construction and unfilled staff vacancies due to
GOI policies
(5) Lower aggregate volume of fertilizers utilized due to procure-
ment delays and the agronomic consideration which does not
permit augmenting fertilizer dosage to cover up previously
missed applications.
3.21     Total field development cost, comprising field establishment and
maintenance costs during the project period, reached Rp 22.8 billion for the
39,636 hectares (including 3,435 hectares of ARP planting) in three project
locations (Annex 3, Table 4), with average unit costs presented below:

3.22     Although average development costs per hectare (average of US$ 1,300
or Rp 812,500 translated at Rp 625 per US$ 1 per appraisal) are in line with
appraisal estimates, there was wide variation among project locations,
principally because of unavoidable differing requirements due to:
(a) varying unit costs of planting materials due to differences in
the efficiency rates (seed germination rate, culling rate,
budgrafting success rate, rejection rate) of nursery operations
(Annex 3, Table 5)
(b) differing requirements for supplying field planting, because
of weather conditions, animal damage and other technical reasons
(Annex 3, Table 5)
(c) incidence of alang-alang which varied widely from one field block/
?MU to another; for instance there was generally sparce alang-
alang in T. Kuantan, while there was a high incidence in Anjungan.
Control costs naturaliy varied in line with the incidence of
this pernicious weed.
(d) irregular application of fertilizers because of procurement delays
(e) higher cost of mechanical land clearing in Prabumulih compared
with the manual method in T. Kuantan and Anjungan.

Fund Releases
3 25     It was unfortunate that releases of funds to the Project had been
persistently delayed throughout the period of implementation. The factors
which contributed to the delay were: (1) approval of annual budgets which
were about four to six months late; (2) the nature of the BI/BRI fund
release procedures where a delay in the initial year caused a chain of delays
in the succeeding years; (3) extraneous conditions imposed by BI/BRI in
releasing their portion of the financing; (4) constraints on government
finances starting 1983/84 which was aggravated later by the drastic erosion of
oil prices; and (5) the GOI policy in effect up to 1985/86 which permitted
the implementation of a fiscal year's budgeted activities over a four-year
period -- a policy which accommodated delays in releases of funds and thus
in project implementation.
3.26     To alleviate the chronic problem of delayed fund releases, project
management had to resiurt to the following measures: (1) allocating limited
available funds to top priority activities (establishment and maintenance of
nurseries, maintenance of planted fields, and salaries of staff); (2) reducing
field planting and related activities to a level which could be supported by
available funds; (3) deferring family labor cash payments to participating
farmers; (4) advancing by one year the budget provisions for imported
fertilizers and herbicides; and (5) interaccount borrowing of funds among
activities within a year and among budget years, in order to direct available
funds to priority activities -- a practice which was and still is a violation
of regulations but which was unofficially condoned by authorities concerned.
To address the external factors which were beyond its control, project manage-
ment resorted to personal approaches, which were supplemented by representa-
tions by World Bank officials from Washington and RSI at various occasions.
This achieved some results, and SRDP hAd less severe funding problems compared
with other tree crop development projects.



-18-                              ~~~~~~~~~~18
3.27     The funding problem adversely affected the overall progress of project
implementation and resulted to the following: (1) the extension of the planting
program from five to six years and a shortfall of 2,300 hectares of total planting;
(2) delays in provision of field inputs and the ultimate reduction of total
volumes of materials procured; and (3) forced reductions of expenditures which
lowered the total project cost compared with appraisal estimate.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.28     Local public works officers and consultants performed well in designing
and supervising civil construction. Contractors in Prabumulih and Anjungan
likewise performed civil works according to contract. Due to lack of bonafide
contractors in T. Kuantan, however, there were cases of half completed buildings
left by contractors in spite of penalties imposed under the contracts. In such
instances, other contractors had to be hired to complete the jobs with much
delays.
3.29     Land utilization surveys and land titling have been budgeted one to
two years after planting. Further, land surveys and titling, which are contracted
to the Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs for one-year periods, actually
took two to three years to process because of the large hectarages involved. The
cumulative effect of these delays has resulted n the following:
(a) Rp 10.3 million of land utilization survey contracts and Rp 204.9
million of land titling contracts, amounts which pertain to
uncompleted portions of 11 outstanding contracts as of project
closing date, remained unpaid. These &mounts will have to be
carried over to and funded by SRDP II.
(b) Planted areas totalling 2,382 hectares not yet covered by land
utilization survey contract and 4,632 hectares not yet contracted
for land titling (Annex 1, Table 8) estimated to cost Rp 36
million and Rp 137 million, respectively, at current unit costs,
will likewise be funded by SRDP It.

3.30     Continuing Project management efforts to have land titling budgeted
one year after field planting, and the issuance of Regulation No. 3 of 1985
by the Minister of Internal Affairs delegating authority to the District Heads
(Bupati) for the issuance of land titles in connection with projects of the
Department of Agriculture, should minimize delays in the future under SaDP II.

4. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPACT
Field Development
4.01     Nurseries.  Since rootstock nurseries for rubber are established
one year before planting, planting materials for 1980/81 (the first year of
planting under the Project) came from the Rubber Replanting Project I (RR I)
nurseries which were established in 1979/80 and funded by SRDP I on a retro-
active basis. Rubber seeds, which were supplied by state-owned and private
estates in North Sumatra under FTP V coordination and quality control by
Tanjung Morawa Research Station, were generally of satisfactory quality.
Germination procedures utilized resulted in germination rates in excess of
60% in most years, which was most satisfactory in comparison with previous
years' rates of 30% - 35%.   Budgrafting training was carried out by technical
staff on site with generally most satisfactory results (about 85% budding
success) considering that only some 50% of budgrafters could be retained each
year due to shift in location of rootstock n,.rseries. A total of 933
hectares of rootstock nurseries more establishe'.  Sixteen hectares of new
budwood nurseries were well established with GT 1 clone, while 30 hectares ex-
ARP nurseries were brought up to a high standard of upkeep, with rogues cut out.
In summary, after nursery staff had gained experience, a high nursery standard
was achieved, and the great emphasis on cost effectiveness was rewarded with
good results.
4.02     Farmer Selection.  From the outset it was appreciated that proper
selection of farmers was of paramount importance to successful field develop-
ment. The Project, therefore, adhered to the following criteria, agreed in
the SFA, in selecting participating farmers:
o residing permanently at project area;
o healthy and above 18 years of age;
o uwning rubber field or working as share-tapper;
o rubber fields owned were low-yielding;



-.21 -21
o soil, slope and drainage of land were suitable;
o family labor was sufficient to develop project planting; and
o did not own more than two hectares of rice field.
4.03     Land Clearing and Intercropping.  In Prabumulih, about 75% of land
clearing was done mechanically due to the flat terrain and existing vegetation
(belukar and alang-alang), while in Taluk Kuantan and Anjungan the manual
method was employed because of the hilly terrain, and mostly secondary jungle
and old rubber trees were to be cleared. Manual land clearing had the advantage
of providing farmers with additional family labor cash payments as well as a
feeling of working their own land. Tree felling by chainsaws was tried out,
but was not well accepted by farmers in view of higher cost compared with the
manual method.
4.04     After land clearing, rice intercrops were planted in Prabumulih (up
to three times) and in Taluk Kuantan (up to two times) to provide additional
income to farmers (Annex 2, Table la and lb). Advantages of such intercropping
were:
a.       Provision of an incentive to farmers to frequently visit their fields
before and after rubber planting, thus rubber related activities were more
closely attended to by farmers;
b.       Better utilization of the land during the initial years of rubber
development; and
c.       Less incidence of damage by mammalian pests, since farmers work more
often in the fields and in some cases lived in huts in the fields.
Intercropping, however, had the disadvantage of requiring stricker control of
alang-alang which appeared after the last rice intercrop.
4.05     Planting and Sugplying. Realizing that proper planting technique
determines the successful growth of young rubber trees, PMUs gave each farmer a
max;-um of 50 budded stumps a day for planting. The planting distance of
8 m x 2.5 m was changed to 6 m x 3.3 m in 1982/83 to promote earlier closing of
the canopies in order to hamper the growth of alang-alang. On slopes of more
than 15 degrees (especially in Anjungan and Taluk Kuantan),terraces were
constructed in addition to planting of leguminous cover crops, to prevent land
erosion.



22
-22-
4.06     Supplying of additional planting material (bare-root budded stumps for
early supply and polvbagged materials for late supply) was completed usually
in the: following planting season, because of insufficiency of materials.
Average supplying rates were 35% in Taluk Kuantan, 34% in Prabumulih and 12%
in Anjungan (15Z per appraisal estimate).   The high rates of supplying in
Taluk Kuantan and Prabumulih were due to:
a.      Insufficient rain during planting season and drought experienced in
Prabumulih in 1983/84;
b.      Extensive damage due to animals (wild pigs, deer and elephants) in
Taluk Kuantan; and
c.      Technical reasons such as unconsolidated soil at the time or planting.
4.07     Field Maintenance.  Field maintenance activities could not be imple-
mented on a regular basis due to the late availability of fertilizers and
agrochemicals and the insufficiency of family labor cash payments to support
the daily needs of farmers who were forced to work for other sources of income
outside the Project. Despite these problems, efforts exerted by PMUs through
continual persuasion of farmers minimized adverse effects on the growth of
rubber trees; this is borne out by girth measurements (Annex 1, Table 2) which
meet set standards.
4.08     Policy on fertilizer dosages was in accordance with that  recommended
in the SAR. However, considering the differences in girth measurements which
indicate generally slower growth in Anjungan compared with the other two areas,
there is a need to conduct systematic soil and leaf analyses in order to determine
the fertilizer dosage most appropriate for each area.
4.09     To eradicate alang-alang, spraying gangs were formed, trained and
closely supervised with good results. Follow-up wiping, however, was a problem,
because of the tedious efiorts required on a regular basis which, from the
farmers' viewpoint, did not provide sufficient financial incentive.



-23 -
23
4.10     Pests and Diseases.  Plant damage by animals, especially elephants,
had been one of the most serious problems encountered in Taluk Kuantan.
Efforts to erect fences have not been effective in coijtrolling elephants
which are protected by the wild life conservation laws of Indonesia. The
incidence of rubber root diseases had been noticeable, but was within controll-
able limits.
4,11     Tapping.   A total of some 760 hec4ares of ARP plantings maintained
under the Project have been opened for tapping (S2/D2 system), with total
production reaching some 360 tons of 100% DRC valued at about Rp 275 million up
t^ March 31, 1986 (Annex 2, Table 2). Actual yields in Prabumulih were averaging
450 kg/ha. for the first tapping year and 800 kg/ha. for the second year.
Before commencing tapping, farmers were given training on opening and tapping
techniques, maintenance of tapping equipment, processing of latex into clean
thin slabs and air-dried sheets, and method of determiriing DRC.
Incremental Output
4.12     Based on recent estimates, the Project will lead to incremental rubber
production of some 682,.200 tons (675,000 tons per appraisal) over the 30-year
project period, with total foreign exchange earnings of US$ 562 million (USS 884
million per appraisal) as detailed below.   In spite of a lower total hectarage,
incremental production per PCR estimate is slightly higher than the appraisal
estimate, because of the higher yield assumed considering the overall quality
of planting. Foreign exchange earnings per PCR estimate are lower due to the
depressed international price outlook for rubber.

Technological Change
4.13     The Project implemented 22,;67 hectares of replanting and 13,634
hectares of new planting, or a total of 36,201 hectares owned by some 28,340
smallholders in Taluk Kuantan (Riau), Prabumulih (South Sumatra) and Anjungan
(West Kalimantan). The Project provided the farmers with credit assistance in
the form of selected high-yielding planting materials, fertilizers and agro-
chemicals, and family labor incentive payments, as well as technical advice on
scientific cultural practices from land clearing to field planting and mainte-
nance through tapping and on-farm processing.
4.14     Technological change is closely related to the success of technical
extension which may be measured in terms of: (1) farmers' receptiveness and
absorption of new technology as reflected in actual field accomplishments
which were generally acceptable in terms of boch ph,sical volume and quality,
although there were cases of problem farmers; and (2) cohesiveness and co-
operation among farmers, within groups and among farmer groups, as portrayed
by coordination in performing field and marketing activities according to
schedule, group sanctions against erring members, and pravision of group
funded facilities in some instances.
4.15     Notable changes in technology employed by participating and non-partici-
pating farmers as well were:
a. Use of high-yielding planting materials. Farmers are now aware of the
advantages of planting budded stumps which are now used even by non-participa-
ting farmers. Some farmers had established their own little rootstock nurseries,
with budwood taken from mature rubber trees of known clone, for the purpose of
planting and supplying their own fields or selling budded stumps to fellow
farmers. Fields now in production prove that those planted with budded stumps
yield two to three times more than those planted with seedlings.



26
-26 -
b.   Use of fertilizers.  Farmers have realized the mierits of applying
fertilizers, especially in relatively unfertile land as in Anjungan, where
tree girth grew 9 - 10 cm. per year in fertilized fields, compared with only
6 - 7 cm. per year in irregularly fertilized fields. In Prabumulih, farmers
whose fields are already in production have been setting aside a portion of
their rubber income to purchase fertilizers.
c.   Weed eradication. Farmers are now generally aware that the presence of
alang-alang hinders the growth of rubber trees and could reduce production by
up to 50% as experienced in Prabumulih. Follow-up wiping after alang-alaag
spraying, however, is still not judiciously performed by farmers.
d.   Improvement of other cultural practices. Improved field practices being
performed include proper lining and contouring where necessary, proper holing
and soii consolidation after planting, and planting of leguminous cover crops
to maintain soil fertility and to prevent the incidence of alang-alang and other
weeds.
e.   Proper tapping. Proper tapping of rubber trees is critical, because it
influences the productive life of the trees. The Project has suggested to
farmers the adoption of the S2/D2 system, which is a significant change from the
traditional practice of daily tapping, and has trained farmers on proper tapping
techniques. Farmers whose fields are already in production have generally
followed project guidance, although bark consumption can still be reduced.
f.   Formation of farmer associations.  With the formation of farmer associations,
which have been managed by farmers themselves and have been instrumental in
strengthening their marketing position, farmers have ragained their self-
confidence and became aware that they, in urity, are indeed capable of improving
their economic status. Farmer experience in managing their own affairs and
exposure to available banking facilities will undoubtedly open up new
opportunities.



-27                                            27
4.16     As the development activities of the Project became known in the
farming communities where SRDP has been operating, more and more farmers
wanted to join the Project. Due to the limited number of farmers who could
be accepted, the Project has suggested to the other farmers, particularly
those with the financial means, to develop their own fields based on project
technical guidelines. The poor farmers without financial resources, however,
have to be assisted by the follow-up project. The Project impact, therefore,
has been felt in the equitable distribution of development, not only to the
outer regions, but more importantly to the low income group which deserve
development assistance.
4.17     With the replanting of old rubber (from which farmers had derived
income estimated at Rp 700,000 per year from two hectares), farmers' gross
incomes from rubber have decreased during the period of field development
(Annex 2, Table 3).  Starting the 8th year, however, incremental gross income
from two hectares of rubber is expected to reach about Rp 135,000 and to
increase rapidly to Rp 2,300,000 by the 16th year. Thereafter, incremental
income would decline gradually to Rp 900,000 by the 30th year. Over the long
term, therefore, increase in farmers' income from rubber would be quite
substantial.

5.  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Econmic Rate of Return
5.01     The economic rate of return (ERR) per PCR is estimated at 15% (14%
per appraisal) calculated on the same basis used at the time of appraisal
(Annex 6, Table la). The exclusion of land titling cost and inclusion of
provisions for maintenance of roads and for cost of extension during the
production period slightly reduce the ERR to 14.6% (Annex 6, Table 1).
Beneficiaries Cash Flow
5.02     Participating farmers'cash flows during the first eight years are
estimated to be lower than the cash flows without the Project (Annex 2, Table 3
with interest to farmers of 6% p.a., free during the seven-year grace period).
Commencing the 9th year, the   incremental net cash inflow from two hectares
of rubber is estimated to be Rp 390,000, which would peak at Rp 1,794,000 by
the 16th year, and gradually decrease to Rp 276,000 by the 33rd year. The
financial rate of return is 25% (more than 50% per appraisal). The lower
rate of return is due mainly to the provision for farm inputs (not provided
at time of appraisal) for new rubber in the cash outflows, and the exclusion of
income from other crops (included in appraisal). If the interest charged to
farmers were to be raised to 12% p.a. (free during the first three years,
accrued and capitalized for four years), the financial rate of return would
fall to 22% (Annex 1, Table 3a).

6. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     In general, institutional development during tne Project period,
followed the fundamental concepts envisaged in the SAR. However, institutional
development relative to training was expanded beyond that foreseen in the SAR.
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.02     During the start-up period, it was recognized by Project management
that the Project's manpower, especially the key managers and extension workers,
constituted its most important resource. Project management believed that the
success or failure of the Project was directly linked with the caliber of its
key managers and extension workers and that the Project's primary role was to
transfer appropriate technologies to the smallholders by providing access to:
high yielding planting materials and agro-inputs; better techniques of
cultivation, maintenance and intercropping; efficient collection and handling
systems; and guides to processing and marketing systems to ensure high small-
holders' incomes, and thus better quality of life for the smallholders.
Project management therefore, emphasized the training aspect to upgrade its
inexperienced staff, particularly the extension workers.
6.03     Project management was hampered by the internal constraints of a
defective and time-consuming planning process, disoreinted Project staff and
ineffective monitoring and control mechanisms, as well as the pervasive external
factor of delayed fund releases and consequent shortages of agro-inputs.
However, by means of a strong, progressive and dynamic Project leadership,
generally effective utilization and back-up support from specialist consultants,
and planned and intensive Project staff training, Project management satis-
factorily improved the planning process by trying to make it more relevant to
actual field requirements, steered the Project away from an over-emphasis on
financial and administrative activities, and improved the monitoring and control
mechanisms.



-30                                       30
6.04     SRDP was created in January 1979 as a special unit   in the DGE.
Originally, the SRDP Manager at Jakarta had 3 deputies, namely: Technical,
Finance and Administration Division heads. Small Provincial Units headed by
Provincial Unit Managers were established in the provincial capitals of
Pakanbaru, Palembang and Pontianak. Each Provincial Unit included a Treasurer
responsible for the PMU accounts, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance
regulations. There were 3 PMUs located in Taluk Kuantan, Prabumulih and
Anjungan absorbed by SRDP to be the field implementing units. Each PMU was
headedbya PMU Manager. with assistant managers for nurseries, mechinery and
workshops, finance, administration and 3 to 4 subunits.  Each subunit head
was assisted by Field Supervisors, who supervise PLPTs.
6.05     The three PMU Managers and three Provincial Unit Managers reported
directly to the Project Manager at headquarters. This centralized control or
reporting arrangement proved to be effective because the PMUs needed close
attention and support due to the inexperience and shortage of qualified field
personnel.
6.06     The Project organization envisaged by the SAR was generally sound,
except in the coneptualization of the training function.  SAR envisioned
training to be a minor aspect under the direction and control of the Technical
Division at headquarters. The consequence was that initial training of the
Project was biased towards the technical subject matter. The equally important
training on the aspects of manageme.it, extension, finance and administration
were paid scant attention and were obviously beyond the capability of the
Technical Division to handle. With the strong support of the DGE and the Bank,
the Project rectified the training issue by proposing and securing approval
from concerned agencies to create a Training and Extension Division at head-
quarters level and a unit on *Training and Extension for each PMU to be headed
by an Assistant Manager. The SRDP I organization chart as envisioned by the SAR
is presented in Annex 5, Chart 1 and that of the modified and improved SRDP I
organization chart is shown in Annex 5, Chart 2.



- 31 -                                     31
6.07     The PMU organization structure at the field level promoted an effective
extension framework. However, it was weakened by the fact that the PMU
managers, sub-unit managers, field supervisors and extension workers were over
burdened by paperwork-The situation was aggravated by the broad geographical
coverage, large total area, and number of participating farmers (some 50% to
1002 more than that envisioned in the SAR). Additionally, the extension support
was somewhat defective because the mobility of the extension workers was hampered
by shortage of motorbikes, and because arrival of agro-inputs was often delayed.
Consequently, the T & V system of information transfer was most difficult
to institutionalize.
6.08     It is noteworthy  that the PMU system,based on the Project's
experience, has an ideal and manageable size limit. The upper limit for one
PM  should be 10,000 hectares (5,000 farmers).  Above this size limit, the
field supervision and the T & V system of extension show a marked decline in
effectiveness.
Institutional Design and Growth
6.09     Many agencies were involved during Project implementation.  Pre-eminent
agencies are listed below together with their roles:
a) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA): This is made up of 5 directorates
general, namely: Estates, Fisheries, Food Crops, Forestry and Live-
stock; plus the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development
(AARD) and the Agency for Agricultural Education, Training and
Extension. The Directorate General of Esttes (DGE) regulates all
private estates and smallholdings involving tree crops and
industrial crops. DGE comprises 6 directorates: Planning, Production,
Farm Management, Plant Protection, Rehabilitation and Development,
and Extension; plus a Secretariat.   To facilitate project implemen-
tation, especially for externally-assisted DGE projects, DGE
created the Special Team for Externally-Assisted Projects (Team



32
32 -
Khusus) to provide technical assistance to projects related to
the special implementation requirements such as procurement,
budgeting, recruitment, project start-up and legal advice. Recently,
however,   Ministerial Decree  No. 279/Kpts/KP.150/5/1986 issued
on 12 May 1986 limits Team Khusus only to DGE domestically-funded
projects (PIR).  And   DGE decree No. 55/RC.330/SK/DJ.BUN/9/1986
issued on 18 September 1986 specifies that DGE externally-assisted
projects will be under the supervision of the Directorate of
Rehabilitation and Development.
b) Ministry of Finance (MOF): This agency, with the approval of the
National Development Planning Board  (BAPPENAS), provides funds for
development after a thorough review of the project budget and funding
requirements.
c) Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI): Provided a portion of credit funds and
acted as executing bank, and made family labor payements to farmers.
d) Provincial Estate Crop Services (DPDs): These units are mandated to
oversee development activities at the provincialand district levels.
They are technically responsible to the DGE but administratively
under the provincial governments.
e) BAPPEDA: Coordinated Project plans with other development plans
in the provincses.

6.10     It would have been better if all concerned agencies involved in
Project implementation had developed a project operations perception. This
means that all concerned agencies should have made themselves familiar with
the Project operations and bottlenecks with a view to enhancing implementation
than concentrating on adherence to rigid regulations which in effect
slow down the Project,especially field operations.
6.11     The intent of each of the above concerned agencies was to facilitate
the implemen.ation of the Project. However, much work would need to be
done for follow-up projects in coordinating the various agencies to prevent
slowdowa of project implementation.
6.12     There was a marked growth of Project personnel from 221 at the
beginning of project (fiscal year 1980/81) to 323 (fiscal year,1981/82), a
percentage growth of 46X. Subsequently, Project personnel grew 6X, from 323
to 343, for fiscal year 1982/83; 23Z, from 343 to 421, for fiscal year 1982/83;
2%, from 421 to 429, for fiscal year 1984/85; and finally 7%, from 429 to 460,
for fiscal year 1985/86. During the entire Project period staff strength grew
from 221 to 460 (52%).
6.13     The headquarters office locateL in Jalan Hayam Wuruk, 4AX-BX in Jakarta
was overcrowded so that some staff of necessity occupied the corridors. The
provincial offices of Pakanbaru and Pontianak were also characterized by
overcrowding. The exception was Palembang which had adequate office space.
6.14     The PMU offices at Anjungan, Prabumulih and Taluk Kuantan had impressive
building infrastructure which were constructed under the Project and strategi-
cally located to link with the farmers. The ouilding details in square meters
are as follows:

In addition to the above, 540 square meters of staff housing were constructed
in Jakarta and 60 square meters of office space were constructed in West
Kalimantan provincial office in Pontianak. Finally, it is noteworthy that there
had been no maintenance work undertaken for the buildings because of GOI
restriction on maintenance expenditures.
Staff Recruitment
6.15     The SAR, DIPP (annual budget), and actual staffing patterns, from
fiscal year 1980/81 to 1985/86, are shown below. It can be seen from the
table that the acttual staffing had fallen short, during every fiscal year, from
levels assumed in the SAR One constraint to recruitment and hiring was that
the Project salary scale was not competitive with that of private firms. Also
noticeable from the table was the budget restriction on hiring of personnel
which was imposed in fiscal year 1982/83.  The number   of personnel was frozen
at 446.

6.16     The Project obviously suffered trom shortage of personnel, especially
at the extension worker and junior manager/supervisor levels. In 1984/85,
actual staffing was 429 compared with the SAR's 516, a shortfall of 87 personnel
or 17%. The shortfall of 87 includes 19 extension workers which has a short-
fall of 11% of the SAR's 175. This shortage of extension workers affected
the institutionalization of the T & V system of extension and markedly weakened
the Project's linkage with the farmers.
6.17     At Project completion on March 31, 1986, the detailed staffing at
headquarters, provincial offices and PMUs based on SAR and actual staffing
is shown in Annex 1, Table 9.   Headquarters, provincial offices and PMUs had
shortfall from SAR of 34, 11, and 56, respectively.
6.18     The turnover of Project personnel are as follows:

Total                 80           Average        4.2%
During the entire Project period the number of personnel who resigned, died and
were terminated total  80 or an average turnover rate of 4.2%.  The turnover
was due mainly to resignations because of better opportunities outside of the
Project, as well as the difficulty of securing a civil servant appointment.
6.19     Ideally, there should be a close connection between the recruitment and
training programs of the Project. As it was, these two programs lacked
integration. This situation, in the final analysis, made training coslier due
to piecemeal recruitment instead of batch recruitment.

Training and Development
6.20     During the start-up period, the Project groped for a training approach,
as well as a coherent, economical and effective comprehensive training
program and implementation guidelines to upgrade its inexperienced and untrained
personnel. Although the SAR had envisaged training for selected Project
personnel and smallholders, the training which was contained in the SAR was
sketchy because the intention of the Bank was to rely on the DGE for preparation
of a detailed training under the Project program.  However, SRDP at its
inception did not have the capability of preparing a training program because
of the delay in hiring a Training Consultant which was compounded by the non-
existance of a training unit. of the Project.  Consequently, Team Khusus
hastily developed an SRDP training program which was at best an elaboration of
training schedules and itemized costings of pre-determined, long-duration and
formal-type courses. Therefore, with the positive support from DGE and the
Bank, it was necessary for the Project to undertake, after the Training
Consultant was hired, a revision and improvement of the SAR and Team Khusus
training concepts.
6.21     With foreknowledge of meager and delayed releases of training funds,
the Project's training approach was to concentrate its efforts on the extension
workers who were the "frontliners" of the Project as far as the transfer of
rubber technology to the smallholders was conceraned; and in addition, training
was conducted mainly through the inexpensive informal method which had better
training impact and effect in improving the day-to-day field operations than
the more popular but ineffective formal classroom method.
6.22     With the strong support of the DGE and the Bank the Project developed
the following institutional training work program.
(a) Developing, through training needs analysis, an SRDP I Compre-
hensive Training Program, including implementation guidelines;



- 37 -
37
(b) Convincing officials of the Project and concerned agencies,
especially World Bank - RSI, DGE and Team Khusus, to accept the
SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program for implementation;
(c) On the basis of the training program and its scheduled imple-
mentation, developing a training organization framework acceptable
to the Project and all concerned agencies, and staffing the
training organization unit with suitably qualified individuals;
(d) Developing the internal training capabilities of the Project to
handle informal and selected formal courses; and
(e)  Developing and maintaining linkages with the ETCs to handle
selected formal courses.
6.23     In training, the following were accomplished:
(a) Seven volumes of training manuals, which altogether, constituted
the SRDP I C6mprehensive Training Program and Implementation
Guidelines, were developed on the basis of training needs survey
and analysis;
(b) The Project was able to convince concerned agencies to accept
the SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program for implementation;
(c) Due to difficulties of recruiting qualified personnel and GOI
restriction on hiring, the Project was able to build up the
training organization framework to an actual peak staffing of 45%
of the   required staffing to implement the SRDP I
Comprehensive Training Program;
(d) In the development of the Project's internal training capabilicies,
the factors involved were training facilities, training instructors
and training materials. The Project was not successful in
building its training facilities due to GOI restriction on cons-
truction activities, so that it resorted to conduct its in-house
training courses by utilizing empty warehouses and farmer meeting
halls as classrooms, and staff quarters and private houses as
lodging places for trainees. For training instructors, the



38
- 38 -
Project utilized its own staff to conduct informal training and
the filterdown approach to develop trainers for formal courses.
Finally, for training materials, the Project developed 7 training
course booklet manuals and accompanying training materials, 11
extension training booklet materials, 4 extension training
pamphlet materials and 2 public relations materials; and
(e) The Project was able to maintain c1ose relationships with 25 ETCs
to conduct selected formal courses.
6.24     In terms of training impact and effectiveness relative to field
operations, the informal training of both the smallholders and extension workers,
by means of the T & V system of information transfer, was the most important
aspect of the SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program. Much time and effort were
spent in gradually developing a functioning T & V system of extension, whereby the
extension workers visit their respective farmer associations on a two-week work
cycle, and teach and advise the smallholders on rubber technology and community
development. Further, the T & V system of extension was also utilized by the
Project to identify and monitor field problems encountered by the extension
workers, through the extension workers diaries and PMU managers observations,
so that these problems were discussed during the biweekly informal training of
the extension workers. In general, it can be concluded that the T & V system
of extension, which included the informal training of the smallholders and
extension workers, has now taken root in the Project's PMUs.
6.25     The Project's formal smallholder training program implementation
(refer to Annex 5, Tables I and 2) is highlighted by the following:

1/  The main factors for the shortfall was inadequate funds and frequent
delays of training fund releases.
2/  SRDP I training activities for smallholders was completed on March 31,
1985. In the last year of SRDP I, training activities shifted to the
implementation of the SRDP II Comprehensive Training Program.

The overall smallholder training under SRDP I totals 49,410 mandays. Based
on the target of the SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program, 51.3%
of smallholder formal training program was implemented for SRDP I. Further,
7.7% of the target of the smallholder fu- Ai training program for SRDP II
was accomplished in 1984/85 - 1985/86 fiscal years for the follow-up project.
6.26     The Project staff training program implementation (refer to Annex 5,
Tables 3 and 4) is highlighted by the following:
Fiscal Year          Implementation        Target          Percentage

The overall Project staff training under SRDP I totals 34,093 mandays. Based
on the target of the SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program 45.1% of the Project
Staff formal training was implemented for SRDP I. Further, 5.6% of the target
of the Project staff formal training program for SRDP II was accomplished in
1984/85-85/86 fiscal years for the following project.
3/ The main factor for the shortfall was inadequate funds. The total cost
to fully implement the SRDP I Comprehensive Training Program (smallholder
and Project staff) was estimated at Rp 1,785 million. At Project comple-
tion the actual funds utilized amounted to Rp 947 million. The funds
made available to the Project was only 53% of required training cost.
In addition to the problem of shortfall of training funds, the Project
encountered frequent delays of training fund realenses.
4/ SRDP I training activities for Project staff was completed on March 41,
1985. In the last year of SRDP I, training activities shifted to the
implementation of the SRDP II Comprehensive Training Program.

6.27     Regarding the various Project staff formal training under SRDP I
(refer to Annex 5,Table 3) the following are the job category comparisons;
Job Category            Man-day            Percent
Senior Manager            114               0.75Z
Junior Manager          3,234              21.25
Extension Worker       11,365              74.68

Tota.              15,218             100.0oz
It can be seen that the thrust of the Project's formal training were of the
extension worker and juniior manager levels. The extension worker and junior
manager formal training are 74.68% and 21.25%, respectively, of the toal
mandays training implementation. The senior manager and rank-and-file formal
training were de-emphasized; the percentage are 0.75% and 3.32%, respectively,
of the total mandays training implementation.
6.28     Tha most critical training implementation constraints and obstacles
which confronted the Project were as follows:
a)   There was delayed hiring of a Training Consultant (10 months
after the Project started) and appointment of a suitable counter-
part (3 years and 3 months after the Project started);
b)   The pervasive factor of insufficient and delayed releases of
training funds obviously limited training implementation;
c)   The practice of measuring and evaluating a training program on
the basis of how much money was disbursed per fiscal year was
most difficult to modify into the correct long-term measurement
and evaluation based on a standard training program (SRDP I
Comprehensive Training Prog.am);
d)   Many of the courses offered by the ETCs did not satisfactorily
attain relevance and the teaching methods of the ETCs needed
much improvement;



41
-41                                      41
e)   In convincing concerned agencies to accept the SRDP I Comprehensive
Training Program for implementation, much time was spent on
meetings and follow-ups;
f)   The creation of the training organization framework and its sub-
sequent staffing, in the context of existing regulations and
external factors, ere time-consuming and difficult;
g)   In the development of the internaltraining capabilities of the
Project, the aspect of building physical facilities was not realized
due to GOI policy of temporary restriction on construction; and
h)   The development of trainers for the Project's Training Division
was far from satisfactory due to difficulties in attracting,
recruiting and retaining potential trainers.
6.29     The Project's Training Division was able to stretch the funds available
(53Z of total funds requirement) to develop the T & V system of extension,
including the informal training of the smallholders and extension workers, to
accomplish 50% of formal training required for smallholders and Project staff,
and to conduct pre-project informal training for SRDP II extension workers and
office staff totalling 5,954 mandays.
6.30     Training was a key factor in the success of. the Project.  More
importantly, a ripple impact of the Project's training was created. The training
lessons learned by the Project was the foundation on which the comprehensive
training program and implementation guidelines of the SRDP II were formulated.
Finally, the Project's training approach and comprehensive program are presently
serving as guides in the rormulation of the SECDP training component and the
massive training program of the estate crops subsector being undertaken by the
HRDP.

Technical Assistance Performance
6.31     The hiring of four specialist consultants conformed with the SAR,
namely: Technical Adviser, Training Adviser, Finance Adviser,and Organization
and Management Adviser. However, there was delayed recruitment of the Training
Adviser (one month after the December 31, 1980 deadlitue specified in Develop-
ment Credit Agreement) and the Organization and Management Adviser (10 months
after the deadline'. The case of the long-delayed recruitment and hiring of
the organization and Management Adviser was due to re-tendering because of the
resignation of the consultant originally proposed by the previous winning firm.
6.32     From the perception of Project management, the overall performance
of the specialist consultants is rated as good. Individually, the rating
varies from excellent to satisfactory.
6.33     It is pertinent to note the following positive technical assistance
experience of the Project:
a)  In general, Project management was able to effectively utilize
the specialist consultants inspite of their different backgrounds,
personalities and attitudes; and
b) Some of the consultants manifested a keen, sincere and personal
interest in helping the farmers improve their lot by frequently
making trips to the field areas and directly relating with the
farmers.
6.34     Each specialist consultant had his own unique approach and working habit
in assisting the Project and it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of each
consultant's approach, in the context of the internal and external factors
which affected the Project. However, it might have been better for the Project
if all the specialist consultants had viewed their fundamental role as that of
the systematic transfer of knowledge and skills _o their respective counterpart



43
4 3 -
and Project personnel, considered the needs of functional areas other than
their own field of expertise, committed much of their time in training their
respective counterpart and Project personnel at the provincial and field levels,
and improved their personal relationships with all levels of Project staff and
their fellow consultants.
6.35     Undoubtedly, despite some consultants'shortcomings, the specialist
consultants have contributed, in varying degrees, in supporting and backstopping
the project, especially during times of management crises.

Review comments by RSI on the draft final reports necessitated significant revisions
which caused a delay in the completion of the final reports:
Processing and Marketing
6.37     Faced with a dearth of proven processing and marketing systems for rubber
smallholders, and lack of a recommended scheme in the SAR (for both SRDP I and II),
the Proidct has been formulating and evolving exploratory marketing schemes in
its three project areas. Results to date have been very encouraging in terms
of improving the quality of farmer rubber produced, raising farmgate prices,
and generating smallholder enthusiasm in adopting new procedures. While certain
aspects of the processing and marketing systems being tried out still require
further improvement, the trend encouraged under the Project will no doubt ensure
both significant increase infarmer incomes and farmers' capacity to repay their
loans.



-44--                                        44
6.38 Role of Project. Realizing the imperative need to improve the traditional
on-farm processing and marketing systems if smallholders are to receive a fair
price for their rubber produce, the Project management has assumed the role of
advising the project participants and acting as intermediary in arranging
direct discussions between the farmer associations and the prospective private
buyers. With this basic role, management directed its efforts during the project
period toward the following objectives, which are consistent with broad GOI
policies:
(1)      to improve the quality of farmers' rubber produce through appropriate
on-farm processing methods;
(2)      to raise the rubber farmgate price by shortening the marketing chain
where possible, by applying acceptable methods of DRC determination,
and by computing fair prices based on formulae mutually agreed between
the farmers and buyers; and
(3)      to cooperate with private rubber processors to enable them to utilize
more fully existing processing capacities.
6.39     Acting in its advisory and intermediary capacity, Project staff have
been instrumental in:
(1)      the formation of farmer associations in project areas where rubber
trees have matured, and farmers have started tapping, and
(2)      the formulation of tentative marketing arrangements between the farmer
associations and the provincial units of the Indonesian Rubber Processors
Association (GAPKINDO) and its member factories.
6.40 On-Farm Processing. In Prabumulih, South Sumatra, project participants
have been producing, since January 1984, clean thin slabs according to specifi-
catious (as to measurements, purity, application of coagulants, and drying
process) agreed with member factories of GAPKINDO. A total of 562 tons, with
DR-s ranging from 59% - 64% have been sold up to the end of March 1986 (Annex 2,
Table 2b). Farmer adherence to the production of clean thin slabs was



- 45 -
45
reconsidered, and a gradual shift to air-dried sheets with higher DRC has
been initiated.
6.41     In Anjungan, West Kalimantan, farmers have been producing, since
February 1985, air-dried sheets of high quality, with DRCs reaching 94% - 97%.
A total of 16 tons have been sold direct to factories (Annex 2, Table 2c).
6.42     In Taluk Kuantan, Riau, where production started only in March 1986,
farme,.s have produced lower quality air-dried sheets (5 tons, with 73% - 80%
DRC). (Annex 2, Table 2a)   The on-farm processing remains to be improved,
and alternative buyers have to sought in view of the unreceptive attitude of
factory buyers in Pakanbaru. Prospective buyers from Padang are being approached.
6.43     Incentives to adhere to quality standards are higher prise and pressure
by other members of association, since the lower quality of any member's
produce tends to reduce the overall DRC of the group.
6.44 Marketing Scheme and Prices. Realizing the inherent advantages of group
marketing project participants, with the guidance of PMUs, have organized
themselves into farmer associations. The associations have elected to sell
directly to factories in order to shorten the marketing channel -- thus retaining
for themselves the margins which would otherwise be received by traders.
6.45     In Prabumulih, farmer association representatives witness visual
test-checking of purity and weighing at factory sites. The DRC is determined
by milling a sample batch and computing the percentage based on factory conversion
standard/experience. Unit selling price is computed at the previously agreed 85%
of local FOB price of SIR 20, taking DRC into consideration. A check payment
for the total sales proceeds is received on the same day by a properly
authorized representative of the association. To safeguard against possible
loss in transit from Palembang to the villages, sales proceeds are remitted
through BRI branches to the BRI village units concerned. Farmers receive their
individual sales proceeds directly from BRI village units, based on lists
provided by the association. A specified agreed amount is credited to farmers'
special TABANAS accounts earmarked for loan repayment after conversion.



-46 -                                      46
6.46     In Anjungan, sales are conducted by open auction at Pontianak, with
the floor selling price set at the posted price of SIR 20 plus 3% premium
for quality. Winning bids, so far, are always higher than the floor price,
probably due to the good quality of the air-dried sheets which buyers deem
may be classified as SIR 10.
6.47     Farmer Associations. Upon maturity of rubber trees and start of tapping
in a particular area, farmer participants are organized into associations at
the village level; these in turn become members of farmer associations at the PMU
level. Each association is managed by officers, chosen from the members,
consisting of chairman, vice chairman, assistants, treasurer, and secretary.
An advisory board (composed of two village leaders, a farmer member, and a PMU
representative) provides advice and direction to the association, while an
inspection team (composed of two farmer members and a PMU representative) reviews
activities and examines records. SRDP has recommended that farmer associations
draw up binding basic documents (articles of association and by-laws or
equivalent) governing, among others, the rights and responsibilities of members
authority and responsibilities of officers, and association policies and
administrative procedures.
6.48     At present, activities of farmer associations include:  (1) on-farm
processing of rubber in accordance with specifications agreed with buying
factories; (2) the collection of members' rubber produce; (3) arranging for
rubber transport to the factory site; (4) observation of weighing and DRC
determine at factory sites; (5) receiving sales proceeds, remitting through
BRI branches and village units, and distribucion of sales proceeds to the individual
members; (6) in a few cases in Prabumulih, provision of coagulants and food-
stuff to members by bulk purchasing; and (7) recording and reporting of members'
production and sales, transportation and administrative costs, and members'
equity and special savings accounts. Financial and administrative systems of
farmer associations have been designed with the assistance of SRDP.



- 47 -
47
6.49     The farmer associations, so far, have been able to protect the interests
of uembers and to generate the expected strength through members' unity in
group marketing. Although the structure and management of farmer associations
are patterncd after those of cooperatives, the associations still operate
outside the Basic Law on Cooperatives. It is the hope of SRDP and DGE that
farmer associations would eventually mature to be tranformed into rubber
cooueratives when their activities have sufficiently expanded and their officers
become proficient in managing association affairs.
Credit System
6.50     Financial assistance for direct field development costs to smallho'lders
participating in the Project was provided on credit basis. A Financing Agreement
between Bank Indonesia (representing GOI) and BRI covered the portion of the
IDA funds pertaining to credit components, while a Sub Financing Agreament (SFA)
between BRI (as executing bank) and DGE covered the relending of the Lotal
credit component (including the credit funds contributed by BI and BRI) to
DGE for provision of credit assistance to participating smallholders. Upon
acceptance by the Project, smallholders entered into credit agreements with
SRDP/DGE, and field development costs were charged by the Project to individual
farmer's accounts.
6.51     Credit funds released by BRI to SRDP/DGE were charged to thet loan
account of DGE in the books of BRI. Upon fulfilling technical and other criteria
specified in the SFA, the individual smallholders' credit accounts are to be
converted during the fourth to the seventh year after field establishment, and
smallholders sign credit agreements with BRI. Conversion is a mechanism for
transferring, in the books of BRI, the released credit funds from the DGE loan
account to the loan accounts of individual smallholders, who become direct
clients of BRI. Upon conversion, the agreed sharing of the credit risk among
BRI, BI, and MOF/GOI becomes effective; prior to conversion, the credit risk
is borne fully by MOF/GOI. Finally, the farmer credit accounts which can not
be converted by the seventh year after field establishment will, in essence,
be written off, with the risk fully assumed by MOF/GOI.

b.52    while it is recogni:ed that farmer credit account conversion is a
necessary mechanism in smallholder credit schemes, the impositions of strict
conversion criteria needs careful review and rationalization Non-conversion
or outright write-off of farmer accounts, while reducing the risk of BRI and
BI, increases the financial burden (in the form of unrecovered development
costs) of the Government as a whole. Considering that the tree density is
a major conversion criterion (400 trees per hectare for SRDP planting and
320 trees per hectare for previous AR? planting tbken over by SRDP) and is
a major determinant of the income generating potential of rubber fields, there
is case for lowering the tree density threshold for conversion purposes, in
order to minimize the negative financial impact of non-conversion of farmer
accounts, while ensuring at the same time the farmers capacity to repay their
loans.   Further quantitative analysis has to be undertaken to determine the
desirable cut-off point and to serve as basis for discussions with the GOI
agencies concerned. The data per March 31, 1986 presented in the following
table, towever, is indicative of the magnitudes involved (Annex 1, Table 4),
although these figures will change by the time of conversion when the total
credit will be higher due to further credit assistance for maintenance of
immature trees, and total hectarage might be lower due to rubber tree
mortality before conversion.

6. 53    As an executing bank, the functions of BRI include:  (1)  providing
the BI/BRI share of field development funds, (2) paying family labor incen-
tives to participating farmers, at the request of PHUs,  (3)  converting
the accounts if farmers in the fourth to the seventh year of field development,
and (4) collecting Lnterest and principal installments during the repayment
period. The releases of BI/BRI funds to the prcject have generally been much
delayed   (Annex 3, Table 6).  Family labor incentive payments have been
satisfactorily done by BRI village Units, although SRDP PMUs often had to
provide the transport facilities. There have been no conversion and nc write-
off of farmers' accounts to date. However, meetings held with BRI Head Office
in September 1986 initiated the conversion process, which is now well underway
in the three PMU locations. Since there has been no account conversion. (which
is a precondition for farmer credit repayment), the credit recovery function
of BRI has not yet commenced.
6,5k    Lt has to be emphasized, however, that in spite of conversion delays,
SRDP farmers who have been tapping their rubber fields are setting aside a
portion of their income for expected loan repayments after conversion has taken
place (Annex 2 , Table 2). This is an exemplary manifestation of good faith on
the part of participating farmers.
Cost   uery
6.55    Credit assistance has been provided to farmers on the basis of a
20-year credit period, with an interest-free grace of seven ears, and with
interest of 6% per annum  (agreed credit terms at the time of project ap?raisal),
with che land title serving  as collateral.   With the issuance of Finance
Minister letter No. S-985/MK.011/1985 on September 6, 1985 concerning the
transfer of SRDP I farmer accounts to SRDP II, farmer credit terms were unila-
terally changed effective April 1, 1986 to:
o 20-year credit period with a seven-year grace on princiapl;
o interest of 12% per annum;
o interest-free period of three years, with interest from Years 4
to 7 accrued and capitalized by the end of Year 7.



-51 -                                       51
This change of credit terms applies to both the credit assistance provided
under SRDP I and the credit assistance to be provided under SRDP II until
maturity of rubber trees. Further, this change of credit terms to farmers
addressed the concern of the IDA Team at the time of credit negotiation that
the low interest rate (free for seven years and 6% p.a. thereafter) could
adversely affect the credit market and that subsidizing interest could cause
budgetary difficulties for GOl.
6.56    Fertilizer subsidies during the period of ProjLct implementation were
expanded to include muriate of potash (HOP) commencing in 1983/84, in addition
to urea and triple superphosphate  (TSP) -   an action which increased the
financial burden on COI.
6.57    The imposition of "he export tax on rubber, as a mechanism for in-
creasing cost recovery, has been held in abeyance in view of the GOI concnern
that the tax might adeversely affect rubber exports which are now suffering
from depressed international prices, and that the tax raises the question
of inequity (recovery from non-beneficiaries).
6.58    With interest of 6% per annum (with a seven-year interest-free grace
period) charged to farmers and Rp 1,200 land tax per hectare per year paid by
farmers, cost recoiery (Annex 7, Table 1) was estimated to be 87% measured in
constant 1986 prices, or 32% in present value terms at 10% opportunity cost of
capital. With interest raised to 12% per annum (free for the first three years
and accrued and capitalized for four years), the cLst recovery would increase to
173Z (in constant 1986 prices) or 63% (in present value terms). Further, if
rubber export tax of 5% of FOB price were to be imposed, cost recovery would
increase by 76% (in constant 1986 prices) or 21% (in present value terms).
The comparison of PCR cost recovery with appraisal estimate is shown on the
following page.

6.59    SRDP has been using the GOI prescribed budgeting control system
which generally meets the operational requirements of the Project. Funds
handling and control procedures have been well established at all office levels
(Jakarta Headquarters, Provincial Offices and PHUs).
6.60    The Project has been using the GOI single-entry accounting system , with
separate sets of detailed subsidiary books maintained for each budget year.
To satisfy the additional accounting and reporting needs of the Project,
supplementary systems and records were installed for materials stock control,
for nursery cost accounting, and for drawing of funds from the IDA credit.
The accounting records, in totality, are adequate in meeting project financial
control requirements. The GOI sing'---entry accounting system, however, is now



53
-53-
being revised by GOI agencies concerned. The Project will continue using the
present system until such time that the new system is officially issued by
GOI.
6.61    Due to the large volume of accounts (about 36,000 at present) and
transactions, the manual posting of charges to Farmers' Cards has been subjec-
to delay.  Special task forces had to be forewd to update the accounts as of
project closing date. With the further increase in volume of accounts and
transactions under SRDP tI, alternative systems, probably computerized, will
have to be explored.
Bank Performance
6.62    The Bank   Supervision Missions' regular visits to the Project
undoubtedly catalyzed the Project to greater efforts by providing much needed
objective guidance, recommendations and assistance.   The expectation of the
Bank Supervision Mission visits maintained the alertness of management and
provided the needed incentive for Project management to gradually improve
Project performance after each Bank visit.
6.63    The impact of Bank Supervision could have been greater had there been
less frequent changes in mission personnel. Furthermore, it would have been
better, during the early stage of Proiect implementation, if the Bank had
warned its personnel to cons-der cultural sensitivities in the Asian region and
to use tact in dealings with Project management and resident consultants.
6.64    Finally, it is also worthy of note that the Project was ably assisted
further by the RSI staff on many occasions, and that the Project benefited much
from the RSI's accommodating and genuine interest for the success of the Project.

7.  SPECIAL ISSUES
Substitution and Diversion
7.01     Considering that project participants are low income farmers lacking
financial resources and unable to obtain credit, there was no substitution
of funds for farm development.
7.02     Conversely; there h'ias  een no evidence of diversion of funds, since
assistance to farmers (with the exception of family labor cash payments) was
provided in the form of farm inputs and equipment, the utilization of wnich
had been closely monitored by project extension staff.
Weather and Other Risks
7.03     During the period of the Project, the weather was unsettled due to
the wurid wide influences of the El 'Nino ocean current. During 1982/83 and
1li3/34 when drought prevailed for many months in Prabumulih, appreciable
areas of rubber were burned.
7.J4     Tree crop development projects like SIDP I are inherently susceptible
to economic risks in view of the long development period and decades of
productive life of developed fields, and in the particular case of natural
rubber, international prices are influenced not only by the world supply and
demand situation, but also by the volatile market for oil, the basic raw
material for synthetic rubber.
Research and Technical Aspects
7.35     Conditions in the field revealed that soil conditions and rainfall
vary from one location to another;differences which were not considered in the
SAR. Even within the area of coverage of one PMU, conditions vary among sub-
units. Therefore, the services of Sembawa Research Station were utilization to
determine the appropriate dosages of fertilizers for Gelumbang (Subunit II in
Prabumulih) where growth was slower than in other areas. Soil



55
- 55 -
types in this subunit are red podsolic, gray hydromorphic, and sandy alluvial.
The research station findings concerning the SAR recommended dosages were:
kieserite dosage was too high, and urea and RP dosages were too low (almost
one-and-a-half times the SAR dosages vere recommended by the research station,
especially in the third to the fifth year). The research station recommended
the following dosages, wbich unfortunately could not be implemented due to
insufficiency of available fertilizers.

7.06     Studies on suitable clone and fertilizer dosages in West Kalimantan,
where rainfall is higher compared with other areas, will be undertaken under
SRDP II.
Replicability
7.07     At the outset, the SRDP I FHU scheme was confronted with numerous and
formidable problems, especially in connection with the smallholders,inter-
agency and public relations, as well as operational inefficiencies. There were
many times when a crisis in aanagement occurred, but nevertheless it may be
said that the SRDP PHU activities aemrged intact and by and large manageable.
7.08     From the institutional viewpoint, the SRDP PMU scheme can be replicated
provided that no PHU exceed: 10,000 hectares (5,000 farmers).   From the
financial viewpoint, the SRDP PMW can be replicated,the prevailing argument being
that the capital outlay per family in the PMU is about half of that in the
NES projects.



56
-56 -
7.09     Howeva., it must be pointed out, that the PMU system of develop-
ment has limited reach and replicability, and therefore, can not be the
vehicle for developing the overall potential of the smallholder area. The
SRDP PMU scheme, although effective and less costly than the NES projects,
would demand heavy manpower and substantial cost if replicated on a large
national scale.
Credit Conversion and Cost Recovery
7.10     In spite of the generally good quality of field planting under SRDP I,
conversion of smallholders' credit accounts has not progressed at the rate expected.
The conversion activities have been hampered by delays in issuance of land
titles and by the apparently passive stance of the executing bank in the past,
although conversion is now in progress in all three project locatiors.
7.11     Regulation No. 3 of 1985, issued on 19 September 1985 by the Minister
of Internal Affairs, addresses the land titling delays in agricultural develop-
ment projects. Work on new land titling contracts with the Directorate
General of Agraria is expected to proceed much faster then before, as processing
under the improved procedures gains momentum.  However, land titling not
completed under SRDP I will have to be carried over to and funded by SRDP II
(Para. 3.29).
7.12     The field conversion criteria have to be re-evaluated and discussed
with GOI agencies concerned with a view to minimizing the negative financial
impact of writing off loan accounts of farmers whose fields do not meet minimum
tree density requirements (400 trees per hectare for SRDP planting and 320 trees
per hectare for PRPTE plancing). While non-conversion of farmers' loan
accounts reduces the risk exposure of the executing bank, it increases the
Government's overall financial burden in terms of higher unrecovered development
costs -- a matterof primary concern in the light of GOI resource limitations.
7.13     Finally, the possibility of non-conversion offers an incentive to
farmers to intentionally neglect their fields and therefore fail to meet con-
version criteria -- thus not obliged to repay their loans. While it may be
argued that this is taking the case to the extreme and that extension services,
if properly carried out, should prevent such events from occurring, the fact
is that the loophole remains wide open for abuse. It is indeed fortunate that



-57 -                                          57
this loophole, so far, has not been exploited by SRDP farmers. This, therefore,
gravelv questions the concept of conversion when tied up with strict criteria
imposed by an executing bank. An alternative would be to change the role of
the executing bank to a channelling one, thereby relieving the bank of exposure
to credit risk and leaving conversion criteria as the sole concern of the
project implementing agency. The ramifications of this approach, however, will
have to be further examined in depth.
Continuity of Field Extension
7.14     Inasmuch as the functional responsibility of DGE for providing field
extension services to project participants extends well beyond project com-
pletion (that is, completion of all field planting and maintenance up to rubber
maturity and termination of credit assistance to participants) in a location,
the specific DGE organizational unit which will provide continued extension
services over the long term should be planned in advance. The range of
possibilities, which should be discussed further by GOI agencies concerned,
follows:
(1)      SRDP would assume the long-term extension function and would corres-
pondingly restructure and reduce the size of PMUs concerned. This
approach is in line with the DGE thinking under consideration to place
all smallholder rubber development under the responsibility of one
organization, which might be transformed into a permanent institution
with possibly more autonomy.
(2)      The Provincial Estate Services (Dinas Perkebunan Daerah or DISBUN) would
assume the responsibility for providing extension after project com-
pletion. This alternative is consistent with the present function, in
addition to supervising fully GOI funded projects, of DISBUN with regards
to smallholders not participating in development projects. The extension
capabilities of DISBUN, however, would have to be strengthened through
manpower development.



58
-58 -
(3)      A third alternative would be a variation of the second, whereby
DISBUN would be relieved of its supervisory function over GOI
funded development projects, and would concentrate on providing
extension services. This approach would have the advantage of
focusing DISBUN manpower resources to the extension function.
Processing and Marketing systems
7.15     The on-farm processing and marketing systems which have been initiated
by SRDP are making good progress. However, some aspects of the schemes being
tried out in certain project locations remain to be improved further in order
to ensure that:
(1)      smallholders' interests are properly protected and that they receive
a fair return for their investments and efforts, and
(2)      smallholders' incomes from rubber are maximized to enable them to
service their loans and at the same time enjoy additional disposable
income to uplift their standard of living.
7.16     After the processing and marketing systems have attained a sufficiently
high degree of efficiency and acceptance by the parties concerned, formal
adoption of the systems for the SRDP series should be considered by appropriate
Government authorities.

8. CHANGES IN THE REPEATER PROJECT
8.01     Upon completion of SRDP I, all rubber fields developed under the
Project, as well as all physical facilities and personnel, were absorbed by
SRDP II. Further credit assistance to bzing SRDP I plantings to maturity
will be provided under SRDP II.
8.02     The rubber tree stand per hectare under SRDP II was increased from
500 to 555 bare-rooted budded stumps so that an increase in initial planting
could alleviate the problem of supplying.
8.03     The seed for transplanting in the rootstock nursery was increased
under SRDP II from 80,000 to 120,000 per nursery hectare to assure the Project
of sufficient planting material.
8.04     Costs of fencing were provided in SRDP II in order to control field
damage due to mammalian pests.
8.05     As previously discussed (Para. 6.53), interest charged to farmers
was raised from 6% to 12% per annum, with a reduc,tion of the interest-free
period from seven to three years, and the accrual and capitalization of
interest for four years. This change was incorporated in SRUP II in order to
align the interest with prevailing rates and to increase cost recovery from
direct beneficiaries of the Project.
8.06     The small provincial units of SRDP I, headed by the Provincial Unit
Managers, will increase their role in proportion to the number of PMUs each
Provincial Unit Manager could absorb and directly supervise in the succeeding
Project. In SRDP II, the Provincial Unit Managers will be taking much of the
functions exercised by Project Management in Jakarta, especially in the support
functions of finance and administration. In effect SRDP II management in
Jakarta would be responsibie for the overall long-term planning and control,
the provincial unit management that of short-term planning and control of PMUs,
and the PMUs that of implementation.
8.07     Under SRDP II, the partial approach will be carried  out for about
19,500 hecrares.

9.   CONCLUSIONS
9.01     In retrospect, the Project was justified at the time of Project
formulation. The identification of rubber as a priority commdity of the
tree crop subsector was strengthened further by the increasingly heavier
reliance of GOI on the tree crop subsector to raise much needed foreign
exchange earnings to partially offset the drastic fall of foreign exchange
revenue from oil. Hovever, the magnitude of the Project is such that greater
attention should have been paid during formulation to in-depth and extensive
study of farmer locations and available participants, as well a pre-project
orientation and training of the Project's lean and inexperienced staff.
9.02     The Project size was appropriate but the scheduling of planting in
the PMUs was optimistic and difficult to achieve because of insufficiency
of resources (manpower, funds and agro-inputs). The 94Z planting program
achievement was remarkable, but the problem of field maintenance persisted
due to resource constraints during the implementation period.
9.03     The implementation capacity of the Project was adequate, but it could
have been stronger had the necessary technical assistance been in place at
the time of Project inception. The early recognition of strengthening the
Project's training function and the subsequent incorporation of a training
structural framework with the Project organization setup greatly contributed to
the reduction of the implementation burden of the Project.
9.04     Delays experienced in civil works and procurement do not, by themselves,
indicate unrealistic scheduling, but were inherent in the environment in which
the Project was operating. The efforts of some GOI authorities to minimize
budget approvals (which might be justified in the light of funding constraints)
and to defer fund releases, and the related GOI policy of allowing i;uplementation
of a fiscal year's budget over a four-year period (with three years SLAP in
effect during project implementation) created delays which were either beyond



61
- 61 -
the control of project management or condoned by other agencies.
9.05     One pervasive aspect of the Project was the obvious imbalance
between actual availability of resources, on one hand, and the ambitious
objectives, on the other. If this adverse factor could be removed
future projects would be more effective as a means for development.
9.06     Finally, Project implementation constraints and consequent backsliding
of Project activities was greatly arrested by strong and dynamic Project
leadership, high staff morale and very effective utilization of resident
consultants.
