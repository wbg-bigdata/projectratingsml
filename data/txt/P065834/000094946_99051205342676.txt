TECHNICAL ANNEX FOR A
PROPOSED EMERGENCY RECOVERY CREDIT
TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
A. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE KOSOVO CONFLICT
1. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo' is inflicting a severe strain on internal stability
and economic management in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR
Macedonia).  Trade with and through the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR
Yugoslavia) has been cut off. Moreover, the country has been forced to absorb a large
and ongoing movement of refugees from neighboring Kosovo into northern FYR
Macedonia. In addition to the extreme challenge created for humanitarian efforts, these
recent events have severely undercut economic activity in FYR Macedonia and begun to
threaten the country's macroeconomic stability.
2.    The UNHCR estimates that nearly 600,000 people have fled Kosovo since March
1998, of which 155,000 registered refugees remain in FYR Macedonia as of April 28,
1999 (with an additional 24,000 evacuated to third countries). This is about 7 percent of
FYR Macedonia's population. About 60,000 of these refugees are in camps in FYR
Macedonia, but the rest have been taken in by families. In particular, the pressures of fast
accelerating refugee arrivals since the last week of March have sorely tested the
Government's, NGOs', and official organization's logistical capabilities. Refugees
equivalent to 6 percent of the population have now arrived in FYR Macedonia with
uncertain near-term prospects for return, raising the specter of domestic political unrest
and threatening to unravel the substantial progress made towards the establishment of a
multi-cultural democratic state.
3.    The de facto cessation of all economic relations with and through FR Yugoslavia
has dealt a severe blow to an already ailing economy (see Table 1). Registered
unemployment was already at around one-third of the workforce last year, with a
majority long-term unemployed. Trade with FR Yugoslavia has been deteriorating for
more than a year, because of trade barriers erected by FR Yugoslavia and the fighting in
Kosovo (a major market for Macedonian agricultural produce). First quarter exports
were only half the level of a year earlier. Yet FYR Macedonia has been only partially
successful at diversification of markets, suppliers, and transit routes, a task made difficult
by the trade embargoes imposed in recent years; FYR Macedonia's landlocked and
relatively isolated geographical position, with limited transport links except through FR
Yugoslavia; and little foreign direct investment which might have fostered new trading
relationships. Thus, its economy has remained vulnerable to any sudden shift in relations
with FR Yugoslavia. To some extent, limited diversification of trade and a low level of
foreign investment have been a by-product of the slow pace of structural reform.
Kosovo is a region within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which comprises the republics of
Serbia and Montenegro. FR Yugoslavia if not a member of the World Bank or the IMF.



2
Nevertheless, even if the reform program had been on-track, the ongoing conflict in
Kosovo would have dealt the economy a severe blow.
4.    The Government, in its initial assessment of economic damages, has not been able
to quantify the likelihood of enterprises' finding alternative suppliers and markets. The
Government has only just begun to assess the losses to the economy as a result of trade
disruption and has yet to consider carefully how recovery may occur. Because the crisis
is still underway and its resolution uncertain, it is premature to present any but
preliminary estimates. In collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union, the World Bank is working closely with Government to further refine
these estimates to understand more fully the social and economic impact of the crisis.
According to the Government, there have been several concrete illustrations of how the
crisis will cause damages. For example, about $50 million worth of unpaid industrial
goods intended for export are currently in transit in FR Yugoslavia. About $20 million of
early fruits and vegetable, intended for shipment to FR Yugoslavia for processing, had to
be dumped on the domestic market; and tobacco and cigarette sales to FR Yugoslavia,
expected at around $45 million this year, will have to be redirected but the glut of these
products on world markets likely limits profitable sale elsewhere. At the same time,
many next-door suppliers of specialized inputs for FYR Macedonia's industrial sector,
often willing to engage in barter arrangements, will be difficult and expensive to replace.
5.    Moreover, many trading relations with the rest of the world have deteriorated as
quickly as relations with FR Yugoslavia: the textile sector, newly expanded through
consignment contracts with European companies, has seen most of its contracts cancelled
because of concern over timely delivery, and both banks and enterprises have seen credit
lines with European banks rescinded, making export financing difficult. Substitution of
alternative markets and transit routes will be difficult and will take time. Based on
surveys of firms in various economic sectors, the Government has concluded that
transport costs for traded goods are likely to rise by 20-30 percent on average this year.
For some traditional exports, alternative transport is difficult to envision, e.g., steel
usually sent by train to Europe, or perishable fruits and vegetables trucked to neighboring
FR Yugoslavia for processing. The replacement of damaged infrastructure along the
traditional transport route to Europe through FR Yugoslavia will likely take years; and
the alternative routes all suffer from poor infrastructure, limited capacity, and greatly
increased utilization.
B. IDA'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
IDA/IBRD's Overall Response
6.   IDA/IBRD's response to the Kosovo crisis' impact on FYR Macedonia is closely
coordinated with the IMF. Together, the two institutions are coordinating the financial
response of the international community to the Kosovo crisis. On April 2, 1999, the
World Bank sponsored an emergency Informal Donors' Meeting on the Kosovo crisis;
international financial institutions and bilateral participants, including representatives



3
from the affected countries, ex-changed views about the immediate impact of the crisis on
the countries in the region and shared information about ongoing and planned donor
support programs. A follow-up coordination meeting for the relevant international
financial institutions was held in London on April 18. IMF and Bank staff produced a
joint paper containing a preliminary assessment of the external financing needs arising
from the Kosovo crisis  This paper was discussed at the IMF and World Bank boards,
which endorsed the broad approach outlined in the paper. The paper was subsequently
discussed in the meeting on the Kosovo crisis on April 27, 1999 during the Spring
meetings.
7.   Given FYR Macedonia's turbulent neighborhood, the CAS approved in July 1998
anticipated the possibility of an emergency scenario arising from growing tensions in
Kosovo (para. 41). This scenario predicted that despite the Government's best efforts, the
environment for efficient long-term investment would likely be undermined, while short
term import requirements would rise. While the Bank would expect and press for other
donors to increase their assistance under these circumstances, the Bank would seek an
exceptional IDA allocation to provide support for critical imports and a reorientation of
social programs to meet emergency needs. The CAS-specified triggers for moving into
this emergency scenario are now overwhelmingly met: the inflow of refugees may soon
approach ten times the level considered burdensome in the CAS; large-scale military
mobilization with impacts on the budget and climate for foreign investment is underway;
and FYR Macedonia's export channels through FR Yugoslavia are seriously impeded.
With the IMF also responding to the needs of the Government for timely economic aid,
bilateral donors and other multilateral agencies already pledging humanitarian and
economic aid, and an emergency consultative group meeting planned for May 5, 1999,
the international community as a whole is already stepping forward to assist FYR
Macedonia. This operation is, therefore one component of this international response.
8.   In line with the approach outlined in the joint World Bank/IMF paper, IDA is
following a multi-pronged strategy to help FYR Macedonia to cope with this crisis. It
consists of:
(a)   Immediate assistance through financing of critical imports provided under
the proposed Emergency Recovery Credit. An emergency recovery
operation is considered appropriate in the case of FYR Macedonia,
because of the exceptionally large impact of the crisis on the balance-of-
payments, especially the current account.
(b)   Ongoing balance of payments and budget assistance by continuing
preparation of the FESAL with suitable redesign and adjustments as
needed in the changed situation. A Labor Redeployment and Social Fund
is currently under preparation to help mitigate the social costs arising from
the Kosovo conflict and to help with the costs associated with the
2  The Economic Consequences of the Kosovo Crisis: A Preliminary Assessment of External Financing
Needs and the Role of the Fund and the World Bank in the International Response. Prepared jointly
by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, April 15, 1999.

structural reform program to be supported by the FESAL (proposed Board
date: January 2000).
(c)   Reallocation of uncommitted funds of selected ongoing IDA operations to
redirect project activities to areas and infrastructure needs most affected
by the economic crisis and the refugees. IDA staff are working with
counterpart Government agencies and other development partners to
consider how existing IDA operations might provide for the urgent social
and infrastructure needs arising from the current crisis. The IDA team has
proposed to the Ministry of Health that some proceeds be reallocated
within the ongoing Health Sector Transition Project for the quick
procurement of selected pharmaceuticals and medical consumables from
UNICEF. Moreover, the team is also considering an infusion of
additional IDA resources to the Social Reform and Technical Assistance
project in order to assist newly laid off workers re-enter the labor force.
(d)   Special support to refugees provided from the post-conflict fund. A
proposal for funding from the Bank's Post Conflict Fund for a US$1
million grant in support of the refugees was approved on April 27 by the
Post Conflict Fund Board. This grant would be implemented under an
umbrella arrangement with UNICEF, and it would focus on supporting
institutions which provide essential services to the refugees, especially
children. Participation in direct assistance to refugees is essential in order
to provide the link between humanitarian and development assistance,
which can effectively be performed by IDA (in coordination with other
bilateral and international donors), through ongoing investment
operations.
(e)   Policy advice on recovery and a return to growth and reform. IDA/IBRD
stands ready to assist with policy advice and adjustment and investment
operations to support the Government's plan to accelerate delayed
structural reforms.
Project Objectives
9.    The proposed Emergency Recovery Project, following OP/BP 8.50 on Emergency
Recovery Assistance, would assist the Government in maintaining macroeconomic
stability while helping to make up for export receipt shortfalls and reduced access to
foreign borrowing and direct investment, allowing imports critical to a resumption of
growth. The Credit is designed to help maintain macroeconomic stability despite serious
external shocks, depressed growth, rising balance of payments pressures, and exceptional
demands on public expenditures during a time of reduced possibilities for revenue
collection.
10. While this type of operation does not include conditionality linked to
macroeconomic policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of economic developments and close
collaboration with the IMF will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence
on the part of the Government. The proposed IMF standby arrangement would also



5
support Government efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability during this difficult
period. The IDA Credit, of $50 million equivalent and 100 percent quick disbursing,
based on the Government's request and an assessment of financing requirements for the
balance of payments for 1999, will provide immediate support to finance a positive list of
imports needed to cope with the emergency while supporting macroeconomic objectives.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
11.   The Emergency Recovery Project will provide immediate, quick- disbursing
support to finance a positive list of imports needed for the recovery effort while
supporting macroeconomic objectives (see Schedule A). While the proposed credit
would be entirely quick- disbursing, it is only the first part of a recovery strategy for FYR
Macedonia which is under discussion now by the Bank Group and the Government to
respond to the effects of the Kosovo crisis. The project will provide assistance for a
broad range of imports by the private sector, especially irnported production inputs and
imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury
goods, military equipment, or nuclear reactors.
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Organization and Management
12.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance with close
collaboration with the National Bank. The Ministry of Finance will open a US dollar
Special Account in the National Bank for the Credit, which would finance 100 percent of
the foreign exchange costs of private sector imports on the positive list agreed with the
Government. This list is based on major items imported by the private sector in the last
two years.
Implementation Arrangements
13.   Consistent with the emergency nature of this recovery assistance, implementation
arrangements have been simplified. To ensure due diligence and sound governance, the
arrangements would seek to ensure:
(a) that the Credit proceeds are used only to finance imports of items contained
in the list of imports permissible under the Credit (Attachment 1);
(b) proper procedures on procurement and accounting and the complete
documentation of transactions; and
(c) provision of management information using suitable monitoring and audit
tools.



6
14.   The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will sign an Implementation
Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, defining the assistance to be provided by each entity.
The Ministry of Finance will:
(a) authorize the National Bank to administer and execute the Project;
(b) approve quarterly financial management and progress reports;
(c) undertake necessary actions to ensure the State Auditing Bureau carry out the
project audit on quarterly basis; and
(d) appoint independent private auditors to carry out the final audit at completion
of the project.
The National Bank will:
(e) manage and operate the Special Account, including preparing withdrawal
applications;
(f) manage project accounts using appropriate financial management systems
and provide accountable and timely financial information on project
financing and expenditures;
(g) prepare and submit quarterly financial management reports and progress
reports to the Ministry of Finance for approval and submission to IDA;
(h) maintain documentation in connection with eligible imports and make
documentation available to independent auditors; and
(i) facilitate independent audit activities.
More detailed instructions on accounting, financial management, and auditing will be
provided by World Bank staff during project implementation.
Procurement
15.   The Credit proceeds would finance private sector imports against documentation
evidencing that the imported goods were on the positive list of imports listed in
Attachmnent 1. Credit proceeds would be limited to goods from eligible countries under
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999) and are also participating countries under current IDA Guidelines. No
more than 50 percent of the Credit would be used in the aggregate for the import of any
single item on the positive list of imports. To avoid high overhead transaction costs for
IDA, financing would be restricted to contracts $20,000 or above.
16.  I]n addition to the foregoing, the Credit would only finance imports procured by
the private sector in accordance with procedures presented in table below. Prior review
thresholds (which require procurement documentation to be submitted to the Bank ex



7
ante) will be set at the same level as the procurement thresholds (which determine the
method of procurement).
Table 1. Summary of Procurement Procedures for Items on the Positive List
Procurement Category                      Procurement Method
Through established commodity markets, or
Commodities, for private sector contracts  other channels of competitive procurement as

Guidelines.
Commodities, for private sector contracts

Goods for private sector contracts valued at or   Simplified ICB procedures under Clauses 2.63

Goods for private sector contracts valued at  Based on established commercial practices.
less than $3 million.
Note: Imports valued at less than $20,000 would not be eligible for financing
17.   There is no Country Procurement Assessment report currently available for the
country. However, the private sector is free to import almost any material into the
country, and goods imports last year exceeded $1.7 billion. Commercial practices of
private sector firms are based on open competition and are generally consistent with a
competitive market place. Typically, firms obtain multiple quotations from traditional
suppliers of the items and base their purchase decisions on the principle of best value for
money. Oil imports by the biggest importer in FYR Macedonia are based on the spot oil
price in the world market. Because of this judgment that private sector importing is
generally profit-oriented and therefore efficient, IDA/IBRD have determined that current
commercial practices would be acceptable without any additional stipulation; and the
thresholds for IDA/1BRD prior review are based on typical contracts of medium and
large companies, which were generally more than US$3 million while oil import
contracts were generally more than $5 million.
18.   The National Bank, which in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance is the
executing agency for the proposed Project, has prior experience in coordination of
disbursements against imports and is capable of ensuring compliance with the agreed
procurement arrangements.
Disbursement
19.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
delivered cost of imports by the private sector, excluding import duties and taxes, subject
to the agreed positive list. Disbursements in respect of expenditures under contracts for
goods for the private sector costing less than $3 million equivalent and for commonly
traded commodities would be made against Statements of Expenditures, for which



supportt g- documentation would be retamaed by the National Bank and made available
for rev>.-'v by IDA financial mnanagemernt and procurement specialists and project
auditots. The project would be implemented over a one-year period and is expected to be
completed by June 30, 2000. The Closing Date for this credit would be December 31,
2000.
20.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 7.4 million,
20 percent of the credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred up to
four months before loan signing, given the deterioration of economic relations with FR
Yugoslavia since the beginning of 1999, followed by collapse in mid-March.
21.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar
Special Account to be established in the National Bank of FYR Macedonia, with an
initial authorized allocation of $20 million (SDR 14.8 million equivalent), 50 percent of
the credit amount net of retroactive financing.  The Special Account would be
replenished as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of funds to cover eligible
imports.
Financial Management and Monitoring
22.   Project Accounting. The National Bank has in place adequate accounting and
financial management reporting systems. Separate project accounts to record all project
expenditures per agreed 'positive list' and financial reporting format will be maintained.
The chart of accounts will provide consistency in the classification of financial and
accounting transactions. Accounting and administrative internal controls for the project
are in place and will be strengthened by the quarterly audits to be carried out by the State
Auditing Bureau. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance have qualified staff
experienced in managing World Bank projects. (See Attachment 3).
23.   Accounting and Auditing Standards. The accounting and auditing standards in
FYR Macedonia are based on the Macedonian Law on Accountancy. The Law was
amended on July 10, 1998 (Official Gazette of RM No. 42/93, 48/93 & 6/95). Where
national standards are used, the Bank requires financial statements to disclose any
material departures from International Accounting Standards and the impact of such
departures on the financial statements. The national standards will be in compliance with
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISA),
effective January 1, 2000. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance use accrual
accounting basis.
24.   Financial Reporting. The Ministry of Finance will be required to submit to IDA
within 45 days after end of each calendar quarter:
(a) a project financial management report;
(b) a progress report; and
(c) an audit report, including audit of the Special Account and Statements of
Expenditure by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.



9
25.   Audit Arrangements. The Ministry of Finance will select independent auditors
acceptable to IDA before the commencement of project activities. Because of the urgent
nature of the project and the limited time to set up project-specific internal control
systems and procedures, it has been agreed to have quarterly audits carried out by the
State Auditing Bureau, a member of the International Organization of Supreme Auditing
Institution (INTOSAI). These audits are intended to assess compliance with the Project
legal requirements. It has also been agreed that an international audit firm acceptable to
IDA will carry out a full financial audit upon completion of the Project. The terms of
reference for the audit, to be submitted to IDA for approval, will indicate that the project
accounts be maintained on an accrual basis and will include the following tasks:
(a) assessment of adequacy and reliability of procedures used to prepare customs
certificates or similar certificates;
(b) examination of customs certificates on which the World Bank disbursements
have been made;
(c) assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to
monitor expenditures and other financial transactions; and
(d) verification that expenditures submitted to IDA, including those submitted in
the project financial management reports are eligible for IDA financing, and
identification of any ineligible expenditures.
Donor Coordination
26.   An emergency Consultative Group Meeting for the FYR Macedonia convened by
the World Bank and the EU will take place on May 5, 1999, in Paris. In preparation for
this meeting, the Bank and the IMF undertook an evaluation of the damage caused by the
Kosovo crisis in the region. The assessment for FYR Macedonia draws heavily on IDA's
preliminary work with the Government during appraisal of this Credit and preparation for
the upcoming Consultative Group meeting. Humanitarian assistance to the refugees has
been forthcoming, and the Government has received some funds from UNHCR and
should soon begin to receive EU funds for reimbursement of direct expenditures on
refugees.
E. ACTION PLAN
27.   During negotiations, the Government delegation and Association representatives
reached speedy agreement on the remaining details of finanLcial management, reports, and
auditing, of procurement thresholds, and disbursement procedures to be followed. A set
of performance monitoring indicators was agreed, selected to allow the Association to
track the impact of the project through the behavior of overall macroeconomic conditions
without being unduly burdensome to the Government.

Monitoring Indicators
The objective of the Emergency Recovery Project is to assist the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia to finance critical private secto:r imports while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The following preliminary indicators would be used to monitor
macroeconomic stability:
Gross reserves of the National Bank of FYR Macedonia not to fall below two months of
imports of goods (excluding those financed by official grants); and
The overall fiscal deficit of the Central Government expected not to exceed 5 percent of
GDP in 1999.
These indicators would be adjusted accordingly, as macroeconomic estimates and
projections are refined, as reflected in the subsequent Government economic program.

FYR Macedonia
Emergency Recovery Project
Financial Management Assessment
Objectives and Project Description
1.  Objective of Financial Management Assessment. The objective of the financial
management assessment was to determine whether the project has in place adequate
financial management systems, including acceptable financial management and
accounting controls as required by the Bank in OP/BP 10.02.
2.   Project Objectives and Project Description.    The proposed Emergency
Recovery Project will assist the Government of FYR Macedonia in maintaining
macroeconomic stability through financing critical imports needed to cope with the
Kosovo crisis.
Sources and Flow of Funds
3.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$50.0 million equivalent will finance 100 percent
of the delivered cost of general imports by the private sector, excluding import duties and
taxes, and subject to an agreed 'positive list'. The IDA Credit will be channeled through a
Special Account for the project to be opened in the National Bank of Macedonia (the
Central Bank). The National Bank, as a representative of the Ministry of Finance, will
operate the Special Account.  It will be responsible for submitting withdrawal
applications for advance payment and replenishments of the Special Account to cover the
IDA Credit share of eligible imports. Upon receipt of written transfer payments orders
from the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank will transfer the IDA funds to the
Ministry budget through the Bureau of Payments (ZPP). The Ministry of Finance will
provide the National Bank with names of authorized signatories with authority to sign
withdrawal applications.
4.   Statements of Expenditure (SOE).  Under the SOE withdrawal procedure, the
National Bank will forward to IDA an application for reimbursement of payments already
made and eligible for IDA financing. Relevant supporting documents including customs
certificates, and evidence of payment will be retained by the National Bank and made
available for inspection by IDA representatives and the external auditors.
5.   Retroactive financing. Payments made after the emergency occurred and within
four months prior to the expected date of loan signing are permissible for payments; to a
cumulative maximum of 20 percent of the credit artount.

6.  The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance in close collaboration
with the National Bank. Both the Ministry and the National Bank will sign an



13
'Implementation Agreement'. The parties' obligations under the Implementation
Agreement will be as follows:
(a) the Ministry of Finance will:
(i)  authorize the National Bank to administer and execute the Project;
(ii)  approve quarterly financial management reports and progress reports
on monitoring indicators prepared by the National Bank;
(iii) undertake the necessary actions to ensure that the State Auditing
Bureau carry out project audits on a quarterly basis; the audit report,
including certified project financial statements in agreed format,
accounts for the Special Account and vvithdrawals made on basis of
Statement of Expenditure, is submitted to IDA within 45 days after end
of each quarter; and
(iv) appoint independent private auditors satisfactory to IDA to carry out
the project final audit. The final audit will cover total, cumulative,
disbursement and expenditures for the Project, and report submitted to
IDA no later than three months after the completion of the Project.
(b) National Bank, Department of Foreign Relations
(i)  prepare disbursement requests including replenishment of the Special
Account;
(ii)  maintain records and accounts for the Special Account;
(iii) maintain documentation in connection with eligible imports and make
documentation available to independent auditors and IDA
representatives (the National Bank receives monthly reports and copies
of customs certificates from the five customs offices which are under
the Ministry of Finance);
(iv) prepare quarterly financial management reports (PMRs) and progress
reports of monitoring indicators, and submit to the Ministry of Finance
for submission to IDA; and
(v)  facilitate independent audit activities.
(c)  Ministry of Finance and National Bank of Macedonia
(i)  Ministry of Finance to approve quarterly financial management reports
and progress reports, prepared by the National Bank, and submit
audited reports, to IDA within 45 days after end of each quarter; and
(ii)  Ministry of Finance and National Bank jointly to prepare and submit to
IDA, the Implementation Completion Report for the Project after
completion of the Project.
Financial Management and Reporting
7.   The National Bank has in place adequate accounting and financial management
reporting systems for the Project. The chart of accountis provides consistency in the
classification of financial and accounting transactions. Accounting and administrative
internal controls are in place. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance have
qualified staff experienced in managing World Bank projects.



14
8.   Quarterly financial management reports, progress reports and audits of project
accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA, will be provided to the Ministry of Finance for submission to IDA
within 45 days after end of each calendar quarter. The quarterly reports contained in the
system and to be agreed during negotiations are as follows (formats in the Project File):
(a)  Project Financial Management Report (Project Financial Statements)
Sources and Uses of Funds (Report 1 -A)
Special Account Statement (Report 1-E)
(b)  Progress Report
Summary of Project Progress (Report 2)
The transitional reporting requirements do not include a procurement management report
because procurement will be done by the private sector based on imports from a 'positive
list' and any contracts above US$3.0 million for goods and US$5.0 million for
commodities will follow simplified procurement procedures.
Accounting and Auditing Standards
9.   Accounting and auditing standards in Macedonia are based on Macedonian Law on
Accountancy. The Law was amended on July 10, 1998 (Official Gazette of RM No.
42/93, 48/93 & 6/95). Where national standards are used, the Bank requires financial
statements to disclose any material departures from International Accounting Standards,
and the impact of such departures on the financial statements. The national standards
will be in compliance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International
Standards on Auditing (ISA), effective January 1, 2000. The National Bank and the
Ministry of Finance use accrual accounting basis.
Audit Arrangements
10. The Ministry of Finance will select independent auditors acceptable to IDA before
the commencement of project activities. Because of the urgent nature of the project and
the limited time to set up project-specific internal control systems and procedures, it has
been agreed to have quarterly audits carried out by the State Auditing Bureau, a member
of International Organization of Supreme Auditing Institution (INTOSAI). These audits
are intended to assess compliance with the Project's legal requirements. It has also been
agreed that an international audit firm acceptable to IDA will carry out a full financial
audit upon completion of the Project. The terms of reference (TOR) for the audit, to be
submitted to IDA for approval, will indicate that the projects accounts be maintained on
an accrual basis and will include the following tasks:
(a) assessment of adequacy and reliability of procedures used to prepare customs
certificates or similar certificates;
(b) examination of customs certificates on which IDA disbursements have been
used;
(c) assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to
monitor expenditures and other financial transactions; and



15
(d)  verification that expenditures submitted to IDA, including those submitted in
the project management reports are eligible for IDA financing, and
identification of any ineligible expenditures.
Conclusion
11. Review of financial management systems, including internal controls, quality of
staff, accounting standards and financial reporting capacity of the National Bank's
Department of International Foreign Relations determined that the project has satisfied
the Bank's financial management requirements as required under OP/BP 10.02. Loan
disbursements will be based on traditional disbursement procedures and not PMR-based
disbursements. This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Bank and
the Borrower.
