(Class 2), both Chinese & English versions of EIA & EAP reports should be submitted before Mar.31,
1998. Then in Dec. 1997, Xian Highway Transportation University has been entrusted by HPCD to
undertake the EJA work of this project. (Xian Highway Transportatio University is undertaking
the EIA work of the National Highway Project nr in Hubei Province, namely Southern Section of
the Jingzhu National Trunk Line in  Hubei Province.)
Based on the EIA working principle  in  this  project for assuring  quality,   simplifying
procedure, and satisfying time limitation, from Dec.14 to Dec.26 in 1997, an on-the-spot survey
along the proposed highsay was done by the EIA working team from Xian Highway Transportation
University. The first version of EIS of this project was compiled in Mar. 1998 according to the
working guidance in EIA Outline of National Trunk Line Project NJ. Following the comnents and
recommendations made in the May and November 1998 and January 1999 Aide Memoire of World Bank
(WB) experts, the fourth version of EIA is compiled (Feb. 1999).

I  GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Li The Source of the Project and Its Pre}m}iary Work
The Southern Section of the Jingzhu National Trunk Line Project in Hubei Province has been
listed in the WB Loan Projects in comeercial year of 1999. According to the arrangement of WB
Loan Highway Projects in China, the Southern  Section   of  the  Jingzhu  National Trunk Line
Project in Hubei Province is called as the WB Loan National Highway Project IV in Hubei Province.
During the visiting of YB deputy group to Hubei Province (Apr.29-Iay 8,1996), Cowunications
Planning and Designing Institute of Hubei Province(CPDIHP) put forward the scheme of Tongshan
ChongyangPuql Highway, in which suggested that the road  designing  should  base  on Class 2
highway standard, and for it is connected with Southern Section of Jingzhu Line it should join
to the National Project as a consisting part. Document 1 1996) No. 198 of  HPCD  in May  1996
specified the preliminary working plan of TongshanChongyangPuqi Highway  scheme  in National
Project IV. Feasibility study report of the project was compiled in Apr.1997 by CPDIHP.
During visiting to Hubei Province in Nov.1997, WB deputy group demanded that EIS and EPA of
this road should be compiled. Then in Dec. 1997, Xian Highway Transportation University has
been entrusted by HPCD to undertake the EIA work of this project. From Dec.14 to Dec.26 in 1997
an on-the-spot survey along the proposed highway was done by the EIA working  team  from  Xian
Highway transportation University.

The project of Tongshan-Ciongyang-Puqi second class highway, which is a branch line of the
drafting Jing-2hu national highway in Hubei Province, is located in the southeastern part of
the province. The area along the route between east longitude 114 14' to 114 30' and north
latitude 29r 19' to 30o 20' is rolling ground. The highway projects of K0+000-K57+000 and K85
+O00K95+245 located in the plain and light undulated area  is  67. 245kms  long;   the  highway
project of K57+000-K85+000 located in the muntainous terrain and heavy undulated area is  28kms
long.
3.1.2. Climate Features
(1) Climate
The project area is located in the middle reaches of Changjiang River belonging to the
seasonal moist monsoon continental climate of the north subtropical zone with a long frost-free
period and abundant water resources. Both of the temperature and light intensity depends
considerably on season of the year. It is cold and dry in winter times for the control of
northwester; it is humid and rainy in early summer time while hot and arid in midsummer time
for the control of warm and humid southeaster. The weather may change significantly and often
likely to be cloudy or rainny in spring times. Autumn is sunny and bright with few records of
windy or rainy days.
(2) Temperature
The annual average temperature is 16.1x: - 16.3xC in the area. July and Augest are the two
hottest months. The monthly average temperature of July and Augest is 28.3C - 29.01C and the
extremes is 40.5x: . January is the coldest month. The monthly average temperature of January
is 2C   - 5'C  and the extremes is -13.3C  . The frost-free period ranges between 141 days and
246 days.
(3) Precipitation
The precipitation of the area is abundant and varies from 1100mm to 1563mm.The precipitation
of the flood period from April to October equals that of 80 -85 percent of a  year.   The  peak

(4) Wind
Heavy winds rarely take place (1 or 2 times a year) in Tongshan County and Chongyang County,
located in the bottom of a mountainous terrain and protected by a large mountain lying to the
north of the two counties. There are two mountains lying to the north and the south of Tongsban
County. Easters and westers are cormonly seen. The average wind velocity of a year is 1. 4m/s.
Puqi City is located at riverside of Changjiang River. Its landform is plain area. The strong
winds take place (4 ~ 5 times a year) in Puqi City more times than the other two counties.   It
is mainly northwester (of which the extremes is the tenth grade and the average velocity is I
Ws).
Figure 3-1 gives the wind-velocity roses of the area according to the five-year (1992 - 1996
climate information statistics offered by local meteorological observateries. It is shown that
the stable wind frequancy of the triangle area is 32% - 39X.
(5) Atmospheric Stability
According to three local meteorological observatories' information of surface winds and
cloud amount of the three years (1994 - 1996) which are calculated according to Pasquil Method.
It is shown that the neutral weather (D type) is the most frequent (49-54%) one and the stable
weather (E and D types) follow behind.

313llydhk Net
The surface watcr systems are vell developed in the project area. There are eany rivers,
creeks, pools and reserviors. Fushbi River and lushul River are the related larte water-
systems to the project.
(1) Fushui River
Fusbul River rises in the north foot of Sanjiejian Mountain, passing through Tongshan County
flows into Changjiang River at Fuchikou in Yangxin County. The upper reaches of  Fushui  River
from Xiapu Town to Tongyang Town are 74kms long; its drainage area is  571km r .  The  average
gradient is 13.3/1000; the flow rates is 19.53&3/s; the runoff rates is 6.06X1O8ms/s.
Tongshan River, a primary branch of Fushui River, rises in the east foot of Beiyang Mountain
It flows from west to east, via Nanlin, Shilong, Gangban, Dalu and Tongyang towns, into Fushui
River at Tangjiadi. It is 35.lkms long. Its drainage area is 246km2. The average gradient of
the river course is 6.6/1000; the flow rates is 5.61m2/s; the runoff rates is 1.74X 108n.  The
river basin is light undulated area. Because of the gentle and wide landform, there are many
farmlands on its middle reaches and lower reaches. The route acrosses Fushui River several
times by bridges in Tongshan County and a large one in the county town.
(2) Lushui River
lushui River rises in the north foot of Mufu Mountain, which is located at the juncture of
Hubei Province and Jiangxi Province. It passes through Tongcheng, Chongyang,   Puqi  and  Jiayu
counties, flows into Changjiang River at Hongmiao.It is 208kms long. Its flood level varies
obviously. The peak flow rates is 2900m'/s and the smallest is 0.11m3/s. The annual largest
flood usually takes place in May or June.   There  are  three  bridges  over  Lushui  River  at
Chongyang County town. The highway project will utilize them.
3.1.4. Hydrogeologic Features
The water resources of the project area is due to abundant precipitation, flouring surface
water-system and several types of groundwater,   commonly  existing  in  unsolidated  rocks  as
porewater and distributing in Chongyang basin, river valley and low land. The aquifer is made
up of sand layer and grit layer. Many aquifers are confined and they are more than 10m in
thickness. Water table is 3 - gm in depth.
3.1.5. Vegetation
The vegetation cover of  the  project  area  is  relatively  satisfied.   According  to  the
investgation, the forest coverage of Tongshan is about 55%; Chongyang is about 59.4%; Puqi is
about 32.6%. Masson pine, cedar, cypress and nanbamboo are the commomly natural vegetation.
Industrial crops include tea-oil tree, mulberry, cotton and fruit tree; cereal crops include
paddy, wheat, maize, rap, soybean and peanut. Thesc are the main artificial vegetations.
3.1.6. Wild-life
16



Sbe physical geographic situations of Tongshan County and Conogyang County are suitable for
wild-lifes. Surveys show that bean, foxes, bares and goats appear in forests,   mountains  and
remote villages. The route of the project does not pass through the national and provincial
natural reserves. Not any rare wild-lifes has been seen in the project area.
31.7. Soil Enosion
Rainfall is a major facter for soil erosion in the highway area. In Tongshan County and
Chongyang County, 80X of the land  is  light  undulated  area.   The  annual  precipitation  is
relatively large (the average of multi-years in Tongshan County is 1500mumChnngyang County 1495
.6am). Rain-storms take place more frequent in the two counties than any other areas of Hubei
Province. The soil erosion srea is 626.9kn2 and equals 25X of total area in Tongshan County.
205 villages among 43 town, most of them are distributed in Damu Mountain and Mufu Mountain,
are subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion area is 766.7km2 in Chongyang County. The amount of
soil erosion is about 2.29X10  ton/year including 1.5X104 ton/year organic matter.  The  soil
erosion coeffecients the two counties are almost the same as 3000 t/km2.a. The drafting route
in the two counties is located in the valley of Damu Mountain and Mufu Mountain. The vegetation
coverage is relatively large (55% and 59.4% respectively). There are few eradible soil types
such as limestone soil and ruddle. Soil-forming matrix is hard carbonate rocks.   According  to
the Survey, the route area of K0+0001K57+000 is plain and light undulated  area.   The  erosion
coefficient is 2200t/km2.a belonging to light erosion; the project area of K57+000-K74+ 800 is
mountainous terrain and heavy undalated area, the average erosion coefficient of the county is
30OOt/km2.a belonging to mean erosion.
The soil erosion area is 288.1/km2 in Puqi City, equals 16.7 percent of the city's area. The
anmual amount of soil erosion is 1.2467X1IO ton/year including 3895 ton/year organic material.
Its average soil erosion coefficient is 4300/kmn.a. The forest coverage is 32.6X. The majority
of soil-forming matrix is made up of pelite and ferruginous sandstone. The route of [74+000-B85
+000 in Puqi City is located in mountain terrain and heavy undulated  area.   Its  soil  erosion
coefficient is 4300t/kM2 belonging to mean soil erosion. The route of K85+ 000- K95+ 245 is
located in plain and light undulated area. The soil erosion coefficient is about 2000t/km 2
belonging to light soil erosion.
Comparing with Puqi City, soil erosion is much more serious in Tongshan County and Chongyang
County. Artificial activities mainly contribute to soil erosion besides natural causes such as
naked weathering. The farming of hillside field has chiefly led to soil erosion.
3.2. Socioeconamic Environment
3.2.1. Imnpaed1 Areas of the Project
The directly impacted areas of the project are Tongshan County, Chongyang County and Puqi
City of Xianning District of Hubei Province. It is 6317 km2, the total polulation is 13667.

Hubei Province. The poor traffic of the two counties limits the econmic developcent of minenal
local specially and tourism resources, and has resulted in poverty-stricken areas now.
3±. Trlfc Network in the Irnu*d Areas of the Project
(1) Traffic Conditicn in the Impacted Areas
lhb  freigh transportation relies an the highway in the impacted  area.  Ihere are No. 106
natinaml higbway, No. 107 naticnal highway, Chuigyang - Puqi highsay an Mianning- Tongshan
highsay etc. The Tong Oxg part of No.106 national highway was built in 1936 according to  low
geometric standards. Although it has been reconstructed manW tines and reaches to the standard
of the third class highway or the fourth class highway. This highway also goes through Nanlin,
azko and Baini Tcon, butit is becoming poorly conditioial and not suitable for driving. Chong
-N higsiwy, being a third or forth class highway, was built in 1988.  The tain  task  of  the
project is to reconstruct the natiwI highway No.106 and Chong-Pf highway.

8.4.2. The Amument of Water Environment Quality
(1) Assessment Methods
The Standard Classification Method was used to assess the water environment quality. If all
the monitoring data of a water sample are lower than the standard ones of the first class,
water quality of the profile belongs to the first class. If one or more items are higher than
the first class standards and lower than the second class standards, than it belongs to the
second class. This method also applies to the third, the forth and the fifth class.
(2) Assessment Standards
Ihe I class of GB3838-88 The Standard of Surface Water Environment Quality  is  used.   The
criteria are showed in table 1-4.
(3) Assessment
Compared the monitoring data with the standard ones in table 1-4, the assessment of water

The hourly average of Co concentration ranges between 0.50mg/Nm' and 0.99 mg/Nm'. The daily
average ranges between 0.53mg/Nm' and 0.95 mg/Nm". All the mean data are conformed to the
second class standard of GB3095-96.
The hourly average of N0. concentration ranges between 0.015mg/Nm' and 0. 045mg/Nm s          the
daily average range between 0.016mg/Nm' and 0.035mg/Nm'.AII the mean data arc conformed to  the
second class standard of GB3095-96.
The daily average of total suspended particulates (TSP) range between 0.20 mg/Nms and 0. 30
mg/Nm', which is conformed to the second class standard of GB3095- 96.   But  it  is  near  the
criteria ( 0.30 mg/N').
In conclusion, the concentration values of CO and N0. along the route of the project areas
are lower than the creteria, while the concentration values of TSP are close to the creteria.
Therefore, air quality has no problem, but more attention should be pay on TSP.

4.1.2.1 Promoting the develpent of regional socioeconomic
There are no railsay and waterway in Tongshan County and Chong Yang County except Puqi City.
The condition of the existing road is worse and its traffic capacity is weak.   Ihe  length  of
classified road is less than 10X of the existing road and commonly under the tertiary class.
Thus, the socio-economic devecopment in this area is limited severely. The project will expend
27



the highway net of the area by ioproving its traffic capacity and connecting local rosd with
highway. It will play an important role of the highway system in Huber Province and promote the
socloecuomic development of Tangshan  County,   Chogyang  Cnity  and  Puqi City  directly  by
enlarging the comconication with outside and speeding the developing pace. It will also drive
the econamic development of the south of Hubei Province and the north of Jiangxi Province.
4.1.2.2 Providing a Solid Basis for Heipping the Poor Areas
The area is located in the border district of Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Province, belongs to
the old  revolutionary  base  areas,   poor  border  areas  and  areas  inhabited  by  minority
nationalities. Tongshan County is listed as one of the helped poverty-stricken counties of Ctina.
The means of annual personal incomes is less than 400 yuan RMB in some districts of Tongshan
County and Chongyang County. The basic need has to assure. To eliminate poverty and become
prosperous is a tough work. The poverty of the area is largely due to its backward traffic
condition, which restricts its economic developent. There are abundant natural resources in the
area. More than 50 kinds of mineral resources with large potential capacities of exploration
have been proven. Therefore, the construction of the project is meaningful for expanding
resources exploration, promoting econmomic development, helping the poor areas and speeding the
pace to become prosperous.
4.1.2.3 Promoting the Development of Tourism
There are many famous and beautiful mountains, rivers and humanity scenes along the route.
The Jiugong Mountain, which is a beautiful splendid steep mountain and famous state rank
scenery in the middle part of China, lies in Tongshan County. It is the place in where Li
Zicheng, who was a peasant uprising leader in Ming Dynasty, died. The project lies in the
southern mountain area in Jiangxi Province, that is the E-Xiang-Gan Revolutionary Basis.   Many
old generation proletariat revolutionists such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai worked
there successively. The proposed road will be favorable to the  tour  traffic  condition,   the
tourism resources exploring and the tourism development.
4.1.3 Social Probleras in Construction
4.1.3.1 The Route Project and Town Layout
The proposed highway restricted by the topography passes through the North Street of
Tongshan Town. The main commercial lies in the South Street at present. There are few people
and vehicles in the North Street. According to the town  layout,   the  planing  route  passing
through the North Street will promote the commercial development in South Street.  The  project
scheme and the town layout of Tongshan Twon are integrated well. Chongyang Town is the center
of political, economy and culture of this county. The project using three existing bridges on
Lushui River passes through the North Street of the town, shere road is wide and houses are in
order. The proposed highway has been listed in the total layout of Chongyang County, and that
of Puqi City. The planing route passing through the south of Puqi Town untilizes the existing
28



toad without *nOy changes and ny effect an town layout.
4.1.3.2 Land Acquisition and Buildinf Removal
the proposed road will cover 1185.5 ma lands the temporary conatruction sites will cover 458
mu land. The removal of buildings is 217808e and that of power poles and telecom poles is 97 in
estimation. Acquisition for land and removal is unavoidable in  highway  construction.   Design
unit considers it as a primary factor in location of line, Because it is concern to residents'
private properties and profits directly. Wide propeganda af relevent state regulations is
necessary to carry out it and ensure the acqusistion for land and removal unimpeded. The local
governments are in faver of highway constructioni all are willing to provide convenience. They
will take part in acquisition for  land,   removal  and  resettlement  positively  and  justify
disagreement between the construction and residents.
4.1.3.3 Historical Relics Impact Analysis
Trough consultation with the designer of the project and Hubei Provincial Archaeology
Research Institute, in the assessment area no significant cultural relics occur along the
projected highway.

The results are shown in table 4-4.
(3) Assessment of Impact on Soil Quality
Table 4-4 shows that the lead content of soil along the route will increase slowly as the
tiraffic volume increases. The predicted datum is far below the assessment standard,   250mg/kg.
It indicates that the construction and transportation of the highway will not result in lead
pollution along the route. Meanwhile, leadfree gasoline will be used more and more widely in
our cuntry. Therefore the lead content in the soil along the route may be smaller than that of
calculated datum in table 4-4 in the coming years.

(3) Impact Assessment of Soil Erosion
The prediction in table 4-5 shows that the soil erosion caused by highway construction is 4
-10 times as much as before. The potential erosion grade of K0+000-K28+200 section in Tongshan
County and K85+000-K95+245 section in Puqi City will attain the extremes grade (80-10 t/ha*a ).
Others attain intensive grade (more than 150 t/ha-a ). However, the total of soil erosion
volume is not large, since the proposed highsay is mainly to reconstruct existing  road.   New
road is only 22.31 kms long. The annual volume of soil erosion ( in  recommended  scheme)   may
attain 18000 ton without taking environmental protection measures ( the soil erosion in
construction of existing road is  considered  to  be  the  half  of  new  construction) .  The
construction period is 2 years with several rainy seasons.  There  are  1477200n '   stone  and
earthwork in roadbed construction, which will destroy vegetation cover,   change  the  original
gradient of land surface, and disturb the original stable surface. So,   the  soil  erosion  is
31



unavoidable. Furthermore, the vegetation cover during initial service stage cannot recover to
a good state iomediately. The  aoil erosion prevention in construction can not be ignored.   The
highway construction unit should recover vegetation cover according to the rule of later and
Soiil Preservation AMt of P.LC while construction. The  protection  slide,   drainage  ditches,
blocking wall ahould be built with as soon as possiblc. The concrete facilities for protecting
engineering are shown in chapter 5.
The intensified soil erosion resulted from the highway construction can be recovered within
3-6years by the improvement of drainage system and the recovery of vegetation cover. The soil
erosion along the route will be eased compared with before by the improved pavement and planting.
lherefore, the intensified soil erosion in construction is temporary.
4.2.3 Analysis of impact on agriculture
The primary impact on agriculture is permanent land acquisition. The acquisite land will
lose agricultural output ability, which do certain damage to agricultural production . The
project will acquisite 1185.5mu land permanently (in table 4-6). The ratio of the acquisite
cultivated land and the cultivated land in each county or city along the route as follows:
Tongshan County 33(,Chongyang County 1.9XD,Puqi City 0 ( acquisite mountain land only ) .   It  Is
shown that the ratio of acquisite cultivated land is low and the acquisite land disperses in
many natural villages. Therefore, the structure of agricultural production is not affected
seriously in this area. Since the average farm land per person in the area is small (Tongshan 0
.65mu/per, Chongyang 0.98mu/per, Puqi 1.38mu/per).    The  No.   11  regulation  of  1997,   The
Information about Strengthening Land Management and Protecting Farmland Practically, should be
carried out very well in design. The cultivated layer in the temporary sites should be piled up
and recover back to the surface.

4.2.4 Analysis of imzpact on ecology environrment by using earth.
The total amount of earth and stone work is 1477.2X103 in, including 355.3X103 m 3   stone
work and 1121.9X103 m3 earth work, in the construction ,since most sections of the proposed
road run along the natural land surface, the cut-fill volume is small. The land surface of K57
32



4000-985+00 sectio  is fairly roSbh  construction of the section includes cut and f ill.   Sme
of eauth aud stone work voloue needed to fill can be stisfied by cutting work within 0.652. Ohm.
Others can be ptovided by stoe quarries and earth fields. Mny stone quarries locate along the
route and can satisfy the needs for stones. Mhe area belongs to rolling terrain.  IMny  little
hills can provide earth for filling and be evened to cultivated land. Earth fields on farmland
are built as less as possible in order to protect insufficient cultivated land.
4.3 Prediction and Assemezit of Inpact on Waterbodies
4.3.1. tunoff Pbolutio of Road Surface
Many factors influence road runoff pollution such as precipitation of the area, duration of
rainfalls interval between two rainfalls, air and road surface pollution intensity relating to
traffic volume, width of road surface and length of road sections for drainage.   There  is no
unique  assessment method confrom  to  now  because  of  random  elements.  The   pollutant
concentrations in table 4-7 are generally used in environmental assessment of highway where
vehicle flow is 2000-3000/d. The proposed road canmonly belongs  to  second  class  road.  The
predicted daily vehicle flow of most sections is about 8000/d in the future corresponding of
1/3 or 1/4 as much as that of high-class roads. Therefore, the pollutant concentration of road
surface runoff will be 1/3 or 114 of the value in table 4-7(except PH).
Comparing with the environmental impact prediction of National Highway Project IV (southern
section of Jing-Zhu Highway) in Hubei Province, of which climate,  geography  position,   river
characters etc are similar to that of the proposed road, the comparative analysis shows that-
Table 4-7             Poflutant Concentration in Initial Runoff on Road Surface

120min. 's Runoff
(1) The weak impact of road surface runoff on river water quality( Fushui River,  Tongshan
River, Baini River and Lushui River) along the proposed highway  can be ignored.   Because  the
flows of the rivers are large and the rainfall in the project area is abundant (annual average
is 1495-1507mm), the road surface runoff can be well diluted, and the pollutant concentration
is 1/3-1/4 less than that of high-class highway.
(2) The impact of runoff on reservoirs can be ignored since the capacity of Lushui Reservoir
is very large. In addition, when pollutant concentration decreases to 1/3-1/4 of the values in
table 3-7 (except PH), they are below the discharging standard. The impact an water quality
near the bank is weak.
33



4.3L Impact Anal ys of Wasteater in Management Zoe
hree monagmt stations along the route will locate in Tongshan County,  CaOngya     County
and Puqi City respectively. The domestic wastewater from mnagement zone will be the  only  one
fixed polluting source during service period. A survey shows that the staff and workers of a
magement zone is about 40, standard domestic wastewater volume is 1501/d each person, so  the
quantity of domestic wastewater will be 6.0 eS every day. The quality of wastewater is similar
to normal domestic wastewater, and can be treated by septic tanks. Treated sludge can be used
as fertilizer and effluent for irrigation (Standard of Irription Water shown in table 1-5). In
addition, the garbage of management stations should be centralized.
4.8.3. Prediction of Water Pollutim  during Construction
(1) Water of the rivers may be turbid by digging bottom mud for bridge construction or
washing construction materials(such  as  sand  or  stones) .       Improved  bridge  construction
technologies such as cofferdam and deep-well are the main methods to alleviate water pollution
of the rivers.  Deep-well method is suitable for Fushul River and  Lushui River.        Cofferdam
method is suitable for other rivers which bed is much wider than surface. It can prevent these
rivers to become turbid by construction and polluted by construction refuse.
(2) Domestic waste without management will pollute waterbodies. The construction of the
proposed road will be put into effect by local goverment and local highway bureau.  The  local
villagers who live in their own hones are  the  main  labor source.   Only  the  construction
management district produces domestic waste. Toilets and garbage plants should be built in
management zone so that treated domestic waste can be used for irrigation and fertilizing.
(3) The leakage oil from machinery oil, construction boats and the pouring waste oil into
rivers can pollute waterbodies. Therefore, management should be strengthened and environment
education should be spread.
(4) Construction materials such as pitch, oil, chemical substances sashed into rivers can
pollute waterbodies if they are not well stored. Therefore, the stockyard should be far away
from drinking wells, rivers and reserviors. Moreover, it should be equipped with canvas for
temporary shielding.
4.3.4. Risk Analysis of Dangerous Goods.
The transportation of chemical and poisonous substance is unavoidable after completion
according to the feasibility study report of the  project.   Oil,  fertilizers  and  pesticide
consist 7.55 percent of the total transportation freights. See table 3-4. The proposed highway
run across some rivers and reservoirs, in order to guarantee waterbodies from pollution caused
by freight transportation, the risk analysis of transportation is given below.
34



The formula for the possibility of traffic accidents caused by dangerous chemical substances
transportation is:
PunQ Q-QlXQ6XQXQ4XQs
Where:
P---Probability of accident involving chemical dangerous cargoes occurred on road sections
near water body in the predicting year;
Q1-The frequency of serious traffic accident occurred presently on the district that  the
proposed highway passes through, (time/million veh.kmi)
Q1-Traff ic volume in the predicting year, (million veh./year);
Qs-Truck percentage, ();
Q4---QChemical dangerous material percentage, (X);
Qb-The length of road section near and over water body, (km).
The value of each factor was determined as follows:
Q1-Reference to the traffic accident rate in 1994 in NH 106, QI-0.15;
Qz-According to the traffic volume prediction , in 2010, Qz-2.00, in 2020, Qz-2. 90,   in
2022, Q2-13.55.
Qs-According to the feasibility study report on the proposed highway, Q.="80%;
Q,-According to the feasibility study report, Q85-8.55%;
Q6-Detetmined based on the road section length that pass over rivers or lakes or  fishing
ponds, Qb= 6.5km.
The prediction results are shown in table 4-8
Table 4-8  Risk Analysis of DarIgerous Goods Transportation on the Road Seciion

The data from table 4-8 show that the possibility of serious accidents that can pollute
the waterbody caused by the vehicles transporting  chemical  substance  across    waterbody  in
service time is 0.13 /year in 2010, 0.19 /year in 2020. Under this conditions, the possibility
of accident is not to be neglected. So in service time, it is necessary to take management
measures to contral the transportation of dangerous chemical substances and to prevent the
accident from happening. For specific measures and suggestions, see chapter V and VA.

Where:
Leq-   total equivalent sound level A at the predicting spot;
Leq,-   Hourly equivalent sound level (dB) of type i vehicle flow at predicting point
i-    Vehicle type, usually it can be classified into heavy, middle and light vehicles;
LAS-  Average radiate sound level A (dB) tested at reference point when type i  vehicle
running at a speed of VI;
T-    Testing time, T=1 hour;
N,- Traffic volume of the ith vehicle, (No./hour);
V1- Speed of the ith vehicle,(km/hour);
r. -   Distance between the reference spot and the lane, r.=7.5m;
r-    Distance betseen the predicting spot and the lane,(m);
-     The attenuation factors of sound waves related to the absorptive characteristics  of
ground covering;
A S     The attenuation amount of sound level caused by objects like embankment, excavation
etc. and the revised value concerned with the characteristics of the highway ,(dB).
(2)  The prediction model of traffic noise  in the  night (22:00-06:00)   is as follows:
Because the  traffic volume per hour at night(20:20 - 6:00)  is  small,   the  model    for
nighttime is used as follows:
N,          ro          TO

lower value.
(2) Ground Attenuation Factor
The areas on both sides of the proposed highway are farmlands  on  the  whole.   The  sound
propagation attenuation factor(o ) of ground covering is 0.5.
(3)a S
For the attenuation amount of sound level (A S) caused by objects like different neights of
embankments, or high-level bridges and the different depths of excavation, use the following
formula:
N=a X f / 170
Where:
b -Difference of sound propagation length,(m),
f---Noise frequency, as for highway traffic , f"550Hz;
N----Fresnel Number.

It is shown in table 4-12 that  in each road section while the spots are more than 30 meters
away from road center can be conform  to the class IV standard of GB3096-93 in 2000,  42  meters
away from road center can be conform to the class1V standard of GB3096-93 in 2010 and 48 meters
away from road center can be conform to the class TV standard of GB3096-93 in 2020.
(2) Assessment of Noise Impact on Sensitive Spots
Table 4-12 shows that within 20 year of service stage the noise level is each scetion, where
is 48 meters away from road center can be conform to assessment standard. From the scope of
acquisition and removal for highway construction, the main objects, are affected by traffic
noise, are the buildings, which located within 10-48 m from road center.
By calculation and statistic in 2000, 2010 and 2020 year, the noise level on sensitivc spots
in the highway environmented assessment extent and corresponding standard are shown in table  4
-13 and table 4-14.

Table 3-13 and table 4-14 shows that comparing with the standard in GB3096- 93,  which is
adopted in the project assessment. The noise of some sensitive spots along the route will
exceed the standard in the service stage. The noise level of four of total 14 schools along the
route exceeds standard. Five of thirteen villages exceed standard ( indicating the front row
building in the evenings). There are 28 villages (other sensitive spots ) within the assesstent
area (see appendix 1). The exceeding standard villages mong the 28 other sensitive spots are

4.4.3 AXnlysds of Acoustic Environment Inpact during Construction
The noise of construction sites along the proposed highway mainly comes from construction
vehicles and equipment. For noise levels and their attenuation, see Table 4-15.

In the Noise Standards for Construction Sites GB12523-90, the limiting noise value is  75dB
during the daytime and 55 dB at night. It is shown from the noise level in Table 4-15 that the
standard distance for the noise of construction machinery at daytime is about 40m,  and  about
150m at night. The noise of construction machinery in the daytime will not affect the
environment greatly, but at night it will. So, it is suggested that the construction should be
stopped from 20:00 to 6:00. If there is a school within 150m of a construction  site,   it  is
necessary to negotiate with the school and adjust the working hours so that teaching activity
will not be greatly affected.
It is shown in Table 4-15 that the noise of construction oachinery,   generally  speaking,
exceeds 8NdOWA), some even exceeds 9WdEKOW. This noise will affect constructors, especally the
operators of construction machinery. The Noise Health Standards for Industrial Enterprises
issued by the Minitry of Public Health of Chnia and the General Bureau of labour are shown in
Table 4-16. It is suggested that the Construction Unit should reasonably arrange for
constructors and their work to protect their health and pay attention to the maintenance of
machinery used for construction so that the noise levels could be reduced to the lowest. As for
those workers who work longer hours near the source of noise, some measures should be taken to
protect their health, such as car plugs, helmets, etc.

4.4.4 Summary
(1) The acoustic sensitive spots along the route will be affected in the highway service
stage. Practical protection measures should be taken to sensitive spots which noise level
exceeds standard.
(2) Construction goes usually at 6:00-22:00 in the day times. There is little influence on
residents' sleep on sensitive spots. When the construction operations have to carry out at
night, some noise-reduction measures should be taken like to slow down the speed and/or forbid
to blow horns.
(3) The noise level of construction machines coforms to the N standard in GB3096-93 at the
place where are 40m away from the construction sites. The majority of villages are further than
40m from highway-center. Therefore, the construction machine noise has a little influence on
the life of local inhabitants in the day times.
(4) There are many schools along the route. The construction noise on school section will
cause a distinct impact on school teaching. The construction units should get agreement with
schools. Besides, during construction at school sections some temporary noise- reduction
measures such as wooden sound insulating boards should be taken.
4.5 Prediction and Assessment of Imnpact on Ambient Air Quality

4.5.2 Prediction Results and Assessment of impact on ambient air quality
(1) Daily average concentration of CO and NO, for some typical cross-sections
According to the meteorological conditions, vehicle flow of each sections and topography
state, the daily average concentrations of CO and Nox on 6 selected cross- sections along the
proposed highway in 2000,2010 and 2020 year has been predicted.   The prediction  results  are
shown in table 4- 19.
It is shown in table 4- 19 that
(a) From the highway coming into operation to 2020  year,  the  maxmum  CO daily  average
concentration on six cross-sections is 1.27mS/n3. That is to say that all of the six road
sections are conform to the C0 standard of class 2 in GB3095-1996
(b) Until 2020 year, the maximum daily average NOx concentration is 0.075  mg/m   ,   which
shows  that all the road sections can satisfy  the NOx standard of class 2 in GB3096-1996.   It
is clear that the future road will affect the ambient air quality slightly.
(2) Daily average concentration of CD and NO,. at sensitive spots
44



Fot the prediction result of daily average concentration of CD and NO6 of same typical
aensitive spots in 2000,2010 and 2020 during the service period, see Table 4-20.
The CD and NOx concentrations an mensitive spots along the route in table 4- 20 show that
the daily average concentrations of CD and NOx are conform to the closs 2 standard of GB3095
-1996 till 2020 year. There is a slight influence on sensitive spots along the route.

4J.3 Analyls of impact an Ambient Air Qualty during Contuction
(I) Major Air Pollution Sources during Construction
The impact on the ambient air quality during the  period  of  construction  is  mainly  from
raised dust or total suspended particles(TSC) and asphalt smog.
There are 3 sources of raised dust. The first one is from the mixing and paving of lime and
soil on the proposed highway during the construction of the subgrade. The second one is from
the mixing plants of lime and soil. The thitd one is from vehicles and equipment used for
construction or transportation on construction sites.
(2) Analysis of Impact on Ambient Air
a) Reducing the dust
According to the analogical results, sprinkling sater at the construction site can reduce
70% of the dust and obtain a good effect. So, it is  suggested  here,   during  the  period  of
construction, the work of sprinkling water to the construction sits should be done timely in
order to prevent the dust pollution.
©Z Controlling the asphalt smog
Because of the asphalt concrete used for pavement will be supplied by asphalt concrete
mixing plants set up temporarily with fully-closed equipment, the asphalt smog will not bring
an obvious pollution to the ambient air of the construction sites. An attention should be paid
to the location of the plants, which should be chosen in light of the requirement of Distance
Classification for Protection of Hygiene. The plants should be located at least 300m away from
the sensitive-spots such as residential quarters and schools and should be downwind of the
ncarest sensitive spot. It is also necessary to point out that open or half-close equipment for
asphalt boiling cannot be used.
4.5.4 Sunnsuay
(1) The current concentrations of CO NOx and TSP along the route is satisfy to the standard of
class 2 in GB3096-1996, the air is clean.
(2) From the highway coming into operation  to 2020 Yr, the concentration of OD and  NOx  on
both sides of the highway is up to the class 2 in Ambient Air Quality Standard, so, the project
will have a small influence on air quality along the route.
(3) All of the predicted pollutant concentrations on sensitive spots are up to the standard
of class 2 in GB3095-1996. There is a slight influence on the air quality of sensitive spots in
service stage.
(4) During construction, the dust produced by vehicle transpoTtation will cause distinct
impact on the air quality; necessary measures should be taken.

V. MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEUI'ON ENGINEERING
5.1 Envirnmental Protweto  Measures in Desgn
Alignment of the proposed highway based on the natural environment should be perfected in
the designing stage.                                            a
(1) Afforestation at road side and mountain slope protection by mortar slab stone should
be considered  in  design,   to  prevent soil  erosion  and  beautify   highway    landscape.
High precipitation of the area along the highway  may  cause  collapse    and    slope    slide
directly, therefore, at sections of large  area  side  slope  protection,   collecting    pipes
should be constructed for drainage to prevent from erosion in flood season.
(2) Alignment scheme should be perfected for being away from villages & schools or less
farmland occupation.
(3) Rational selection for the position of earth borrowing sites and spoil areas, should be
considered. Pay attention to water and soil conservation of earth borrowing sites, the  impacts
of dusting and other problems caused to environmental sensitive area (for example, residential
regions).
(4) Sensitive spots as cities & towns should be avoided in the highway design.
5.2 Environmental Protecdon Measures During Construction
5.2.1 Measures for Ecological Environmental Protection -
(1) During construction, it is necessary to build temporary settling basins to allow mud and
sand to settle at places where rainwater runoff occurs during digging  of  the  subgrade.   The
average depth of the settling basin is 0.5m, its scale is determined in terms of the size of
catchment area and its location in terms of the topography. Earth and cloth fences are placed
when necessary near the outlet of the settling  basin.       When  the  highway  construction  is
finished and the culvert pipes laid  down, either trees should be planted on the sites of   the
settling basins or the area should be reverted to farmland.
(2) Afforestation and slope protection of cut slopes should be pay attention to when the
line is cutting in rolling hills.
(3) It is recommended to limit the working area, to prohibit workers cutting trees out of
borrow site. It is necessary to plant trees in the borrow area as soon as possible after the
excavation has been completed. Earth will be borrowed fron upland areas.
(4) The retaining walls, the drainage ditches, and the work of planting trees and grass
should be constructed checked simultaneously.
(5) During construction, while the land is temporarily'using, it will be necessary to remove
the fertile surface soil and stack it nearby. Then after the construction is finished , restore
the land to its previous condition.
5.2.2 Measures for Prevention and Control of Noise
(I)  It is recommended that the construction unit should arrange for the   workers  to operate
49



the machines in turn for reducing the time of beariln excessive noise, pay attention to the
maintenance of the machinery and to keep the noise level of the machlnery as low as possible.
For the workers working a longer  time near the sound  ource,  eat plugs should be provided for
them to protect their bearing.
(2) When the distance between the residential quarters and the construction site is less
than 150m, it is recoended that work be suspended from 20: 00 to 06: 00 in  order  to    ensure
that the residents have an undisturbed night rest. When the construction operations have to
carry out at night, some noise-reduction measures should be taken like to slow down the speed
of transport truck and/or forbid to blow horns.
(3) For the section near school, the construction unit should negotiate with the teachers
about the tine of construction to reduce the disturbance to teaching caused by noise. Besides,
durin8 construction at school sections soae temporary noise-reduction measures such as wooden
sound insulating boards should be taken.
5.2.3  Measures for Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Polution
(I) It is recomended that bedding plants and lime-soil mixing plants should   be  set  up  in
open areas, at least 200m away from residential  quarters  or schools
(2) Material piling areas should be covered up or sprinkling to prevent  from  pollution  of
dust. Material transportation trucks should be covered by mufflers.
(3)For prevention and controlling of asphalt smog, the asphalt concrete mixing plant should
be located at least 300m  away from the environmental sensitive  spots  such  as    residential
quarters and schools and should be downwind of the nearest sensitive Spot.
5.2.4 Environuenftal Protection Measures for Water Polution
(1) Pollution of river water from bridge constructfon can be prevented by innovation of
construction procedures. For examples when the flow of a river is rather iarge (Fushui River and
Lashul River),  drop shoft sinking method should be used  in  the  bridge    construction    to
mitigate the pollution to river. For other rivers with wider river bed than river surface,
cofferdam method should be adoped to prevent the river from being muddy and polluted by falling
garbage.
(2) The domestic sewage, garbage and excrement of workers at construction site should be
concentrated and treated, and cannot be discharged directly into the water body.   If  domestic
sewage in the areas of construction cannot be connected with the municipal drainage system, it
will be necessary to build dry toilet and septic tanks.
(3) During the construction of bridges, the machinery and  shfps  used  should  be  strictly
checked to prevent the leakage of oil. The waste oil and garbage from construction are not
allowed to discharge into the water body.
(4) It is not proper to pile up construction materials such as asphalt, oil  and  chemicals
at places near wells for public use, rivers and lakes in order to prevent them from entering
into the water body when it rains.
5.3 Environmental Protectio Measure durbzig the Operation Period
5.3.1 Plan for Areas on Both Sides of the Route
(1) The predicted results of traffic noise showed that during the long-term service period
(202OYr.) of the proposed highway, the noise level in the areas more than 48m away from the
road center-line is lower than the limiting value of Class 4 in GB3096-93. Therefore, from a long
-term point of view, it is recommended in planning for the areas on both sides of the highway
that buildings and units such as residential quarters not be built within 60m away from the
50



road ornter-line. As for schols and hospitals  that have a higher demand for acoustic
enviromnent quality, it is recmmended that schools and hospitals not be built within 200C away
from the road center-line.
(2) Set up traffic signs prohibiting the use of horns on the sections where schools are near.
(S) Strengthen traffic management by setting up traffic enviromental monitoring stations at
the entrance and exit to the highway and prohibiting old vehicles with higher noise levels to
run on the highway.
(4) For engineering measures for prevention and control of traffic noise and cost estimates,
see Table 5-1 & Table 5-2. The effect of noise-reduction of varied mitigation measures is
shown in Table 5-3.

5.3.2 Measures for Prevention and Control of Ambient Air PoUution during Operation
(1) Planting Trees by the Roadside
It was reported that the planting of frees can purify and absorb the pollutants from the
exhaust of vehicles'7n.
The area along the proposed highway is fairly suitable for the growth of trees and shrubs.
Therefore, it is recoamended that trees and shrubs be planted in the area near the roadside,
especially in sensitive areas ,so that the air pollutants from the exhaust of vehicles can be
absorbed , the 7SP can be purified, the enviroment can be beautified and the landscape along
the route can be improved . As the atmospheric sensitive spots are basically the same as that
for acoustic sensitive spots, the measures for planting trees in these places can produce
effects in both two aspects.
(2) Strictly examine vehicle exhausts by selectively sampling at toll stations and vehicles
52



with ehausts greatly exceeding the staldard are =z be allowed to rmn  n the highway.
5JJ  Water Pofution and Potential Rlsk during Servie
(1) Sewge for three toll station and management regions (Tangshan, Qiongyan, Puqi) should
be treated by septic tanks, then used for irrigation  and fertilization,   garbage  should  be
assembled and treated.
(2) Cargo vehicles which leak and overloaded vehicles are not allowed by the toll stations to
run on the highway to prevent them from polluting the water body.
(3) For preventing the pollution to water bodies by leakage accidents of dangerous articles,
collision-proof concrete  stakes  should be set at the  road aection near Lushui reservoir
([63K69).
(4) Certifications from public security, fire control, & transportation agencies must be
required for passing of vehicles carrying dangerous goods. These vehicles should have obvious
marks on them, and should be supervised strictly.
(5) Vehicles carrying dangerous articles should not be permitted running, or should be speed
limited on the icy road and in snowy & smoggy weather.
(6) An emergency leading group  consisted  by  local transportation,   fire  control,  and
environmental protection agencies should be organized for dealing with the accidents of
dangerous article transportation in time and scientifically.

VI ALTERNAT[VE SCHEMES
6.1  Route Alipgnent of the Comparative Scheme
There are three comparative sections: Tongshan town city coapatative section,   Pufang  main
plant comparative section, and Puqi outskirts comparative section.
(1) Tongsban town city comparative section
Recommended scheme: K0+000-K19+000, 19.0km long.
Comparative scheme: K0+000 - K18+218 (K19+000 in recomended scheme), 18.218km long.
(2) Pufang main plant comparative section
Recomended scheme: [74+800 [ K84+500, 9.7km long.
Comparative scheme: K74+800 - K83+006 ([84+500 in recommended scheme), 8.206km long.
(3) Puqi city outskirts comparative section
Recommended scheme: K90+500 [ K94+700, 4.2km long.
Comparative scheme: K90+500 - K94+357 (K94+700 in recommended scheme), 3.857km long.
See the appendix map for comparative scheme alignment.
6.2  Comparison of the Altemrative Sebemes
In the determination procedure of alignment scheme, consultations and discussions are made
many times among designing unit (Hubei Provincial Communication Planning and Designing Institute)
EIA unit Xian  Highway  Transportation  University) ,   government  agencies,   environmental
protection departments, city planning departments, deputies to the National People's Congress.
and affected masses along the proposed highway. To eliminate the unfavorable impacts by the
highway construction, the route makes detour to avoid big villages, schools, etc. In the mean
time, the route avoids lakes as far away as possible to eliminate the impacts on water bodies.
The  comparison  of  the  alternative  schemes  in  the  aspects  of  engineering,   economic,
environmental and resettlement is shown in table 6-1.
6.3 Conclusion
(1) Tongshan town city comparative section
Advantages of Recommended Scheme:
qiIn spite of the greater total length of the recommended section,the practical length is  0
.386 km shorter when by using 1.15 km of the existing road. Therefore, the land used will be
less than the comparative section. Land is very important to the people in Tongshan where it is
scarce, so it worth considering in choosing the alignment.
(I Located in the light rolling areas, the soil erosion extent of the recommended scheme is
140.5 t/ha.a., while the comparative section is near the mountainous areas where the erosion
extent is 210.75t/ha.a. As a result, the loss of water and soil of recommended scheme during
the construction stage is less than that of the comparative scheme (See Table 6-1).
® The recommended scheme passes less rivers, thus causing less impact on water environment.
() The cost for recommended scheme is lower than that of comparative scheme.
54



Aj) The recommended sgheme is in favour %Z thL public.
Disadvantages of the Recomended Scheme:
Q There are nore sensitive spots effected by traffic noise and air pollution.
<> There are more demolition of housing.
According to the analysis above, the recomwended scheme in the Feasibility Study Report has
been put forward mainly based on the consideration of the factors as local governlment and public
opinions, engineering investment, and local economic development. Therefore, to mitigate the
unfavorable impacts on the enmitonmental  sensitive  spots,   proper  eovirormental  protection
measures must be adopted.
(2) Pufang main plant comparative section
Advantages of Recommended Scheme
(D Although the total length of the recommended scheme is 1.494 km longer (9.7- 8.806), 5.88
km of highway would be built for the comparative scheme. For the recommended one no new section
will be built, thus saving much land.
® The soil erosion resulting from improvement to the existing road is half that of building
a new one. The greater erosion resulting from new building (5. 5  km)   makes  the  comparative
scheme impractical.
® The recommended scheme is in favour of the public.
T Both schemes pass the same number of rivers, but the recommended one passes less streams(
same number of culvetts), causing slighter impact on water-bodies.
Disadvantages of Recommended Scheme
CD There are more sensitive spots affected by noise and air pollution for the recommended
scheme.
() There is more demolition of housing.
©D The cost for the recommended is higher.
According to the analysis above, the recommended scheme in the Feasibility Study Report has
been put forward mainly based on the consideration of the factors as local government and public
opinions, and local economic development. Therefore, to mitigate the unfavorable impacts on the
environmental sensitive spots, proper environmental protection measures must be adopted.
(3) Puqi city outskirts comparative section
Except for the mileage, the recommended scheme is superior to the comparative scheme in the
following ways: land use, house demolition and support from the public.  So,   the  recommended
scheme is better than the comparative scheme.

7.1.3  CompLrison of Environmental Protection Costs and Project Co0ts
The estimated total cost of this construction project is 171.4 million yuan (RMB). The lump
-sum cost of environmental  protection  is  3. 255  million  yuan.   Yearly  operation  cost  of
environmental protection is 2.15 million yuan. Environmental protection investment of the whole
project takes 3.16% of the total investment in this project. Which shows that the cost of
environmental protection is not a major part in the total investment of this project, and the
envitonmental pollution of this project is not serious.
7.2 Analysis of Environmental Loss and Benefit
7.2.1 Analysis of the Environmental Benefit of Environmental Protection Costa
(1) Direct Benefit
During operation of the highway, vehicle exhausts will pollute the atmospheric and water
environment; dust and noise will impact on the environmental quality in residential areas. The
health of people living on both sides of the highway will be affected to some extent and the
normal life and work  of  these  people  will  be  affected  as  well.   Therefore,   practical
environmental protection measures must be taken, such as sound proof measures and plantation
along the road sections near sensitive spots to reduce the negative effects caused by traffic on
the environment. After taking environmental protection measures, the economic loss that can be
retrieved each year or the direct economic benefit of environmental protection will be about 0
.642 million yuan, which includes the net output value lost because of workers illness caused by
traffic  noise and atmospheric pollution;  the  medical  expenditure  on  illness   caused    by
pollution; the expenditure from social  welfare  funds  on  illness  and  death    caused    by
pollution;  the devaluation in real estate in polluted sections; the loss of  means of production
and livelihood, etc, when environmental protection measures are not taken. See Table 7-3.

Note: First line house along the roadside:2600room, popullation:3600person, in
Which about 1000room and 1200person will be protected by EP measures.
(2) Indirect Benefit
If no effective environmental protection measures were taken along the proposed highway,
there would be some indirect negative effects, such as the reduction of the quality of teaching
and the quality of life, the agitation of people and social instability factors, etc.   in  the
affected areas. Therefore, after some  environmental  protection  measures  being  taken,   the
negative effects mentioned above will not arise and bc replaced by positive benefits as a result
of this environmental protection investment.
7.2.2 Analysis of EnvironmentaJ Loss and Benefit
The following formula is used to analyze the economic loss and benefit of the environmental
protection measures.
E = S / H
Wihere
E-   economic benefit of environmental protection expenditure
S     economic loss that can be retrieved each year aftcr environmental protection  measures
are taken
H -     expenditure of environmental protection investment per year
By calculation method mentioned above, we know that after effective environmental protection
measures are taken, the economic loss retrieved per year will be 0.642 million yuan, and there
will be numerous uncountable indirect economic and social benefits. The expenditure used for
environment protection yearly average is 0. 2703million yuan and the economic benefit for
environment protection each year is E=2.38, Which illustrates that the investment of environment
protection is reasonable.  Thus, it is of  great  importance  to    execute  the  environmental
protection measures suggested  in  the  EIA  when    building the highway. The construction unit
should take environmental protection measures step by step as suggested in the assessment to
ensure the coordinate and sustainable development of construction and enmvironmental protection.

8.2 Envhrnmental Monitoring Plan
8.2.1  Monitoring Purpose
The environmental impact during construction stage mainly includes river water pollution
caused by construction of bridge; noise from construction machines,   soil  erosion  caused  by
67



earth and stone cuttlng & filling, flying dust and asphalt smoke from the mixing  plants,   and
other pollution. During operation stage, the  impact on  environment  is mainly  by   traffic
ehawusting gas, flying dust, and noise, serious pollution caused by emergent accident. Therefore,
it is necessary to understand the environmental situations and development trend to improve
environmental management in implementation of monitoring plan.
8.2.2 MonItoring Agencies
Environmental monitoring work in construction & operation is in charged by Hubei Provincial
Highway Environmental Monitoring Unit. This agency has been organized in project  I   already.
The monitoring work of proposed highway is also taken care by it.
8.2.3 MonItoring Plan
The routine monitorlng work is undertaken by  the  Hubei  Provincial  Highway  Environmental
Monitoring Unit.  See (I) - (4) in monitoring plan of table 8-3.
The key points in monitoring is air,  water,    nd  noise,   according  to  the  requirement
environmental monitoring, on-the-spot or mobile monitoring, fixed time or random time sampling
methods are all be arranged in the work.
In the implementation of monitoring plan, the problems as monitoring method, purpose, staff
training, etc. should be determined by the monitoring unit under HPCD and the entrusted unit
together. The monitoring plan will be implemented according to the contractor.

DK PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ITS ANALYSIS
1.1 Scope of and Method tor Public Participation
In Dec.1997, the EIA group of this project made public surveys in the areas that will be
affected by the proposed highway in Tongshan County, awongyang County and Puqi City. We held
meetings and delivered questionnaires to collect opinions from representatives of NPC (National
People's Congress), people's governments at different levels, social organizations along the
route, and members of the public in the affected area on both sides of the  route. They    also
consulted environmental  protection    organizations,   agricultural  organizations,   forestry
organizations and transportation organizations about environmental protection along the route.
96 peoples took part in the meetings and consultations.
9.2 Statbiscal Result of Public Participation
The hearings along the proposed highway were carried out in Dec. 1997. The issues discussed
(e. g. the impact of noise and air pollution) with the villagers and the opinions from the
participants ( the impacted people ,   social  organizations and  peoples governments along the
proposed highway ) are summarized as follows.
The statistical results of public participation are shown in Table 9-1, the results show:
(l)Concerning government agencies of cities and counties show warm attitudes to this project.
They promise to cooperate in land acquisition and resettlement, also provide convenience for
construction.
(2)Local government agencies along the proposed highway support the recommended scheme.
Among them, government agencies of Tongshan County insists the recommended scheme of Tongshan
section extremely.
(3)Among the investigated people, 77% of the public had understood the highway project, other
23% of the public understood the route alignment and the project through our investigation  and
introduction.
(4)98% of the public hope that it would be built as soon as possible. It can be see that the
public hope the construction of this project would greatly change the present poor transport
situation.
(5) 92% of the people believe that the construction of the highway would be favorable for
local economic development.
(6) As to the requirement about removal and resettlement, 90% of the people hope that they
could be resettled in their own village.
(7) Teachers of the impacted schools ask for construction of surrounding walls to minimize
noise and protect safety of their students.
9.8 Analslys of Public Participation and Solutions to Problemms
(1)Land acquisition and removal: Economic compensation for land acquisition & removal is
strictly based on the regulations of polices. Ensure the compensation be paid practically,   no

otheT usage is permitted. Works of this part for public or individuals should be done carefully
and considerately. It is critical for highway construction.
(2)Resettlement, Resettlement of removed families should be in time & rationally.  Every
family of removal will be asked for its permission before construction. Contractions will be
signed to local governments. Reasonable resettlement as no economic loss, no reducing of living
conditions should be achieved.
From the analysis above, demands and suggestions of public opinions have already becn
considered in highway design stage. Land acquisition, house removal and resettlement during
construction should be implemented gradually and rationally which can be accepted by the local
public. Thus, the unfavorable impact of this construction project can be reduced to a smallest
extent.

In order to know the comcents about the construction of the project and the attitude of the
public toward  the mitigative  measures  in  the  EIA,   publie  hearings  were held  by  the
Environmental Assessment Panel of Xian Highway University and the designers of Hubei Provincial
Coeunication Planning and Design Institute among the masscs concerned. In  short  words,   the
public likely to be affected by the project is in favor of the mitigation measures in the
report of EIA, expressing very high enthusiasm in construction of the  highway.   They  express
their genuine thanks to the World Bank and the Chinese Government for their concerns about the
issues of enviromental protection in the highway construction. The major schools investigated
and villages are: Tongyang No. 3 Primary School, Tongyang Forest Primary School, Tiancheng Sec.
School, Puqi High School, Dalu Village and Hongxia Village, etc.



x   CONCLUSION
10.1  Aa _eent Conclusion of the Preset Envhirment
(1) Farm crops (vegetables) and soil environmental quality along'the route have not polluted
by Pb yet. Organic matters content of soil is met the medium or lower level in the average
level of Hubei Province.
(2) Among the 7 acoustic monitoring spots (villages or schools )   along  the  route, except
Tongyang No.3 Primary School and Tiancheng Middle School, all other spots satisfied pertinent
class in GB3096-93 noise standard. As to these two Schools, for they are locating at a street
side of Tongyang Town or Tiancheng Town, noise from present traffic and trade center has made
the schools beyond standard already.
(3)There are 5 rivers and 1 reservoir in the assessment scope. Among them, water quality of 3
rivers and I reservoir (Tongshan River, Lushui River, Lushui Reservoir) meets Class  I          of
original standard, which is better than the Class I of present excecuting standard (GB3838-88)
. While water quality of other 2 rivers (Fushui River, Baini River) meets Class IV of original
standard, which is a little beyond Class I of present excecuting standard (GB3838- 88),   the
major beyond standard item is organic matter which is caused by organic pollution.
(4) Ambient air quality along the route is quite good, 4 air monitoring spots distributed in
town, village or school all satisfied class 2 in Ambient Air Quality Standard ( GB3095-1996).
10.2  Prediction and Assessmnt Concludon of Environmental Impact
10.2.1 Stages of Design and Construction
(D)The impacts upon the ecological environment during highway construction are the
occupation of farmland, damage to vegetation, and loss  of  water  and    soil.   They  can  be
alleviated if environmental protection  measures  are  undertaken,   such  as  the  reasonable
selection of route alignment, the  timely  recovery  of  farmland  and    the    building    of
Intercepting ditches, retaining walls and settling basins.
(2) As to the impact upon  the  surface  water  environment during  construction, if the EP
administration and education are strengthened, rational construction procedures are adopted  in
bridge construction, and measures are  carried out at toll management stations, the quality  of
surface water will not be obviously polluted.
(3)The impacts upon acoustic and air environmental quality during construction  are   mainly
the noise of construction machinery, dust and  asphalt  smoke  pollution.   The  environmental
quality of sensitive spots, such as villages and schools along the route will not be affected
to a great extent if construction time and locations of asphalt concrete mixing plants are
reasonably arranged and selected.
(4) There is no distribution of rare animals and plants in the assessment area along the
proposed highway, therefore, the construction of it will have no effect on them.
(5) No important historical relics existed in the assessment scope along the proposed highway.
(6) The scheme of the proposed highway is supported by the local governments and most of the
74



people along the route.
(7) The recommended scheme in the Feasibility Study Report has been put forward mainly based
on the consideration of the factors as  local governmnt and  public  opinions,   engineering
investment, and local economic development. Therefore, to mitigate the unfavorable impacts on
the environmental sensitive spots, proper environmental protection measures must be adopted.
10.2.2 OpWato   Stae
(1) Lead content in traffic dust and exhaust gas is the primary reasons caused the impact on
ecological environment during operation stage. However, because of the little aoount of dust
worn on the surface of plants,  and  the  abundant  precipitation,   influence  of  traffic  is
relatively light. According to the prognosis of lead content in soil, in the end of year 2022,
it will still remain a large range between the lead content in soil and the limitation of
standard (calculated by vehicle exhausted lead).
(2) The road surface runoff will have little impact on water quality of the rivers and
reservoir. The slight impact on the whole reservoir can be neglected.            Sewage  of  toll
management station will be treated by septic tank before using in irrigation, which can be a
solution of the surface water pollution problem by waste water utilization
(3) Risk of the transportation of dangerous articles must be pay attention to, especially in
the section of lash reservoir, the protection measures must be implemented.
(4) During the middle operation stage (in year 2010), there will be 10 sensitive spots ( 9
villages and 1 school) beyond the standard, noise proof measures will be necessary.
(6) Exhaust gas from vehicles will reduce the ambient air quality along the route, but the
ambient air quslity of affected area will not surpass the limitation of Class 2 in
"Environmental Air quality Standardf (GB3095-1996).
(6) It is shown in the analysis of the environmental economic loss and benefit that the
social and economic benefit is remarkable to carry on these environmental protection measures
suggested in this EIS.
In brief, the construction project (Tongshan-Chongyang- Puqi Highway of National Highway
Project IV in Hubei Province) will greatly improve the present state  of  transportation,   and
accelerate the economic development of local poverty regions. It will also promote the tourism
of the remote regions of Hubei province. The construotion of the project will result in some
negative environmental effects along the route, such as loss  of  land  resources,   damage  to
vegetation and the reduction of environmental quality, etc. But when corresponding mitigation
measures are taken, the negative effects upon the environment can be alleviated or eliminated.
Therefore, this environmental impact assessment believes  that  the  construction  of  Tongshan
-Chongyang-Puqi Highway of National Highway Project N in Hubei Province is feasible.
