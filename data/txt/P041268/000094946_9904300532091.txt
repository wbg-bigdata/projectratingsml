Preface
The total length of the proposed Dawu-Hongan Highway (Class 2) is 68.959km, including
15.905kn new road, 48.405km innovated road and 4.646km original road. It is a part of the National
Highway Project IV in Hubei Province (World Bank loan project), belonging to the poverty region
helping projects of World Bank loan. According to the negotiate memorandum between WB deputy
group and Hubei Provincial Communication Departmnent (HPCD) in Nov. 1997, also the demand in
Nov. 1997 from WB to compliment the EIA work of Dawu-Hongan Highway, both Chinese &
English versions of EIA & EAP reports should be submitted before Mar.31, 1998. Then in Dec. 1997,
Xian Highway Transportation University has been entrusted by HPCD to undertake the EIA work of
this project. Based on the EIA working principle in this project for assuring quality, simplifying
procedure, and satisfying time limitation, an on-the-spot survey along the proposed highway was done
by the EIA working team from Xian Highway Transportation University in Dec. 1997. The EIS of
this project is compiled according to the working guidance in EIA Outline of National Trunk Line
Project IV. Then revised based on the suggestion of WB.
The present monitoring data used in the statement is provided by Environmental Monitoring
Station of Xiaogan Prefecture, while Meteorological Bureaus of Xiaogan Prefecture, Dawu County
and Hongan County provided the meteorological information. Thanks very much to the conceming
agencies that provided assistance and convenience to the EIA works.

I GENERAL DESCRIPTION
1.1  The Source of the Project and Its Preliminary Work
The Southem Section of the Jingzhu National Trunk Line Project in Hubei Province has been
listed in the WB Loan Projects in commercial year of 1999. According to the arrangement of WB
Loan Highway Projects in China, the Southem Section of the Jingzhu National Trunk Line
Project in Hubei Province is called as the WB Loan National Highway Project IV in Hubei Province.
During the visiting of WB deputy group to Hubei Province (Apr.29-May 8,1996), Communications
Planning and Designing Institute of Hubei Province (CPDIHP) put forward the design of
Dawu-Hongan Highway, in which suggested that the road designing should base on Class 2 highway
standard, and for-it is connected with Northem Section of Jingzhu Line it should join to the National
Project IV as a consisting part. Document [1996]No.198 of HPCD in May 1996 specified the
preliminary working plan of IV Highway scheme in National Project IV. Feasibility study report of
the project was compiled in Apr.1997 by CPDIHP.
During visiting to Hubei Province in Nov.1997, WB deputy group demanded that EIS and EPA
of this road should be compiled. Then in Dec. 1997, Xian Highway Transportation University has
been entrusted by HPCD to undertake the EIA work of this project. From Dec.14 to Dec.26 in 1997,
an on-the-spot survey along the proposed highway was done by the EIA working team from Xian
Highway Transportation University. The first version of EIS was compiled in Mar.1998. Then the
second version of EIS was revised and compiled based on the suggestions of WB experts in July 1998.
Now, this document is the third version of EIS revised and compiled in Dec. 1998.
1.2  Purposes of EIA
Make quantity & quality analysis of the impact of the project by the investigation and assessment
of present natural & social environment along the proposed highway, to attain the following purposes.
(1) To provide basement for rational alignment by prognosis, demonstration and assessment of
the impact scope and extent of the construction project on surrounding environment.
(2) To provide feasible environmental protection measures & suggestions as instructions for
design, construction, and operation management, as to mitigate and eliminate unfavorable impact of
the project, to attain the purpose of the coordinate development of economic construction &
environmental protection.

4.1.5 Analysis of Impact on Scenic Spots, Historical Relics
The area that the proposed highway tuns through has a civilization of longstanding history. In
this area, the scenery is beautiful, and there are many tourism spots. The construction of the proposed
project has both positive and negative effects: On the one hand, the ease of transport can speed up the
development of tourist industry, on the other hand, the building of the highway will damage historical
relics along the route.
According to the discussion with the designing institute and Hubei Provincial Archaeology
Research Institute, there is no important historical relic along the proposed highway. So unfavorable
impact will not be brought by the project to local cultural heritage. However, during construction
stage, excavation should be stopped immediately when a historical relic site is found, and domestic
historical relic management agencies should be informed simultaneously. Excavation is prohibited
before appraisal of the relic site and adoption of protection measures.
4.1.8 Analysis of Impact on Landscape Caused by the Proposed Highway
The construction of the proposed highway will certainly cause damage to part of the natural
landscapes by destroying the vegetation. Especially in Dawu section, although most part of this
section is renovated road, it is located in an hilly area, and the filling and cutting volume of earth and
stone works for subgrade is great, which will surely cause damage to the landscape.
Practical measures must be taken to restore the damaged vegetation. As to the bareness of slopes
caused by earth cutting, trees and grass should be planted to restore the natural landscape.
Afforestation is one of the indispensable measures for enviromnental protection in highway
construction. In addition to the restoration of danaged vegetation and natural landscape, it is
necessary to increase afforestation along the highway, which can improve the landscape and provide
facilities for highway rest areas. This will make the highway blend into natural environment and also
beautify it. Therefore, the land used for highway and highway facilities should be afforested as far as
possible, shrubs, such as coronilla may be planted on the bare slope of earth-cuttings, grass may be
planted on the roadside. In management zones along the route, trees and shrubs should be planted
according to the land feature, buildings and gardens should be designed to beautify the environment.
Apart from the land used for the highway, greenbelts consisted by vegetation should be set up along
the route. to protect the enviromnent and prevent pollution.
In planning stage of the route, apart from being in accordance with the Technical Standards for
Highway Design, the Design Unit for the highway should try to make the route style as beautiful as
possible from the point of view of aesthetics, to make the artificial engineering works be in perfect
harmony with the natural landscape.

4.1.9.2 Impact of Removal
Negative effects are mainly as the follows:
(a) Most of the houses and buildings to be removed along the route are residential houses or
buildings. The residents have been living there for a long time. In resettlement, they must leave their
home and, even though they can be resettled at places not far away, their surroundings will be
changed, for instance, neighboring contacts, water supply and shopping stores, etc. they can not
become accustomed to all the changes in their lives in a short time.
(2) If those people whose houses or buildings have to be removed and who have to be resettled
cannot get the amount of compensation they had expected or be not satisfied with the new houses or
buildings, social instability factor would be increased.
30



4.1.93 Suggestion for Removal and Resettlement
As to the various types of houses or buildings to be removed along the route as shown in Table
4-6, in principle, they should be built 200m away from the both sides of the highway in their own
villages. For complying with the local planning of land used for houses and other buildings,
arrangement work of the removal families should be instructed by the local government which should
be in keeping with the standards for planning of towns and villages and the families should be
compensated.
The problem of removal and resettlement caused by the project can be solved nicely by the
common effort of the construction unit and the local govermnent based on the investigation results of
public participation.
4.1.10 Summary
All in all, the construction of the highway project has good social environment benefits as well
as economic benefits. As to negative effects on the social and economic environments brought about
by the highway construction, namely land acquisition; the interaction of the existing highway;
removal and resettlement; damage of vegetation and landscape; obstruction of residents' contacts, etc.
The construction unit should negotiate with the local governments in the preliminary work for
highway construction and execute the concerning polices strictly. During construction of the highway,
it is necessary to enforcing management of communication, to ensure the normal running of vehicles,
and to eliminate accidents. Generally speak, magnificent social environmental and economic benefits
brought by the project have shown that this project is necessary and feasible.
4.2 Prognosis and Assessment of Impact on Ecological Environment
4.2.1 Prediction and Assessment of Pb Impact on Soil Quality
4.2. 1. lThe Calculation Of Annual Emission Intensity of Pb
The formula is:
F 365P G    NPb,J,
where:
Ji-the average amount of consuming gasoline for type "i" vehicles per km, heavy vehicle
0.41 L/km, middle vehicle 0.27L/kln, small vehicle 0.1 151.km;
Pbi-the Pb content of gasoline used by type "i" vehicle, (the average value is 140mg/L);
'7-the emission ratio in exhaust pipe, generally 75%;
Ni-the daily traffic volume of type "i" vehicle (not including diesel oil vehicles);
P-the precipitation of Pb within the assessment extent on both sides of the proposed highway,
generally is 60%;
G-the mass of soil a kilometer long of cultivated layer on both sides of highway, iss.96X
lO'kg;
i-syrijbolizing heavy, middle and small vehicle.
365-number of days in one year
31



42.1.2 The prediction of lead content in soil
For predicting of the soil quality, the follow forecasting formula for lead (Pb) is used:
~~~~~
W. = Bo + K21 *,K"-
i-1
Where:
Wn-  Accumulated amount of lead in the A layer of the soil in the nth year,(mg/kg);
K -     Residual ratio of lead in the soil ,(%);
Bo-  Background value of lead in the A layer of the soil ,(mg/kg);
Ri      Annual input amount of lead in the soil, (mg/kg.year);
n -    Years of forecasting, (year).
The results are shown in Table 4-7.
From table 4-4, we can learn that the lead content in soil along the route will not exceed the
standard of soil environmental quality after 10 or 20 years during service time. Namely, the
accumulation of lead will not have a damaged effect on soil. And more, because of the promotion of
lead-free gasoline in or country, impact of Pb from traffic exhaust gas will be eliminated.

4.2.2 Prediction and Assessment of Water and Soil Erosion
(I) Prediction Model of Loss of Water and Soil Erosion
According to the geographical location of the proposed highway, and the Environment
Assessment Regulations for Highway issued by MOC, the prediction model of water loss and soil
erosion during construction use the universal formula as follows.
A = R . K  Ls C . P
Where:
A      Erosion strength, (t/km2.year);
R      Erosion factor of average precipitation;
32



K      Soil erodible factor,
Ls- Topography factor, (slope lengtb and slope degree);
C - Vegetation cover factor;
P - Soil conservation factor.
4.2.2.2 Assessment of Impact on Water Loss and Soil Erosion
The value of the factors and the prediction results are shown in Table 4-8.
Table 48              Prediction Result of Soil Erosion
Value of factor         Potential erosion  Current erosion

The results of table 4-8 show that, the water loss and soil erosion caused by construction of this
object will be 2.7 times of the volume than before the potential erosion intensity will attained the level
of the extreme erosion intensity (80-150 t / ha . a) . The construction period of the proposed highway
will last 2 years and go through several rain seasons. In constructing roadbed, 915.799 X 103ml earth
and stone work will be used, damaging the vegetation on surface, changing the original land slope,
interfering with the original stable land surface, so the water loss and soil erosion is unavoidable.
Further more, in initial service time, the vegetation cannot restore to its original state at once.
Therefore, the prevention and cure for water loss and soil erosion during construction can not be
neglected. The construction units should emphasize the vegetation restore work, such as found
protection dam, drainage ditches, retaining walls to stop earth, etc. at the same time building road in
accordance with the requirement of "Water and Soil Conversation Act in PRC", to control the water
loss and soil erosion caused by construction as early as possible. The special facilities of protection
measures are shown in chapter V.
After 3 to 5 years of operation, the water loss and soil erosion caused by construction may
recover to the level of pre-construction, thanks to the improvement of drainage facilities and the
restoration of vegetation, also the improvement of road state and afforestation of roadside, the water
loss and soil erosion along the route will be alleviated. So the sharpening of water loss and soil
erosion during construction is temporary.
4.2.3 Analysis of Impact on Agricultural Production Caused by Earth Borrowing
4.2.3.1 Distribution and Transportation of Construction Materials
Construction materials are abundant in the local areas along the highway. Except for steel, wood
and asphalt (these materials will be transported from Wuhan City), other materials can be satisfied by
local provision.
4.2.3.2 Earth and Stone Work Balance in Construction
The most effective way to mitigate soil erosion is to implement earth and stone balance in
highway construction along the route.
There,ere three ways to get earth for the subgrade:
(1) Use the earth of excavation section for the fill section as much as possible along the route.
33



(2) Combine the work of excavation and the future production sites of provision. For instance,
the borrow pits in the aa of plains and lakes can be used to build fish ponds. And combine the work
of excavation of earth on mountain slopes in hilly areas with the work of building up fields and
leveling land.
(3) For the sections where earth is difficult to get, it is necessary to choose proper borrow areas
to get it
Excavating for earth for the highway construction will have the following negative impacts on
the surrounding ecological environment:
(1) The large quantity of earth and stone needed for the construction and the construetion of three
years will damage the vegetation and landscape and the vegetation will not recover to its original state
in a short time. Thus, sufficient attention should be paid to the unavoidable soil erosion during the
construction of the highway.
(2) Some stone and earth will need to be transported from material sites at some distance during
highway construction and the vehicles transporting them will damage the surrounding vegetation.
Because of the poor conditions of makeshift roads, the raised dust will have an adverse impact on the
neighbouring environment and crops.
(3) Excavating for earth damage the natural land surface and make it not coordinating with
surroundings.
As we can see from above, great attention will have to be paid to the mitigation of soil erosion in
construction.
4.3  Prognosis and Assessment of Impact on Water Environment
The pollution of the water environment during the service period of the proposed highway
mainly comes from rainwater runoff from the road surface, domestic waste water from the service
zone, rest zone, toll station and management zone. The pollution of the water environment during
construction period mainly comes from the domestic waste arising from the constructors, oil-
containing wastewater from machinery operation and construction material such as oil, cement etc.
4.3.1 Prediction and Analysis of Pollution from Road Surface Runoff
The factors that effect the pollution intensity of road surface runoff include rainfall, rainfall time,
the amount of pollutants on road surface related to traffic volume, the level of atmospheric pollution,
the rainfall frequency, the width of road surface, the length of the section, etc. Based on the results of
the investigation and reference infornation, the concentration of pollutants of high-class highway
surface runoff is determined and shown in Table 4-9. As to the Class 2 highway in this project, the
traffic volume in 2020Yr. will be 7000Veh./d, which is 1/3-1/4 of that of the high-class
highway(20000-30000veh.fd). So, the pollutant concentration in runoff of proposed highway will be
1/3-1/4 of the values in Table 4-9 (except for PH).

34



Comparing to the National Highway Trunk Line of Project IV in Hubei Province (Southern
Section of Jingzhu line), we can see:
(1) The impact of surface runoff on water quality of Gaodian River, Xiadian River, and Xidahe
River can be neglected, because of the dilution ability caused by great volume of precipitation and
large flow volume of the rivers.
(2) The impact of surface runoff on water quality of Xinzhai Reservoir is rather small. On one
hand, the large volume of 5818000 m3 made the impact so small that it can be neglected. On the other
hand, there are a 1 00m width slope between the proposed highway and the reservoir, the grass on the
slope provide a land treatment function for the runoff. To ensure the intercept function of the land in
winter, evergreen shrubs should be planted along the roadside.
4.3.2 Impact Analysis of Wastewater in the Toll Management Zones
Based on the Feasibility Study Report two toll management zones are planned along the whole
route. They are located on Baiyun of Dawu County, and Dazhaojia of Hongan County respectively.
The wastewater discharged from these two zones is estimated as follows.
Based on the investigations, staff of the zone is counted as 50 person, 150 L/d.person sewage,
volume of sewage is 7.5m3 everyday. Sewage from the toll management zones must be treated before
being discharged. It is suggested septic tank should be set up to treat the domestic sewage in the zone.
Garbage of the toll management zones should be assembled for treatment
4.3.3 Analysis of Water Pollution during Construction Period
The following factors are the sources that may pollute the water body during the construction
period:
(I) In the process of building large bridges, the digging out of mud from the river or lake and
washing of building materials, such as sand and stones, will muddy the water and thus affect the water
quality of the rivers or lakes. In the process of building large bridges, ships and a large amount of
construction machinery will be used. If the oil-containing drainage from these ships and machinery
flow into the water body it may cause the oil concentration of the water body to exceed the standard.
(2) During the period of construction, if domestic sewage and garbage from builders are not
controlled, then they will be discharged or thrown into the river or the lake and thus pollute the water
body.
(3) The leakage of oils from construction machinery or ships and the dumping of waste oils into
the water body may pollute the water. This should be strictly prevented.
(4) If the building materials, such as asphalt, oils and other chemical substances are not carefully
stored, they might be washed away into the water body in a storm.
All thq above factors may affect the quality of the water body during the construction period. As
it is difficult to make a quantitative prediction of the human factors, it is necessary to strengthen
35



administtion, take measures to prevent, cure and reduce the impact of accidents on the pollution of
the water body.
4.3.4 Risk Analysis of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods
The proposed highway will go along and cross some rivers and lakes. In order to ensure the
protection of the water body during the transportation of dangerous goods, an analysis was made of
the risks.
For the probability of traffic accidents in the transportation of dangerous chemicals, use the
following formula:
P = JQ   =Q1x Q2 xQ3 XQ4 XQ5
i-l
Where:
P-Probability of accident involving chemical dangerous cargoes occurred on road sections
near water body in the predicting year;
Q,-The frequency of serious traffic accident occurred presently on the district that the
proposed highway passes through, (time/million veh.km);
Qi-Traffic volume in the predicting year, (million veh./year);
Q%-Truck percentage, (°/0);
Q4--Chemical dangerous material percentage, (%/o);
Q%-The length of road section near and over water body, (cm)
The value of each factor was determined as follows:
Q1-Reference to the traffic accident rate in local region, Q,=O.15;
Q2-According to the traffic volune prediction, in 2010 Q2=l1.2, in 2020, Q2=2.4
Q3-Reference to the investigation of feasibility study report, Q3=82%;
Q4-Reference to the investigation of feasibility study, when the transport good belong to oils,
Q4=5.35%; as to other dangerous chemical matters, Q4=5.35%;
Q-Determined based on the road section length that pass over rivers or lakes or fishing
ponds,.Q %1.35km;
The prediction results are shown in table 4-10.

2010   ;               0.013                                    0.646
2020                   0.025                                    1.293
36



As shown in Table 4-10, the probability of major traffic accidents that may pollute the water
body during the transportation of dangerous chemicals in the service period of the highway is small.
In 2010 it is 0.013 times per year, while in 2020 it is 0.025 times per year. Even though the
probability is small, accidents may happen. Therefore, during the transportation of dangerous goods in
the service period of the proposed highway, it is necessary to execute certain administrative
measures to prevent them. For specific measures and suggestions, see chapter V and VI.

4.4.2 Environmental Impact Assessment of Traffic Noise
(1) Critical line of traffic noise
According to the prediction results of traffic noise of different road sections, we can figure out
the distance from the road center-line to the point where the traffic noise level equals to the limiting
value of the 4 class standard of GB3096-93 ( daytime 70 dB(A), night 55 dB(A)). The distance are
shown is table 4-14.
39



From table 4-14, we know that in 2000 year the traffic noise level at the areas more than 25m
away from the road center-line can satisfy the category 4 of the assessment standard, in 2010 year the
traffic noise level of the areas more than 43m away from the road center-line can satisfy the category
4 of the assessment standard, and in 2020 year the traffic noise level of the areas more than 64m away
from the road center-line can satisfy the category 4 of the assessment standard.
(2) The impact of traffic noise on sensitive spots
From Table 4-14, we know that in 20 years of operation, the region of more than 64m away from
the road center-line will satisfied the assessment standard. And from design unit of the project, we
know that the buildings located within 64m from the road center-line will be removed and relocated at
the process of land acquisition. So, the impacted objects which will suffer from the traffic noise
pollution are manily the residents houses located at the area from lOm to 64m away from the road
center-line. along the route.
By calculation, The ambient noise level in 2000, 2010 and 2020 year of the sensitive spots and
the comparing results to the stsndard are shown in table 4-15 and table 4-16.

Notes: Foi villages, execute the GB3096-93 standard for Class 4 (daytime 70dB, night 55dB).

We can see from Table 4-15 and 4-16 that, compared to the corresponding limiting value in GB
3096-93standard, the ambient noise at some sensitive spots along the highway will exceed the
standartd. All of the 10 schools exceed the standard. The major reason is most of the schools are built
facing the road or near the road. Some of the present background values has exceed the standard
already. Among the 12 villages, 8 villages exceed the standard. Most of them are the first line house
facing the road beyond standard at night There are altogether more than 35 villages along the
proposed highway. See Appendix . . There are 6 villages beyond standard have not been listed in the
Table 4-16: Caijiawan (K1+350), Fangjiawan (K3+600), Huangjiaqiao (K35+200), Hanjiaduwan
(K46+800), Hejiawan (K48+800), and the Jiaoshi village (K66+000). There are all together 24
sensitive spots beyond standard should be provided noise-proof measures.
4.4.3 Analysis of Impact on Acoustic Environment during Construction
Main sources of noise during construction stage are construction machines and transportation
vehicles. See table 4-17 for their noise levels and attenuation with the distance.
Table 4-17 Noise Level of Major Construcion Machanical Equipment Unit:dB(A)

In the Noise Standards for Construction Sites GB12523-90, the limiting noise value is 75dB
during the daytime and 55 dB at night. It is shown from the noise level in Table 4-17that the standard
distance for the noise of construction machinery at daytime is about 40m, and about ISOm at night.
The noise of construction machinery in the daytime will not affect the environment greatly, but at
night it will. So, it is suggested that the construction should be stopped from 20:00 to 6:00. When the
construction operations have to carry out at night, permition of environmental supervision engineer
should be got in advance, then some noise-reduction measures will be taken like to slow down the
speed and/or forbid to blow horns. All the high noise construction machineries are forbidened to be
operated during nighttime near sensitive spots as villages. If there is a school within 150m of a
construction site, it is necessary to negotiate with the school and adjust the working hours so that
teaching activity will not be greatly affected. Besides, during construction at school sections some
temporary noise-reduction measures such as wooden sound insulating boards will be taken.
It is shown in Table 4-17 that the noise of construction machinery, generally speaking, exceeds
80dB(A), some even exceeds 9OdB(A). According to the Noise Health Standards for Industrial
Enterprises issued by the Minitry of Public Health of Chnia and the General Bureau of Labour, these
noises will affect constructors, especally the operators of construction machinery. It is suggested that
the Construction Unit should reasonably arrange for constructors and their work to protect their health
and pay attention to the maintenance of machinery used for construction so that the noise levels could
be reduced td the lowest extent.. As for those workers who work longer hours near the source of noise,
some measures should be taken to protect their health, such as earplugs, helmets, etc.

4.4.4 Summary
(1) During the service period, the proposed highway will have an obvious negative impact on the
acoustic environment at sensitive spots along the route. Therefore, practical measures for prevention
and control of noise should be taken at sensitive spots where the sound level greatly exceeds the
standard.
(2) The construction work should be anranged at daytime from 6:00 to 22:00, so that it will not
affect the sleep of residents at sensitive spots along the route.
(3) The noise level of construction machinery at places which are about 40m away from the
construction sites can satisfy the standard for Class 4 in GB3096-93. Most of the villages and towns
along the proposed highway are more than 40m away from the centre-line of the highway. Thus,
the noise level of construction machinery in the daytime will not distinctly affect the life of people
living in the towns and villages.
(4) There are many schools along the proposed highway. The construction noise on these
highway sections will greatly affect the teaching activity of these schools. Thus, it is suggested that
the construction unit should negotiate with the school and adjust the time of construction to reduce the
disturbances to teaching activity as far as possible during the construction period.

From table 4-19, we know the prediction results as follows:
1) Dung operation stage, daily average concentration of CO is less than 1.07mglm3 (at
Raojiacha cross-section), which will not surpass the limitatiom of Class 2 standard in GB3095-1996
before 2020Yr (4.00 mg/m3).
2) During operation stage, daily average concentration of NOx is less than 0.054mg/r3 (at
Lingyuan Mid.Sch. cross-section), which will not surpass the limitatiom of Class 2 standard in
GB3095-1996 before 2020Yr (0.054 mg/m3). However, the hourly average concentration may be
increased a lot on the base of the background level.
From the analysis above we can see that the project will have no obvious impact on the
environmental air quality along the highway.
4.5.1.A Assessment on Environmental Air Quality of Sensitive Spots in EIA Scope
Based on the present situation of the environment, traffic volume and local meteology conditions,
statistic information of pollutant concentration on sensitive spots are shown in table 4-20. We can see
that during middle-tern operation stage before 2020Yr. all the daily average concentrations of CO
and NOx will meet the demand of Class 2 standard in GB3095-96. So this highway will not bring
obvious impact on the environmental air quality of sensitive spots along the highway.

4.5.2 Analysis of Impact on Ambient Air Quality during Construction
(1) Pollution of Dust
Major impact on the amnbient air quality during the period of construction is from dust, which is
caused by mixing and transportation of construction materials as concerte and lime.
Monitoring results of TSP in construction stage near mixing plant shown 1.00 mg/m3 of TSP as a
distance of 50 m; 1.65 mg/m3 of TSP as a distance of 100 m; 1.00 mg/m3 of TSP as a distance of 150
m. Therefore, locations of mixing plants should be properly arranged as downwind and more than
300m away from residential spots.
According to the analogical results, sprinkling water at the construction site can reduce 70% of
the dust and obtain a good effect So, it is suggested that during the period of construction, the work
of sprinkling water to the construction sits should be done timely in order to prevent the dust pollution.
Abundant water resources provide a favoable condition for dusr control by sprinkling.
48



(2) Controlling the Pollution of Asphalt Smog
Because of the asphalt concrete used for pavement will be supplied by asphalt concrete mixing
plants set up temporarily with fully closed equipment, the asphalt smog will not bring an obvious
pollution to the ambient air of the construction sites. An attention should be paid to the location of the
plants, which should be chosen in light of the Requirement of Distance Classification for Protection of
Hygiene. The plants should be located at least 300m away from the sensitive spots such as residential
quarters and schools. It is also necessary to point out that open or half-close equipment for asphalt
boiling cannot be used.
4.5.3 Summary
I. Concentrations of TSP, CO and NOx will meet the demand of Class 2 standard in GB3095-96.
So the environmental air quality along the highway is quite good.
2. During operation stage, concentration of CO and NOx along the highway will not surpass the
limitatiom of Class 2 standard in GB3095-1996 before 202OYr (4.00 mg/m3).
3. During operation stage before 202OYr. all the daily average concentrations of CO and NOx
will meet the demand of Class 2 standard in GB3095-96. So this highway will not bring obvious
impact on the environmental air quality of sensitive spots along the highway.
4.Mitigation measures must be adopted for rising dust of transportation in construction, because
it will obviuosly impact local environmental air quality.
49



V MEASURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENGINEERING
5.1   Environmental Protection Measures during Design Period
Alignment of the proposed highway based on the natural environment should be perfected in the
designing stage.
(1) Afforestation at road side and mountain slope protection by various ways for stabilization of
side slope should be considered in design, to prevent soil erosion and beautify highway landscape.
High precipitation of the area along the highway may cause collapse and slope slide directly, therefore,
at sections of large area side slope protection, collecting pipes should be constructed for drainage to
prevent from erosion in flood season.
(2) Alignment scheme should be perfected for being away from villages & schools or less
farmland occupation.
(3) Rational selection for the position of earth borrowing sites and spoil areas, should be
considered. Pay attention to water and soil conservation of earth borrowing sites, the impacts of
dusting and other problems caused to environmental sensitive area (for example, residential regions).
(4) Sensitive spots as cities & towns should be avoided in the highway design.
5.2   Environmental Protection Measures during Construction Period
5.2.1 Measures and Suggestions for Ecological Environmental Protection
(1) During construction, it is necessary to build temporary settling basins to allow mud and sand
to settle at places where rainwater runoff occurs during digging of the subgrade. The average depth of
the settling basin is 0.5m, its scale is deternined in terms of the size of catchment area and its location
in terms of the topography. Earth and cloth fences are placed when necessary near the outlet of the
settling basin. When the highway construction is finished and the culvert pipes laid down, either trees
should be planted on the sites of the settling basins or the area should be reverted to farmland.
(2) It is suggested to limit the working area, to prohibit workers cutting trees out of borrow site.
It is necessary to plant trees in the borrowing area as soon as possible after the excavation has been
completed. Earth will be borrowed from upland areas.
(3) The retaining walls, the drainage ditches, and the work of planting trees and grass should be
constructed checked simultaneously.
(4) During construction, while the land is temporarily using, it will be necessary to remove the
fertile surface soil and stack it nearby. Then after the construction is finished, restore the land to its
previous condition.
so



5.2.2 Measures for Prevention and Control of Noise
(1) It is recommended that the construction unit should arrange for the workers to operate the
machines in turn for reducing the time of bearing excessive noise, pay attention to the maintenance of
the machinery and to keep the noise level of the machinery as low as possible. For the workers
working a longer time near the sound source, earplugs should be provided for them to protect their
hearing.
(2) When the distance between the residential quarters and the construction site is less than 150m,
it is recommended that work be suspended from 20:00 to 06:00 in order to ensure that the residents
have an undisturbed night rest.
(3) For the section near school, the construction unit should negotiate with the teachers about the
time of construction to reduce the disturbance to teaching caused by noise.
5.2.3 Measures for Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution during Construction
(1) It is recommended that bedding plants and lime-soil mixing plants should be set up in open
areas, at least 200m away from residential quarters and schools. Material piling areas should be
covered up or sprinkling to prevent from pollution of dust. Material transportation trucks should be
covered by mufflers.
(2) For prevention and controlling of asphalt smog, the asphalt concrete mixing plant should
locate at least 300m away downwind from the enviromnental sensitive spots such as residential
quarters and schools, etc.
5.2.4 Environmental Protection Measures for Water Pollution
(I) Pollution of river water from bridge construction can be prevented by innovation of
construction procedures. For examples when the flow of a river is rather large, not cofferdam method
but drop shoft sinking should be used in the bridge construction to mitigate the pollution to river.
(2) The domestic sewage, garbage and excrement of workers at construction site should be
concentrated and treated, and cannot be discharged directly into the water body. If domestic sewage in
the areas of construction cannot be connected with the municipal drainage system, it will be necessary
to build dry toilet and septic tanks.
(3) During the construction of bridges, the machinery and ships used should be strictly checked
to prevent the leakage of oil. The waste oil and garbage from construction are not allowed to
discharge into the water body.
(4) It is not proper to pile up construction materials such as asphalt, oil and chemicals at places
near wells for-public use, rivers and lakes in order to prevent them from entering into the water body
when it rains.
51



5.2.5 Communication Dredging & Safety Insurance
1. For this project is a innovation project, communication dredging during construction stage is
very important Construction work along the line should be finished sectional; supervision spots
should be set to ensure fluency of communication and safety of people. Temporary road should be
considered before construction, which should be unblocked even in rainy days.
2. Safety supervision spots should be set at intersections, densely residential regions, sections
near school and village, etc. to ensure safety.
5.2.6   Historical Relics
Excavation should be stopped immediately when a historical relic site is found, and domestic
historical relic management agencies should be informed simultaneously. Excavation is prohibited
before appraisal of the relic site and adoption of protection measures.
5.3 Environmental Protection Measures during Operation Period
5.3.1 Plan for Areas on Both Sides of the Route
The predicted results of traffic noise showed that during the long-term service period (202OYr.)
of the proposed highway, the noise level in the areas more than 64 m away from the road side is lower
than the limiting value of Class 4 in GB3096-93. Therefore, from a long-term point of view, it is
recommended in planning for the areas within 70m on both sides of the highway that residential
quarters not be built, and areas within 200m on both sides of the highway that buildings and units
such as schools and hospitals which have a higher demand for acoustic environment quality not be
built.
5.3.2 Traffic Noise
(I) Set up traffic signs prohibiting the use of horns on the sections where schools are near.
(2) Strengthen traffic management by setting up traffic environmental monitoring stations at the
entrance and exit to the highway and prohibiting old vehicles with higher noise levels to run on the
highway.
(3) For engineering measures for prevention and control of traffic noise and cost estimates, see
Table 5-1. Mitigation measures will be adopted at the sensitive spots beyond standard by 202OYr. The
cost of mitigation measures to traffic noise should be calculated in the land acquisition payment for
local residents.
52



533  Measures for Prevention and Control of Ambient Air Pollution during Operation
(1) Planting Trees by the Roadside
It was reported that the planting of frees can purify and absorb the pollutants from the exaust of
vehicles. The area along the proposed highway is fairly suitable for the growth of trees and shrubs.
Therefore, it is recommended that trees and shrubs be planted in the area near the roadside, especially
in sensitive areas, so that the air pollutants from the exhaust of vehicles can be absorbed, the TSP can
be purified, the environment can be beautified and the landscape along the route can be improved. As
the atmospheric sensitive spots are basically the same as that for acoustic sensitive spots, the measures
for planting trees in these places can produce effects in both two aspects.
(2) Strictly examine vehicle exhausts by selectively sampling at toll stations and vehicles with
exhausts greatly exceeding the standard are not be allowed to run on the highway.
53A  Water Pollution and Potential Risk during Service
(1) Sewage form Dawu and Hongan toll station and management regions should be treated by
septic tanks, then used for irrigation and fertilization, garbage should be assembled and treated.
(2) Cargo vehicles which leak and overloaded vehicles are not allowed by the toll stations to run
on the highway to prevent them from polluting the water body.
(3) For preventing the pollution to water bodies by leakage accidents of dangerous articles,
collision-proof concrete barriers should be set at the road section near Xinzhai reservoir
(K57+700-K58+400).
(4) Certifications from public security, fire control, & transportation agencies must be required
for passing of vehicles carrying dangerous goods. These vehicles should have obvious marks on them,
and should be supervised strictly.
(5) Vehicles carrying dangerous articles should not be permitted running, or should be speed
limited on the icy road and in snowy & smoggy weather.
(6) An emergency leading group consisted by local transportation, fire control, and
enviromnental protection agencies should be organized for dealing with the accidents of dangerous
article transportation in time and scientifically.
5.3.5 Plantation for Beautification
1. Aforestation at villages and schools on both side of the road will beautify the landscape and
improve environmental quality.
2. Planting shrubs & trees at roadside and in the highway management regions to beautify
environmenal landscape.

IN  ALTERNATIVE SCHEMES
The content of this chapter is compiled after consultations and discussions between EIA
working team and highway design unit.
The alignments of alternative schemes are restrained by starting point, ending point and
other controlling points along the line. The section from start point to Huangshanggang is
restrained by buildings of towns and topography, then Changzheng Road of Dawu Towncity is the
only choice of the route; The section from Huangshanggang to Yanjiahe Reservoir passes a
narrow valley between high mountains, alignment of existing road is the only economic and
feasible choice; as to the section from Xiadian to Liuji, the existing road is using conveniently,
and part of the section has attained Class 2 highway standard already. Therefore, two sections of
comparative schemes have been put forward in the alignment of feasibility study stage.
6.1  Alignment of the Comparative Scheme
There are two comparative sections: Xincheng comparative section and Hekou comparative
section, see the appendix map for alignment of comparative sections.
1. Xincheng comparative section (Recommended scheme: K1 8+200-K25+800)
North line scheme: the alignment is along the existing highway. Except the 800m long new
road section built at Xincheng Town (undisturbed by the towncity), there is little change in this
part of section. Advantage: existing highway is utiliied fully; work-ing amount and investment are
reduced; the local government supports this scheme for it will promote the development of
Xicheng Town. Disadvantage: the route line is winding with a low road standard; length of the
line is 1.8km longer, maintaining fee is rather high.
South line scheme: The route diverges the existing highway at Yanjiahe Reservoir, extending
southeastward from the south of the reservoir, toward north of Xinjie, then connects with the
existing highway again. This road section is all new built road with good topography. Advantage:
Road length is 1.8km shorter than the north line scheme; maintaining fee is lower; this scheme is
good to the economic development of Xinjie. Disadvantage: Working amount and investment are
larger; the route line is far away from Xincheng Town, which cause farmland acquisition. Land
acquisition is so difficult that the local government is not enthusiastic to this scheme.
Because this project is an renovated one, the principle is fully utilizing the existing road and
saving investment. Based on the investigation and analysis, the north line scheme is chosen and
be recommended by the feasibility study report.
2. Hekou comparative section (Recommended scheme: K41+498.874-K50+154.452)
North line scheme: The route diverges the existing highway at Zhangjiahe, passes north of
Xinhanjia, south of Hejiadian, passed over Xida River at Dahewan it gets Hejiaduwu, then the
route goes to south of the Jinqiao concrete plant of Xinji Town, connects with the existing
highway there. Advantage: This route is convenient with a shorter length and higher road
standard, which is suitable to the towncity planning of Hekou Town and Shangxinji Town. It is
extremely good to the economic development of this two towns, and the disturbance from
construction is rather moderate. Disadvantage: For the road length is longer, and one more bridge
has to be built in this scheme, the investment is larger.
South libe scheme: The alignment is along the existing highway from Zhangjiahe to Jiaolijia,
from there on it diverges the existing highway, along the foot of Hengshan Mountain the line
56



extending to south of Xujiatian intersected with Huang-Tu line (Huangpi-Tumen), then passes
over Sheshui River, passes north of Xujia and south of Minjiawan, the route connects with
existing highway again at north of the brickyard of Tongnongzui. Advantage: New built road
length is shorter, and there is a bridge no need to be built, so the investment is saved.
Disadvantage: Disadvantage of this scheme is obvious, because total length of the road is 1.54km
longer than the recommended scheme, operation benefit is little, while the maintaining fee is
rather high; The route is far away from Hekou Town, which is unfavorable to the planning and
economic development of Hekou Town and Shangxinji Town, thus the local government disagree
with this scheme; There is a 31an long section of the road in Huangpi County of Wuhan City,
which adds much working amount and scope of management & maintenance, so the
communication divisions of Dawu County strongly demand for giving up this south line scheme;
Another problem is that raw material basement of Jinqiao concrete plant of Shangxinji Town
locates at north of Hekou Town, large volume of raw materials is transported through streets of
Hekou Town, which cause blocking of communication. A bridge will be built in the north line
scheme to solve this problem, however south line scheme cannot solve this problem anyway, and
the bridge on Sheshui River has to be built which cause investment waste.
By comparing, the feasibility study report recommended the north line scheme.
6.2   Comparison of Alternative Schemes
For the comparison of the alternative schemes, see Table 6-1.
6.3   Conclusion
(1) Xincheng comparative section
Advantages of the recommended scheme (North Line Scheme):
a) Although the total length of the recommended scheme is longer than that of the
comparative scheme (South Line Scheme), the road sections in the recommended scheme are all
belong to reconstruction road without new built road section. Therefore, the new land taken by
the recommended scheme is less than the comparative scheme. b) Based on the erosion intensity
predicted in Table 4-8, calculation results show the soil erosion volume during construction
period of the recommended scheme is less than that of the comparative scheme. c) The
recommended scheme is supported by the public opinion. d)The cost of the recommended scheme
is lower than that of the comparative scheme. e) The major engineering working amount of the
recommended scheme is less than that of the comparative scheme.
Disadvantages of the recommended scheme:
a) The number of noise impacted sensitive spots such as villages and schools involved in the
recommended scheme is more than that involved in the comparative scheme. b) The amount of
the removal houses in the recommended scheme is more than that in the comparative scheme.
Trough careful discussion with Hubei Communications Division, the designers, assessment-
makers as well the local governments, with the growth of local economy considered in the first
place, the recommended scheme has been chosen. Therefore, appropriate mitigation measures
will be taken to alleviate the adverse impacts on the environmentally sensitive locations for the
project.
(2) Hekou comparative section
The North Line Scheme of Hekou comparative section is the recommended scheme put
forward by the construction feasibility study report, while the South Line Scheme is the
comparative scheme. From the aspects of land taken, house removal, soil erosion, number of
sensitive spots, and construction cost, the North Line Scheme is inferior to the South Line
Scheme. However, the South Line Scheme exists these following major disadvantages:
a) Total route length of the South Line Scheme is 1.5km longer than that of the North Line
Scheme. b)he South Line Scheme is strongly opposed by the local government. c) The route
length passes another county-Huangpi County besides Hongan County and Dawu County is
57



only 3km, which will bring about a lot of management difficulties during construction and
operation periods. d) The raw material basement of Jinqiao concrete plant of Shangxinji Town
locates at north of Hekou Town, large volume of raw materials is transported through streets of
Hekou Town, which cause blocking of communication. A bridge will be built in the North Line
Scheme to solve this problem, however South Line Scheme cannot solve this problem anyway,
and the bridge on Sheshui River has to be built which cause investment waste.
Trough careful discussion with Hubei Communications Division, the designers, assessment-
makers as well the local governments, with the growth of local economy considered in the first
place, the recommended scheme has been chosen. Therefore, appropriate mitigation measures
will be taken to alleviate the adverse impacts on the environmentally sensitive locations for the
project.

7.1.3 Comparison of Environmental Protection Costs and Project Costs
The estimated total cost of this construction project is 181,569,200 yuan. The lump-sum cost of
environmental protection is 2,485,000yuan. Yearly operation cost of environmental protection is
1,775,000 yuan. Environmental protection investment of the whole project takes 2.3% of the total
investment in this project Which shows that the cost of environmental protection is not a major part
in the total investment of this project, and the enviromnental pollution of this project is not serious.
7.2   Analysis of Environmental Economic Loss and Benefit
7.2.1 Analysis of the Benefit of Enviromnental Protection Investment
During operation of the highway, vehicle exhausts will pollute the atmospheric and water
environment; dust and noise will impact on the environmental quality in residential areas. The health
of people living on both sides of the highway will be affected to some extent and the normal life and
work of these people will be affected as well. Therefore, practical environmental protection measures
must be taken, such as sound proof measures and plantation along the road sections near sensitive
spots to reduce the negative effects caused by traffic on the environment. After taking environmental
protection measures, the economic loss will be retrieved each year (equal to the direct economic
benefit of environmental protection), including the net output value lost because of workers illness
caused by traffic noise and atmospheric pollution; the medical expenditure on illness caused by
pollution; the devaluation in real estate in polluted sections; the loss of means of production and
livelihood, etc, when environmental protection measures are not taken.
If no effective environmental protection measures were taken along the proposed highway,
there would be some indirect negative effects, such as the reduction of the quality of teaching and the
quality of life, the agitation of people and social instability factors, etc. in the affected areas.
Therefore, after some environmental protection measures being taken, the negative effects mentioned
above will noi arise and be replaced by positive benefits as a result of this environmental protection
investment.

7.2.2 Analysis of the Economic Loss & Benefit of Environmental Impact
The following formula is used to analyze the economic loss and benefit of the environmental
protection measures.
zSI
Ei = 1-1
-~ ~~ '    H
H
Where
E-     economic benefit of environmental protection expenditure
S; -     economic loss that can be retrieved each year after environmental protection measures
are taken
H      expenditure of environmental protection investment per year
By calculation method mentioned above, we know that after effective environmental protection
measures are taken, the economic loss retrieved per year will be 250,000 yuan, and there will be
numerous uncountable indirect economic and social benefits. The expenditure used for environment
protection yearly average is 213,000 yuan and the economic benefit for enviromnent protection each
year is E, =1.17, Which illustrates that the investment of environment protection is reasonable. Thus,
it is of great importance to execute the environmental protection measures suggested in the EIA when
building the highway. The construction unit should take environmental protection measures step by
step as suggested in the assessment to ensure the coordinate and sustainable development of
construction and environmental protection.

8.2   Environmental Monitoring Plan
8.2.1 Monitoring Purpose
The environmental impact during construction stage mainly includes river water pollution caused
by construction of bridge; noise from construction machines, soil erosion caused by earth and stone
cutting & filling, flying dust and asphalt smoke from the mixing plants, and other pollution. During
operation stage, the impact on environment is mainly by traffic exhausting gas, flying dust, and noise,
serious pollution caused by emergent accident. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the
environmental situations and development trend to improve environmental management in
implementation of monitoring plan.
8.2.2 Monitoring Agencies
Environmental monitoring work in construction & operation is in charged by Hubei Provincial
Highway Environmental Monitoring Unit. This agency has been organized in project DI already. The
monitoring work of proposed highway is also taken care by it.
8.2.3 Monitoring Plan
The routine monitoring work is undertaken by the Hubei Provincial Highway Environmental
Monitoring Unit. See (1) - (3) in monitoring plan of table 8-3.
In the implementation of monitoring plan, the problems as monitoring method, purpose, staff
training, etc. should be determined by the monitoring unit under HPCD and the entrusted unit together.
The monitoring plan will be implemented according to the contractor.
8.2.4 Monitoring Equipment, Cost and Report Institutional Arrangement
Monitoring equipment in project III can be used in this project too, no acquisition for new
equipment.
Monitoring cost during construction: 30,000yuan/year X 3year= 90,000 yuan;
During operation: 15,000yuan/year X 20year= 300,000 yuan;
Contingent accident monitoring cost (unforeseen): 30,000 yuan.
Monitoring report institutional arrangement is shown in Figure 8-2.
8.2.5 Enviromnental Protection Staff Training
For the proposed highway is Class 2 highway, abroad training will not be arranged. Staff training
in our country includes environmental management, environmental monitoring exports(the same
people for project III), and emergency dealing experts; who can be trained simultaneously in their
professional works. National training environmental management expert are: 10 persons of
environmental protection experts, 2 persons of enviromnental supervision engineers, 4 persons of
emergency dealing experts (environmental monitoring experts are same people in project E),
altogether 16 person-times, 2 weeks every time. Total cost for training is 90,000yuan. See table 8-4.

DC  PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
9.1 Scope of and Method for Publie Participation
In Dec.1997, the EIA group of this project made public surveys in the areas that will be affected
by the proposed highway in Dawu County and Hongan County. We held meetings and delivered
questionnaires to collect opinions from representatives of NPC (National People's Congress), people's
govermnents at different levels, social organizations along the route, and members of the public in the
affected area on both sides of the route. They also consulted environmental protection organizations,
agricultural organizations, forestry organizations and transportation organizations about
environmental protection along the route. More than 80 peoples took part in the meetings and
consultations, 22 questionnaires were collected.
9.2  Statistic Results of Public Participation
The hearing along the road were carried out in Dec. 1997. The issues discussed (e.g. the impact
of noise and air pollution, social disruption caused by the expressway, restricted access to the highway,
etc. ) with the villagers and the opinions from the participants (the impacted people, social
organizations and peoples govenmments along the proposed highway) are summarized as follows.
The statistical results of public participation are shown in Table 9-i.
(I) Concerning government agencies of cities and counties show warm attitudes to this project.
They promise to cooperate in land acquisition and resettlement, also provide convenience for
construction.
(2) Local government agencies along the proposed highway support the recommended scheme.
(3) Among the investigated people, 90% of the public had understood the highway project, other
10% of the public understood the route alignment and the project through our investigation and
introduction.
(4) 82% of the public hope that it would be built as soon as possible. It can be see that the public
hope the construction of this project would greatly change the present poor transport situation.
(5) 91% of the people believe that the construction of the highway would be favorable for local
economic development.
(6) As to the requirement about removal and resettlement, 82% of the people hope that they
could be resettled in their own village.
(7) Teachers of the impacted schools ask for construction of surrounding walls to minimize noise
and protect safety of their students.
9.3  Solutions to Problems from Public Participation
(1) Land acquisition and removal: Economic compensation for land acquisition & removal is
strictly based on the regulations of polices. Ensure the compensation be paid practically, no other
usage is permitted. Works of this part for public or individuals should be done carefully and
considerately. It is critical for highway construction.
(2) Resettlement: Resettlement of removed families should be in time & rationally. Every family
of removal will be asked for its permission before construction. Contractions will be signed to local
governments. Reasonable resettlement as no economic loss, no reducing of living conditions should
be achieved,
From the analysis above, demands and suggestions of public opinions have already been
73



considered in highway design stage. Land acquisition, house remnoval and resettlement during
construction should be implemented gradually and rationally which the local public can accept. Thus,
the unfavorable impact of this construction project can be reduced to a smallest extent.

Situations and conditions  88 questionnaires were collected. The investigated persons including 16 workers, 24
Situatons and condtions    teachers, 12 cadTes, and 36 farmers. Education levels among them include I university
of the  investigated  graduated level, 24 university under graduated or high school graduated level, 20 middle
etsofls                                        school level.
In order to know the comments about the construction of the project and the attitude of the public
toward the mitigative measures in the EIA, public hearings were held by the Environmental
Assessment Panel of Xian Highway University and the designers of Hubei Highway Design Institute
among the masses concemed. In short words, the public likely to be affected by the project is in favor
of the mitigation measures in the report of EIA, expressing very high enthusiasm in construction of
the highway as one of the state key projects. We express our genuine thanks to the World Bank and
the Chinese Government for their concerns about the issues of envirornental protection in the
highway construction. The major schools investigated and villages are: Lingyuan Primary School,
Huanggang Primary School, Diangang Primary School, Huangshanggang Village, Chenjiawan Village,
etc.

X CONCLUSION
Based on the results of environmental impact assessment, following conclusions are reached:
10.1   Assessment Conclusion of the Present Environment
(1) Farm crops (vegetables) and soil environmental quality along the route have not polluted by
Pb yet. Organic matters content of soil have met the medium or lower level in the average level of
Hubei Province.
(2) Among the 7 acoustic monitoring spots (villages or schools) along the route, except 3 schools,
all other spots satisfied class 2, GB3096-93 noise standard.
(3)There are 4 rivers and I reservoir in the assessment scope. Water quality meets Class I or
Class II of present water quality standard, which is rather good.
(4) Ambient air quality along the route is quite good, 4 air monitoring spots distributed in town,
village or school all satisfied class 2 in Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996).
10.2 Prognosis and Assessment Conclusion of Environmental Impact
10.2.1 Stages of Design and Construction
(1) The impacts upon the ecological environment during highway construction are the
occupation of farrnland, damage to vegetation, and loss of water and soil. They can be alleviated if
environmental protection measures are undertaken, such as the reasonable selection of route
alignment, the timely recovery of farmland and the building of intercepting ditches, retaining walls
and settling basins.
(2) As to the impact upon the surface water environment during construction, if the EP
administration and education are strengthened, rational construction procedures are adopted in bridge
construction, and measures are carried out at toll management stations, the quality of surface water
will not be obviously polluted.
(3) The impacts upon acoustic and air environmental quality during construction are mainly the
noise of construction machinery, dust and asphalt smoke pollution. The environmental quality of
sensitive spots, such as villages and schools along the route will not be affected to a great extent if
construction time and locations of asphalt concrete mixing plants are reasonably arratnged and
selected.
(4) There is no distribution of rare'animals and plants in the assessment area along the proposed
highway, therefore, the construction of it will have no effect on them.
(5) No important historical relic has been found in the assessment scope along the proposed
highway.
(6) The scheme of the proposed highway is supported by the local governments and most of the
people along the route.
(7) Thbalignment has been recommended on the basis of comments of the local governments
and the masses, investment cost as well as whether or not beneficial for growth of the local economy.
Therefore, appropriate mitigation measures should be incorporated in the project.
75



(8) During construction stage, operation of existing roads will be impacted seriously, mitigation
measures, as sectional construction, transport and communication organization will be adopted.
10.2.2 Operation Stage
(1) Lead content in traffic dust and exhaust gas is the primary reasons caused the impact on
ecological environment during operation stage. However, because of the little amount of dust worn on
the surface of plants, and the abundant precipitation, influence of traffic is relatively light. According
to the prognosis of lead content in soil, in the end of year 2020, it will still remain a large range
between the lead content in soil and the limitation of standard (calculated by vehicle exhausted lead).
(2) The road surface runoff will have little impact on water quality of the rivers and reservoir.
The slight impact on the whole reservoir can be neglected. Sewage of toll management station will be
treated by septic tank before using in irrigation, which can be a solution of the surface water pollution
problem by waste water utilization .
(3) Risk of the transportation of dangerous articles must be pay attention to, especially in the
section of Xinzhai reservoir, the protection measures must be implemented.
(4) During the far-term operation stage (in year 2020), there will be 18 sensitive spots (8 villages
and 10 school) beyond the standard, noise proof measures will be necessary.
(5) Exhaust gas from vehicles will reduce the ambient air quality along the route, but the ambient
air quality of affected area will not surpass the limitation of Class 2 in "Environmental Air quality
Standard" (GB3095-1996).
(6) It is shown in the analysis of the environmental economic loss and benefit that the social and
economic benefit is remarkable to carry on these environmental protection measures suggested in this
EIS.
In brief, the construction project (Dawu-Hongan Highway of National Highway Project IV in
Hubei Province) will greatly improve the present state of transportation, and accelerate the economic
development of local poverty regions. It will also promote the tourism of the remote regions of Hubei
province. Most part of this highway construction project utilizes the original road, so some negative
environmental effects from construction along the route are mitigated, such as loss of land resources,
damage to vegetation and the reduction of environmental quality, etc. Therefore, this environmental
impact assessment believes that the construction of Dawu-Hongan Highway of National Highway
Project IV in Hubei Province is feasible.
