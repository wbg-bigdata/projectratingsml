Preface
The Beijiag-Zhuhai National Trunk Highway ( mely Ihe Jingphu Line ) is an important part
of the proposed Two Vertical National Trunk highways and Two   Horizontal National   Trunk
highways. With the regression  of Hongkong in 1997 and Macso in 1999 to their motherland,   it
will be one of the wain lines to the border ports of China.
Situated in the central part of China, the Jingzhu line will cross Beijing  city,   Hebei
Province, Emna Province, Bubei Province, Hunan Province and Guandong Province, connecting some
iaportant cities, such as Beijing City, Shijiazhuang City, Zhenzhou City, Wuhan City, Changsha
City ,Guangzhou City and Zhubai City. Also it will connect Shenshen, Rongkong and Macao . The
area that the Line passes is one of the aost economically developed areas in China. The
construction of the project is of great significance. to the national economy and social
development.
The National Highway Project IV in Hubei Province, namely the Southern Section    in  Eubei
Province of the Jingzhu Line is one of the 4 high- class trunk highways in Hubei Province
planned by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Department of Comunication.
The proposed highway, referring to the recommended scheme of project IV (Zianning SchemeI),
is about 109. 815Km long. The estimated investment is 3908. 015 million  yuan  (1MB)   .  This
project belongs to  category A and an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment )  should  be made
according to the TOR of the project.
Xian Highway Transportation  University  was  entrusted  by  the BMCD  (  Communications
Department of Hubei Province ) in Apr. 1994 to undertake the EIA of the Southern Section
Project in Hubei Province of Jingzhu Line. A team was formed in Apr. 1994 for making the EIA,
and a field survey along the proposed highway was done in May,1994. A TOR for the ZIA had been
compiled by Jun. 1994 and approved by NEPA (the National Environmental Protection Agency) in Jul.
1994. The first version of EIS ( Statement of the ZIA ) had been compiled by Apr. 1995 in the
light of the TOR and the Feasibility Study  Report of  the  project completed by CPDIHP
Communication Planning and Designing Institute of Hubei Province) in Aug. 1994. In that EIS,
the total length of the recommended scheme ( Xianning Scheme E1) is 112.73 k.
In May 1996, a newer feasibility study report of the project was completed by CPDIHP based
on the requirement for the loan project of World Bank, in which 4.498km road section used both
by Jingzhu Line and Hurong Line was cut out and included in No. DI World Bank Loan Application
Project. So , a newer EIS (The Second Version) was made in October 1996 according to the newer
feasibility  study report (May,1996)   and  the  'ZIA  Pattern  and Requirement for the Loan
Project of the International Financial Organizations' (issued by NEPA).
The second version of EIS (Oct. 1996) was based on Xianning Scheoell. In Mar. 1998, based on
the suggestion of World Bank and the consideration of environmental problems, CPDIHP compiled
another version of feasibility study report (Mar. 1998), in which the Xianning Scheme I   was
decided as the recommended scheme. The third version of EIS (Mar.1998) was compiled based
on the feasibility study report (Mar.1998). Then, according to the suggestion of NB,  the  forth
version of BIS (Jul.1998) was finished. Now, after the pre-assessment of the project by World
Bank experts in Nov. 1998 and Jan. 1999, this newest version of ZIA report is compiled  following
the suggestions from World Bank experts and the newest feasibility study report ( revised
version in June 1998 by CPDIHP).  In this report of ZIA, the stations and names of sensitive



locatios have been identified based an the latest 1: 2000 initial design drawings.
The present onitring data used in the statemet is provided by hviroetal Mloitoring
Station of liaming Prefecture, Hubei Province, Hubei Meteorological Bureau sad Comnication
Planning & Desigping Institute of Hubei Province.

I  GENERAL DESCRPTION
1.1 The Source of the Project and Its Preliminary Work
1.1.1 Tne Source of the Project
Being  an artery of the national   econOmy  ,  transportation  directly  influences the
development of economy in China. To meet the requirements of reform and  opening   to    the
outside   world,  the  construction    of traffic  infrastructures  is put above all other
constructions by Chinese government.
The Beijing-Zhuhai National Trunk Highway is the most important component part of two
vertical national trunk highways and two horizontal national trunk highways in ChirnL The MOC
(Ministry of Comunications)  has classified it as a major project which    will be open to
traffic in 2002.
The National Highway Project IV in Hubei Province, namely the Southern Section Project in
Hubei Province of the Jingzhu Line is the most important component part of the Beijing- Zhuhai
National Trunk Highway.  According to  the   general arrangement made by  the Ministry of
Communications , the proposed project (the Southern Section Project in Hubei Province of the
Jingzhu Line) was listed as one of the main constructive projects in the preliminary work plan
for capital construction from 1993 to 1995 by the IPCD (the Comunications Department of Hubei
Province). According to the task given by EPCD, the CPDIHP ( the Counications Planning  and
Designing Institute of Hubei Province) compiled the prefeasibility study report of the project
in Aug. 1994 For keeping the harmonious development of economic construction and environment
protection, Xian Highway Transportation University was entrusted by the HPCD  in Apr. 1994 to
undertake the HIA of the project.
1.1.2 Preliminary Work
In Feb. 1994, the "Prefeasibility Study Report on The Southern Section Project in Hubei
Province of the Jingzhu Line' was completed by the CPDIHP.  In  Apr.  1994,  the  'Report on
Construction of The Southern Section Project in Hubei Province of the Jingzhu Line I was
submitted to the State Planning Committee and MOC by Hubei Planning Committee and IEPMD. In Aug.
1994, the CPDIHP finished the compiling work of feasibility study report on the project.
The EIA started in Apr. 1994. In Jun. the same year, the TOR for the EIA was completed by
Xian Highway Transportation University and reported to the higher authority by the EPOD. In Jul
.1994, the Environment Protection Office of MOC asked some experts for advice about the TO.  In
July, the TOR was approved by the NEPA in the Document No. 184 (1994). Based on the TOR and the
reply from the NEPA, the earliest version of ZIA was completed in Apr.1995 (The First Version).
In May 1996, a newer feasibility study report of the project was completed by CPDIHP based
on the requirement for the loan project of World Bank, in which 4.498km road section used both
by Jingzhu Line and Burong Line was cut out and included in No. m World Bank Loan Application
Project. So , a newer EIS (The Second Version) was made in October 1996 according to the newer
feasibility  study report (May 1996)  and  the  'ZIA  Pattern  and   Requirement   for the
Loan Project of the International Financial Organizations' (issued by NEPA).
The second version of EIS (Oct. 1996) was based on Xianning SchemelI. In Mar. 1998, based on
1



the suggestion of World Bank and the consideration of environmental problem, CPDIIP compiled
another version of feasibility *tudy report (ar. 1998), in which the lianning  Scheme I   was
decided as the recomended scheme The third version of 1IS (Mar. 1998) was compiled based
on the feaibility study report (iar. 1998). Then, according to the uggestion of WB, the forth
version of NIS (Jul. 1998) was finished. Now, after the pre-asseesment of the project by World
lank experts in Nov. 1998 and Jan. 1999, this newest version of ZIA report is compiled following
the suggestions from World Bank experts and the newest feasibility  study  report  ( revised
version in June 1998 by CPDIEP). In this report of IA, the stations and names of sensitive
locations have been identified based on the latest 1: 2000 initial design drawings.
1.2 Purposes of ELA
The purpose of the LIA on the southern section in Hubei province of the   Jingzhu National
Trunk Highway  is  to  determine the  feasibility  of the project from  the point of view
of the protection of the natural and social environment, prove the favorable  and unfavorable
impact upon the surrounding environment caused by the project  ,  put forward measures and
methods for the environment protection so that the unfavorable impact could be controlled
or decreased to the least degree, and make the  harmonious   development   of   economic
construction  and environmt protection, by way of investigation and assessment   of   the
natural,  social and economic environment along the proposed highway, and   the    forecast
and assessment of the impact extent on the surrounding environment during the  construction
period and the service period of the highway.

m  CURRENT SITUATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
L.2 Natural Environment
8.1.1 Geographical Location and Terrain
Geographically, the proposed Jing-Zhu National Trunk Line in Hubei Province is located on
the south bank of the Changjiang River of its middle reaches. The terrain through which the
projected highway passes is described as one with raised lands on the edge of  the   Jianghan
Plain with hills and low mountains.
The terrain in this area rises from northwest to southeast with its western part terminating
at the edge of Jianghan Plain. The geographical structure is mainly of alluvial plain with an
elevation of less than 500 meters above sea level. The terrain is gentle with many lakes. Its
central part belongs to hilly structure with an elevation under 50 meters above seal level
where there are broad alluvial flats. Its southeastern part ends at the north slope of Mufu
Mountain falling into medium-low mountainous terrain with faulty basins between valleys under
500 meters above sea level.
3.1.2 Meteorology and Water Regimes
(1) Climate
The planned project is located in the medium and low latitude belonging to the tropical
continental monsoon climate with four clearly-divided seasons, long frost-free periods, plenty
of sunshine and abundant rainfall, The climate along the proposed route is peculiar because of
different topography, lake regimes, cold lakes in the low  lands and    mountain  effect.  The
features of the climate are: in the spring, the weather is changeable and the temperature rises
up sharply with lots of cold rainy days; in  the  summer,  however,   it  is  temperate  with
increasing amount of rainfall. The so-called 'plum rains' take place very often, which,sometimes
leads to floods; in summer, it  is  scorchingly  hot with  dry  winds;   in  the  autumn, the
temperature goes down quickly. It is often clear without much rain, in the winter, it is cold
with strong winds and snowstorms resulting in freeze injuries.
(2) Temperature
The annual average temperature in the study section is 15 C- 1  C  with  January    being
the coldest with the temperature of 2 C-5 6C). The extreme low temperature was -18.1 «C (Feb. 1
1977). The frost-free period amounts to 230- 260  days.   There  have been  records  that the
Hanjiang River and The Changjiang River were frozen. July and August are the two hottest months
with  an  average monthly temperature being 29 C. During this period   it   is   hot
17



with a relative hmidity of 80%. In the midsumer, the highest temperature may reach as high as
41.3 SC (in 1934). Therefore, it got the nane of 'heating stove".
(3) Precipitation
The rainfall in this area is plentiful with a precipitation of 1100- 145m mainly
concentrated in April - October taking up about 84%-88% of the annual amount. The maximum hourly
rainfall r'ecorded was 413.4m (Xingou Hydrolic Station'data, June 9, 1959).  Subsequently,   it
sometimes causes flood. Generally, it rains more in the south than in the north as the
Iatitude decreases with the isolate of the precipitation distributed latitudinal. The rainfall,
however, varies in different areas and in different years with a maximum rainfall of 2262. 0m and
the minimum of 657.1m  , which shows great annual rainfall difference. The seasonal rainfall  is
uneven too. The rainfall in the sumer runs into as great as 430-530mm making up 36%-45% of the
whole year's; the rainfall in the spring is 330-490m making up 29%.36% of the total;  in  the
fall, however, it rains not very often with a rainfall of 180-240mm making up 17%. 19% of the
total; in the winter it rains seldom, making up 8%-11% of the whole year's amount.
(4) Wind
The greatest recorded velocity in the study area was 29.6./s (January 27, 1967) . The wind
direction is mainly northwest, and the greatest wind force was 6. Strong winds, in most cases,
in April, but in September and October there are much less strong winds.   The   south    wind
dominates in June and July with the other seasons dominated by the north one.   Every year  in
June and July there is always a period of Nanyang wind (the wind from the south  coast)  which
lasts as long as more than 10 days. The recorded  meteorological data  and  'wind  rose'  from
Jiangxia, Xianning and Puqi involved in the project are shown in Fig. 1. It is  seen  that   in
Jiangsia, Xianning and Puqi north wind is dominant with the frequency of southeast wind,
northeast wind and other leading wind direction accounting for 11,. 10%, and 10% respectively.
The  frequency of calm wind in these three areas is 23%, 20% and 32%  individually.    Fig.   3
shows noticeable seasonal wind directions in these weather stations. Fig. 3 is the 5- year
average wind rose of the three stations.
On the basis of the data recorded in recent 32 years about the surface wind at Jiangxia,
Xianning and Puqi, the mean wind velocity at these stations measured are 2.6mls, 2.2m/s and 1
.Smls.
(5) Atmospheric Stability
Table 3 shows the atmospheric stability frequency in the study area based on the data
collected about surface wind and cloud amount by using Pasquil Stability Method ( P. O) . The
average annual stability frequency is seen in Table 3. It is apparent that the neutral weather
(D type stability) appears the most (41-54%) followed by the frequency of the stable weather ( E
-F types) which appears 17. 0-27. 5'% While the frequency of the unstable weather (A-B and C types)
appears much less (16.0-18.1 and 12.6% respectively).

3.1.8 Rhier Regbmes
In the area where the projected alignpent is located there are plenty of surface water
coming from rivers, lakes, reservoirs. The major rivers and lakes involved are the Jinshui
river and its branches, the Lushui River, Lu Lake, Futou lake, Xiliang lake and some others
which are abundant in runoff and passing water. On the other hand, because of the low terrain,
these areas are often stricken by floods.
(1)Ganhe liver
Ganhe River derives from Menlou Village in Wanjia Township of Tongshan County, where is at
the foot of Dnushan Moutain. It passes Baishansi, Baishaqiao, Wenquan, Yongan, Zitan and Yaozui,
then runs into Futou Lake in the end. Total length of the river is 73.6 KE, with an elevation
of 789m at riverbead, and an elevation of 18m at outlet. Average precipitation ratio of the
river is 1.36%  There are altogether twelve tributaries joined with the river,   which  have  a
total length of 25. 97Km, Thus, the river is limpid and rich in waterpower  resources.   At  the
position passed over by the proposed expressway, the water flows gently and windingly,  with  a
broad surface (40-50m width) and a silt formed riverbed. The rain bear area of Ganhe  River  is
809.4Km2, which is 54% that of lianning Region. The Yearly average water level is 22. 9w,   and
the average  flow volume is 16. 6mls.The average flow volume of January is the least, which is
5.1 els, while the average flow volume of June is the largest, which  is 352m g Is,   Maximum
velocity is 2. 83m/s (in 1969). Minimum velocity is 0. 016m/s (in 1984) .   Yearly  maximum  silt
discharge is 106,000 ton, minimum silt discharge is 49,9000 ton, and average silt discharge
is 83, OOOton. Average silt-carrying capacity of the river water is 10.11kg/ms.
(2) Jinshui River
The Jinshui River derives in the Damushan Mountain in Tongshan County. It flows from the
southeast to northwest via Tongshan County, Xianning City and Jiangxia District, and runs into
the Changjang River at Jinkou Town. The total length is 144km. Its drainage area is 2539 km2.
In the upper reaches , the width of the river course various greatly and the water flow is small.
In the lower reaches, it has a flat and slow stream. The river bed is steady. The river course
runs in a winding way because of the long time water erosion. When the water level reaches 18 3
m, the river width is 60m, the depth is 71. When the water level reaches 24 m, the river width
is 90 m. When the water level reaches 15 m, the river width is 50 m. The maximum flow is 370Mw
/s  in the flood season.  But it has a small flow in  the  dry  season.       According    to  the
information from Jinshui Floodgate Hydrological Station, the yearly average discharge is 16,800
.000,000 ml, flow volume is 56-100m'/s, the flow is influenced by the water level of the
Changjang  River. In the comparative scheme -    Xianning Scheme ]I, the expressway will pass over
Jinshui River for three times.
(3) Tingsi River
Tingsi River located in the western part of Xianning City, derived from the southern foot of
Shangsian Mountain at Huangshafan in Puqi City, accepted water from Niejia Port, liwan Port and
Gutangjiao Port, extending northwards windingly. In the end, it runs into Xiliang Lake at
Dengjiawan in Junshan Village of Gantang Township. Total length of the river is 27.6km. Overall
drop of the river is 108m Drainage area of the river is 68.17km2, when the water level is
normal, river section in the middle reaches, is 30-40m wide, average depth of water is 0. 5m,
and flow volume is 2ml/s. At the position passed by the proposed expressway, average width of
the river course is about 50w, with abundant and limpid water, where is famous for carp and
23



silver carp.
(4) The Lishui liver
lising from the north slope of ufu Mountains on the border between Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi
Provinces, the river passes through Tongoheng, Chongyang, Puqi and Jiayu cities or counties. The
flow of the river varies greatly with the maximum of 2. 900 cube meters per second and the
minimum of 1.4 cube meters -per second. Floods usually happen in May and June. The Lushui liver
finally joins in the Changjiang River. Its total length is 208 km with a width of about 100 a.
(5)  The Xiliang Lake and Futou Lake Regimes
Both lakes are of natural and fresh water lakes connected to the Changjiang River. Originally,
the two lakes used to be one water body. Owing to the drop of the water  level,   Gantang  Land
appeared, which divided these two lakes called Futou Lake and Xiliang Lake.
The Putou Lake is located at northern latitude 29e 56'-30 07' and eastern longitude 114' 10'
-114- 15'. The rain bearing area is 1.238 square km with a normal water area of 324.000 mu and  a
meam depth of 4 meters. The width from east to west is 9 km and the length from south to north
is 18 km. The highest water level is 23.9 m and the lowest one is 19.11 m.
The Xiliang Lake is located at northern latitude 29° 51'- 30° 02' and eastern longitude
1140 00-114° 10'. The rain bearing area is 827 square km. The water area during the normal water
level (22.5m) is 120.000 mu with a relevant capacity of 3.12 hundred million cube meters.   The
average depth is 4 meters.
In both of the lakes there are artificial aquatic farms yielding carp and silver carp. The
Lu Lake is one part of the Xiliang Lake and Futou Lake system connected by the River Jinshui.
The water area is 11.05 square km when the depth is 18 meters Its capacity is 5. 525 million
cube meters. Its water area is 92. 39 square km when the depth is 25 meters with a capacity of
430.359 million cube meters The highest level reached 24.29 meters in 1969.
The main function of the water bodies mentioned serve as aquatic farming, water storage and
irrigation
3.1.4 Hydrogeology
The study area has plentiful rainfall and developed surface water regime and various kinds of
ground water
The underground water of the 1st and 2nd terrace of the Changjiang River belongs to the
loose deposited rock water The rock of the water-bearing stratum is sandy rock and grit rock.
The general thickness is more than 10 metres. The underground water is pressure-bearing and the
water level is 3-8 metres beneath the earth surface.
3.1.5 Vegetation
Subtropical coniferous trees are found in the study section. They are Masson  pines,   China
firs and cypresses etc. The subtropical deciduous broad-leaved trees are also found here. They
are Wingceltis and poplars etc. Shrubs are Stroblucea, chestnut trees and others. Aquatic plants
are lotus and reed, etc.
The cash plants are tea trees, oil tea trees, mulberry. bamboo and other crops. The grain
crops are rice, wheat, rape and beans.
The project-located  area in Jiangxia is mainly of plains with farmland,  lakes  and  ponds.
There are less trees here. The forest coverage is 22.1-27. 6%  ( Xianning  Prefecture  Forestry
Bureau's data, 1995). The terrain in Xianning and   Puqi  is mainly  hilly  where  the  forest
coverage is higher than that in the former area, which  is 27.6%-36.2%  ( Xianning  Prefecture
24



Forestry Bureau's data, 1995).
3.1.6 Soil Erosion
Among the highway passed are   soil erosion of Jiangxia Destrict is not serious.  CAlculated
in eroded area, the yearly average erosion module is about 1000 ton/k . a. Eroded area is 5% of
the natural area (Jiangxia District Hydrolic Bureau's data, 1995). Topographical terrain of this
area is rolling limnetic plain.
Another highway passed area-Xianning City is in the transition region    from    limnetic
area to low hilly area of southern Hubei. Most part of this region is hilly, with    a  lot  of
gullies. For the raining season is amassed, gully erosion by surface runoff is serious. Because
of  the natural factors as land feature, geology and climate, soil erosion is easily  aroused.
The other factors that caused soil  erosion  are  conflagration,           cutting    down    trees
excessively  and cultivation on steep slopes. Based on investigation, eroded area  of  Xianning
City is 717.34km2, which is 47.79% of the whole area of the city. Total erosion volume  of  the
city is 3, 535, 000 ton, with yearly average erosion module 2354 tonfy. km 2 . a ( Xianning City
Hydrolic Bureau's data,1995), which is still remaining in moderate situation.
According to the information of investigation, The eroded area of Puqi City is 288. lkm 2,
which is 16.7% of the whole area of the city. The yearly erosion volume of the city is 1, 246
700 ton, while eroded organic matter is 3895 ton. The average soil erosion module is 4300 t/km2
a, which shows a medium extent situation (Puqi City Hydrolic Bureau's data,1995).
3.1.7 Flood
Precipitation of the highway passed area is plentiful, which may cause damaging flood. It is
recorded'201 that there are altogether 16 damaging flood due to daily precipitation more than
100mm since 1967 to 1990. The most serious flood in the history is in 1954 with 3 months
rainfall of 1394mm  When  it  had been raining for months, water level  ascended  fast  .   The
flood  was diverted near Panjiawan of Siyigong Bank. the length of the flood diversion   sluice
was 156m. After diversion, the flood entered the Xiliang Lake area, and inundated an area of
884 thousand mu(northward to Zhengdian,  Southward  to  Shuqiao,   eastward  to  Heshengqiao) .
Eighteen days later, the water level of the lake and Chanjiang River were 31.16m above sea level,
the water level of the lake was raised 4.65m, the deepest point was 13 16m. In Panjiawan, the
ground elevation was 26.3m. and the depth of water was 4.86m. When the flood was receding, the
water level of the  lake was reduced from 31.16m to 27.76m. The flood lasted for 47  days.   As
the elevation of the 4 km long embankment from Huanggou Bridge to Zhujiawan was 0. 24- 1. 00m
lower than the water level of the flood, the Jing-Guang Railway Line was interrupted for 40
days
The function of Xiliang Flood Storage and Detention Basin has two aspects:
First aspect: in flood season, when water level of Changjiang River is higher than that of
Xiliang water system, the floodwater in the catchment area of Xiliang water system can  not  be
drained away but stored temporarily in Xiliang Flood Storage and Detension Basin. Waiting for
the time, when the water level of Changjiang River is lower than the water level of the lake,
the flood gate at Jinkou can be opened to drain the floodwater out.
Second aspect: when the water level of Changjiang River is higher than that of the warning
limitation and need to discharge the flood peak, the flood-diversion sluice on the south bank
of Changjiang River can be opened to divert floodwater into Xiliang Flood Storage and Detention
25



hain so that the threat of flood to the lover reaches of Oiangjiang liver can be reduced.
In Document No.79 issued by the State Council, in 1995, liliang water system is listed as a
flood detention basin to prevent catastrophic flooding of Changjiang River.   When  the  water
level at  ainkou is 29.73k. above sea level. The flood can be discharged into Dujiatai,      Wuhu
Lake, Zhangai lIake, Baitan Lake, lizi Lake and liliang lake for flood confinement.
3.1.8 Irrigation
The natural rivers along the proposed expressway, such  as  Ganhe  River,   Tingsihe  liver,
Lushui liver , Panhe liver, etc. have both irrigation and drainage functions.   The  artificial
constructed Beiganqu is a ditch for irrigation and drainage especially. A lot of tiny rivers or
Channels along the line have connected a iwell developed irrigation system, which can used for
irrigation in dry season, for drainage in flood season.
3.1.9 Fauna along the Projected Alignment
There used to be different species of wild animals thanks to the favorable natural
conditions including temperate climate  providing them with  good  habitats.   However,   their
number has been reduced greatly due to heavy cutting of trees. Tigers and leopards have almost
become extinct because of uncontrolled hunting and damaged vegetation. The wild animals found
bere are marmots and weasels. But pangolins are not found very often. This area is rich in
fishery resources the major kinds of which are carp, silver carp, crucian, grass carp and eel,
etc.
No rare animals have been found in the scope of EIA, according to  the  result  of  a survey
along the proposed highway.
3.2 Social Economic Environment
3.2.1 Impact Area
The areas impacted directly by the project are Jiangxia District of Wuhan City, Xianning
City and Puqi City , with a total area of 5233.58 km2   and  a  total  population  of  1660. 4

3.2.8 Traffic and Transportation State
(1) Railway, Waterway, Airline
There is only one railway passing through the project area, that is the Jing- Guang Railway
Built in 1957, this railway is an important trunk line from south to north in China.
The waterway transportation  in Hubei Province relies on the Changjiang River  mainly.   The
natural condition for development of waterway traffic is good, but at present the raising rate
of waterway transportation is a negative value.
The air transportation in Hubei Province is undertook by 2 airports  ,   namely  the  Tianhe
Airport and the Wangjiatun Airport. No airport has been built in other counties and cities
(2) Highway
Highway transportation plays an important role in the comprehensive transportation network
At present, there are 16 highways passing through Wuhan city, of which two are national highways
namely No 107 and No 316 and the others are provincial highways. In the Prefecture of Xianning
there are 37 provincial highways existed, except for the No. 107 National Highway and No. 316
National Highway. The major highways in the impact area are lower-class highway. In the impact
area, the No. 107 National Highway is the major highway located near the proposed highway.
These two highways run almost parallel to each other. The length of No. 107 paralleling to the
proposed highway is about 169 km . See Fig. 3-5.
(3) The Status Quo of Traffic Accidents
The status quo of traffic accidents on the main highways in the impacted area is shown in
Table 3-4.
The economic loss caused by traffic accidents in 1996 is 551 thousands  yuan  in    Jangxia
District of Wuhan City, 1989.2 thousands yuan from Xianning City section of No 107 National
Highway,* and 787.600 thousands yuan from Puqi City section of No. 107 National Highway .

(3) Monitoring Method and results
The methods of sampling and analysis and the equipment used were determined according to the
"Environmental Monitoring and Analysis Methods' , issued by the NEPA and published by China
Enviromental Science Publishing House.
The monitoring results are shown in Table 3-6 and Table 3-7.
8.8.2 Assesment of Soil Quality and Crop Quality
(1) Soil
comparing the monitoring results as shown in Table 3-6 and Table 3- 7 with the assessment
standard -  the Class 2 of 'Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (GB15618-1995)f( see Table
1-7),  we know that the monitoring result is far below the limitation of Class 2,  and  it  is
lower than the limitation of Class 1 ( 35mglkg). The facts show that soil of sampling  spots
along the highway is not polluted by lead. The soil quality along the proposed alignment is
good.
(2) Vegetable
Based on the "Hygienic Standards for Limitation of Pb in Food, (GB14935-94)", see Table 1-8,
the assessment standard for vegetables quality was determined as Pb<0. 2 mg/kg . The monitoring
results of Pb levels of vegetables along the route (see Table 34 and Table 3-7)   are  in  the
range from 0. 01 to 0. 072mg/kg, which are less than the  value  of assessment standard.   This
indicts that the vegetables quality along the route has not been polluted.

8.4.2 Watwr Quality AnUkent
(0) Asement standard
According to the reply of Hubei Provincial P Bureau, the standard for assessment of surface
water is determined as 'Stawdard of Environmental Quality of Surface Water' GE3838-88, Class m.
ee table 1-4.
(2) Asessment Method
Standard Classification Method of Water Quality is used in the assessment of water
environmental quality, later quality can be decided as Class I when all the  factor    values
are below the limitation of Class I. can be decided as Class    w When one or more  than one
factor values is beyond Class I. but below Class  II. Then, Class m  . W     or    V   can  be
dqcided also by this method.
(3) Assessment result
C) Caimuo liver, Tingsi liver, Lushui liver.
As table 3-10 shown, water quality of Cainwo  liver,   Tingsi liver and  Lushui liver  is
analogous. According to the surface water quality staudard, CODu. is Class II,  other  factors
belong to Class I, thus, the water quality is Class II, which is better than demanding level
of functional region (Class El) lWater quality of these river sections is quite good.
) Gsnhe liver & Panhe River
Among the four factors of assessment, except COD,. (belong to Class M), the  other  factors
have reached Class I, then, water quality can be decided as Class m. which has satisfied  the
demand of functional region (Class I). lWater quality of these river sections is good.

1.6.2 Ambient Air Quality Assessment
By comparing the monitoring results of C0, NOx and ISP with the related assessment standards
the ratios of monitoring values to standards were shown in  table  3- 14,   3- 15  and 3- 16
respectively in terms of "Eceed Standardt. From table 3-14  to  table  3- 16,   the  following
assessment results can be gotten.
(1) One-hour average concentrations of 00 about the ambient air of the monitoring spots
range from  0. 41 to 1. 12 mg/Nma, and daily average values of CO range from 0. 42 to 0. 87 cg/NH.
Both of the one-hour average values and daily average values of CO tested did not exceed the
class 2 standards in GB3095-1996, that is one-hour average concentration of 10. 00mg/NmP   and
daily average concentration of 4. OOmg/Nm respectively.
(2) One-hour average concentrations of NO. about the ambient air of the monitoring spots
range from 0. 003 to 0. 060 mg/Nm3, and daily average concentrations range from 0. 004 to 0. 058
mg/NmW Both of the one-hour average concentrations and daily average concentrations of NO.
tested were not excessive the class 2 standards in GB3095- 1996 of one- hour average
concentration being 0.15mg/Nl3 and daily average concentration being 0.10mg/NmJ respectively.
37



(3) Daily average concentrations of TSP about the ambient air of the monitoring spots range
from 0.(07 to 0. 0 ag/IN, which is not greater than the limiting value of the class 2
standards in G13095-1996 (0.30 vgl').
From above , it can be seen that the ambient air quality along the proposed highway is good
in general except the ISP, which is close to the standards of 0.30 glNIz.

As shown in table 4-2, all the national economic assessment indexes of the project meet
requirements. The comprehensive index of the recommended scheme (Xianning Scheme I ) is    good
and its benefit is superior.
(3) Analysis of Economic Sensitivity
A sensitivity analysis of the project is made using investment and traffic volume, the two
variable   factors, with benefit ratio as the index for sensitivity analysis. Prom the analysis
it is shown that when the investment is increased 20% or the traffic volume is reduced 20X, the
EIRR is 19.66% or 18.99%, more than the social discount  ratio( 12%) .  This  shows  that  the
economics of the project is acceptable and  provides  better  protection  against   risks,   so
the investment is feasible.

4.12 Effects on Regional Zecnomic Development Brought about by the Proposed
Hghway
When the construction of the proposed highway is completed, it will become another important
traffic artery nd a corridor of economic  developmnt  in  Hubei Province,   laying  a  solid
foundation for the smooth fulfillment of the planning of the national economy and social
development of the prefectures, cities and counties along the route.
Being connected with some important cities, economic centers, hubs of comunications and
ports of exit, the Jingzhu National Trunk Highway will accelerate economic contact and
transport of mterials, and speed up the development of the national economy of the country,
especial that of Hubei Province.
4.1.8 Analysi of Coordination for the Proposed Highway and the Planing of Cities
and Towns
When determining the route alignment, the designing unit actively solicited suggestions from
local governments, tried to and avoid cities and towns along the  route.   It can  reduce  the
impact on residents caused by vehicle exhausts and noise, improving the quality of the living
environment of the residents. In addition it can reduce the work of removal of houses and the
unfavorable impact on the social environment caused by the project.
The recommended scheme (Zianning Scheme I) basically has no detrimental effect on city and
town planning. In distance between highway and cites, the route alignment meet the requirement
of MOC.
4.1.4 Analysis of Coordination of the Proposed Highway and the Existing Traffic System
As far as the distribution of highways is concerned , the proposed highway is in parallel
with National Highway NO.107 and the distance between them is 1.5-9km. National Highway NO. 107
can be used as a service carriage way and the Changjang liver is near, Which is the secondary
development axes of China, thus the vast areas south and north of the Changjiang River can be
connected as one through harbous, docks and boats.  This  is  helpful for  the    improvement
and development of the traffic system.
When the construction of the southern section in Hubei Province of the    Jingzhu  National
Trunk Highway is finished, it will remarkably alleviate the seriousness of congestion and
improve traffic conditions in the affected area.
Being a line project on the ground, the proposed highway will make it inconvenient for
villagers in some villages to communicate, such as  farming in the fields,   visiting  relatives
and going shopping. To solve this problem, it is planned to build 190 passageways which can
basically meet the requirements of the people along the route. It is recommended that the
construction of passageways and the main part of the project should be completed at the same
time, opinions from the people along the route  should  be  solicited  in time.   Passageways
should be constructed to accommodate agricultural machinery. Also since this area has a
plentiful supply of rain, this should be considered thoroughly when designing the underpasses.
4.1.5 Analysis of Impact on Scenic Spots and Historical Relics Caused by the Proposed
Highway
The construction of highway has both positive and negative effects on scenic spots and
40



historical relices: On the one hand, the ease of transport cao speed up the development of
tourist industry and on the other hard, the building of the highway will damage cultural
relics and historical sites along the route.
The area that the proposed highway runs through has  a  long  history. In  this  area,   the
mountains and rivers are beautiful, and there are many scenic spots and historical relices,
among them the most famous is the ancient Chibi battlefield, which is 38km northwest of Puqi
City proper and at the side of Chandjiang River and about 30km from the proposed highway.
The Chibi battlefield of the Three Kingdoms, in Jinkouchijishan in Jiangxia District is 10km
away from the proposed highway. The ancient street in lindian Township, which is 28km to the
southwest of Puqi City, is 4km away from the proposed highway. The completion and service of
the proposed highway will promote the development of the local tourist industry and explore
more tourist resources and attract more tourist from home and abroad.
Through the investigation of culture department of Hubei Province, there are two cultural
relics within the assessment scope along the route in recommended scheme (Xianning Scheme I )
of the proposed highway. Based on the investigation report of Hubei cultural department
(shown in Appendix I), the two cultural relics will be protected from digging before the
construction.  Except  this, no signs indicating important cultural relics had been    found.
So the construction of the proposed highway will not have a damaging affect on cultural
relics and historical sites.
During the period of the design and construction of the highway,  if  new  cultural  relics,
especially  those underground,  were  discovered,   the  construction  unit  should    execute
protective measures and make  a  timely  report  to  cultural  department.   According  to  the
Protection Law for Cultural Relics of the State, make solving program.
4.1.6 Analysis of Impact on Landscape Caused by the Proposed Highway
The construction of the proposed highway will certainly damage some natural landscapes which
have good covering of vegetation. Especially the Puqi section, as it is located in an area of
hills and where the filling and cutting of  earthworks  for   subgrade  is  greater.  Practical
measures should be taken to restore the damaged vegetation. As to  the  bareness        of  slopes
because of earth cutting, trees and grass  should  be  planted  to    restore    the    natural
landscape.
Afforestation is one of the indispensable measures for environmental protection for highway
construction. In addition to the restoration of damaged vegetation and natural landscape, it is
necessary to increase afforestation along the highway, which can improve the landscape and
provide facilities for highway rest areas. This will make the highway blend into the natural
environment and protect and beautify it. Therefore, the land used for highway and highway
facilities should be afforested as far as possible, shrubs, such as coronilla may be planted on
the bare slope of earth-cuttings, grass may be planted on  the  side  slope  of  subgrade.   In
administrative and service and rest zones, trees and grass should be planted according to the
terrain, distribution of buildings and the design of gardens to beautify the environment.
Apart from the land used for  the  highway,   greenbelts  should  be  set  up, to  protect  the
environment and prevent pollution
In planning the route alignment, apart from being in accordance with the Technical Standards
for Highway Design, the Design Unit for the highway should try to make the route alignment as
beautiful as possible from the point of view of aesthetics, to make the natural landscape and
the man-made engineering works coordinate and be in perfect harmony.

4.1.7 Analyss of Removal and Reiettlement
(1) Amount of  eoval and Resettlement
According to the recomended scheme (Kianning Scheme I ), the amount of buildings needed to
be removed along the route, is 122286.12 e, and the population needed to be resettled is 3050 as
shown _n Table 4-3.

Data source: feasibility study report of the project (June, 1998)
Based on investigation, the removal and resettlement in  recommended  scheme    (  Xianning
Scheme I) of the Southern Section in Hubei Province of the Jingzhu  National Trunk   Highway
involve 3 citiesldistrict, 16 towns, 66 villages and affect 1745 families, and 9 enterprises.
Among them, the number of families which are affected only by land taking is 1522, making
up 75.9% of the total affecting families, the number of families which are  affected  only  by
removal is 71, making up 3.5% of the total affecting families,  the number of families which
are affected by both land taking and removal are 414, making up 20. 6% of the total
affecting families. The population affected by the project is 8402, among them, only affected
by acquisition is 77. 5%, only affected by removal is 3. 6%,   affected  by  both  removal and
requisition is 18.9%. As far as city concerned, in Puqi city, the families affected is most,
accounting for 47.2% of the total.
(2) Impact of Removal and Resettlement and its leasures
Negative effects are mainly the following:
0D Most of the houses and buildings to be removed along the route are residential houses or
buildings. The residents have been living there for a long time. In  resettlement,  they must
leave their home and, even though they  can  be resettled  at places not  far away,  their
surroundings will be changed, for instance, neighbouring contacts, the supply of water
and shopping facilities, etc. they can not become accustomed to these changes in their lives in
a short time.
2 If those people whose houses or buildings have to be removes and who have to be resettled
can't get the amount of compensation they had expected or were not satisfied with the new
houses or buildings, social instability would increase.
(3) Recommendations for Removal and Resettlement
As to the various types of houses or buildings to be removed along the route as shown in
42



Table 4-3, they should be built in principle 200m any from the both sides of the highway  in
their own villages. In order to comply with the planing of land used for houses or buildings,
the families ready to move with their house or apartmt to be dismantled should  be resettled
and their houses or apartments be relocated under the guidance of the local governent, which
should be in keeping with the standards for planning of towns and villages and the families
should be compensated.
The problem of removal and resettleomnt caused by the project's development could be solved
nicely by the common efforts of the Construction Unit and the local governments based on public
participation and the investiption carried out.
(4) Resettlement Action Plan
The Resettleoent Action Plan has been compiled by the Land Acquisition and Building Removal
Office of Jing-Zhu Expressway under the lB Project Office of IPCD.
4.1.8 Summary
All in all, the construction of the highway project has good ocial environment benefits as
well as economic benefits. As to negative effects on the social and economic environwents
brought about by the highway construction, namely land acquisition;   the  interaction  of the
exusting highway; removal and resettlement; damage of vegetation and landscape; obstruction of
residents' contacts etc. the Construction Unit should negotiate with the local governments in
the preliminary work for highway construction and execute the Resettlement Action Plan strictly
. In the process of the highway design, it is necessary to fully consider the negative effects,
such as the disruption to the comumity, obstruction of transport, etc. and leave underpasses
or overhead bridges and take measures to restore the damaged vegetation and landscape to
reduce the local negative effects on the social environment as much as possible.
4.2 Prediction and Assessment of the Impact on Ecological Environment
4.2.1 Prediction and Asessment of Pb Impact on Soil Quality
(1) The calculation of annual emission intensity'/of Pb
The formula is:
365 ,7P
F =  3637 F_Ni Pbi J
where:
Ji-the average amount of consuming gasoline for type i vehicles per km, heavy vehicle
0.41L/ke middle vehicle 0.27LIkm, small vehicle 0.115L/km;
]Pbi-the Pb content of gasoline used by type i vehicle,  (the average value is 140mg/L);
q -the emission ratio in exhaust pipe , generally 75%;
Ni- the daily traffic volume of type i vehicle (not including diesel oil vehicles);
F- the precipitation of Pb within the assessment extent on both sides of the proposed
highway, generally is 60%P;
0--the mass of soil a kilometer long of cultivated layer on both sides of highway, is 8.96 x
43



10'k;
i-symbolizing heavy, middle and *uall vehicle.
(2) The prediction of lead content in soil
For predicting of the soil quality, the follow forecasting formula for lead (Pb) is used:
W. - B +  KI21 *l-
i-1
Where:
1.-  Accumulated amount of lead in the A layer of the  soil in the a year, (oflkg);
K -    Residual percentage of lead in the soil , ();
B -    Background value of lead in the A layer of the soil , (mg/kg);
,-     Annual input amount of lead in the soil, (qg/kg.year);
a - Years of forecasting, (year).
The results are shown in table 4-4.
From table 4-4, we can learn that the lead content in soil along the  route  can't   exceed
the standard of soil environmental quality after 10 or 20 years during service time.    Namely,
the accumulation of lead can't have a damaged effect on soil.

4.2.2 Prediction and Assessment of Loss of Soil due to Water
(1) Prediction Model of Loss of Soil due to Water
The proposed highway lies to the south of Changjiang River, according to the Environment
Assessment Regulations for Highway, the loss of soil due to water during construction use the
Universal Formula provided by document 21, the model is as follows.
A = R .K -L.C .P
Where:
A - Erosion strength , (t/ha.year);
R - Erosion factor of average precipitation;
44



1 - Soil erodible factor;
L- Topography factor, (slope le4gth and slope degree);
C -    Vegetation cover factor;
P -    Soil conervation factor.
(2) Determination of Factors in Model and Prediction Results
The value of the factors are calculated according to formula provided by document 12] and [7].
The value of the factors and the prediction results are shon in Table 4-5.

(3) Assessment of Impact on Loss of Soil due to Water
The results of table 4-5 show that, the loss of soil due to water caused  by  construction
will be 3. 20-6. 85 times of that before  construction,   the potential erosion  intensity  in
Jiangxia section will arrive the level of strong erosion (50-80t/ha.a), the other sections will
arrive the level of serious erosion (80-150tfha.a). Without taking protection  measures,   the
loss of soil due to water all line in recommend scheme (Xianning SchemejI) will arrive 5.92x0l'
tol. The construction of the proposed highway will last 3.5 years and go through several rain
seasons. In constructing roadbed, 12781.246xlOe earth and rock work will be used,' . damaging
the vegetation on surface, changing the original land slope,  interfering  with  the  original
stable land surface, so the loss of soil due to water is  unavoidable.   Further   more,   in
initial service time, the vegetation can't restore to.its original state at once.   Therefore,
the prevention and cure for the loss of soil due to water during construction can not be
neglected. The construction units should emphasize the vegetation restore work, such as found
protection dam,  drainage ditches, retaining walls to stop earth   etc.   at  the    same  time
building road  in accordance with the requirement of {later and Soil Conversation Act in PIC )>
to control the loss of soil caused by construction  as  early  as possible.   The  special
facilities of protection measures are shown in chapter V.
After 3 to 5 years of operation, the loss of soil due to water which  is       serious    in
construction should recover to the  level of pre- construction,   thanks  to  the    drainage
facilities' improvement and vegetation's restore, also the improvement of road state and
afforestation of road-sides, the loss of soil due to water along the route will be alleviated.
4.2.8 Analysis of impact on Agricultural Production caused by Land Acquisition
The effect on agricultural production caused by construction is occupation the cultivated
land permanently, the occupied cultivated land will lose the output ability and bring some
effect  to agriculture production.   In  the recommended  scheme,   the  total  land  occupied
45



pemmmently is 10486.9 amu Asmog thoo, the cultivated land is 7688. 8 u, account for 73. 3%   the
non-cultivated land is 2800. Ou, accounting for 26.7% Por families, the occupied land mostly
(92 8%) is cultivated land, of vhich 98X is paddy field and 26.7% is dry farm, (see in table 4
--.4  The ratio of the total occupied cultivated land permanently and the present   cultivated
land on all villages along the road is 4. 8% on average. It hows that the ratio of the
occupied cultivated land %y the proposed highway is low. In addition, in the villages where
the road pass through, the cultivated land per capital is 2. 30 mu/person , so the agricultural
planting structure is not affected distinctly in this area. In order to reduce the effect on
agricultural production as such as possible; in highway design, should execute the papers of
[19971,   No 11 ( The information of Enforcing the Ltnd Management and Protecting Cultivated
Land Practically)>.   In highway design stage, optimize the road alignment and occupy the  land
as few as possible.  For the cultivated land occupied  temporarily in the construction  time,
the  surface  layer soil should be piled up   on  side and  recover  it to  the  land  for
cultivation after completion.

4.2.4 Analysis of the Impact on Irrigation Ditch of Farmland
In Jiangxia and Xianning area where the proposed highway pass through, the terrain along the
route is low and the majority of farmland is paddy field and irrigated land. The irrigation
system for farmland is perfect. The route cross some drainage ditches and irrigating channels.
In order to guarantee the farmland irrigation system to work normally, many bridges will be
constructed according to design plan. According to the report of project feasibility study, 28
small bridges and 251 culverts are planed, which can basically satisfy the farmland irrigation
and drainage. In addition   the proposed highway lie to the south of the Changjiang Biver, so,
there are plenty of lakes and  streams,   the  independent   irrigation    water source   is
abundant. Therefore the highway construction have a slight influence on the irrigation systea
4.2.5 Environmental Impact Analysis on Borrow Sites
The subgrade height of the proposed highway in the area of plains and hills is controlled by
the net height of passageway. The average height of the whole subgrade is 3. 8m, the total earth
and stone volume amounts to 12781.246 thousand i8. There are three ways to get earth for the
subgrade:
(1) Use the earth of excavation section for the fill section as much as possible along the
route .
(2) Combine the work of excavation  and the  future production  sites of provision.   For
instance, the borrow pits in the area of plains and lakes can be used to build fish farms or
shrimp farms. And combine the work of excavation of earth on mountain slopes in hilly areas
with the work of building up fields and leveling land.
(3) For the sections where earth is difficult to get, it is necessary to choose proper
borrow areas to buy it.
46



As a result of investiption, for the section from the starting point in Jiangxia District
to liming section, earth can be got from upland and the area on both sides of the - subgrade;
after Quankou, the route enter into hilly area basically, the earth for oubgrade mainly
come from the transportation of excavating sections.
Excavating for earth for the highway construction will have the following negative impacts
on the surrounding ecological environment:
(1) The great quantity of earth and stone needed for the construction and the construction
of three years will damage the vegetation and landscape and the vegetation will not recover to
its original state in a short time.   Thus,  sufficient attention  should  be paid  to  the
unavoidable soil erosion during the construction of the highway.
(2) Some stone and earth will need to be transported from material sites at some distance
during highway construction and the vehicles transporting them will damage the surrounding
vegetation. Because of the poor conditions of makeshift roads, the raised dust will have an
adverse impact on the neighbouring environment and crops.
(3) Excavating for earth damage the natural land surface and make it not coordinating
with surroundings.
As we can see from above, great attention will have to be paid to, and practical measures
should be taken for environmental protection.
4.8 Prediction and Analysis of Impact on the Water Environment
The pollution of the water environment during the service period of the proposed highway
mainly comes from rainwater runoff from the road surface, domestic waste water from the service
zone, rest zone, toll station and nanagement zone. The pollution of the water environment during
construction period mainly comes from the domestic waste arising from the constructors, oil
-containing wastewater from machinery operation and construction material such as oil, cement etc.
during flood.
4.3;1 Prediction and Analysis of Pollution from Road Surface Runoff
(1) Analysis of Pollution Source of Road Surface Runoff
Q) Concentration of Pollutants of the Road Surface Rainwater
The factors that effect the pollution intensity of road surface runoff include rainfall,
rainfall time, the amount of pollutants on road surface related to traffic volume, the level of
atmospheric pollution, the rainfall frequency, the width of road surface, the length of the
section, etc. Based on the results  of the  investigation and  reference  books 1lO0,   the
concentration of pollutants of the road surface is determined and shown in Table 4-7.

The data in Table 4-7 are determined in the light of the average  annual precipitation
According to the data provided by the Meteorological Bureau of Xianning  Prefecture,   Hubei
Province, the average annual precipitation of the project area is 1100-1450mm.
According to the route alignment, the characteristics of topography and the relative
location of rivers and lakes, the rainwater runoff volume of the road surface are determined
and shown in Table 4-8.

(2) Pollution prediction of road surface runoff
Because most of the initial rainwater runoff from the bridge surface flows down into the
water body directly and some of it flows downwards both ends of the bridge and then discharges
into water body. The pollutants in rainwater on road surface have small biological degradability
Therefore, the Completely Mixed Model is used to predict the effect on surface water quality
caused by the rainwater runoff from the bridge surface. The model is as follows:
C3Q3+C.Q
C=-
QB + Q
Where:
C- Concentration of the pollutants at the predicting section where the  waste   water  has
become mixed with the river water , (mg/L);
Ca-Background concentration of the pollutant in the river, (mgfL);
Qa-River flow , (mels);
C.--Concentration of rain water, on road surface runoff (mg/L);
Q-Discharge of waste water, (m3fs).
The calculation results are shown in Table 4-9:

From the results of prediction, it is clear that the initial rainwater runoff from the
bridge surface during the service time of the highway will have little impact on the water
quality of the rivers and will not change the original Class of water quality ( Class  II  and
Class m respectively).
The impacts on the quality of rivers' water are only for a short period and then
intermittently. It often occurs in the early hours of a rainfall and will reduce with the
prolongation of rainfall time or reduce gradually with the self-purification of the river water.
4.1.2 Impact Analysis of Wastewater in the Service Zones, Rest Zones. Toil Stations
and Management Zones
Based on the Feasibility Study Report two service zones are planned along the whole route.
They are located on  aggong section and Puqi section respectively. The wastewater discharge
rate from these two zones are estimated as follows.
(1) In the service zone there is a service building including a market, a hotel and a dining
hall with 35 administrators, 25 staff of a parking lot, a repair workshop and a filling station
49



a nd 280 pasing travelers. ( In fact, out of the people comiog and going usually stay for a
short time, ha"e meals or refuel their vehicles). Suppoe the amount of waste water per person
per day is 200 1, then the total daily waste water volume will be 58W,   including  the waste
water from the dining hall, offices And toilets, then the concentration of domestic aste water
is calculated in the light of OOD concentration being 500ng/l, E09 concentration being 200.g/l
and oil concentration being 100mg/l, the discharge rate of pollutants in the waste water will be:
COD-29kg/d, EOD5-12. 8g/d and oils-5. 8kg/i
(2) The waste water from washing vehicles in parking lots is estimated based on the traffic
volume in 2020. In 2020, the traffic volume of the Zhanggong section will be 57428 veh. /d and
the traffic volume of the Puqi section will be 58804 veh. /d. then the ratio of vehicles being
washed is 2% of the daytime traffic volume; the average draining water from washing vehicles
will be 40011veh(2t, and the recycling ratio of water used for washing vehicles is 70%. the
drainage volume for the car wash per day in Zhanggong service zone will be 1lilmd and in Puqi
service zone will be 113m/d. The rate of wastewater discharge in the car wash is:
in Zhanggong service zone, COD,, 22. 1kg/d,  10D) 5. lkg/d,  oil 3. 3kg/d,
in Puqi service zone, COD, 22. 5g/d, BDkD 5. 2kg/d and oil 3.4kg/d
(3) In normal conditions, if the filling station and the repair workshop are washed once
each day, OD1 will be 9kg/d, 101) will be 2kg/d and oil will be 3 kg/d in the drainage water.
All in All, the amounts of water pollutants arising from the service zone is
In the Zhanggong service zone, ODD 60. 1kg/d, B01  19. 9kg/d and oil 12. lkg/d,
In the Puqi service zone, COD is 70. 5kg/d, BOD. is 20. Okg/d, and oil is 12.2kg/d.
Therefore, the drainage from the service zone must be treated before being discharged. It is
suggested that a comprehensive sewage treatment station be set up to treat the domestic sewage
and oil-containing wastewater in the two service zones.
For the 2 rest zones that will be built  along  the  highway,   because  their  function  is
similar to the service zones, similar sewage treatment station should be set up too.
For the 6 toll stations and 2 management zones, domestic wastewater from the staff of toll
stations or management zones should be treated by septic tank and oil wastewater should be
treated by oil separating tank before discharge.
4.3 analysis of Water Pollution during Construction Period
The following factors are the sources that may pollute the water body during the
construction period:
(1) In the process of building large bridges, the digging out of mud from the river or lake
and washing of building materials, such as sand and stones, will muddy the water and thus
affect the water quality of the rivers or lakes.
(2) In the process of building large bridges, ships and a large amount of construction
machinery will be used. If the oil-containing drainage from these ships and machinery flow
into the water body it may cause the oil concentration of the water body to exceed the standard.
(3) During the period of construction, if domestic sewage and garbage from builders are not
controlled, then they will be discharged or thrown into the river or the lake and thus pollute
the water body.
(4) The leakage of oils from construction machinery or ships and the dumping of waste oils
into the water body may pollute the water. This should be strictly prevented.
50



t6) If the building materials, such as asphalt, oils and other chemical substances are not
carefully stored, they might be washed away into the water body in a storm
All the above factors my affect the quality of the water  body    during  the  construction
period. As it is difficult to make a quantitative prediction of the  human  factors,   it  is
necessary to strengthen administration. take measures to prevent, cure and reduce the impact of
accidents on the pollution of the vater body.
4.584 Risk Analysis of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods
The proposed highway is a component part of the four national trunk lines of China. When it
is open to traffic, the transportation of poisonous and harmful chemicals will be unavoidable
(as shown in Table 3-8). The proposed highway will go along and cross some rivers and lakes. In
order to ensure the protection of the water body during the transportation of dangerous goods,
an analysis was made of the risks.
For the numbers of traffic accidents in the transportation of dangerous chemicals,   use
the following formula:
n
P = 1I Q  = 4xQ2 xQ. xQ xQ5 xQa
i4
Where:
P-nusbers of accident involving chemical dangerous cargoes occurred on road  sections near
water body in the predicting year;
Q4-The frequency of serious traffic accident occurred presently on the district that the
proposed highway passes through, (time/nillion veh.km);
Q2-Traffic volume in the predicting year, (million veh./year);
Qs-Decrease in traffic accident rate caused by the use of expressway, (%);
Q.-Truck percentage, (%);
Qs-Chemical dangerous material percentage,  (%);
Qe-The length of road section near and over water body, (km).
The value of each factor was determined as follows:
Q,.--Reference to the traffic accident rate in 1994 in Xianning Prefecture, QL-0. 25;
Q2---According to the traffic volume prediction , in 2002, Q(=2. 98, in 2012, Q2'7.0B ,   in
2022, Q,.11. 00.
Qs- Reference to the Traffic Safty Report of America (1974), Qs=25%;
Q. - According to the feasibility study report on the proposed highway, Q4=76%;
Qc-According to the feasibility study report, Q5=7.6%;
Qe-Determined based on the road section length that pass over rivers or lakes or  fishing
ponds, Q.= 4.6km.
The prediction results are shown in table 4-10.

As shown in Table 4-10, the possibility of major traffic  accidents  that may  pollute  the
water body during the transportation of dangerous chmeicals in the service period of the
highway is sall. In 2002 it is 0. 060 times per year, while in 2012 it is 0. 117 times per
year and it is 0.183 times per year in  2022.   But even  though  the  possibility  is  small,
accidents may happen. Therefore, during the transportation of dangerous goods in the service
period of the proposd highway, it is necessary to execute certain administrative measures to
prevent thea  For specific  easures and recomendations, see chapter V and VI.
4.8.6 Analyis of the Impact of floods an the Proposed Hghway during Service Time
The road surface elevation of the highway section in Futou lake area is great than 30. 5.,
but lower than the highest water level(31. 16.) of flood diversion in 1954.  Therefore,   if a
catastrophic flood like that in 1954 occurred, it would be difficult to ensure the normal
operation of the Jighzhu Highway. The explanation for this which had been made in the
Feasibility Study Report for  this project  was  as  follows:   It would be  uneconomic and
impractical to build the depth of fill about 6-7m and the highest depth of fill 9-10m so that
transportation could not be interrupted when a catastrophic flood like that in 1954 occurred.

(2) Determination of Parameters in the Model
5D Traffic Volume, Speed of Vehicles, Radiant Noise Level and Its Correction
For the traffic volume of heavy vehicles,   middle  vehicles  and  light  vehicles  on  the
proposed highway, see Table 2-3. For classification  method  of vehicle  types see    reference
book 121.
The limit speed designed for the expressway is 120km/h. The limit speed designed for the
link road is 80km/h. According to the reference book I21, determine the practical speed ( Vi)
of vehicles in accordance with the following formulas.
light type:       V. = 237 N. -   "
middle type:      V. = 212 N.-°  174
heary type:       VD = 0.8 V.
Where: N. is the traffic volume of light vehicles, time/h;
N. is the traffic volume of middle vehicles, time/h.
According to the practical traffic speed (Vi)and the  road  surface  materials  (  asphalt
concrete pavement ) recommended by  the project  feasibility  study  report    as    well  as
Regulations  of Environmental Impact Assessment For Highway  Project.   Calculate  the  radiant
noise level (LAi) of different vehicles on asphalt concrete pavement in accordance with
following formulas:
heavy vehicles:    LA = 77. 2 + 0. 18 Vh
middle vehicles:   LA = 62. 6 + 0. 32 V.
light vehicles:    LA = 59.3 + 0.23 V.
53



Where  Vh. v.. v. is the speed of eah vehicle respectively.
The road vertical slope correction is calculated in accordance with the practical vertical
slope of road section relative the sensitive spots, the  anxmum correction is + 2dB( A)    for
heavy and middle vehicle.
The correction of road surface is calculated according to table 4-11.
Table 4-1                    Correction of road surface
Type of pavement                        Correction of road surface  dB(A)
Asphalt concrete                                      0
Cement concrete                                      1.2   *
*   For  the ratio of light vehicle more than 60%.  adopt the higher value, otherwise, the
lower value.
CD Ground Attenuation Factor
The areas on both sides of the proposed highway are farmlands  on  the  whole.   The  sound
propagation attenuation factor(z) of ground covering is 0.5.
G AS
For the attenuation amount of sound level (AS) caused by objects like different heights of
embankments, or high-level bridges and the different depths of excavation, use the following
formula:
N= 6 x f 1 170
Where:
-Difference of sound propagation length, (m);
f -Noise frequency, as for highway traffic , f--55OHz;
N-Fresnel Number.
The attenuation amount of sound level (AS) can be figured out from the  Fresnel  Curve  by
referring to the Fresnel number calculated.
(3) Prediction Results of Traffic Noise of Different Road Sections
According to the traffic volume at different periods of service and the average height of
embankments, the traffic noise levels of different road sections are shown in Table 4-12.
4.4.2 Environmental Impact Assessnent of Traffic Noise
(1) Critical line of traffic noise
According to the prediction results of tiaffic noise of different road sections   , we  can
figure out the distance from the road center-line to the point where the traffic noise level
equals to the limiting value of the 4 class standard of GB3096-93 ( daytime 70 dB(A), at night
55 dB(A)). The distance are shown is table 4-13.

Notes: For villages, execute the GB3096-93 standard for Class 4(daytime 70dB,  55dB) .  For
schools, execute the GB3096-93 Standard for Class 1 (daytime 55 dB, night 45dB).
(2) The impact of traffic noise on sensitive spots
From table 4-13,.we know that in 2012 year the traffic noise level at the areas more than
95 c away from the road center-line can satisfy the category 4 of the assessment standard, and
in 2022 year the traffic noise level of the areas more than 111 away from the road center-line
can satisfy the category 4 of the assessment standard. From the design unit of the project, we
know that the buildings located within 30m away from the road centerline will be removed and
relocated at the process of land acquisition. So, the objects that will suffer from the traffic
noise pollution are manily the residents living in the front line of the residence quarter
58



located at the area from 34 to 1113 away from the road center-lirne
The ambient noise level at the front line of the residence quarter was obtained by adding
the traffic noise to the background noise of the area, then calculating, the noise attenuation
caused by objects like excavations, embankments, etc. were considered. The ambient noise level
in 2002, 2012 and 2022 year for the sensitive spots (villages) within 111 meter away from the
road center-line and all the schools are shown in table 4-1I
We can ee from Table 4-14 that, compred to the eorresponding limiting value in GB 3096-93
standard, the ambient noise at some sensitive spots along the highway will exceed the standard.
There are some sensitive spots whose noise level during the long service period will exceed
the standard by more than 14dB(A). Therefore, reasonable measures should be  taken  to  reduce
the noise for the protection of the acoustic enviroment at sensitive spots.
The mitigation measures of environmental protection for the 27 sensitive locations are
listed in Table 5-1. For the mitigative measures of environmental protection for other
sensitive locations, please refer to Annex II.
4.4.3 Analysi of Impact on Acoustic Environment during Clonstruction
(1) Environmental Impact Analysis on Transportation Highways Used for Construction
The engineering of the highway will need 65791 tons of steel,1216&  lumber, 431207 tons of
cement, 70662 tons of asphalt and 11378402e earth and 1402844 e stone for the subgrade. If 10
local transportation highways are going to be used, there will be about 230 additional vehicles
running on each of them every day during the 3. 5 years of the
construction period
On the light of the data of feasibility study report of the project, the existing traffic
volume of the major highways in this area(National Highway No.107) is 5130 veh. /day, so,  the
traffic volume during the construction period will amount to 5360 veh. /day. The traffic noise
in day time along major transportation highways during the construction period is shown in
Table 4-15.

Note: As the construction is not done at night, there is no prediction of traffic  noise at
night in the above table.
The table 4-15 shows that  the distance to roadside at which  the traffic  noise of the   WV-
transportation road'can meet standard during construction is 12. That  is to say  that the   (lNtc
traffic noise have a slight influence on acoustic environment quality on both sides of
transportation roads.
(2) Environmental Impact Analysis of Construction Sites
The noise of construction sites along the proposed highway mainly comes  from construction
vehicles and equipment. For noise levels and their attenuation, see Table 4-16.

In the Noise Standards for Construction Sites 0B12523-90, the limiting noise value is 75dB
during the daytime and 55 dB at night. It is shown from the noise level in Table 4-16 that the
standard distance for the noise of construction machinery at daytime is about 40m, and about
150. at night. The noise of construction machinery in the daytime will not affect the
environment greatly, but at night it will. So, it is suggested that the construction should be
stopped from 20:00 to 6: 00. If there is a school within 150m of a construction  site,   it is
necessary to negotiate with the school and adjust the working hours so that teaching activity
will not be greatly affected.
It is shown in Table 4-16 that the noise of construction  machinery,  generally  speaking,
exceeds 80dB(A), some even exceeds 90dB(A). This noise will affect constructors, especally the
operators of construction machinery. The Noise Health Standards for Industrial Enterprises
issued by the Minitry of Public Health of Chnia and the General Bureau of Labour are shown in
Table 4-17. It is suggested that the Construction Unit should reasonably arrange for
constructors and their work to protect their health and pay attention to the maintenance of
machinery used for construction so that the noise levels could be reduced to the lowest. As for
those workers who work longer hours near the source of noise, some easures should be taken to
protect their health, such as ear plugs, helmets, etc..

4.4.4 Swumary
(1) During the servioe period, the proposed highway will have an obvious negative impact On
the acoustic environment at sensitive spots along the route. Therefore, practical oasures for
prevention  nd control of noise should be taken at sEnitive  spots where  the  sound  level
peatly exceeds the standard.
(2) The construction work should be arranged at daytime from 6:00 to 22 00, so that it will
not affect the sleep of residents at sensitive spots along the route.
(3) The trasportation of building materials is basically a daytime activity. The calculated
results in Table 4-13 sho that the places more than 120 away from the roadside can satisfy the
standard for Class 4 in 03096-93. Therefore, the transportation of building materials will
not greatly affect the acoustic eanvironment of sensitive spots along the route.
(4) The noise level of construction mchinery at places which are about 40. away from the
construction site can satisfy the standard for Class 4 in GB3096-93. Most of the villages and
towns along the proposed highway are O0 away from the centre-line of the highway. Thus,  the
noise level of construction machinery in the daytime will not distinctly affect the life of
people living in the towns and villages more than 50 m away from the highway. For the villages
within 50 o from the proposed highway, sound  insulation  window  with a scavenger  should  be
installed to the windows of bedroom of the front line residences before construction ( in 1999,
see Table 5-1 ).
(5) The eight schools along the proposed highway are less than 160. away from the route
center-line. The construction noise on these highway sections will greatly affect the teaching
activity of these schools. Thus, it is suggested that the construction unit should   negotiate
with the schools and adjust the time of construction to reduce the disturbances to teaching
activity as far as it possibly  can during  the  construction  period.   In addation,   sound
insulation window with a scavenger fan should be installed to the windows of schoolroom toward
the road, and high enclosing wall for school should be built at the side toward the road
before construction ( in 1999, see Table 5-1 ). Besides, during construction at school sections
some temporary noise-reduction measures such as wooden sound insulating boards should be taken.
(6) The temporary construction detours should be far away from schools. When the construction
operations have to carry out at night, some noise-reduction measures should be taken like to
slow down the speed and/or forbid to blow horns.

4.5.2 Asseasment of Impact on Ambient Air Quality
The daily average concentration of carbon monoxide on both sides of the proposed highway of
the predicting cross-section in 2002,2012 and 2022 is shown in Figure 4- la to Figure 4- le
respectively. As shown in the above figures, the daily average concentration of carbon monoxide
at places near the roadside is 0. 54-1. 35mglNme in 2022. The concentration of carbon monoxide at
every prediction cross- section does not exceed the limiting value for daily average
concentration of carbon monoxide (4. 00cg/Nm) in Class 2 of the Ambient Air Quality Standards
(GB3095-1996). But the concentration increasing caused by traffic is distinct.
The daily average concentrations of nitrogen oxide of the 6 cross-sections in 2002,2012 and
2022 are shown in Figure 4-2a to Figure 4-2e respectively. The daily average concentration of
nitrogen oxide on both sides of the highway in 2022 is 0. 03 -0. 08 mg1Nc, and does not exceed
the corresponding standard for ambient air quality.  As the cross- section  in  Xuzhuangyujia
66



Village is affected by the structure of a through cut,  the daily  average  concentration  of
nitrogen oxide within an area 20. on both sides of the highay approaches  the  standard,   the
lisiting value of standard being 0.10 g/bNO. The daily average concentrations of nitrogen oxide
of all the other cross-sections do not exceed the standard.
As shown in Table 4-20, the daily average concentrations of CO and NO. at some typical
ensitive spots during  ervice period (in 2022) do not exceed  the  standard  for Class  2  in
G03095-1996.
Briefly, during the service time, with the increase in traffic volume, the concentration of
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide on sides of the proposed highway will be increased. Assuming
that the existing environment is not changed, the concentration of carbon monoxide in the
middle part of the service time (in 2012) and in the late part (in 2022) will not exceed the
standard. But in the late part of the service time, as several cross-sections will be affected
by the structure of though cuts, the concentrations of nitrogen oxide in places near the
roadside will be increased distinctly to approach the standard.
The daily average concentrations of CO and N0, at typical sensitive spots in 2022 do not
exceed the standard. But because the increase in pollutant concentration caused by traffic is
obvious, some easures for protecting the ambient air quality should be taken to reduce the air
pollution as possible as they could.
4.5.3 Analysis of Impact on Ambient Air QuaHity during Construction
(1) Major Air Pollution Sources during Construction
The impact on the ambient air quality during the period of construction is mainly from
raised dust or total suspended particles (TSP) and asphalt smog.
There are 3 sources of raised dust. The first one is from the mixing and paving of lime and
soil on the proposed highway during the construction of the subgrade. The second one is from
the mixing plants of lime and soil. The third one is from vehicles and equipment used for
construction or transportation on construction sites.
(2) Analysis of Impact on Ambient Air
0) Reducing the dust
According to the analogical results, sprinkling water at the construction  site  can  reduce
70% of the dust and obtain a good effect. So, it is  suggested here,   during  the period  of
construction, the work of sprinkling water to the construction sits should be done timely in
order to prevent the dust pollution.
CD Controlling the asphalt smog
Because of the asphalt concrete used for pavement will be supplied by asphalt concrete
mixing plants set up temporarily with fully-closed equipment, the asphalt smog will not bring
an obvious pollution to the ambient air of the construction sites. An attention should be paid
to the location of the plants, which should be chosen in light of the requirement of Distance
Classification for Protection of Hygiene. The plants should be located at least 300c away from
the sensitive spots such as residential quarters and schools and should be downwind of the
nearest sensitive spot. It is also necessary to point out that open or half-close equipment for
asphalt boiling cannot be used.

V MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENGINEERING
5.1 Envrnmental Protetion Measu    in Dedg
(1) Alignment schece should be perfected for being away from villages & schools or less
farmland occupation
(2) Afforestation at road side and side slope protection by mortar slab stone should be
considered  in  design,   to prevent soil erosion  and beautify  highway  landscape.   High
precipitation of the area along the highway may cause collapse and slope slide directly,
therefore, at sections of large  area  side  slope  protection,   collecting  pipes  should  be
constructed for drainage to prevent from erosion in flood seasonL
(3) The highway design based on landform, should occupy less farmland as much as possible.
(4) Rational selection for the position of earth borrowing sites and spoil areas should be
considered Pay attention to vater and soil conservation of earth borrowing sites, the impacts
of dusting and other problems caused to environmental sensitive area (for example, residential
regions).
(5) Design of crash barrier should be strengthened on bridges to prevent from vehicles
dropping into the rivers in accidents of dangerous transportation.
(6) Mitigation measures should be adopted to the sensitive spots beyond noise standard.
(7) Waste water treatment processes should be designed in service zones, rest zones and toll
stations and mnagement zones.
(8) Landscape design should be done at interchange bridges.
(9) Rational action plan should be made for land acquisition and resettlement.
(10) Protective measures for the two historical sites along the proposed project should be
taken prior to the commencement of the construction.
5.2 Environmental Protection Measures During Construction
5.2.1 Measures for Ecological Environmental Protection
(1) During construction, it is necessary to build temporary settling basins to allow mud and
sand to settle at places where rainwater runoff occurs during digging of  the  subgrade.   The
average depth of the settling basin is 0.5m, its scale is determined in terms of the size' of
catchment area and its location in terms of the topography. Earth and cloth fences are placed
when necessary near the outlet of the settling basin. When the highway construction is finished
and the culvert pipes laid don, either trees should be planted on the sites of the settling
basins or the area should be reverted to farmland.
(2) Afforestation and slope protection of cut slopes should be pay attention to when the
route is cutting in rolling hills.
(3) During construction of Jiangxia section, earth will be borrowed from upland areas.   So,
it is recoemended to limit the working area, to prohibit workers cutting trees out of borrow site
It is necessary to plant trees in the borrow area as soon as possible after the excavation has
been completed. When excavating on both sides of the proposed highway in the area   of plains
68



and lakes, it is recomemded that building shrimp farms  and fish farm   be considered.   Before
excavation, it will be necesoary to negotiate with local people for a suitable design and at a
reasonable distance from the subgrade It is strictly prohibited to excavate on the sides of
the propoed highway at random.
(4) No earth borrow site in forest land.
-(5) Plant grass on the side slopes of subgrade  in three amoths after construction,  Shrubs
which can be easily grown such as coronilla should be planted on the excavated slope.
,(6) The retaining walls, the drainage ditches, and the work of planting trees and grass
should be constructed and checked simultaneously.
(7)Education and training of the workers to protect the wild animals & plants,   hunting  is
prohibited strictly.
(8) During construction, while the land is temporarily using, it will be necessary to remove
the fertile surface soil and stack it nearby. Then after the construction is finished, restore
the land to its previous condition.
5.2.2 Measures for Prevention and Control of Noise
(1)  It is recommended that the construction unit should arrange for the      workers   to
operate the machines in turn for reducing the time of bering excessive noise,   pay attention
to   the maintenance of the machinery and to keep the noise level of the machinery as low  as
possible. For the workers working a longer time near the sound source, ear plugs should be
provided for them to protect their hearing.
(2) When the distance between the residential quarters and the construction site is less
than 150m, it is recommended that work be suspended from 20: 00 to 06: 00 in order  to    ensure
that the residents have an undisturbed night rest.
(3) Mitigation measures should be adopted  for residential regions within  50m  to   the
constructed sections.
(4) For the section where any school is located, the  construction   unit should  negotiate
with the teachers about the time of construction to reduce the disturbance to teaching caused
by noise. Besides, during construction at school sections some temporary noise- reduction
measures such as wooden sound insulating boards should be taken.
(5) Carefully maintain the normal operation of machines to eliminate mechanical noise to the
lowest level.
(6) The temporary construction detours should be far away from schools. When the construction
operations have to carry out at night, some noise-reduction measures should be taken like to
slow down the speed and/or forbid to blow horns.
5.2.3 Measures for Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution during Construction
(1) It is recommended that bedding plants and lime-soil mixing plants should  be  set up  in
open areas, at least 200. away from residential   quarters   or schools.   Water should  be
sprinkled on the transport and construction sections to minimize rising dust.
(2) Prevention and Control of Asphalt Smog
The pavement of the proposed highway is asphalt concrete. Therefore, it is   necessary  to
choose a proper location for a asphalt concrete mixing plant when using asphalt concrete,   so
69



that asphalt smog pollution can be prevented.  Meanwhile,  the selected  location  should  be
convenient and oet the dmand  of distane  of protection  regulated  in  the Distance
Classification for Protection of  ygiene. the asphlt concrete mixing plant sold  be  located
at leat 3     away froa the anvironental s itive spots suh as residential quarters and
scbools and should be down ind of the neart sensitive spot. It is also necessary to point out
that open or half-close techniques for asphalt boiling cannot be used.
(3) Material piling areas hould be covered up or sprinkling to prevent from pollution of
dwt. Material transportation trucks should be covered by mufflers.
(4) Space of mixers should be separated to prevent air pollution.  Pay attention  to  the
health protection of workers.
5.2.4 Environmental Protection Measures for Water Pollution and Water Conservancy
Projects.
(1) The domestic sewage, garbage and excrement of workers at construction site should be
eoncentrated and treated, and cannot be discharged directly into the water body.  If domestic
sewage in the areas of construction cannot be connected with the mnicipal drainage system, it
will be necessary to build dry toilet and septic tanks.
(2) During the construction of bridges, the machinery and ships used should be strictly
checked to prevent the leakage of oil. The waste oil and garbage from construction are not
allowed to discharge into the water body.
(3) Pollution of river water from bridge construction can be prevented by innovation of
construction procedures. For examples when the flow of a river is rather large, not cofferdam
method but drop shoft sinking should be used in the bridge construction to mitigate the
pollution to river.
(4) It is not proper to pile up construction materials such as asphalt, oil and chemicals at
places near wells for public use, rivers and lakes in order to prevent them from entering into
the water body when it rains.
(5) For small-sized irrigation and drainage ditches for farmland, it is necessary to lay
down culverts in advance during construction The area of cross- section of culvert is not
allowed less than that of the original ditches, and the level of the culvert bottom should be a
little lower than the original level of the ditch bottom, such as 2 cm.
(6) Temporary substitute drainage system should be constructed during construction of
permanent drainage system.
(7) Mitigation measures should be adopted for earth and stone blockage of irrigation and
drainage system.
5.2.5 Historical Relics
Excavation should be stopped immediately when a historical relic site is found, and domestic
historical relic management agencies should be informed simultaneously. Excavation is prohibited
before appraisal of the relic site and adoption of protection measures.
5.3 Environmental Protecdon Measures during the Service Period
70



5.8.1 Plan for Armas on Both Sides of the Route
(1) The predicted results of traffic noise shoed that during the long-term service period
of the proposed highway, the noise level in the areas more than 1113 away from the highway
cgnter-liie is lower than the limiting value of Class 4 in GB3096-93. Therefore, from a long
-term point of view, it is  reooimended in planning for the  areas on  both  sides  of    the
highway that buildings and units such as residential quarters not be built within 130 m away
from the road center-line. As for schools and hospitals that have a higher demand for acoustic
environment quality, it is recommended that schools and hospitals not be built within 50m away
from the road center-line.
(2) Set up traffic sigps prohibiting the use of horns on the sections where schools are near.
(3) Strengthen traffic mnagement by setting up traffic environmental monitoring stations at
the entrance and exit to the highway and prohibiting old vehicles with higher noise levels to
run on the highway. The concrete operation is described as follows: One person specialized in
environmental protection is assigned at a tolling station  Meters in hand,   they  examine  the
passing vehicles on an ad hoc basis through experience.
(4) For engineering measures for prevention and control of traffic noise and executing time,
see Table 5-1 and Appendix II. The effect of noise-reduction of varied mitigption measures is
shown in Table 5-2.
(5) For the scattered residences as not shown in Table 5-1 and Appendix 2 but may be found
during the design or construction stage, if the residence is less than 111 a away from the
road center-line, a sound proof windows should be installed for every residence (400 yuan per
window).
5.3.2  Measures for Prevention and Control of Ambient Air PoUution during Service Time
(1) Planting Trees by the Roadside
It was reported that the planting of trees can purify and absorb the pollutants from the
exhaust of vehicles. As for 00, the conclusion is"":
A single row of trees and shrubs with a width of 3-40 can give a purification rate of 7-25%;
Double rows of trees and shrmbs with a width of 10-12, can give a purification rate of 40
.50%,
T'he area along the proposed highway is fairly suitable for the growth of trees and shrubs.
Therefore, it is recommended that trees and shrubs be planted  in the  area near  the roadside,
especially in sensitive areas ,so that the air pollutants from the exhaust of vehicles can be
absorbed , the TSP can be purified, the environment can be beautified and the landscape along
the route can be improved   As the atmospheric sensitive  spots are basically the same as  that
for acoustic sensitive spots, the measures for planting trees in these places can produce
'effects in both two aspects. For the spacing in the rows when planting trees, reference the
'Technical  Regulations  for  Environoental    Protection  Designing  of Highway  Constructive
Projects".
(2) Strictly examine vehicle exhausts by selectively sampling at toll stations and vehicles
with exhausts exceeding the standard are not be allowed to run on the highway.

(4) Cargo vehicles which leak and overloaded vehicles are not allowed to run
on the highway to prevent them from polluting the water body.
(5) An emergency leading group consisted by the High- Class Highway Management Bureau of
Hubei Province and EP Bureau of Hubei Province has been organized in project m  which  is  for
dealing with the leakage accidants of dangerous article specially. Now, this group is in charge
of the management of dangerous article transportation on this proposed expressway simultaneously.
(6) Vehicles which carry dangerous goods cannot run on the highway until they are examined
and approved by the Management Zone of Southern  Section in Hubei Province of Jingzhu    Line.
The Management Zone will strictly oDnitor and control them in order to prevent accidents.

658.4  Obxtruction of Traffic
Being a linaer construction project on  the ground,   the proposed highway  will make  it
inconvenient for villagers in ome villages to coemnicate,  such  as  farming  in  the  fields,
visiting relatives and going shopping. To solve this problew    it  is planned  to build  190
p asgeways which can basically meet the requirement for normal comunication and work of the
people along the route  It is recanemded that the cOnStrUction of passages and the ain part of
the project should be completed at the ame time and opinions from the people along the route
should be solicited in good time. Passageways should ensure the ease of passage of agricultural
machinery and the fact that there is a plentiful supply of rain in this area should be
thoroughly considered when designing the underpasses.
5.8.6 Afforestation
(1) Besides planting trees on the roadside near sensitive areas, such as villages and schools,
trees,   shrubs and grass should be planted in the rest areas along the highway, so that    the
plantation- belt will be formed.
(2) Trees and grass should be planted in the  service zones and management zones  and    at
interchanges to improve the eavironment.

VI ALTERNATIVE SCHEMES
6.1 Route Alignment of the CoNmpratiVe Schene
In the determination procedure of alignment scheme, consultations and discussions are made
ay times among designing unit (Hubei Provincial Comunication Planning and Designing Institute)
ZIA unit( lian Highway Transportation  University) ,  government agencies,  environmental
protection departments, city planning departments, deputies to the National People's Congress,
and affected masses along the proposed highway. To eliinate the unfavorable impacts by the
highway construction, the route makes detour to  avoid big villages,   schools,   military
installations, etc. I the man time, the route avoids lakes as far away as possible to
eliminate the impacts on water bodies. Upon the synthetic consideration of engineering, economic,
environmental and resettlement elements, 4 alternative schemes are  put forward,   which are
Xianning Scheme I, Xianning Scheme II,  ianning Scheme m and Jiayu Scheme. In the feasibility
study report compiled before Oct. 1996, the lianuing Scheme II  was the recommended scheme,
while the other three schemes (lianning Scheme I, ianning Scheme EJ, and Jiayu  Scheme)   were
all comparative schemes. After Oct. 1996, a long time of study had been done by the CPDIHP
following the suggestions of world Bank esperts and taking into considerations of environmental
impacts. As a result, the Xianning Scheme j is determined as the recomended scheme in Mar.1998,
while the other three scbemes are all comparative schemes. Among the three comparative schemes,
the lianning Scheme nI is determined as the main comparative scheme.
The route alignment of the comparative schemes are as follows:
The start point of the main comparative scheme (  lianning  Scheme II    is  at Shenshan,
extending southward, the route passes the highland between Xiliang lake and Futou lake- - -
-4antang, getting to Quankou of Puqi City, where connecting to the recommended scheme ( Xianning
scheme I). The connecting point is K272+962.463 which is K260+DOO  of comparative  line.   The
total length of the main comparative scheme ( Xisning Schemell)is 102. 831km, while the total
length of the recommended scheme is 109. 815km. The alignments of the other two comparative
scheme (Xianning Scheme m and Jiayu Scheme) are shown in Figure 6-1.
6.2 Comparison of the Alternative Schemes
6. 2.1 Comparison of the Four Schemes
The synthetic comparison among the four schemes (hianning Scheme I    Xianning  Scheme II.
lianning Scheme m and Jiayu Scheme) is listed in  Table 6- 1.   Analysis of advantages and
disadvantages is listed in Table 6-2. From Table 6-1 and Table 6- 2,  we can  see  that the
investment payoff period of Xianning Scheme m and Jiayu Scheme will be longer than 23.5 years,
thus from the point view of economic, the construction of this project will have no realistic
meaning. In these two schemes, the route lengths involved in the Xiliang LAke flood storage and
detention area are all rather long, and the potential impacts on the water environment is
rather serious. Therefore Xiaming Scheme m and Jiayu Scheme are all voted down.
The further specific comparison are made mainly between Xianning SchemeI and Xianning Scheme
nI.
6.2.2 Comparison of Xianning SchemeI and Xianning Scheme H
The comparisons of the lianning  Scheme I and  lianning  Scheme II  from  the  specific
environmental impact elements as atmosphere, acoustic, waters, ecology, etc. are shown in Table
6-3.
In table 6-3, risk of flood refers to the length of road section of alternative schemes
passing Xiliang Lake flood storage and detention area, where the terrain is rather low,    so

later environmental impact refers to the impact of risks in dangerous article transport
during operation and the impact of bridge construction on the river water quality along the
expresmy. These impacts have a direct relationship with the total  widthes    of river  and
lakes that the proposed highvay will pass over. That is to say, from the amount of widthes of
rivers and lakes we can *ee the impacted scope.
Public opinion refers to the opinions from government agencies along the  route.   Generally
speaking, it is said that lianning SchemeI has a  reasonable  alignme¢t,   which    is    *ore
favorable for domestic comzunication than the lianning Schemell, and can greatly promote the
development of ocial oconomy.
Soil erosion refers to the yearly erosion volume during construction stage.
From Table 6-3, we can see that the number of acoustic and air sensitive spots and voluve of
water loss and soil erosion of the two schemes are similar,  however,   by  the   impact   on
surface water quality, historical relics and flood risk we can find   liaming  Scheme  I   is
slightly better than liaming Scheme fl. Besides above factors,       lianning  Scheme  I      is
welcomed much more than  Xianning Scheme E[ by  the  local governments.   Therefore,        from
the environmental point of view,  Liaming Scheme I is superior to limanng Scheme  .
658 Conclusion
For synthetic comparing from engineering, economic, environmental and resettlement elements
of the two alternative schemes ( lianming Scheme I and lianning Scheme Ei ) ,   the  Analytical
Hierarchy Process of systems engineering is adopted in the calculation to make distinction
between the good and the bad. See Appendix 3 for the specific calculation process.
According to the result of the calculation, the comparison conclusion can be reached that
lianning Scheme I is superior to lianning Scheme II.

I AOSS AND BENEFTr ANALYSIS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
7.1  Investment Fadtiration of Environraental Protection
7.1.1  avestment for Environmrental Protection Engineering
Based on the environmental protection easures suggested in this assessment, the lump- sum
cost of environmental protection engineering needed for this project is estimated and shown in
Table 7-1. Total lump-sum investment for environmnmtal protection is 29,092,000 yuan
7.1.2 Yearly Operational Cost of Environmental Protection Facilities
See table 7-2 for the yearly operational cost of environmental protection facilities. Thtal
operation cost in the 20 years long operation stage is 20 year x705, 000 yuan - 14,100,000 yuan.
7. 1. 3 Comparison of Environmental Protection Costs and Project Costs
The estimated total cost of the project- the Southern  Section  in  Hubei  Province    of
the Jingzhu National Trunk Highway is 3908. 0715  million  yuan.   The  cost  of  environmental
protection is 43.1920 million yuan, taking up 1.11% of the total investmcent in this project.
This shows that the cost of environmental protection is not a major part in the total
investment of this project, and the environmental pollution of this project is not serious.
7.2  Analysis of Environmental L-oss and Benefit
7.2.1 Analysis of the Environmental Benefit of the Project
(1) Reduction of Exhausts from Vehicles and the Related Pollution of Surface Water, Soil and
Crops
Prom the point of view of the quality of the natural  environment,   the  exhaust  gas  per
vehicle per mileage on the future expressway will be reduced compared with that on the second
-class, third-class and fourth-class highways. As the pollution of surface water, soil,   crops
and atmosphere is related directly to   vehicle  exhausts   during  the  service period,   the
construction of the expressway will greatly reduce vehicle exhausts. As a result, every kinds
of pollution caused by traffic will be reduced also.
As shown in some data"21, for the same running distance vehicle exhausts on the expressway
is greatly reduced compared with that on a Class-Two  highway.   For  vehicles  running  on  an
expressway reductions of 47% in CO, 48% in RC and 35% in NOX are obtained compared with that on
Class-Two,highways, which indicates the evident beneficial effect of the expressway.
(29) Reduction of Noise pollution
More and more buildings are being built near the roadsides because of the low awareness of
the harm of environment pollution of the existing Class-Two or Class-Three highways. Therefore,
the residents near the roadsides of the highway will be more and more seriously affected by
traffic noise and vehicle exhausts with the increase in traffic volume.
With the  opening  of  the  expressway  to  traffic,   scientific  planning  and  reasonable
environmental protection measures, there won't be any street-like sections of expressway and
the effect of pollution on the people living on both sides of the highway can be reduced by way
of diverting the traffic from existing highways.

7.2.2 Analysis of the Environmental Benefit of Environmental Protection Costs
(1) Direct Benefit
As the traffic volume of Jingzhu National Trunk Highway is large, vehicle exhausts will
pollute the atmospheric and water environment, dust and noise will impact on the environmental
quality in residential areas; the health of people living on both sides of the highway will be
affected to some extent and the normal life and work of these people will be affected as well.
Therefore, practical environmental protection measures must be taken, such as sound proofing
measures and  plantation on road section near  sensitive  spots  to  reduce    the    negative
effects on the environment along the route caused by traffic.
After taking environmental protection measures, the economic loss that can be retrieved each
year or the direct economic benefit of environmental protection will be about 2.5 million yua
which includes the net output value lost because of workers illness caused by    traffic  noise
and atmospheric pollution; the medical  expenditure  on  illness  caused  by  pollution;   the
expenditure from social  welfare  funds  on  illness  and death  caused  by  pollution;   the
devaluation in real estate in polluted sections; the loss of means of production and livelihood,
etc, when environmental protection measures are not takenL The calculation is based on an
analogical analysis of EIS of the Pekai Expressway and the Tulufan-Urumqi-Dahuanshan Expressway,
when considering the factors such as population density and  the    economic  level  along  the
proposed highway.
(2) Indirect Benefit
If no effective environmental protection measures were taken along the proposed highway,
there would be some indirect negative effects, such as the reduction of the quality of teaching
and the quality of life, the agitation of people and social instability factors, etc.. in the
affected areas. Therefore, after some environmental protection measures are taken,   the above
entioned negative effects will not arise and be replaced by positive benefits as a result of
this environmental protection investment.
7.2.8 Analysis of Environmental LIogs and Benefit
The following formula is used to analyze the economic loss and benefit of the environmental
protection measures.
83

B- ( :81) / E
i-l
Ihere
Bj- economic benefit of environmental protection expenditure
S8-   economic loss that can be retrieved each year after environmental protection measmres
are taken
E - expenditure of environmental protection investment per year
By analogical estimation mentioned above, after effective environmental protection measures
are taken, the economic loss that can be retrieved per year will be 2.6 million yuan and there
will be numerous uncountable indirect economic and social benefits. The expenditure used for
environment protection is on the yearly average 2 1596 million yuan and the economic benefit for
environment protection each year is Em1. 16>1. This value of Ej illustrates that the investment
of environment protection is reasonable. Thus, it is of great importance to execute the
environmental protection measures suggested  in  the BlA  when    building  the  highway.   The
construction unit should take environmental protection measures step by step as suggested in the
assessment to ensure the coordinate and sustainable development of construction and
environmental protection.

1l PLAN FOR ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION
8.1 Plan for Environment Management
8.1.1  Environment Management Agencies and Reisponsibilities
Agencies for Environmental protection of this project can be divided into two part,
management agencies and supervision agencies. See Fig. 8-1.

High-Class Highway Administrative Bureau  of  HPCD    Be  in  charge  of  the  execution  of
environmental protection measures and the checking and accepting of their construction.   There
are 2 specialists responsible for EP management of the proposed highway
Highway Environmental Monitoring Unit: has been organized  in  project  m  .   Environmental
monitoring work during construction & operation stage can be undertaken by the provincial
highway monitoring unit, or be entrusted to environmental monitoring station of prefecture   or
cities.
During construction stage of this project, 6 environmental supervising engineers will be
sent by WB Loan Project Office of HPCD to supervise execution of EAP and EP measures regulated
in contract.
(2) Supervision Agencies
NEPA: the summit authority at the central government for administration of national
environmental  protection,    including  overall  in  charge  of  the  environmental  projection
management of projects, examining and approval the terms of reference of  EIA,   examining  and
85



approwal of KIA report, directing the provincial onvironmental protecting bureaus to implement
various lams and regulations.
PEMI- Be in charge of project EP  supervision  and  administration,   organization    and
coordinating of project environental protection service provided by  different departments,
exaining EIA report, or entrusted by the NEPA examining & approval of term of refereace of
ZIA  and  EIA report; supervision of implementation of environmental   protection    action
plan;   check  and  acceptance    of   project    environmental    protection    facilities;
identifying  applicable  laws, regulations  and    standards    for    project    environmental
protection,   directing  environmental protection departments  or divisions  at  municipal or
district level for project enviromental protection maDagement during project construction
and operation periods.
Prefecture, Cities *or District EPE: receive instruction from EPEPB; supervising execution
of   P by construction units;  administration  of  the  EP  management  laws &  regulations;
coordinating HP works of concerning agencies, supervision of project EP facility construction,
check and acceptance, operation, within their jurisdiction areas.
8.1.2   Plan  of  Environmental  Management and Environmental Supervision
The plans for environmental management and supervision are shown in Table 8-1 & 8-2.
8.2 Environmental Monitoring Plan
8.2.1  Monitoring Purpose
The environmental impact during construction stage mainly includes river water pollution
caLused by construction of bridge; noise from construction machines,   soil  erosion  caused  by
earth and stone cutting & filling, flying dust and asphalt smoke from the mixing  plants,   and
other pollution. During operation stage, the impact on environment is mainly by traffic
exhausting gas, flying dust, and noise, serious pollution caused by emergent accident Therefore,
it is necessary to understand the environmental situations and development trend to improve
environmental management service in implementation of monitoring plan.
8.2.2 Monitoring Agencies
Environmental monitoring work in construction & operation is in charged by Hubei Provincial
Highway Environmental Monitoring Unit. This agency has been organized in project mI[ already. The
monitoring work of proposed expressway is also taken care by it.
8.2.3 Monitoring Plan
The routine monitoring work is undertaken by the Hubei Provincial Highway Environmental
Monitoring Unit. See (1) * (3) in monitoring plan of table 8-3.
The key points in monitoring is air,  water   and  noise.  According  to  the  requirement of

Monitoring equipment in project m can be uset in this project too, no acquisition for new
equipment. Because the utilization ratio of the environoental monitoriyg equipment in Project mI
is only 25%.b so it is possible tbat the environmntal monitoring equipment in Project m can be
shared with Project N-.
Monitoring cost during construction: 40, OOOyuanlyear x 8. Syear- 140, 000 yuan;
During operation: 30, OOOyuanlyear x20year= 600, 000 yuan;
Contingent accident monitoring cost (unforeseen): 50,000 yun

IX   PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ITS ANALYSIS
9.1 Scope of and Method for Pubic Participation
In Dec.1997, the ZIA group of this project made public surveys in the areas that will be
affected by the proposed highway in Jiangxia district,  Xianning City and Puqi City. We  held
meetings and delivered questionnaires to collect opinions fromD representatives of NPC (
National People's Congress) , people's governments at different levels, social  organizations
along  the route, and especally the people in the affected area on both sides of the  route.
'We  also consulted environmental protection  organizations,     agricultural organizations,
forestry organizations and transportation organizations about environmental protection along
the route. 250 peoples from 30 villages took part in the meetings and consultations, and
76 questionnaires were collected. See appendix 4.
9.2 Opinions and Requirements from the impacted people and Social Organizations in
the Affected Areas
9.2.1 On-the-Spot Survey and Public Opinions
Along the Lianning Scheme I, the hearings were carried out in Dec. 1997. The 30 villages
related and the names of some participants were shown in appendix IV. The hearings along the
connecting roads were also carried out in Dec. 1997 . The issues discussed (e. g. the impact
of noise and air pollution, social disruption caused by the Expressway, restricted access to
the highway. etc.) with the villagers and the opinions from the participants ( the impacted
people ,  social organizations and  peoples governments along the proposed  highway  )   are
summarized as follows.
(1) The impacted people along the proposed highway are concerned at compensation of land
acquisition and resettlement. They asked that compensation should be executed according to the
requirements of state policies.
(2) 92.8% people  in  the  affected  area  along   the    proposed  highway  asked  to  be
resettled in their own villages when they have to move.
(3) Most of the impacted people worries about the inconvenience in future visiting and
shopping caused by the separation of the proposed expressway.   It  is  asked  that fly  over
bridges and passage ways be built near these villages.
(4) When we talking about the impact problems of noise and exhausting gas with villagers,
they asked that protection measures be adopted or moving to a suitable place far away from the
expressway but still in their own village.
(5) Teachers of the impacted schools ask for construction of surrounding walls to minimize
noise and protect safety of their students.
(6) Villagers in the area passed by linking roads shown a much warmer attitude to the
construction of the proposed project than the villagers in the area passed by expressway,   we
found almost no complain from the former.
(7) All the governments at city or county level welcomed the highway sections to pass
96



through the area under their own administration, especially the goverment, NPC ( National
People's Congre) and highwy transportation organization of lianning City. They  sincerely
expressed that limaing Scheme I will benefit the economic development of liming prefecture.
(8) It is ase that at leant 1 interchange be built in each city and district and passages
be built for vehicles or the public at places where the proposed highay crosses over the
existing highways and places ner any big villages in all the cities and district that the
route passes thromugh

9.2.2 Statistical Reult of Public Participation
The statistical results of public participation are shown in Table 9-1 and discussed as the
following.
(1) The Public's Un4erstanding of the Project
Amog the investigated people, 53. 9% understood the highway very well, 36. 8% understood a
little. On the item of whether agree to the route alignment, 30. 3% knew nothing of it. Therefore,
it is necessary to increase publicity about the construction of the highway.
(2) Attitude towards the Highway Construction
It is shown in table 9-1 that 56.6% of the public were not satisfied with the existing
traffic situation, 35. 5% of the public were basically satisfied and 7. 9% were quite satisfied.
Concerning the public attitude towards the construction of the highway as shown in Table 9- 1,
96. 1% of the public hoped that it would be built as soon as possible. It can be see   that,
the public hope the construction of this project would greatly  change  the    present   poor
transport situation.
(3) Understanding of the Environmental Impact of the Project
In the investigation, most of the people (85. 5%) thought that the proposed highway would
slightly affect the residential and the living enviromtent and 98.7% of them believed that the
construction of the highway would be favorable for local economic development.
(4) Requirement about Removal and Resettlement
92. 8; people hoped that they be resettled in their own village.
9.3 Analysi of Public Participation and Solutions to Problems
(1) It is shown in the above investigation result that the governments,    representatives
of NPC, social organizations and the public living in the affected areas along the route all
warmly welcome the proposed highway and hope that it could be open to traffic as soon as
possible. In terms of removal and resettlement, 92. 8% of the people required that they be
resettled in their own village and expressed that they would comply with the plans of the
state if there were some contradictions.  During  the  construction  of the proposed highway,
the  Construction unit of the Southern Section in Hubei Province of the Jingzhu    National
Trunk Highway should act in close coordination with the local governments and National
People's Congress at different Levels, collect opinions and requirements from  the  public
in  time  and  strictly executes state  rules  and regulations about  land   acquisition,
removal and resettlement and compensation. Resettlements of the families should be arranged
in their own villages as far as possible.
(2) As to the 'exits and entrancesf of the proposed highway required by governments along
the route, it had been considered thoroughly in the Feasibility Study Report on this project.
Ensure 1 to 2 interchanges set for every City or District. Average distance between
interchanges is 18. 5km, which can meet the demand for connection between the existing highways
and the proposed highway.
(3) Because most of the impacted people worries about the inconvenience in future visiting
and shopping caused by the separation of the proposed expressway, the designing unit plans to
set 190 passage ways along the line to satisfy the requirements of local residents.   As for
the total 109. 815km long expressway, the average distance between passage ways is 0. 58km,
98



which can basically meet the needs of the local people for comunication and farming.
lhen designing and constructing passages, it is suggested tbat drainag measures to be given
special attention and ensure that mechinery used for agriculture  can  pass   under  them  to
reduce the negative effects of the highway construction upon the  local people   as  far as
possible.
(4) To the noise poklution problems ooncerning by the impacted people and teachers of the
impacted schools, specific analysis and studies with concrete measures have been made already
in this assessment report. AmOng the 146 impact villages and schcols, there are 115 ensitive
spots whose noise situation for long operation period my  surpas  the  standard.   Suitable
aitigption measures will adopted for all of these spots. In the execution procession of the
measures, more consultations will be done for the impacted people. Satisfaction of the impacted
people will be achieved in the end.
From the above analysis, it can be seen clearly that the suggestions and requirements
arising from public participation have  been  given  a  thorough    consideration    at    the
preparation stage of the highway, and a few unreasonable suggestions such as the coment of
not enclosing the expressway, which are against the state plans, were not adopted.
In order to know the coments about the construction of the project and the attitude of the
public toward the  mitigative  measures  in  the EZA,   public  hearings  were  held  by  the
Environmental Assessment Panel of Xian Highway University and the designers of Communication
Planning and Design Institute of Hubei Province among the moasses concerned in Jan.  1999.   In
short words, the public likely to be affected by the project is in favor of the mitigation
measures in the report of EIA, expressing very high enthusiasm in construction of the highway
as one of the state key projects. They express their genuine thanks to the World Bank and the
Chinese Government for concerns about the issues of environmental protection in the highway
construction. The major schools    and  villages  investigated  are:   Laosi  Primary  School,
Maowuling Village, Guanghui Primary School, Zhunao Primary School, Xinwuxia Village, Leowuxia
Villge and Tucheng Village etc.

X   CONSLUSION
The following conclusions can be made on the basis of the assessment results of the
environmental impact:
10.1 Assessment Conclusion of the Present Environment
(1) Farm crops (vegetables) and soil environmental quality along the route have not polluted
by Pb yet. Organic matters content of soil has met the average level of Hubei Province.
(2) Altogether 7 monitoring spots (villages or schools )  along  the  route  of noise  all
satisfied class 1, GB3096-93 noise standard.
(3) Among the 5 rivers monitoried, water quality of 3 rivers are Class II, other two rivers
are Class m, all reached or better than the demand of Class m  in GB3838-88.
(4) Ambient air quality along the route is quite good. 5 air monitoring spots distributed in
town, village or school all satisfied class 2 in Ambient Air Quality Standard ( GB3095-1996).
Prom above conditions of specific aspects, we can see that the ambient air is fresh and pure
the surface water is clean, the surroundings are quiet and secluded and the quality  of crops
and soil are good, so the present state of quality of the environment is good in the areas
along the route of National Highway Project IV in Hubei Province.
The quality of ambient air, surface water and acoustic environment satisfies the corresponding
environmental quality standards determined by Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau.
10.2 Prediction and Assessment Conclusion of Environmental Impact
10.2.1 Stages of Design and Construction
(1) The scheme of the proposed highway is supported by the local governments and most of the
people along the route, therefore, the work of land acquisition and removal and resettlement
can be done properly if it is administered methodically.
(2) From the environmental point of view, the recommended scheme is considered slightly
superior to the comparative scheme.
(3) The impacts upon the ecological environment during highway construction are the
occupation of farmland; damage to vegetation; and loss  of water and    soil.  They  can  be
alleviated if environmental protection  measures are  undertaken,   such  as  the  reasonable
selection of route alignment, the  timely  recovery  of  farmland  and   the    building    of
intercepting ditches, retaining walls and settling basins.
(4) As to the impact upon  the  surface  water  environment during  construction,   if  the
administration are strengthened and suggestions are carried out , the quality of surface water
will not be obviously polluted.
(5) The impacts upon acoustic and air environmental quality during construction are mainly
100



the noise of construction machinery, dust and asphalt smog pollution. The environmental quality
of life and teaching in sensitive spots, such as villages and schools along the route will not
be affected to a great extent if the measures such as reasonable construction schedule, proper
sites of asphalt concrete mixing plants and lime soil mixers, sprinkling at proper time and
covering with canvas, etc. are implemented.
(6) There is no distribution of rare animals and plants in the assessment area along the
proposed highway, therefore, the construction of it will h.tve no effect on them.
(7) The construction of the proposed highway shouldn't be started until the two sits with
cultural relics have been excavated and protected. During the period of the design and
construction of the highway,  if new  cultural  relics,  especially  those underground    were
discovered,   the  construction  unit  should      execute  protective  measures  and  make    a
timely  report  to  cultural relics department.  Make solving program    according    to    the
Protection Law for Cultural Relics of the State.
10.2.2 Operation Stage
(1) Lead content in traffic dust and exhaust gas are the primary reasons caused the impact
on ecological environment during operation stage. However, because of the little amount of dust
worn on the surface of plants,  and  the  abundant  precipitation,   influence  of  traffic  is
relatively light. According to the prognosis of lead content in soil, in the end of year 2022
,it will still remain a large range between the lead content in soil and the limitation of
standard (calculated by vehicle exhausted lead).
(2) Culverts and pipes will be built to mitigate the infavorable impact on the farmland
drainage system by the passing expressway.
(3) The road surface runoff will have little impact on water quality of the rivers. But, some
measures should be taken to prevent the fish-ponds from pollution. The administration of the
transport of dangerous and poisonous cargoes should be enhanced in order to prevent water
pollution caused by traffic accidents.
(4) Sewage of toll station and managemental zones will be treated by septic tank before
using in irrigation, which can solve the pollution problem of surface water by waste water
utilization Sewage of service zones and rest zones will be treated by small style waste
water treatment station to attain standard before discharging
(5) During the service time of the highway, the traffic noise may affect the acoustic quality
to a certain extent, especially near residential  quarters  and  schools.   When  environmental
protection measures are taken, the reasonable teaching and living conditions can be assured.
(6) During the long operation stage (in year 2022), the exhausts from vehicles will reduce
the ambient air quality along  the  route  ,   but  the  affected  area  is  not  large.   When
environmental protection measures are taken, ambient air pollution can be alleviated.
(7) It is shown in the analysis of the environmental economic loss and benefit that the
social and economic benefit is remarkable to carry on these environmental protection measures
suggested in this EIS. With the development of the local economy and the increase in traffic
volume, the traffic noise, exhausts from vehicles and pollutants from  roadway  runoff    would
seriously affect the acoustic, air and water environmental quality along the existing highways
if the proposed highway were not built. Therefore, the construction of the proposed highway with
reasonable planning and proper environmental protection measures being carried on will greatly
improve the quality of the local environment.
In brief, the constructive project- the Southern Section in Hubei Province of Jingzhu
101



National Trunk Highway (roject IV)- will be of great significance in accelerating regional
economic developuent; improving the present state of transportation; improving the uZdiL ion for
investment and prooting the developeent of the tourist  industry.   The  construction  of  the
project will result in some negative environmental effects along the route,  such as  losS  of
land resources, damage to vegetation and the reduction of environmental quality, etc. But when
corresponding measuresr are taken, the negative effects upon the environment can be alleviated
or eliminated. The negative effects can  be  allowed  by  the environment.   Therefore,   this
assessment believes that the construction of the Southern Section in Hubei Province of Jingzhu
National Trunk Highway is feasible.

Investigation Report of Historical Relics and Distribution Map
A CULTURAL HERITAGE SURVEY AND RECONNAISSANCE
REPORT
THE SOUTH SECTION OF JING-ZHU HIGHWAY IN HUBEI PROVINCE
AS THE
NATIONAL TRUNK LINE (PROJECT  IV)
The south section of Jing-Zhu Highway in Hubei Province (Highway Project IV)
with a total length of 111 km passes through Jiangxia District of the City of Wuhan
and the Cities of Xianning and Puqi of Xianning Prefecture the topography of which is
characterized with low hills and plains with lakes and low lands. To respond to the
17th and 18th articles of " Cultural Heritage Act of China " and the document on
enhancing cultural heritage protection in Hubei Province, Hubei Cultural Heritage and
Archaeology Institute, entrusted by the Hubei Transportation Planning and Design
Institute, has conducted a cultural heritage survey and reconnaissance concerning the
south section of Jing-Zhu Highway (Project I V). The report of the findings is as
follows:
1. Location of the Cultural Relics
On the basis of the sufficient survey and reconnaissance, 8 cultural relics sites
have been identified, 2 of which are involved in the recommended scheme (Xianning
East Line Scheme) with the other 6 sites involved in the alternative scheme (Xianning
Scheme).
Considering the heritage protection, we suggest that the highway be constructed
using the recommended scheme (Xianning East Line Scheme).
The brief introduction to the two sites is as follows:
A. Lubiangao Site
Being located in Lubiangaowan, Xianglin Village, Henao Township, Jiangxia
District, Wuhan, it is placed on a terrace with an area of about 10.000 square meters
and a deposit thickness of 1.5-2.0 meters. Pottery cooking vessels, pottery cooking
pots and pottery basins have been found. The research shows that these relics belong
to the New Stone Age--Shang and Zhou Periods. The area involved covers 240 square
meters.
B. Tucheng Site
Being located south of Tucheng Village, Xindian Town, Puqi in Xianning
104



Prefecture. It is placed on a terrace with an area of about 30.000 square meters and a
deposit thickness of 1.2-1.5 meters. Pottery stemmed cups, pottery pots, pottery
bowls and earthenware pipes have been found. The research shows that these relics
belong to Shang ind Zhou Periods-West and East Han Periods. The area involved
covers about 480 square meters.
2.  The Plan for Protection and Excavation of the Relics
A. The two remains sites on the recommended line needs archaeological
excavation. Based on the 20th article in "Cultural Heritage Protection Act of the
P.R.C.", the cost for excavation will be included in the budget of the project cost . It is
our plan that as soon as the fund is ready, the excavation will commence. It is
estimated that the excavation will need 30-35 days.
B. The excavation activities will strictly follow "Regulations for the Field
Archaeology Activities" to guarantee scientific excavation and to obtain detailed and
true data. The cultural data got in the field excavation will be kept properly and safely
for use of scientific research.
C. The highway construction activities on the two sites mentioned above are not
permitted until the excavation is finished. If any other cultural heritage sites are found
in the construction of the project, the cultural authorities will be informed of and
proper protection measures will be taken.
D. In the excavation, the site will be guarded by the construction agencies and the
workers will be told to protect the relics.
3.   Estimated Cost for Excavation
On the basis of the "Budget Quota Management for Archaeology Survey,
Reconnaissance and Excavation" issued by the State Culture Heritage Administrative
Bureau, the cost for the excavation of the two sites is estimated as 60.000 yuan ,with
20.000 for Lubiangao Sites and 40.000 for Tucheng Site.

Analytical Hierarchy Process for Scheme Comparison
1. Establishment of Hierarchy Structure Model
To aim at the optimum scheme for highway construction,   analyticalcomparison  between  two
alternative  schemes  is  made according  to  the  criterions  from  engineering,   economic,
environmental and resettlement elements. There are three hierarchies. The first one is aim
hierarchy A; while the second is criterion hierarchy C, including four items of criterions as C,
Ca, C., C4; and the third is the plan(or scheme) hierarchy P, including two plans (or schemes)
as P., P2. The ladder style Hierarchy Structure 15odel is shown in Fig. 1

Figl. Hierarchy Structure Model
2. Formation of the diagnostic matrix
Based on the Hierarchy Structure Model, the diagnostic matrix A-C is formed as follows:
A     C,   C2   C3   C4
G. C   .__   C   G.L
C2   C21   C=   C23  C24
Ca    Ca,  C82  Cas  Ca.
C4    C41  C4.2  C.   C..
According to the informations in table 1 and the 1-9 standardization method in table 2,
111



values of the coefficients Ci in the diagpostic m_trix A- C are determined considering the
following aspects:
(1) The purpose of highway construction is to achieve a relatively high economic benefit
with a rather low investment, so engineering elements are considered to be inferior to economic
elements.
(2) Sustainable development of environmental protection with economy is the fundamental
development policy of our country, then economic elements are as the same importance as the
environmental elements.
(3) From (1)(2), we know that environmental elements are superior to engineering elements.
(4) Comparing engineering elements with resettlement elements,   the  resettlement problem
lasts a relatively short period of time,   and  the  economic  lost  for  resettlement can  be
compensated by the benefit of the project. However, engineering elements lasts a very long
period of time during construction and operation phases. Therefore, engineering elements are
slightly superior to resettlement elements.
(5) From(2)(4), we know economic and environmental elements are rather superior to
resettlement elements,
Then the diagnostic matrix A-C is determined as:
A     C.   C2   CS   C.
C,   1      1/5   1/5   3
C,    5    1      1     7
Co    5     1     1     7
C.    1/3  1/7   1/7   1

Compare Ci with Cj
The advantage level of C, and Cj is equal                                1
C, is slightly superior to Cj                                            3
Ci is superior to Cj                                                     5
C, is rather superior to Cj                                              7
C, is much more superior to Cj                                           9
C, is slightly inferior to C,                                           1/3
C, is inferior to Cj                                                    1/5
C, is rather inferior to C,                                             1/7
C, is much more inferior to Cj                                          1/9
Note: 'superior' and I inferior" here refer to 'importance'
The diagnostic matrices C1-P, C,-P, C6-P and C4-P are also determined identically-

8. EHerarchy Individual Arrangement
Characteristic vector and characteristic root of the matrices above are calculated.
The largest characteristic vector of the diagnostic matrices A-C is:
W - (11, W2,. W,) = (0.103, 0.424, 0.4424, 0. 050)
In which, the four components of the vector are the weights of the four items of criterions
as C,, C2, Ca, C. in criterion hierarchy C.
Characteristic root 1A,   is
4 (CW0),i
=4. 072
i=l   n W
The identical index CI for test of the diagnostic matrix A-C is:
A   -n       4.072-4
CI =            = -         = 0. 024
n-i         4-1
The average random identical index RI for test of the diagnostic four rank matrix A-C is:
RI=0.90
Therefore, the random identical index CR for test of the diagnostic matrix A-C is:
CI     0.0924
CR = - = - = 0. 027
RI      0.9
Obviously, matrix A-C has satisfactory identity, which is CR=O.0027< 0.1, so the values of
weight in W can be used.
Identically, the calculation result of diagnostic matrix Cl-P is:
W - (0. 25, 0. 75), A max=2, CI-0, CR=0.
113



The calculation result of diagnostic matrix Ca-P is: I - (0. 83, 0. 17), la max-2, CI-0, Cl0
The calculation result of diagnostic mtrix Ca-P is:W - (0. 75,0.25). Amx-2, CI-0, C-a
The calculation result of diagnostic matrix CQ-P is: I - (0. 83, 0.17), A masx2, CI0, CR4
All mtrices have satisfactory identity, then all the values of weight in W can be used.
4. Hierarchy TotalArrangement
Fill the data from hierarchy individual arrangement in the table of hierarchy total
arrangecent (table 3). The values of the four items of criterions C1, Ca, Cs, C. in   criterion
hierarchy C are 0. 103, 0.424, 0. 424, 0. 050, which are filled into the second line of the table;
The values of the hierarchy P corresponding to C1, C., Ca. C. are filled into the second, third
fourth, fifth column respectively in the table. As to the total object, values of weight in
the two schemes are:
P. = 0. 103xO 25+0.424xO 83+0. 424xO 75+0. 050xO 83 = 0.738
P2 - 0.103x0. 75+0.4Ax0. 17+0424x0. 25+0 050x0. 17 - 0.262
From the analysis above, we know that Scheme I is superior to SchemeIl.
