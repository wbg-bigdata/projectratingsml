                         least one bed net. The mass distribution of bed nets in the Coast province, and the highlands districts of Bomet, Sotik and Buret has been done, reaching the project target of 80%,
                         but will need to be confirmed by the programmed post distribution survey. TB drugs have also been procured and distributed, and condoms have continued to be available and
                         distributed, with the last procurement having been received in the country in April.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project status is satisfactory and over10,000 civil society/private sector organizations received grants for HIV prevention and mitigation measures. Performance of three-fourths of
                         such grantees is rated good or excellent and over 6, individuals received HIV counseling. There is also an increased use of condoms among the youth and nearly 80% of households
                         in malaria endemic districts supported by the project have at least one net. The project has been restructured to allow for realloation of funds across categories and an extension of
                         the project for another six months to December 31, 2013.
