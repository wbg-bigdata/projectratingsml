MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL TRAING PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan of US$115.8 million equivalent
to the Government of Turkey, is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be for a term of seventeen years, including four years grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, and would help finance an industrial training
*        project.
2.       Background.  Industrial production and, in particular, manufactured
*        exports have been the mainstay of the sustained economic growth experienced since
1981. Between 1980 and 1985, manufactured exports grew by almost 41 percent per
year, which doubled industry's share in exports from 36 percent to 75 percent.
However, the industrial sector faces major technological problems that could
jeopardize future export growth and the competitiveness of Turkish goods in
European and other overseas markets. These problems which include low labor
productivity, poor product quality, low design and engineering capability, weak
production management skills, and poor preventive maintenance of plants and
equipment, are linked to the serious shortage of highly skilled technicians and
specialized manpower in the country. Industrial employers frequently report that
well-trained technicians, particularly in exporting industries which require high
standards of quality control, modern production techniques and specialized
machinery, are in short supply. These qualitative labor market signals have been
confirmed by an industrial training needs survey conducted in early 1986 to
assess the demand for technicians in export-oriented manufacturing industries.
Survey results indicate that a minimum of 12,500 additional higher-level
technicians would be required by manufacturing industries in Turkey during the
five-year period 1986-90.
3.       The scarcities of skilled technical manpower in Turkey point to
insufficient investments in human resource development in general, and to
inadequate industrial training in particular. Programs for the training of bona
fide technicians are qua'litatively and quantitatively lacking both within the
formal education system and in the private sector. The Council of Higher
Education (YhK) is the key Government agency responsible for training
higher-level technicians in Turkey through its system of two-year, post-secondary
Vocational Schools of Higher Education (VSHEs). These VSHEs suffer, however,
from an over-formalized approach to training, inadequate premises, out-dated
curricula, almost no equipment and a shortage of appropriately-trained
instructors. Furthermore, YiK has limited institutional capacity to carry out
effectively coordinated planning and supervision of the technician training
system.
4.       A scheme is now being implemented by YoK to upgrade systematically
selected VSHEs so that they are more capable of meeting the needs of industry.
As a first step, eight VSHEs are being developed into industrially-oriented
Technician Training Centers (TTCs) with assistance from the Bank under the
ongoing Industrial Training Project (Loan 2399-TU). Although total annual output
from these eight TTCs would be about 1,200 technicians from 1991 onwards, the
results cf a pre-investment study included in the same project indicate that
further expansion of the technician training system is neccessary to meet
projected requirements for technicians in industry. Based on the findings of
this pre-investment study, the Government has requested further Bank assistance
in developing an additional 20 TTCs.



-2-
5.       One of the priority areas identified for action in the Bank's 1986
survey of the education and training sector was selective expansion of the
technical/vocational training system in accordance with skilled manpower noeds.
However, both ongoing and planned training efforts are constrained by the severe
shortage of instructors and qualified senior staff in skill training
institutions. The Government concurs with the Bank that this shortage must be
addressed through qualitative and quantitative improvements to technical and
vocational teacher training.
6.       Scarcity of trained manpower is also constraining the expansion of the
tourism sector which is becoming an increasingly important source of foreign
exchange earnings. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MCT) has projected
additional needs for about 1,800 skilled workers per year in hotel, catering and
tourism occupations based on the anticipated increase in the capacity of licensed
accommodations (100,000 hotel beds by 1989).
7.       Prolect Obiectives.  Project objectives include assistance to YoK in:
(a) strengthening its institutional capacity to plan and coordinate technician
and technical/vocational teacher training programs; (b) alleviating scarcities of
technicians in industry through the development of pre-service technician
training programs targeted to produce about 3,100 graduates per year by 1996; and
(c) meeting a projected shortfall of over 13,700 technical and vocational
teachers by 1991 through the expansion and improvement of training programs at
three Faculties of Technical Education and one Faculty of Vocational Education.
In addition, the project would support MCT in developing and implementing a
national training plan for tourism occupations.
8.       Project Description.  The project, to be carried out during 1988-1995,
would support four components as follows: (a) management of industrial training
at UoK; (b) industrial technician training at 20 TTCs; (c) vocational and
technical teacher training at four Faculties of Technical/Vocational Education;
and (d) hotel, catering and tourism training at 10 Tourism Training Centers
(TUREMs). Specifically, component (a) would include technical assistance for
strengthening and expanding the existing Technician Training Unit (TTU) in YUK to
enable it to undertake additional responsibilities in respect of coordination of
technical/vocational teacher training. Component (b) would support curricula and
subject development for 20 TTCs, a fellowship training program for instructors,
equipment, furniture and renovations or extensions to existing TTC buildings.
The proposed fellowship training program (US$12.8 million) in the most
expeditious and effective way of producing instructors for the 20 new TTCs, given
the Government's strong commitment to starting up priority technician training
programs with the minimum of delay. Longer term needs for such instructors would
be met through project support to strengthen the Faculties of
Technical/Vocational Education (FTVEs). Component (c) would provide technical
assistance for developing new, improved and shorter training programs at the
FTVEs to attract a broader group of entrants. This component would also support
the establishment of a Technology Department, a Technical/Vocational Education
Department, and a Development and Instructional Support Unit at each faculty to
improve the pedagogical and technclogical content of existing programs, and
ensure the quality of new programs. Support for upgrading teacher training
facilities and improving faculty administration would also be included. Finally,
component (d) would provide technical assistance, equipment, furniture,
renovations and/or extensions for upgrading 5 existing TUREMs and developing 5
new ones.
9.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$165.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$115.8 million equivalent (70
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.



-3-
The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, as well as the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the location of project-assisted
institutions is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7038-TU dated
March 7, 1988 is being dist_ibuted separately.
10.      Rationale for World Bank Involvement.  Continued export growth and
technological advancement in Turkey is dependent upon an adequate supply of
highly skilled technical manpower. One of the major priorities for the education
and training sector is therefore to upgrade technical and industrial training to
improve the supply of skilled workers and technicians for industry. Since 1971,
the Bank has assisted the Government in addressing this need through four loans
aimed at increasing and upgrading capacity to train technicians and skilled
workers. In particular, the ongoing Industrial Training Project (Loan 2399-TU)
is helping the Government develop a pre-service technician training system
through support to an initial group of 8 TTCs. However, given the size of
Turkey's industrial sector and its anticipated rate of growth, there is a
continued need for Bank assistance, both to expand training and to retain the
overall framework for training which has been created under previous
Bank-assisted projects. In addition, it is important for the Bank to assist YoK,
which is a relatively new agency, in its future development as an institution
responsible for the planning and coordination of post-secondary technician
training. Finally, given the increasing importance of the tourism sector to the
economy, Bank assistance to MCT in expanding its manpower development programs is
both timely and essential.
11.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to provide the following
assurances:
(a)    that it would allocate funds for creating additional staff positions for
instructors in order that there would be 1 instructor for every 12
trainees in the 20 new technician training centers;
(b)    that it would establish by March 31, 1989, a Department of Technical
Education in the Faculties of Technical Education at Gazi, Firat and
Marmara Universities, and a Department of Vocational Education in the
Faculty of Vocational Education at Gazi University to provide the
pedagogical focus to teacher training programs;
(c)    that: (i) it would establish a Policy Board for Industrial Training
(PBIT) by March 31, 1989 under the chairmanship of the YoK member
responsible for industrial training and technical/vocational teacher
training; (ii) the PBIT would have representation from the entities
concerned with the development and management of technical education and
training; and (iii) the existing Technician Training Unit responsible
for project implementation would be expanded into an Industrial Training
Unit having a full-time coordinator (who would also serve as secretary
to the PBIT), and a full complement of key staff by March 31, 1989;
(d)    that: (i) it would establish by March 31, 1989, a Regional Advisory
Board at each Faculty of Technical/Vocational Education to advise the
dean, the faculty council and the faculty executive committee on
requirements for teachers of technical subjects, requirements for
teacher training courses in new specializations and on curriculum



-4-
development issues; and (ii) membership of this Board would include local
technical and vocational schools, regional universities, TTCs and
industry;
12.      Justification.  By increasing the output of well-trained technicians and
instructors, the project would improve industrial productivity leading to higher
output and increased foreign exchange earnings. The 20 project-assisted TTCs would
produce about 3,100 graduates per year by 1996; this output would meet the
projected annual demand for about 2,500 higher-level technicians in manufacturing
industries, and, in addition, be available to other employer groups such as the
power and services sectors. Through the provision of post-secondary training
programs in commercial studies, financial administration and tourism that are
attractive to women (estimated 80 percent of enrollment in these fields), the
proposed project would increase the labor force participation rate of women in
these areas. Finally, the 10 project-assisted TUREMs would produce about 1,800
skilled workers for the tourism sector which is anticipated to have foreign
exchange earnings amounting to US$1.6 billion in 1988.
13.      Risks.  There is a risk that TYK may not be able to bring on board as fast
as needed, the specific skills required to manage the industrial training system on
a continuing basis. To minimize this risk, the proposed project would assist YoK
in strengthening and expanding its existing TTU into an Industrial Training Unit to
enable it to undertake additional responsibilities in respect of technical/
vocational teacher education. There is a risk that training programs may be
compromised by an overly academic orientation due to the attachment of TTCs to
universities. This risk would be diminished by the strong commitment of YoK to
make training programs relevant to the needs of industry and by existing
cooperative arrangements for this training with industry. Since many FTVE
graduates currently prefer to work in industry, there is a risk that the Ministry
of Education (MOEYS) may not be able to attract sufficient FTVE graduates to teach
in its secondary schools. To alleviate this risk, the MOEYS has proposed to
improve the terms of service for technical and vocational teachers. The Bank fully
supports the recommendations of the MOEYS which are being considered seriously by
the Government in view of the critical shortage of teachers in technical/vocational
institutions. The proposed project would assist in improving recruitment and
retention rates of teachers through: (a) re-orienting FTVE programs towards
teacher education to ensure that the end-products are trained to teach and not
serve as engineers; and (b) improving teacher quality and involving the MOEYS in
curriculum development and standards setting for teacher training, thereby
eliminating the need for an external examination in which the passing rate is only
about 50 percent. The MOEYS would also simplify recruitment procedures for
teachers in order to shorten the waiting period for candidates. In respect of the
MCT, there is a risk that project activities may not be implemented in a timely
fashion. To reduce this risk, disbursements against expenditures incurred under
the tourism training component will not start until the Bank has reviewed and
agreed on the details of an implementation program for the component.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
