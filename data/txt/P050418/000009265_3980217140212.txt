Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
This loan has two main objectives: (i) to increase rural incomes derived from sustainable use of water resources and
the effective development, delivery and adoption of improved farming practices; and (ii) to enhance institutional
responsiveness to user demand for agricultural research, extension and training.
2. Project components (see Annexes 2A and 2B):
The project will consist of investment components that constitute line-items in the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA)
investment budget. These undergo an extensive internal preparation and review process. The investments components
are linked to accompanying measures designed to enhance the effectiveress of the public investment. The measures are
grouped by investment component and are targeted for completion by two deadlines - by December 1, 1997 [completed]
and before October 1998. Adequate completion of the measures would be necessary for inclusion of the related
investment component in Loan financing in the subsequent budget year. Full definition of the accompanying measures is
found in Annex 2B. The components of the project were selected because they support strategic priorities of the
Government to strengthen water management and agricultural support services, and because of a financing gap for these
activities as the Government begins implementing its 9th Plan (1997-2001). The project builds on the successes of
implemented projects, continuing the basic design of the ongoing Agricultural Sector Investment Loan (ASIL), and
adding components from the recently completed (June, 1997) Research and Extension Project (Ln. 3217).

3. Benefits and target population:
Direct beneficiaries would be farmers through small-scale irrigation. The total irrigation area expansion will be
3000 ha of new tubewell irrigation in over 14 governorates, benefiting mostly small farmers who would average 2 ha in
the project areas. About 1500 farm households (10,500 persons) would directly benefit from the estimated net increase
in total value of agricultural production of TD 8.4 million annually and from the stabilization of their incomes from
drought impacts. The modernization of the Utique perimeter will benefit 175 households (1350 persons) on 968 ha total.
The incremental employment impact of the modernization is estimated at about 75,100 additional person-days p.a..
Household agricultural income gains would range from TD 5,800 to TD15,700 p.a., or from 26% to 540% (average of
180%).
Groundwater prospecting and monitoring is a key component of groundwater management as it is presently
practiced, and as it needs to improve in the future. It is the foundation for water resource inventories (quality and
quantity) which define sustainable extraction rates for economic uses. It also provides the data needed for groundwater
modeling, which Tunisia needs to expand in the near future as part of establishing groundwater management plans for its
at-risk aquifers.
The national research, extension and training components would benefit farmers at large in the agricultural sector
by assisting them to adopt improved farming techniques that increase productivity and quality of output, and to manage
their natural resource inputs more sustainably.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period. Four and one-half years. The loan would support component activities (see Section 2)
included in two Government budget exercises, 1998 and 1999, with completion of these investment expected by end-June
2002.
Project coordination. Overall project coordination among the executing units would be assured by the DGFE
(Direction Generale du Financement et des Encouragements) and a Coordinating Committee chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture. The DGFE is responsible for overall preparation of the Ministry of Agriculture investment budget
proposals.
Project Implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be the overall executing agency for implementation
of the project, with investment preparation guidelines and sub-sector policy pursued at the central Ministry level by the:
(i) Directorate General of Rural Works (DGGR) for the irrigation component and institutional capacity building for water
user association support; (ii) Directorate General of Water Resources (DGRE) for the groundwater monitoring and
prospecting component; (iii) the Institute of Agricultural Research and Education (IRESA) for the research component;
and (iv) the Agricultural Extension and Training Agency (AVFA) for the extension and training component. At the
regional level, the Regional Commissariats for Agricultural Development (CRDA), in which there are units representing
the central directorates, are responsible for overseeing technical preparation of specific investment proposals and for
assuring coordination among technical units.

Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements. Accounting and financial reporting will be assured
centrally by the DGFE. Formats and procedures for accounts and financial reporting are agreed and will continue the
approaches developed, implemented and improved under the ongoing ASIL. Audits of project accounts, the Special
Account and Statements of Expenditure will be done by the General Controler of Finances (CGF) of the Ministry of
Finance according to acceptable auditing standards and will be made available to the Bank within six months of the close
of each fiscal year. The MOA is current with audits due and in compliance with audit covenants under the ongoing
ASIL. The financial management capability of the Borrower is adequate.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. The DGFE will be responsible, with inputs from all implementing units,
for monitoring of financial and physical progress on investment implementation, for progress reporting on execution of
the accompanying measures, for coordinating disbursement, and for semi-annual project implementation reports. Impact
monitoring will include farmers' incomes for the irrigation component. The data necessary data for this monitoring are
already collected, but different parameters are the responsibility of different administrative units and are not currently
compiled so as to permit this analysis. The Directorate General of Rural Engineering (DGGR), will coordinate a pilot
monitoring system that will follow farm incomes for Project investments.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The agricultural sector has undergone considerable structural adjustment in the past 10 years but structural problems
persist. Key production sub-sectors benefit from protection, including cereals, fruits, milk and meat products. Policy
decisions to promote trade liberalization lag behind the pace established for other sectors of the economy, mainly due to
concerns over social consequences in rural areas. The Government reopens negotiations with the European Union on
trade liberalization of agricultural products in 2000, but expectations are not high that these negotiations will lead to
rapid openning of markets. Meanwhile, the Government is concentrating on strengthening the capacity of the sector to
respond flexibly and positively to an eventual reduction of border protection. The main sector challenges in this regard
are:

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will address three of the four issues. Sustainable resources management will be addressed, with a focus
on water resources, through groundwater prospecting and monitoring of quantity and quality, by prudent, small-scale
irrigation expansion only where resources and opportunity costs permit and by support of resource management
components of national research, extension and training programs. Support for irrigation users' associations will
improve management of water resources and mobilization infrastructure, and tariff policy measures will continue the
Government's consistent reduction in irrigation water subsidies. Efficient support services to agriculture will be
addressed by moving research, extension and training strategies in the direction of demand-driven services and public-
private provision compared with the current state-only provision strategy, and by focusing on overall delivery cost
efficiency of these services. Poverty reduction will be addressed directly by production-related investments in small-
scale irrigation and indirectly through the research, extension and training components.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Three project alternatives were considered and rejected for various reasons.
(a) Traditional investment operation with pre-identified investments. Rejected because the MOA project preparation
process is not able to generate the needed analysis and documentation in time to mobilize the proposed Project for the
1998 budget year. The sector investment approach provides the needed flexibility to provide financing for projects that
pass agreed selection criteria (see Annex 2A).
(b) Delay Bank support until the results of the two PHRD studies in support of two water and agricultural services
projects are available. Rejected because this would result in a sharp decline in investment programs and loss of
momentum in the hiatus for strategies that the Bank is currently supporting, and likely to support in the future.
(c) Substantially larger project to include expanded activities in the research, extension and training components.
Rejected because of evaluated limited capacity of IRESA for implementing its regionalisation strategy and new research
project start-ups supports a more prudent scaling-up of activities, and because for AVFA the overall strategic orientation
needs strengthening before significant increases in investment. Also, a follow-up Bank-financed project is planned for
FY00 and would include additional components (marketing, strengthening farmers organizations, support services to
agriculture) to reflect the increasing diversity and complexity of Tunisian agriculture.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
The project design will replicate much of the ongoing ASIL and the recently completed Research and Extension
Project. Improvement will be sought in the following areas:
(a) Assuring sustainability of irrigation projects needs institutional strengthening of water users associations and of
the MOAs units that support to these associations. The Project will ensure that the MOA mobilizes an interdisciplinary
team to provide training and programming support to the regional support units and by implicating beneficiaries from the
initial design stage of irrigation projects.
(b) Agricultural research needs to be decentralized to be effective, and be based on clear institutional attributes to
strengthen coordination and links among researchers, users and extension agents. The Project will support
implementation of the MOA's strategy to decentralize research by strengthening selected regional research Poles and
experimental stations, by formnally establishing mandates of the research poles, and by improving representation of
beneficiaries within research programming and monitoring committees.
(c) The country needs a national strategy for extension that goes beyond the initial exercise done to date. The Project
will facilitate a dialogue to reformulate the existing strategy based on the participation of farmers and the opening up of
extension to potential providers from the private sector, agro-industry, academia, etc.
(d) Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms need clear definition from the outset of project implementation. The
Project will be launched with clear mechanisms and responsibilities based on detailed discussions of monitoring and
indicators enumerated in Annex 1.
(e) Linking investment components to accompanying measures that are defined as strategic studies to be followed by
agreement on details of strategy implementation will be avoided. Accompanying measures defined in this way have
taken longer than expected in moving from strategy formulation to action plan under the ongoing ASIL, and the process
of consensus building is not amenable to a faster pace. The Accompanying Measures of the Project limit use of this
design.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Ministries of International Cooperation and Agriculture have requested this project. It is also supported by the
Ministry of Economic Development which considers it consistent and supportive of the 9th Plan (1997-200 1). The
project will support investments that will have been identified and approved within the Government's internal process of
budget arbitration. The policy and institutional reform measures are designed to make progress on strategic visions of
the Government that are broadly defined in the 9th Plan.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The project consolidates achievements made in two projects and builds on their success, the ongoing ASIL (to be
completed in June 1998) and the Research and Extension Project (completed June 1997). It provides a bridge to further
strategic reforms that are being formulated on the basis of preparation of two pipeline projects in water management and
agricultural services. For both water sector management (FY00) and agricultural services (FY00), Bank staff are
providing critical international experience as input to dynamic Government efforts to move to detailed definition of new
strategic approaches. The breadth of activities of the Bank gives it a perspective which contributes greatly to its
contribute to Government's formulation and implementation of strategic approach in the sector. In addtion, Bank

involvement in the project facilitates the participation of other donors in financing the Ministry of Agriculture's
investment program by providing criteria, process and framework strengthening which the Ministry then applies
program-wide.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment [x] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV - see below;        ERR - see below
(see Annex 4):
Given the sector investment approach of this Project, sub-projects are not fully known at this stage. Hence, economic
assessment of the Project relies on analysis completed for similar sub-projects implemented in recent years in Tunisia,
and this shows satisfactory indicative economic rates of return. Moreover, sub-projects for irrigation to be financed by
the Loan will be subjected to economic selection criteria whose application has already been tested under the ongoing
ASIL. Direct beneficiaries would be farmers in small-scale irrigation systems, who would gain in terms of increased and
less variable production and income.
Irrigation. For small-scale, tubewell-based irrigation investments, recent sub-projects have estimated rates of return
of 15-21%. For the modernization of Utique, the project was evaluated to have a 15% ERR. A cost benefit analysis for
the proposed set of tubewell investments yielded an ERR of 20%.
Groundwater exploration. For the exploratory tubewells investments, ex post analysis was conducted for the DGRE
1990-95 exploration activities, which resulted in the estimated annual sustainable aquifer yield in Tunisia increasing by
40 million m3, of which was 80% was utilized in irrigated agriculture and 20% for urban and rural potable water supply.
Based on this increased availability of water, returns to representative cropping patterns for a "with-project" (irrigated
agriculture) were analyzed, assuming conservatively a relatively low-value added use of irrigation water. Comparison to
a typical "without-project" cropping pattern (rainfed agriculture) using detailed farm budgets results in an ERR of 18%
for the overall exploration program.
The benefits of the investments in agricultural research and extension component do not lend themselves to ready
quantification. Qualitatively, they would benefit farmers at large in the agricultural sector by assisting them to adopt
improved farming techniques that increase productivity and quality of output, and to manage their natural resource inputs
more sustainably.
Economic selection criteria that will be applied for irrigation sub-projects consist of: (a) a minimum 10% ERR for
irrigation modernization projects; and (b) for the construction of new irrigation schemes, sub-projects with a cost
exceeding TD5,000/ha but less than TD 500,000 in aggregate, a simplified procedure for cost-benefit analysis and would
need to demonstrate a benefit cost ratio greater than 1.05. Sub-projects with an estimated total cost of more than TD
500,000 would be subject to a feasibility study with a complete cost-benefit analysis and would need to have an ERR of
10% minimum to receive Loan finance. Sub-projects costing less than TD5,000/ha would not be subject to an economic
analysis to be eligible for financing. Other selection criteria are detailed in Annex 2A.
Fiscal impact: The investment costs will be borne by the public budget and the Loan. Budget resources are carefully
managed and since the Project consists of sub-projects that are fully integrated into the Government's budget process and
are consistent with Ministry of Finance planning envelopes for investment and debt servicing, the fiscal impact of the
Project is considered supportable. Increased agricultural production is envisaged under the project. However, in Tunisia,
agricultural income is not subject to income tax, and 65-75% of agricultural production is home consumed or marketed
through the informal sector. Hence incremental tax revenues accruing to the government are expected to be very small.
Regarding recurrent cost, irrigation associated with tubewells will, in principle, have limited impacts on the government
budget since routine operations and maintenance are the responsibility of water user groups. The institution building

Country Republic of Tunisia                                              Project Title Second Agricultural Sector Investment Loan
component of the project will foster greater responsibility of the water user associations in the operations and
maintenance of the schemes. Recurrent costs of exploration tubewells are also minimal; where successful, tubewells pass
over to exploitation programs with recurrent costs borne by users associations or other entities. Running costs of
groundwater monitoring infrastructure will increase marginally because of addition of the piezometers, but installation of
electronic recording data is expected to reduce overall personnel input for data collection and database management
compared with the manual collection and inputting that currently predominates. For the research, extension and training
components, no significant increases in personnel are planned under the project, although there will be increased
recurrent costs for operating vehicles for the extension component.
Government public expenditures -- both recurrent and investment -- in the agricultural sector were reviewed as
background to appraisal of this sector investment loan. The Project represents about 8% of total public investment
planned in the sector during its two years of budget support. Public investments included in the Ninth Plan take place
within sound sub-sector strategies, are subject to adequate selection criteria, and are not likely to face significant
financing constraints, despite being programmed to grow substantially in real terms over the Plan period. Investments in
the MOA budget have social and environmental objectives in addition to the purely economic criteria that are routinely
applied, and while acknowledging this, attention still needs to be paid to social returns of the MOA portfolio compared
with alternative uses of the resources in other sectors, for which simple aggregate investment-output ratios appear to be
more favorable. Regarding recurrent expenditure, fiscal restraint has resulted in a modest decline in expenditure in real
terms over the past decade. This raises general concerns about the adequacy of operations and maintenance, although for
the specific investments supported by this Project public funding of operations and maintenance is acceptable.
Economies in the MOA recurrent budget have indeed been achieved through disengagement from numerous activities
since the beginning of the decade, in conjunction with deconcentration of the management of its investment budget to the
regional level and shifting of some operations and maintenance needs to water user associations and private service
providers. But the lack of adequate cost information systems makes it difficult to determine at a detailed level whether
the recurrent budget is in balance with investment plans. The recent integration of recurrent and investment budget
preparation within the Ministry of Finance, and piloting within the MOA of analytical accounting systems, are expected
to begin addressing this shortcoming. A planning study of CRDA is underway to assess the future resource needs --
human, physical and budgetary -- to enable the CRDA to carry out their responsibilities. The mid-term review scheduled
for October 1998 will review MOF progress on integrating recurrent and investment budgeting, on the accounting
systems pilot, and on the CRDA study.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):        NPV=N/A; FRR=N/A
No single financial assessment is possible for the proposed project since this is a sector investment loan with some detail
for the 1998 program but only the broad envelope of activities for the 1999 program. Further, none of the investments are
directly in revenue-earning entities. The agricultural research, extension, and training components do not lend
themselves to traditional FRR calculations. The irrigation development sub-projects will be selected based on minimum
criteria (described in Annex 4), and at this stage, it will not be possible to calculate financial rates of return. Partial cost
recovery is envisaged since the water users' associations will meet the cost of routine O&M in the newly-developed
small-scale irrigation perimeters.
15. Technical Assessment:
Irrigation - The small-scale irrigation technology consists generally of pressured, buried pipe networks to metered
outlets at the individual parcel level, with the meters' costs justified by their advantages for water user association
management. Experience in Tunisia has demonstrated the desirability of pouring concrete structures in situ rather than
pre-cast, because the initial additional cost is compensated by greater durability. The networks' layout serves the existing
configuration of parcel ownership because this avoids social obstacles. System pressure is adequate for sprinkler or other
water-saving irrigation techniques.
Groundwater Exploration - Prospecting to determine siting of exploration tubewells is generally adequate and will be

Country: Republic of Tunisia                                       Project Title Second Agricultural Sector Investment Loan
further improved during the project (see Accompanying Measures, Annex 2B). The proportion of negative wells (25% of
the 384 exploratory wells completed since 1991 due to unproductivity or salinity) in the public investment program is
acceptable, particularly taking into account that the public program focuses on less well understood hydrogeological
formations where the uncertainties are greater. Prospecting in more favorable and better-understood zones is typically
left to the private sector to undertake.
Groundwater Monitoring - the existing piezometer network is inadequate to provide monitoring data of the reliability
that will be critical as Tunisia makes progress towards implementing a strategy of groundwater management by
stakeholders. Siting of piezometers can be improved based on approaches that will be introduced under the project,
including a sharper focus on strategic objectives (e.g. monitoring overdrafted aquifers, saline intrusion, artificial recharge,
etc.). Measurement equipment as part of the longer term effort to equip 20% of the piezometer network is justified in
order to: (a) increase from current manual measurement frequences, cost effectively, as will be essential for effective
management; (b) improve measurement reliability in remote areas; (c) replace limnographs with less costly and more
efficient electronic data recorders; and (d) introduce multiparameter units capable of monitoring water quality. Technical
preparation of the Project established the appropriate balance between new piezometers and automatic recording
equipment. The Project will also finance a tubewell remote diagnostic unit and a resistivity unit for groundwater
prospecting. The former is cost effective for well rehabilitation, and the national market for this service is too limited to
support a competitive private sector. The latter is important to maintaining the technical capacity of the DGRE, although
for CRDAs routine site selection for exploration tubewells, the objective is to make a transition to contract this out
commensorate with development of private sector capacity.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies:
The foundation for Project execution and coordination (see paragraph 4) has been tested and proven adequate during
the recently completed Research and Extension Project and ongoing ASIL. Sub-projects are adequately prepared by
CRDAs and/or central technical departments, preparation and selection criteria are satisfactorily applied as part of
preparation of the annual investment budget, the budget is soundly executed, and implementation of investments is
technically competent.
Further institutional improvement and innovation are an explicit focus of the Project through the Accompanying
Measures (Annex 2A). Each implementing unit will pursue an agenda of institutional strengthening that has been
identified as needed and opportune. Implementing these changes will require close monitoring, flexibility and
adjustment, and supervision missions will be staffed to provide needed input to this process. Areas of particular focus
will be: (a) beneficiary participation in validating irrigation projects' feasibility studies; (b) research system
decentralization and research program committee strengthening; (c) extension agent work programming; and (d) DGRE
service provision to stakeholders in water resource management.
b. Project management:
The Project rests squarely on the MOAs existing investment budget process and the Project management design
aims to be synonymous with management of the overall investment budget. Project accounts and financial management
will be an extract sub-set of the MOAs detailed accounts for its investment budget. This management information system
is computerized and provides up-to-date data on sub-project costs, commitments, expenditures and sources of funds, on
both a contract basis and for analytical aggregates. All procurement decisions are approved and documented by formally
empowered review commissions and overseen by a financial controller representing the Ministry of Finance. The DGFE
will also maintain its computerized project accounts and paper documentation files so as to permit a comprehensive
itemized trace of all transactions that are forwarded to the Central Bank of Tunisia which manages payments out of the
Special Account. These accounts and procurement documentation processes are already in place for several years as part
of the ongoin ASIL and have proven fully satisfactory. In addition, the DGFE provides, with effective and efficient staff
input, the essentials of a traditional project management unit.

c. National consulting companies:
National consulting companies will be called upon to conduct more complex and multidisciplinary preparatory
studies for sub-projects. To promote adequate capacity to carry these out, study terms of reference will pay close
attention to definition of needed consultant profiles and expertise. The Project launching workshop will also have
information sessions for consulting companies to permit introduction and discussion of the new methodologies.
17. Social Assessment:
The irrigation component will be located primarily in semi-arid rural areas where there is great demand for irrigation
water by local communities. However, even where private dug wells exist, these communities are often not used to
cooperating to operate small-scale irrigation infrastructure. They can at times be impatient with Government preparation
and budget procedures and skeptical of information gathering by consulting companies. However, the MOA is improving
its procedures for early collaboration with local communities in project identification, and for prioritization of investment
to focus on those with the most favorable prospects for social cohesion and collaboration during projects' preparation,
implementation and operation phases.
Groundwater prospecting and monitoring under the project will remain largely technical activities with limited
immediate interaction with local communities. Based on ongoing strategic studies, it is anticipated that the information
generated by these investments will begin to be better integrated into a communication strategy that underpins
management of groundwater by local stakeholders.
18. Environmental Assessment:      Environmental       []  A    [X] B       []  C
Category
The project is a Category B. An environmental management plan was prepared and confirmed during negotiations.
The possible adverse environmental impacts of irrigation development relate to overdrafting of the aquifer, and impact
on soil and water quality through tubewell-based small perimeter development. The impact on groundwater aquifer
management is expected to be minimal since the administration (DGRE) is capably monitoring aquifers, and only permits
additional tubewell irrigation capacity to be installed where renewable groundwater resources are not overexploited. In
order to qualify for financing under the Project, for each tubewell irrigation sub-project, the Bank will require
documentation (from DGRE) that demonstrates the water requirement of the project in relation to the current exploitation
and renewable resource status of the aquifer involved. For individual tubewells and related irrigation infrastructure
costing more than TD 500,000, the feasibility study would include an analysis of the potential environmental impacts
including the set of mitigation measures to be taken where necessary, in accordance with the environmental plan. These
measures will be integrated in the design of the sub-project. The environmental management plan developed will be
closely monitored during supervision missions, and will be presented as part of the annual report to be submitted by the
government. In addition, any required environmental assessment and/or planned mitigation measures will be submitted
to the Bank for review and approval along with the proposed sub-project.

20. Sustainability:
The project directly addresses water use and management sustainability issues through the groundwater and irrigation
components. The groundwater prospecting and monitoring component addresses the need for Government to develop a

more precise understanding of renewable groundwater resources (quantity and quality), which represent 45% of
exploitable national water resources.
The irrigation component is explicitly promoting beneficiary involvement from the earliest stages of irrigation sub-
projects by assisting the DGGR to transition by the second year of the project to involvement of the beneficiaries in the
conception and validation of working hypotheses of the socio-economic study. In addition the project will support the
creation of a second mobile team that trains regional trainers of AIC members, with a reinforced focus on irrigation user
groups, and largely following the approach of the existing team that has succeeded in improving the organizational and
financial autonomy of AICs in the regions of its operation. The objective is autonomous user associations for operation
of irrigation infrastructure such that the irrigation activity is sustainable with minimal additional public intervention and
cost.

users associations. But there is a preference to finance such a team using grant rather than loan resources. Two of the
more likely donor sources of grant financing have already indicated that they will not be able to provide support at least
during 1998. The Bank position is that the mobile team is an Accompanying Measure and that the team needs to be
operational by the first trimester of 1999, regardless of the source of financing. If no alternative financing becomes
available by September 1998, the team would have to be mobilized using resources from the existing Agricultural Sector
Investment Loan (Ln. 3661 -TUN).

Annex 2A
Detailed Project Description
Irrigation Development - US$22.5 million (total cost of component)
This component consists of the construction of small, tubewell-based, irrigation perimeters, and
modernization and drainage installation in existing perimeters. The construction of irrigation perimeters will
consist of approximately 30 small tubewell projects for a total of about 3000 hectares. The modernization
will upgrade three sectors totaling about 968 ha of the Utique perimeter in Bizerte to a buried pipes irrigation
system that will permit switching to efficient on-demand sprinkler irrigation, in addtion to installing of a
drainage system.. Drainage installation project is foreseen on 282 hectares of the El Azima and Brahmi
perimeters in Jendouba. The 1998 program would comprise 15 new perimeters totaling 1179 ha of intensive
irrigation and 360 of supplemental irrigation, as well as drainage in the El Azima and Brahmi perimeters in
Jendouba and modernization of Sector 2 and part of sector 3of the Utique perimeter.
Investment Selection Criteria - sub-project selection criteria for individual or groups of tubewells
and related irrigation infrastructure with a cost exceeding TD5,000/ha but less than TD 500,000 in aggregate
would be subject to a simplified procedure for cost-benefit analysis (format agreed during the ASIL) and
would need to demonstrate a benefit cost ratio greater than 1.05. Sub-projects with an estimated total cost of
more than TD 500,000 would be subject to a feasibility study with a complete cost-benefit analysis and
would need to have an ERR of 10% minimum to receive Loan finance. The feasibility study would also
include an analysis of potential negative environmental impacts including the set of mitigation measures to
be taken where necessary in accordance with the Environmental Mitigation Plan agreed upon. These
measures will be integrated in the design of the sub-project. Sub-projects costing less than TD5,000/ha
would not be subject to an economic analysis to be eligible for financing. For a project to be selected it also
needs to be demonstrated, based on DGRE analysis, that the aquifer source of water for the project is not
overdrafted. The project will also continue the practice of the ongoing ASIL requiring that a water users
association needs to be created by the time that disbursements for a sub-project from the Loan begin.
Accompanying Measures - (i) water tariff increases (9%/year in real terms); (ii) functionality of a
second mobile team to support water user associations; and (iii) progressive implementation of a preparation
(technical and socio-economic) approach for sub-projects that strengthens participation of beneficiaries (see
Annex 2B for details).
Groundwater Prospecting and Monitoring - US$36.3 million (total cost of component)
This component consists of drilling 212 exploratory wells (71,000 linear meter) and 115 piezometers
(14,750 linear meters) and acquisition of one geophysical resistivity unit to assist for exploration well siting,
one video device to diagnose conditions in existing exploitation wells, and automatic data recording for
piezometers. The exploratory wells are located in sites which have been evaluated as having a high potential
for finding productive aquifers, typically in the 100-700 meter range. The piezometers are to be concentrated
in areas where groundwater overdraft or saline intrusion are critical concerns, and where experimental
recharge projects are programmed. The automatic monitoring equipment is part of a longer-term objective of
installing such equipment on 20 percent of the piezometer network. The 1998 program, will consist of 108
exploratory wells, 55 piezometers, the remote video dagnostic unit for tubewells, and half the piezometer
recording equipment.

Country: Republic of Tunisia                                    Project Title Second Agricultural Sector Investment Loan
Investment Selection Criteria - the selection criterion for exploration well site selection is the
carrying out of a technical prospecting for each site, and the justification of the site selection as part of a peer
review process. On a broader, programmatic level, the activities undertaken during the project will introduce
economic parameters into the scoping of the overall investment program and the selection of specific
exploration sites.
Accompanying Measures - (i) reinforce private sector provision of tubewell and piezometer drilling
and hydrogeological prospecting; and (ii) strengthen administrative capacity in technical analysis of site
selection for piezometer and exploratory tubewells.
Agricultural Research - US$4.0 million (total cost of component)
This component would finance: (i) research sub-project start-ups and programme research amnongst
the priorities identified by ten programming commissions; (ii) support for research priorities established by a
new programming commission in animal health; and (iii) consolidation of research regionalisation by
supporting and equipping three additional research pole stations. In particular, the project will finance
construction of a biotechnology laboratory, research pole centers at Chott-Meriem, Tozeur and Sidi Bouzid,
research equipment for research projects and programmes, and training. About 70% of the component is for
equipment to enable research sub-projects of items (i) and (ii).
Investment Selection Criteria - the research sub-projects must have been identified as priority by the
recently completed work of the ten research programming Commissions, and need to be presented with
budget (investment and recurrent) requirements and financing plan, interim and final outputs expected, and a
timetable of activities. Priorities identifed by the new Commission on animal health may also be included in
1999. Other components are already broadly known and will not be submitted to general selection criteria.
Accompanying Measures - (i) strengthen the process of regionalisation of research; (ii) strengthening
of research committees through implementation of a monitoring approach and improved representation of
research users (demand); and (iv) clarifying the attributions of research poles concerning coordination of
research, extension and training.
Agricultural Extension and Training - US$5.1 million (total cost of component)
The training (AVFA) investment will consist of rehabilitation of seven existing training and the
upgrading of the central training unit at Sidi Thabet. The rehabilitation of the existing centers will entail
physical renovation of the training centers' buildings, rehabilitation of teaching plots at the centers,
equipping the training workshops, and a minimum of vehicles to permit transport of students and farmers for
field visits. The intervention for Sidi Thabet will encompass procurement of audio-visual and computer
equipment, of vehicles for field visits, for upgrading of conference rooms, for construction of a
documentation center.
The extension (AVFA) component will invest in vehicles to provide mobility to extension agents in
the eight of the country's 23 governorates which were not covered in the previous Research and Extension
Project.
Investment Selection Criteria - the seven training centers identified for rehabilitation, plus the
upgrading of Sidi Thabet, are selected from among thirty-two total training centers that fall within the
responsibility of the MOA. A coherent intervention plan for agricultural training is being undertaken by the
AVFA with results expected by March 1998, and this will establish the criteria for setting priorities among

the training centers to be retained and investment justification for interventions at the centers included in the
Project. These criteria will take into account the future relation of these training centers and Technical
Centers that exist or may be established.
Accompanving Measures - for training, these will consist of: submitting for approval the application
decrees for the existing orientation law for professional training; definition of new training programs in
collaboration with representatives from the agriculture and agro-industry sectors; improved rationalization
of the training centers network; for extension the measures will cover extension strategy reformulation in
collaboration with the private sector and including the possible roles that the private sector might play in the
design of the extension agenda and in the cofinancing of some extension programs; and improved work
programming and mobility of extension agents.

ANNEX 2C
Environmental Management Plan
1.    Overview
1.    This environmental management plan reviews the existing Tunisian environmental
legislation and administrative procedures relevant for the proposed Agricultural Sector
Investment Loan (ASIL) II project, provides a brief overview of the key environmental issues
associated with the project components, and develops a mitigation plan identifying the relevant
Tunisian parties responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the mitigation measures.
2.    Environmental Effects of Project Components
2.1   Small-scale Tubewell Irrigation Creation and Drainage Rehabilitation
2.     Small-scale tubewell irrigation will be financed only in areas where there is no
groundwater mining taking place and where the groundwater resources are still sufficient to
sustain the tubewell irrigation intensification. Monitoring of groundwater levels in these areas is
a priority and will be financed under the Project. In addition, groundwater quality will also be
monitored. The water resources involved will all be deeper aquifers (greater than 50 meters) for
which government licensing and regulation are adequate.
3. In some existing irrigation perimeters (Lezdine-Utique and Azima) a drainage rehabilitation
program will be financed. Adequate drainage is essential in the type of climatic conditions
that prevail in Tunisia, since soil salinity can increase rapidly. In certain other perimeters in
the Center and the South (rehabilitation/creation) the drainage network permits on one hand,
to cut back the advancement of the groundwater table, and on the other hand, in the removal
of salts accumulated during irrigation. There are no proven health impacts from any of the
irrigation systems of the type included in the Project.
2.2    Modernization of several larger-scale irrigation perimeters
4.     Modernization of larger-scale irrigation perimeters would use water more efficiently,
improve drainage efficiency, thus reducing salinization risks.
2.3    Groundwater Prospecting and Monitoring
5.     ASIL II will finance a groundwater prospecting and monitoring component. This
monitoring component will strengthen the network of measurement points and measurement
equipment for both groundwater level and quality. The groundwater exploration and monitoring
components will strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) to assist the
sustainable management of these resources in Tunisia. The results of the groundwater monitoring
component will be used where necessary, to prevent further deterioration in water quality, and
arrest overexploitation.

Country: Republic of Tunisia                 Project Title: Second Agricultural Sector Investment Loan
2.4    Strengthening ofAgricultural Research, Extension and Training Institutions
6.     A portion of the research, extension and training component focuses on strengthening
the generation, delivery and adoption of resource management technologies and strategies by
farmers that improve sustainability of land and water resource use. Proposed research projects in
water management will take into account results from the groundwater exploration and
monitoring components.
2.5    Policy and Institutional Reforms
7.    A set of accompanying measures, mostly of a policy and institutional nature, as
incorporated in the project design and linked to the investment components. The measures
included which have environmental implications are: (i) irrigation tariff policy - real annual
increase of 9% (should promote more efficient water use); (ii) beneficiary participation as a
prerequisite for irrigation sub-project acceptance; (iii) water use economy research; and (iv)
groundwater efficiency gains in prospecting and monitoring.
8.    In the light of the above, Annex 1 presents the potential negative impacts of the
irrigation and drainage components of the project, the mitigating measures to be undertaken, the
Tunisian parties responsible for their implementation. In many cases, the Direction Generale
Genie Rural (DGGR) already undertakes these mitigation measures based on preparatory studies
and as part of the design process. Other mitigation measures are overseen by the Direction
General/Ressources en Eau (DGRE), Agence de Vulgarisation et Formation (AVFA), and the
Institut National de Recherche Agricole (IRESA) on a regular basis. Thus, the costs for these
mitigating measures are already integrated into the overall project costs.
3.    Environmental Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
3.1    Environmental Assessment Legislation
9.    Decree No. 91-362 issued on March 13, 1991, regulates the EA procedures in Tunisia.
According to this decree, a site specific EA for agriculture and drainage projects is required, and
the approval of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA; created in 1988), which
is the executing agency of the Ministry of Environment and Land Management (created in 1991)
must be obtained before any construction can start. The decree also regulates the issues to be
addressed in the EA report.
3.2    National Environmental Protection Agency
10.   The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) was created in 1988 and is
responsible for approval of EA studies and for the monitoring of the implementation of the
mitigation plans. For this purpose the NEPA has employed dedicated staff. The staff in NEPA
responsible for EA is competent.

Country: Republic of Tunisia                Project Title: Second Agricultural Sector Investment Loan
3.3    Soil and Water Conservation Code
11.   This code was promulgated in 1995 (law no. 95-70 of July 17, 1995) and contains
clauses for the creation of a National Commission and Regional Groups for Soil and Water
Conservation. The former one would have as a major task to propose elements for a National
Strategy for Soil and Water Conservation and propose improvements in the methodology to
safeguard the soil and water resources in Tunisia.
12.   The Regional Soil and Water Conservation Groups have as tasks to create, coordinate,
advise, animate and ensure the monitoring of the activities of the Soil and Water Conservation
Associations, which are groups of landowners and land users in the perimeters where soil and
water conservation activities are being undertaken. These associations are given the
responsibility to undertake the planned soil and water conservation activities within their
perimeters, to warn the authorities in case of soil degradation within their perimeters and to assist
other members of the association with the realization of the soil and water conservation program.
Overall, the Direction de Conservation d'Eaux et Sols (DCES) in the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) is responsible for implementation. The Project would ensure that the DCES and the
DGRE work in close coordination to ensure consistency between the groundwater component
and the 1995 Soil and Water Conservation Code.
3.4    Water Code
13.   Surface water use is regulated by the Water Code (Law 75-16, March 31, 1975). A
comprehensive Water Resources Strategy as is recommended by the World Bank's Water
Resources Policy is being actively prepared based on a PHRD- and KfW-financed study.
Surface water quality, particularly in the Medjerda River system, has been monitored since the
late 1980s for a range of physical and chemical parameters through a network of measurement
points. Further measures to reinforce this existing system and install additional capacity are
being determined as part of the aforementioned strategic study. The Direction Generale
Ressources en Eau (DGRE) in the MA is responsible for enforcement of laws and regulations
pertaining to the Water Code.
14.   At present groundwater legislation only regulates the groundwater resources deeper than
50 meters. There is also an increasing need to adequately manage shallower groundwater, since
groundwater mining is becoming an increasingly important problem.
4.    Institutional Capacity
15.   The capacity of the DGGR to adequately screen, oversee the design of sub-projects, and
monitor their implementation in accordance with environmental criteria is satisfactory. For a
sub-project to be selected it also needs to be demonstrated based on the analysis of the DGRE
that the aquifer source of water is not overdrafted. The technical capacity of the DGRE to carry
out such screening is highly satisfactory.

5.     Implementation and monitoring
16.    The arrondissement of the DGGR  in each of the Commissariat Regional de
Ddveloppement Agricole (CRDA) will be responsible for carrying out the mitigation measures
where necessary. Through the DGFE, the Borrower will prepare and submit to the Bank the
mitigation plan developed, and approved by the NEPA where required. The mitigation plan
developed will be closely monitored during supervision missions, and will be reported as part of
the annual report to be submitted by the Borrower.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
The project would support the Ministry of Agriculture's budget for a sub-set of investment
activities in irrigation development, agricultural research, extension and training, and groundwater
prospecting and monitoring. Since this is a sector investment loan, there is at this stage of preparation
some detail for the 1998 program but only the broad envelope of activities for the 1999 program. This
makes it difficult to conduct a comprehensive cost benefit analysis, although indicative rates of return
are presented below. Moreover, specific sub-projects for irrigation systems to be financed by the Loan
will be subjected to economic selection criteria whose application has already been tested under the
existing ASIL. Direct beneficiaries would be farmers in small-scale irrigation systems who would gain
in terms of increased production and income. For small-scale, tubewell-based irrigation investments,
projects have achieved rates of return of 15-21%.  The benefits of the investments in agricultural
research and extension component do not lend themselves to ready quantification. Qualitatively, they
would benefit farmers at large in the agricultural sector by assisting them to adopt improved farming
techniques that increase productivity and quality of output, and to manage their natural resource inputs
more sustainably.
Rationale for Public Sector Involvement:
In the area of groundwater exploration and monitoring, the limited number of private companies in
Tunisia equipped to undertake geophysical prospecting or to drill deep wells militates against a greater
involvement of the private sector in these activities. The strategic objective underlying the current
investments in groundwater exploration is a social one - creation of new irrigation perimeters, and
development of rural water supply. This, coupled with the fact that the exploration activities now focus
on locations where there is a good potential for finding additional sources of high quality supply but
complex geologic structures increase the probability of negative wells explains the paucity of private
sector involvement. However, the DGRE, the department in the MOA that is responsible for
groundwater exploration and monitoring recognizes this, and is making efforts to provide better
incentives for greater private sector participation. Monitoring data are now being made available to a
wide range of actors, including the private sector. Under this Project, a regular discussion forum is
envisaged, which is intended to encourage the establishment of a professional association as well as to
address challenges faced by the private sector in developing its capacity. It has also been identified that,
at the present stage, it is far from clear that transferring exploration and development capacities to the
private sector can be done without careful preparation. Uncontrolled development of groundwater
resources by private companies and individuals is the single largest factor underlying overexploitation
and saline intrusion problems emerging in many countries. In this context, the exploratory well
program within DGRE may remain as part of the larger strategy for sustainable development of
Tunisia's water resources.
Research and extension continue to be in the domain of the public sector, but there is a gradual move
towards diminishing the overall role of the State. Agricultural research continues to be a public good in
the Tunisian context. Private sector involvement is small since its financial and technical capacity is still
limited. However, inroads are being made slowly. Several research institutes now contract out research
projects to the private sector. Under the Project, strengthening of research committees is envisaged
through improved representation of farmers (demand). In the area of extension, the government is keen
on exploring the possibility of greater involvement of academics, agro-industry, and other private
sector operators. To this end, a pilot extension project with UTAP (private farmers association) has
been launched recently.
In the case of small-scale irrigation systems the government continues to play the major role since the
scale and scope of the investments preclude any private sector investors. For the small-scale irrigation
systems, the government is moving towards greater transfer of responsibilities to the water users

associations. The goverunent bears the development costs, but O&M costs are completely the
responsibility of the water users associations (AICs) that have to be created to manage these irrigation
perimeters. The record of cost recovery has been mixed so far, with some associations faring better
than others. In this regard, the capacity building component under the Project will provide the weaker
AICs with much needed training and, in the long-term contribute to greater autonomy of the
associations, as well as sustainability of the investments.
Evaluative Criteria for Water Sector Investments (excluding groundwater):
Irrigation:  For tubewell irrigation, sub-project selection criteria for individual or groups of
tubewells and related irrigation infrastructure with a cost exceeding TD5,000/ha but less than TD
500,000 in aggregate would be subject to a simplified procedure for cost-benefit analysis and would
need to demonstrate a benefit cost ratio greater than 1.05. Sub-projects with an estimated total cost of
more than TD 500,000 would be subject to a feasibility study with a complete cost-benefit analysis and
would need to have an ERR of 10% minimum to receive Loan finance. Sub-projects costing less than
TD5,000/ha would not be subject to an economic analysis to be eligible for financing. Periodic
"audits" of the economic analyses for the smaller sub-projects and reviews of all larger sub-projects
under the ongoing ASIL has proved to be successful. For irrigation modernization, the one perimeter
already proposed for Project finance, Utique (sectors 2 and 3), has been extensively analyzed and
demonstrates an ERR of about 15%.
Cost-effectiveness analysis for deep tubewell exploration:
The following methodology was used to determine, ex post, the cost-effectiveness of the deep
exploratory tubewells investments: between 1990 and 1995, exploration activities by the DGRE
resulted in the estimated annual sustainable aquifer yield in Tunisia increasing by 40 million m3, of
which was 80% was utilized in irrigated agriculture and 20% for urban and rural potable water supply.
Based on this increased availability of water, returns to three representative cropping patterns (Ml,M2,
and M3) for a "with-project" (irrigated agriculture) were analyzed and compared to a typical "without-
project" cropping pattern (rainfed agriculture) using detailed farm budgets and cost of cultivation data.
MI represents the least-value added cropping pattern, with a irrigated forage and cereals (88%),
legumes (15%) and high-value vegetables (10%). M3 represents the highest-value added with legumes
(80%) and high-value peppers (50%) with M2 representing an average value-added cropping pattern.
Costs included in the analysis are the investment costs of the deep exploratory tubewells, the irrigation
development costs (at TD 7000/ha. based on an average of recently completed projects in six different
governorates), O&M costs, and the replacement cost of the pump every seven years. All financial costs
and prices were converted to economic prices using specific conversion factors. A stream of net
benefits was computed and its economic rate of return computed using the assumptions listed below.
This represents the ex post rate of return to investments in deep exploratory tubewells, and the value-
added from the additional renewable groundwater resources discovered.
Main Assumptions:
1. All additional water is of reasonable quality and is wholly allocated to agricultural
production.
2. Prices remain constant in real terms over the 20-year period covered in the with and without
project scenario (Specific conversion factors used for input prices and output prices are
presented in the detailed financial and economic analysis in the project files).
3. Tax and transfer policies remain constant over the same 20-year period so that economic
prices remain constant (1997 prices) in real terms during that period.
4. Benefits from the additional water start to accrue only in the third year, allowing two years
for development of irrigation after additional resources of water have been discovered.
5. The SCF used for capital costs was estimated to be 0.84 with a foreign exchange component
of 70%.
6. The opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent.
7. Farmers have no constraints in terms of access to inputs (including credit).

Country Republic of Tunisia                                    Project Title Second Agncultural Sector Investment Loan
8.  The opportunity cost of unskilled labor is estimated at 70% of the prevailing wage rate.
9.   The project life is 20 years.
With the above assumptions and using cropping pattern Ml, the net stream of benefits yielded a
rate of return of 18.2 % , with an NPV of 12.8 DT million for the exploration investments of the 1990-
1995 period.' Sensitivity tests indicate that with a 1-year and 2-year delay in benefits, the ERR would
have declined to 14.6 % and 12.9% respectively. A 10% increase in capital costs would have resulted
in the ERR declining to 15.9 %. The tests indicate that overall viability of the investments would be
robust over modest declines in performance even in the most conservative case. Incorporating potable
water uses would result in even more favorable economic returns. However, the nature of the results
for the conservative case demonstrates that the deep exploratory tubewell program has been cost-
effective.

Cost-Benefit Analysis for Tubewell Irrigation:
For the approximately 30 small tubewells envisaged under the project, an overall cost-benefit analysis
was carried out. Tube well irrigation comprises 21 percent of the total project costs.
The overall costs included the investment costs, O&M costs, and the pump replacement costs every
seven years. Since the new irrigated area is roughly 2000 ha., the benefits from three representative
cropping patterns (in increasing order of value-added) were computed using farm budgets and cost of
cultivation data using the same methodology as in the deep tubewell case discussed earlier. All the main
assumptions listed above hold here also. The conservative (low value-added) cropping pattern was the
same as used in the deep tubewell case. All financial prices and costs were converted to economic prices
using specific conversion factors. The benefits are assumed to come on stream in the third year of
implementation starting with 40%, followed by 60%, 80% and then 100% of total benefits. The stream of
net benefits was calculated and its economic rate of return was calculated to be 20.1% with an NPV of
TD 9.4 million. Results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that with an increase in total costs of 10%,
the ERR declines to 15.9%. A delay in 1-year of project benefits would result in the ERR declining to
14.6%. The combination of a 10% increase in capital costs and a 1-year delay in benefits would result in
the ERR declining to 12.8%. The results are robust across all the scenarios attesting to the viability of the
investments. Switching values indicate that benefits would have to decline by 39%, and costs increase by
68% to maintain a minimum ERR of 10%. The high switching values indicate that the ERR is quite
robust and that the risk from these crucial variables is low.
The ERRs for cropping pattems M2 and M3 are significantly higher at 24.3% and 56.0% respectively.
However, only the results from the most conservative case are presented here.

Incremental investments and recurrent expenditures resulting from the project activities after completion of implementation would average around $US 4 million
per annum with a sharp peak of US$8.6million approximately seven years in to the operational period (year 2007) and every seven years thereafter when pump equipment
in small-scale irrigation systems would need to be replaced. The amount ($US 4 million) includes: (a) for recurrent costs, maintenance of measurement recorders, data
monitoring costs of the piezometric network, spare parts, maintenance, and fuel costs for the auscultation unit and the electric prospection unit, o[fice operating costs, staff
salaries (including travel allowances), and annual maintenance costs of the civil works. The water users associations would be responsible for 100% of the operations and
routine maintenance of the irrigation pumps; (b) for investment costs, replacement of computers in year 2003 (and every 3 years thereafter), replacement of vehicles
starting in year 2004 (and every 5 years thereafter)

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
ProcuremIgal
Procurement methods (Table A)
Works and goods contracts financed by the Loan will be procured according to standard Bank
procedures, as set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Procurement methods, by
disbursement category, are detailed in Table A below.
* International competitive bidding (ICB) for works contracts of an estimated cost equal or
greater than US$ 3 million equivalent, and equipment contracts of an estimated cost equal or greater than
US$ 350,000 equivalent. All international procurement will use standard bidding documents of the
Bank.
* National competitive bidding (NCB) for works contracts of an estimated cost less than US$ 3
million equivalent, and equipment contracts of an estimated cost less than US$ 350,000 equivalent.
* National shopping for goods with an estimated cost of less than US$50,000.
* Owing to lack of other providers, direct contracting will be used with the Societe Tunisienne
de l 'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG) for electrification of irrigation pumping stations.
Consultants will be selected in conformity with procedures specified in the Bank's "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants", January 1997, and revised in September 1997.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
Bank-financed contracts awarded by ICB, works contracts above a threshold of US$1,000,000
equivalent, contracts for goods equal to or above the equivalent of US$350,000, and consultants
contracts equal to or above the equivalent of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals would
be subject to the Bank's prior review. These thresholds reflect the performance of the MOA on
procurement of similar works and goods under the ASIL and Research and Extension projects. The
rview process would cover about 25 percent of the total contract amounts. This low percentage is due
to the large number of small civil work contracts, and is deemed acceptable given the satisfactory
procurement of the same executing agencies under existing projects and the acceptability to the Bank of
the national competitive bidding procedures. The first two small contracts for irrigation perimeters and
the first two contracts (each) for groundwater prospecting and monitoring would be reviewed by the
Bank prior to award. For other procurement, prior to the submission of the related withdrawal
application, the Borrower should furnish all information and documentation that the Bank may
reasonably request in respect of such procurement.

US$ 50,000 equivalent for individuals and training.
* Full documentation for expenditures under contracts requiring the Bank's prior review will be
submitted with the corresponding application.
Special account:
Upon effectiveness an amount of FRF 17,600,000 of the authorized allocation of
FRF 23,500,000) will be deposited to a Special Account acceptable to the Bank. The remaining balance
will be made available when the funds withdrawn from the loan acount and the special commitments
issued reach an amount of FRF 70,500,000 Replenishment applications will be submitted on a monthly
basis or when the total disbursement from the Special Account equals to one third of the initital deposit,
whichever comes first.
Co-financement.
No cofinancing is planned.
