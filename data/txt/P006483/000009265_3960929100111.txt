MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEND.TION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SCIENCE RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROJECT
l.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$150 million
equivalent to help finance programs to strengthen Brazil's human resources and
research capacity in science. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of
grace.
2.    Background.  Capacity building in science and technology is a critical
input to productivity growth. Because of uncertain and non-appropriable
returns to research and externalities to graduate training, the public sector
must finance most basic science research and training, as well as areas such
as development of industrial measurements and standards. In Brazil, total
investment in research and development (R&D) currently amounts to about 0.7Z
of GDP, 80Z of which is publicly financed. Economic returns to Brazil's
public investments in science, which require a long gestation period, have
been threatened by policies which limited competition and thus did not
encourage technological innovation in the productive sector. The Government's
technology transfer and intellectual property rights laws and regulations have
also probably discouraged productive sector innovation. The new
administration in Brazil, in a major step towards eliminating barriers to
competition, recently adopted a comprehensive trade reform program which has
done away with most quantitative restrictions on imports. The Government is
also currently reviewing its policies in areas such as intellectual property
rights and technology transfer with a view to making policy changes. The
actions taken to date, as well as those being contemplated, are expected to
enhance economic growth by strengthening Brazil's capacity to respond to and
adapt science and technology to local conditions.
3.    In the early 1980s. development of Brazil's capacity in science research
was in jeopardy because of highly centralized and bureaucratic decision-
making, lack of continuity in funding, and inadequate attention to emerging
areas and to support services. In 1985, in an attempt to develop key
scientific areas and to improve the management of public funds, Brazil
initiated the Support Program for Scientific and Technological Development
(PADCT), which was partially financed by the Bank (Loan 2489-BR, US$72
million). PADCT provides support through competitive grants for basic
research and graduate training in chemistry and chemical engineering,
biotechnology, geosciences and mineral technology, and instrumentation. These
areas were chosen on the basis of their perceived importance for future
economic development and on the relative inadequacy of their human resources
base. PADCT also finances the support areas of science information, science
research consumables, maintenance of scientific equipment, science planning
and management, science education in primary and secondary schools, and basic
industrial technology (i.e. measurement, standards and quality control). The



2
program currently accounts for 6Z of the Government's effort in R&D directed
at universities and research institutes, most of which is in the form of
scholarships, salary support, and non-competitive direct institutional
support.
4.    After an initial period of skepticism both within and outside
Government, PADCT has successfully introduced and strengthened processes such
as science community participation in sub-sector planning, peer review, and
open competition for grants, and overall has demonstrated a superior system of
resource allocation in the sector. Until recencly, implementation suffered
from long delays in importing scientific equipment because of excessively
centralized management as well as Government requirements for licensing of
imports. Since May 1989, new PADCT leadership has inproved the importation
process considerably. The recent trade reform will help to ensure that
importation continues to proceed smoothly. At present, all loan funds in this
first project are committed for research contracts, training and equipment.
Because of the lag time in purchasing equipment and utilizing scholarships,
about 742 of loan funds were disbursed by August 30, 1990. The project will
close December 1991, one year after the original closing date.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Brazil
emphasizes efficient resource allocation, especially in the public sector, and
the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. The
main focus of the Bank's human resources strategy in Brazil is on redirection
of public spending to those social programs that are largely public goods,
especially basic education and health services. Bank support for science
research and graduate-level training is an important element of this strategy,
since it supports long-term human resource development through a set of
activities the private sector will not finance, and helps to ensure improved
management of public sector investments.
6.    Proiect Obiectives and Description.  The objectives of the project are
to continue to strengthen research capacity in key scientific and support
areas, including human resources development, and to consolidate institutional
reforms. The project also seeks to improve science sector management and
encourage policies designed to improve the economic environment for
technological innovation. The loan will help finance a time slice of the
US$300 million first phase of a planned eight year US$600 million Government
program to strengthen science research and training. Specifically the project
will finance the purchase of equipment, local and overseas training, research
expenses, consultant services, information services, publications, and
monitoring and evaluation for an estimated 900 training and research programs
in the areas currently being supported under PADCT I (see para. 3) as well as
in the two new areas of new materials and environmental science. In addition,
the project supports two studies. A policy study will review issues related
to the long term role of science and technology in Brazil's economic
development and will make recommendations to improve public sector management
of the sector, including policies which would foster increased private sector
technological innovation. A study on the productivity and international
competitiveness of Brazilian industry will complement current Government



3
policy changes through reviewing and making recommendations for changes in
behavioral patterns of firms, relations between management and employees, and
relations between the productive sector, government, education, and the
science and technology community.
7.    As under PADCT I, an Executive Secretariat within the Secretariat of
Science and Technology (SCT) will coordinate the project. Technical
committees, consisting mainly of scientists, engineers, and businessmen,
decided on the allocation of resources within and between sub-programs. Bank
staff and consultants reviewed and approved the objectives and allocations
of the sub-programs to ensure an adequate level of specificity and an
appropriate balance between basic and applied research. Compared with PADCT
I, the sub-program objectives have greater emphasis on engineering and other
types of applied research and training, as well as increased emphasis on
industry/university collaboration, all of which will help to ensure that
research to be financed under the project will have long-term payoffs in
increased productivity and development of new products. In the course of
project implementation independent committees, consisting mainly of
scientists, engineers, and businessmen, will select, on the basis of open
competition, research and training projects to be financed under the project.
Brazil's two main autonomous science funding agencies, the National Council
for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Agency for
Financing of Studies and Projects (FINEP), as well as the Coordinating Agency
for Training of High Level Personnel (CAPES), a department of the Ministry of
Education, will administer and monitor contracts awarded under PADCT. An
international advisory group of renowned scientists (GEA) will meet yearly to
provide an independent review of progress and of the relevance of PADCT to
Brazil's development needs. In accordance with PADCT operational guidelines,
each sub-program has set aside funds for dissemination of research results
through a variety of seminars, meetings, newsletters, and publications. In
addition, a specific objective of the basic industrial technology sub-program
is to develop a network of centers providing information to industry groups on
latest developments in the sector.
8.    The project will be carried out over five years.  The total cost is
estimated at US$300.0 million, which amounts to half of the planned Government
program to be undertaken over eight years. The Government is seeking
additional external financing for the second half of the program which would
begin three years from now. The foreign exchange component is US$103.4
million (35X of project costs). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of up to US$200,000 will be provided to initiate the
policy study. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8811-BR, dated October 19, 1990, is
also available.

9.    Agreed Actions.  Conditions of effectiveness will be: (a) the Government
will allocate adequate counterpart funds for the first calendar year of
project implementation; (b) the Government will sign agreements with FINEP and
CNPq for these agencies to implement their respective parts of the project;
(c) the Government will prepare terms of reference and a work program
acceptable to the Bank for undertaking the policy study; and (d) the
Government will prepare terms of reference acceptable to the Bank for
undertaking the productivity study and will select Commission members whose
experience and qualifications shall be acceptable to the Bank. Conditions and
assurances are as follows: (a) Any changes in PADCT operational guidelines,
sub-program documents, as well as allocations among sub-programs, shall be
acceptable to the Bank. The key features of the operational guidelines are:
(i) decisions on award of sub-projects shall be in the hands of technical
committees consisting mainly of members of the science and business
communities; (ii) research awards shall be made on a competitive basis; (iii)
awards shall be made taking in due consideration the need to strengthen
existing centers of excellence, and to provide multi-year support, in
accordance with guidelines for minimum and average size of grants stated in
the operational guidelines; (iv) inflation corrections shall be made to ensure
that the objectives of awards can be attained; (v) an international advisory
group (GEA) shall meet regularly to provide an independent analysis of project
implementation and effectiveness; and (vi) a special technical committee, with
experts whose qualifications and experience shall be acceptable to the Bank,
will be established no later than two months after the date of loan
effectiveness, and will review all proposals for improvement of scientific
metrology services. (b) The policy study shall be completed six months after
loan signing; the productivity study shall be completed by October 30, 1992;
the Bank shall have an opportunity to comment on drafts of both studies; and
the Government shall inform the Bank of all actions it will take based on the
recommendations of both studies. (c) The qualifications and experience of the
project director shall be acceptable to the Bank. (d) The Government will
prepare and send to the Bank on an annual basis each May 30 a review of
financing of science and technology, including PADCT II, covering sources and
uses of funds, based on criteria acceptable to the Bank. (e) Two years after
loan signing, or after 60X of loan funds are committed, whichever comes first,
the Bank and the Government will review progress in project implementation.
On the basis of the review the Government will adjust operational guidelines
and sub-program objectives, and strategy and reallocate funds among sub-
programs as necessary. A condition of disbursement for funding of the
productivity study is the preparation by Government through SCT of a detailed
work program for the study, satisfactory to the Bank.
10.   Benefits.  The project will increase human resource capacity in science,
i.mprove the efficiency of resource allocation in science and technology, and
foster increased understanding and public debate on policies affecting the
returns to investment in science research and training. Through these
benefits, the project will enhance economic growth by strengthening Brazil's
capacity to respond to and adapt science and technology to local conditions.

Project beneficiaries are estimated to include 2,400 Brazilian scientists,
6,600 graduate science students, 25,700 undergraduate students, 135,000
primary and secondary teachers and 5,400,000 students, 7,300 technicians, 80
research institutes, 60 universities, and an undetermined ntunber of other
users of science and technology and information services.
11.   Risks.  Institutional change, including devolving decision-making to the
scientific community and decentralizing the system of importation, as well as
strengthening the Government's own planning and analytical capacity, is a
delicate and complex process. The risk that these changes will not be
solidified or that counterpart funds will not be made available will be
minimized by the strong support for the project, especially its objective of
decentralized decision-making, by the scientific community as a whole and the
considerable influence of this group on the Government, by the high quality of
recently appointed Government officials responsible for the sector, and by
project-mandated annual and mid-term reviews. A long term risk to achievement
of the goal of encouraging technological innovation in the private sector
would be continued macroeconomic instability as well as trade and other
restrictions on competition. This risk would be met in part through project
supported studies as well as through the Bank's overall dialogue with the
Government on these issues. As a means of increasing competition, the
Government recently eliminated most quantitative restrictions on imports and
is implementing a number of additional steps which will eventually help to
increase the long-term economic returns to investment in science.
12.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
