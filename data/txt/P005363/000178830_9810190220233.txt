INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED SIXTH LOAN TO THE BANQUE NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE) to be guaranteed by the
Kingdom of Morocco, for the equivalent of US$24 million, to help finance
lending for industry. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggre-
gate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment pro-
jects financed out of the proceeds of the loan, with a maximum period of 15
years for individual investment projects. The interest rate would be 7-1/4
percent per annun.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.   An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Morocco" (EMA-42) was distributed to the Executive Directors in September,
1971. More recent economic information is given below. The next economic
mission is scheduled to visit Morocco during the fall of 1973. A country
data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.   In the period since independence (1956) the traditional social and
political order has been essentially maintained while the economic structure
began to change gradually. Traditional subsistence rainfed agriculture still
occupies more than half of the active population while a small but growing
modern agricultural sector provides a large part of commercial agricultural
production. Phosphate mining is the major industrial activity. The relative
importance of manufacturing industry which is oriented toward import substi-
tution is growing only slowly. Traditional crafts and trades provide substan-
tial employment. The fast growing tourism traffic has made tourism the most
dynamic sector of the economy. Major constraints to balanced economic growth
continue to be the vulnerability of agriculture to drought, low savings, and
insufficient dynamism of the private sector, especially in industry. Unemploy-
ment in cities and in the countryside is high and there are large differences
in cultural and economic levels between regions and population groups. Rapid
growth of the population aggravates the problems.
Development Policies
4.   Following an extended period of quasi-stagnation, the growth of output
in most sectors during the present Plan period (1968-1972) eceeded the con-
servative Plan targets. Agricultural production increased over 6 percent
annually in 1968-71, partly due to a mediocre crop in the base year. But
taking more normal periods as a base, average growth of agricultural output
has been about 3.5 percent, still above expectations. In 1969 and 1970,
medium and large scale manufacturing grew by 8 percent annually but slowed
down in 1972. The sector as a whole grew by only 5 percent during the last



five years, slightly more than planned. Mining fell short of the Plan target,
largely on account of a slackening world demand for phosphates and also because
of depletion of other mineral resources; however, market prospects for phosphates
have improved in 1972, and production is expanding with recently completed
capacity. Building and public works also fell behind target.

Total (government services excluded)      4.3               5.7
5.   The political events of mid-summer 1971, following the first attempted
coup d'etat, had limited effects on the overall growth rate in that year.    In
1972, however, industrial production slackened, while mining and tourism con-
tinued to grow. Although the August 1972 disturbances did not seem to affect
investment decisions, fixed capital formation, in particular the purchase of
new capital equipment, fell in 1972 for the second consecutive year. Growth
of total fixed investment is estimated at an annual rate of 3.5 percent over
the 1968-1972 period, falling substantially short of the Plan target of 7.8
percent. Fixed investments account now for about 13 percent of GDP instead
of 17 percent that had been planned.
6.   The objectives pursued by successive governments since independence
include: acceleration of economic growth and improvement of living standards;
preservation of social and political stability; and promotion of "Moroccani-
zation", i.e. a larger share of Moroccan ownership and management in foreign-
owned land, commercial and financial companies, and industry. At the same
time new foreign investment in industry, tourism and mining continues to be
encouraged by the Government. In August 1971 the King stressed several
socioeconomic objectives, extension of education and reform of administration.
Some measures have already been taken but the coming 1973-1977 Plan is looked
to for a more positive application of this new orientation. Total domestic
savings remained at 12 percent of GDP which is too low for accelerated deve-
lopment.
7.   A substant4ai improvement on the external account took place over the
last two years as a result of lower imports of investment goods and a jump in
phosphate exports, increased tourist activity and larger workers' remittances.
The deficit on current account which had attained a $140 million peak in 1970
disappeared in 1972. Disbursements on official loans increased, however, to



- 3 -
an estimated $110 million in 1972. There was a net outflow of short term
private capital. Reserves increased by $60 million to a level of $240 million
at the end of 1972, equivalent to five months' imports of goods.
Development Prospects
8.   Although the 1968-72 Development Plan has come to an end, a new five-year
plan is still being prepared and may not be completed before mid-1973, so that
this year may well be a transitional one. However, implementation in 1973 of
public projects postponed from 1972 could prevent a further fall in invest-
ments. Economic prospects for the next two or three years continue to be
overshadowed by current political uncertainties.
9.   The immediate need is for an acceleration of public investments so as to
stimulate the growth of output and private investments. Morocco's foreign
exchange reserves and the improved balance of payments situation can support
a significant increase in the level of investment. In the longer run, invest-
ments should rise to a structurally higher level than in the past to sustain
a growth rate of 2 to 3 percent in per capita production and to alleviate
existing unemployment. Investment is forecast to grow by about 7 percent in
1974 and possibly more in future years. Ample investment opportunities appear
to exist in tourism, for which Morocco is particularly well endowed, in indus-
try through exports to the European Economic Community, in agriculture through
completion of irrigation schemes, and in urban development which has been lagging.
10. At the end of 1971, external public debt amounted to $794 million, of
which medium-term private credit amounted to 15 percent. Debt service was
expected to grow rapidly in 1972 but is still likely to remain below 10 per-
cent of exports of goods and services. Assuming continued improvements in
exports and no substantial deterioration in the concessionary terms of the
aid received, Morocco retains substantial capacity to service additional debt.
If these assumptions hold true, the debt service ratio would be expected to
rise only gradually reaching about 15 percent by the end of the decade.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
11.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco amount to $303.1 million (net of
cancellations) for 17 projects, of which four were financed under IDA credits
totalling $36.8 million. IFC investments amount to $2.4 million. Annex II
gives a summary of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March
31, 1973 together with notes on the implementation of ongoing projects,
particularly those which are encountering delays. While initial implemen-
tation of projects carried out by the Government or its agencies is often
slow and can, at times, be very disappointing (see in particular Loan 850-MOR
in Annex II) project performance usually improves with the passage of time as
has recently happened with two education projects. On the other hand, pro-
ject implementation by the three autonomous financial institutions to which
the Bank lends (BNDE, CIH and CNCA) is generally satisfactory.
12.       The Bank Group program aims at assisting Morocco in the adoption of
policies to curtail unemployment, develop agriculture and industry and improve



urban and rural living conditions, and by advising on, and obtaining necessary
institutional and sectoral reforms. To achieve these objectives the Bank
has concentrated on projects in agriculture (35 percent), education (6 per-
cent), industry (30 percent), transportation (5 percent), tourism (8 percent),
and urban infrastructure (16 percent). In the future the Bank plans to
continue its efforts in the same sectors, but the pace at which this program
can be carried out will depend to a large extent on the Government's ability
to prepare projects and to take related policy decisions.
13.       In the financing of agricultural projects the Bank has so far
helped develop Large scale irrigation schemes and agricultural credit of the
traditional type. In this connection it has insisted on the importance of
efficient organization of the sector, of land reform and of the development
of small scale farms.   The Government has recently greatly accelerated land
distribution and is presently preparing agricultural projects which are
directed at small farmers and which are expected to be submitted to the Bank.
14.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.    Two
IDA credits have been made for education and a third project is under pre-
paration for later consideration. The first two projects, however, have
encountered some difficulties (see Annex II) and presentation of the third
is contingent upon continuing improvements in the first two.
15.       The financing of industry and tourism has so far been made only
through two DFC's (BNDE and CIH). While these DFC's are expected to continue
playing the main role in Bank lending in these sectors, the Bank is presently
appraising a large phosphoric acid project and is helping prepare a tourism
infrastructure project as Executing Agency for a UNDP financed study. Pro-
jects in these sectors are primarily helping Morocco enlarge its foreign ex-
change earnings but also increasingly enable the Bank to help improve sectoral
policies and to encourage the creation of employment opportunities.
16.       The first transportation loan was for a highway project and included
financing of a sector review which is now serving as a basis for future
transport investments as well as recommendations on transport policy. Among
the investments recommended in the sector review, a second highway project
has already been appraised by the Bank and a port project is being prepared
for Bank consideration.
17.       The first Bank financing for public utility serving urban infra-
structure is the $48 million Water Supply loan signed in July 1972 but not
yet effective (see Annex II). A $25 million power project has also been
appraised and is expected to be presented soon to the Executive Directors.
By means of these two projects the Bank is trying to help the Government to
bring about much needed improvements in the organization of the public utility
sector. The wider social problems due to the rapid urbanization presently
taking place are expected to be tackled more directly through a site and
services project which is being prepared with the Bank's assistance.
18.       A Consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April 1967.   It in-
cludes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Spain,
the U.K., The U.S., IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African Development Bank and the



- 5 -
European Investment Bank. The Group last met in October 1971, when it wel-
comed the Government's new policies and affirmed continued support for Morocco.
The next meeting of the Consultative Group is tentatively scheduled foz the
Spring of 1974, when it will consider Morocco's new Five Year Plan (1973-1977).
Official foreign assistance to Morocco has shown a rising trend, from a total
DH 651 million in 1966, to DH 848 million (of which DH 92 million in grants)
in 1971. The major sources of aid were the U.S., Germany, the Bank Group
and France.
III - THE SECTOR
19.       Next to agriculture and tourism, manufacturing has come to be an
important sector in Morocco's economy. During the last decade, manufacturing
was about 13 percent of GDP despite the pronounced growth of both agriculture
and tourism. Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) is
the sole provides of long term finance for industrial investments, and the
Bank, helping BNDE meet its resource needs for import financing through re-
peated loans, has made a major contribution to industrial development in
Morocco.
20.       Growth of industrial production which had been slow in the early 1960's
accelerated in the three-year period 1968-1970 to about 6 percent annually.
In 1971, output grew only by an estimated 4 percent in real terms, due to
adverse political circumstances, and according to current projections, the
growth rate may have declined even further in 1972. Growth has been uneven
from sector to sector: while building material production increased by 35
percent over the period 1966-1970, metal transformation by 44 percent and
textiles by 52 percent, the chemical industry grew only by 13 percent and the
shoe and leather industry by 3 percent.
21.       Exports of manufactures are relatively recent, import substitution
having been the traditional aim of Moroccan industry. Lately, however, the
limitation of the domestic market and the opportunities opened by the 1969
association with the European Economic Community have induced the Moroccan
industrialists to become more active in the export markets. Exports of manu-
factures have increased by about 7 percent annually since 1965 and reached
DH 526 million or nearly 20 percent of exports of goods in 1970. Half of
these were food products. Non-food manufactured exports were mainly textiles,
leather goods, clothing, handicraft and fertilizers.
22.       Various weaknesses and problems have prevented a more balanced
growth of the manufacturing industry in Morocco. The share of value added
in gross output is low, ranging from 14 to 27 percent. In addition, scarcity
of managerial and other skills, exacerbated by keen competition for the avail-
able talent between the major sectors, impedes a more rapid growth of in-
dustry. However, unemployment remains substantial among unskilled workers.
Government intervention in the industrial sector has not always been well adapted
to solving these difficulties. Extensive controls have had negative effects
on private entrepreneurs. To a certain extent this has been compensated by
an impressive array of incentives but the response of private industrial
investment to the benefits offered has, on the whole, not met expectations.



23.       The oriertation of Moroccan industrial policies and related finan-
cial incentive measures have been the subject of discussions between the
Government and the Bank Group for several years. These talks brought out that
there could be advantageous changes in the incentive system which so far had
favored capital-intensive investments, and had put little emphasis on pro-
moting industrial exports and employment creation. Also the granting of in-
centives had been on ad hoc basis by an investment commission and without clear
guidance of well defined policy criteria. However, the Bank has recently
been informed that new legislation on industrial incentives was being finali-
zed. Incentives would be defined selectively according to sectors, geographical
regions as well as importance of projects, and greater automaticlty would be
applied in granting incentives to investors meeting predetermined criteria
within the framework of this selectivity. Furthermore, grants toward invest-
ment costs woule b? replaced by income tax exemptions, which are neutral
vis-a-vis labor iit.ensive or capital intensive investments. These features
embody Bank advice on industrial policy, and the dialogue on further possible
modifications is expected to continue.
IV - THE PROJECT
24.       An appraisal report on BNDE (No. 90a, dated April 11, 1973) is being
distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary, is attached as Annex III.
The Bank's fifth loan to BNDE was fully committed against sub-projects in
December 1972. The proposes sixth BNDE project was first appraised in
January/February 1972, and this appraisal updated in September 1972.
Negotiations for L he proposed loan were held in Washington, D.C. on March
20 to 23, 1973. DNDE was represented by Mr. Mustapha Faris, its President
and General Manager and Mr. Mansouri, Deputy General Manager, and the Guarantor
by Mr. Cheggour, of the Ministry of Finance.
BNDEts Objectives and Role in the Economy
25.       From its inception in 1959 BNDE has occupied a key position in the
Moroccan economy as the only financial institution authorized to provide long-
term financing to the manufacturing sector. Recently BNDE has supported 75
percent of all industrial projects approved by the Moroccan Investment Commis-
sion, and its financing typically accounts for 40 percent of the total cost
of projects. Since there is no alternative source of long-term financing for
industry, BNDE's operations representatively reflect the distribution of
investments in 4iorocco. In addition, BNDE plays a major role in the alloca--
tion of medium-term finance to industry by appraising and approving loans as
they are presented by commercial banks to the Central Bank for rediscount.
26,       The average capital cost per job created by BNDE projects under the
previous Bank loan is about $9,000 if the investment is below $1.5 million,
and $17,000 if the investments is between $1.5 million and $3 million. These
figures, while not particularly low, are in line with the capital cost per
job in comparable countries despite the bias of exisitng legislation on
investment incentives in favor of capital intensive operations. It was agreed
during negotiations that BNDE through its follow-up work would measure the
impact on employment of projects it finances to serve as feedback and back-
ground information for future project appsaisals of BNDE. To improve the



-7-
measurement of the economic merits of projects it finances, BNDE has agreed to
calculate the effective rate of protection and financial rate of return with
and without the incentives granted by the Government. In addition, BNDE
will start to calculate the economic rate of return on large projects and it
aims at extending the coverage as experience grows.
Resources
27.       BNDE's share capital, as increased in December 1972, amounts to
DH 32.4 million; 56 percent is held by Moroccan public institutions and
individuals. IFC has contributed about 17 percent and the remainder has
been subscribed to by subsidiaries of foreign institutions resident in Morocco
and foreign banks. BNDE's equity including reserves of DH 19 million, amounted
to DH 51.9 million at the end of 1972. BNDE plans to have its shares listed
sometime in 1973; this operation is likely to be a success in view of the large
over-subscription by the Moroccan public to both BNDE's 1973 share increase
and January 1973 bond issue.
28.       From its inception to 1970, BNDE relied mainly on the Bank and
the Government for its resources. As of December 31, 1972, 61 percent of
its outstanding resources were Bank funds. Government loans were BNDE's main
source of local currency but since 1971 local bond issues have also come to
form a new and important source of funds.
29.       Foreign resources have come primarily from the Bank, which has lent
BNDE nearly $100 million. Until 1970, the only other foreign loan was from
USAID ($3 million in 1970). However, with improved income prospects resulting
from a recent increase in its lending rate to 9 percent, BNDE is now in a better
position to tap foreign sources of capital. The first inroads were made in
1971 and 1972, with a loan from the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) for DH 46
million, and a loan of DH 12 million from the Kuwait Development Fund. Alto-
gether, foreign borrowings, obtained and under negotiation, in addition to
Bank funds, total about $30 million. However, these funds are partly for
tied procurement only and BNDE has been reluctant to borrow long-term, untied
funds, because the interest rates on such funds have been substantially higher
than those it is accustomed to pay. But, given its prospects of profitability,
it is the Bank's view that BNDE could afford a rate as hign as approximately
its own lending rate on some limited amounts, considering this as a price to
pay in order to enter the international capital market. During negotiations
it was agreed that BNDE would try to work out a borrowing program to that
effect.
Management and Organization
30.       BNDE's 16-member Board meets about four times a year, sets BNDE's
policy and approves all loans. The Board has delegated to an 8-member
Executive Committee the power to approve all loans and investment proposals
below DH 4 million and to review all operations. On December 18, 1972, Mr.
Mustapha Faris, former Minister of Finance, succeeded Mr. M'hamed Bargach,
who had been BNDE's President and General Manager since early 1971.



- & -
31.       During a good part of 1972 BNDE experienced organizational
difficulities, resulting in a deterior-ation in BNDE's financial administration
and in the quality of appraisal work. A new organization plan was introduced
in September 1972. The staff is now split into two clearly defined groups -
the first dealing with legal and administrative matters, financial management
and business promotion; the second is in charge of project work such as
appraisal, follov-up economic studies and equity investments. Each group
is headed by a Deputy General Manager. This isew organization seems to be
sensible and should bring an overall improvement of BNDE's work. Although
the change is very recent, some improvements can alreadv be noticed in BNDE's
follow-up of projects and financial administration.
Operations
32.       From its inception in 1959 to June 30, 1972, BNDE approved 428
direct loans and equity operations for a total of DH 809 million (ITS$ 192
million equivalent). It furthermore approved 500 rediscountable medium term
loans amounting to DII 677 million.  During 1967-69, BNDE's annual approvals of
direct operations hovered around DH 60 million. In 1970, they reached a
record level of DE 167 million, boosted by the good investment climate pre-
vailing at the t-me, and by a few large projects. In 1972, approvals were
only DH 97 million. These fluctuations in BNDE's approvals reflect primarily
Morocco's economic and political situation.
33.       Total equity participations represent only 5.8 percent of direct
operations. In the late sixties, BNDE made equity investments of only DH
2 million, partly due to its owm reluctance and to the scarcity of good
opportunities. The Societe Naticnal d'Investissement (SNI) has further
reduced BNDE's investment opportunities by its ourchasing, together with the
Government, freshly floated shares of existing exterprises. To help broaden
BNDE's role, the Government agreed during negotiations for the fifth Bank
loan that BNDE would have freedom to seek out share investment opportunities,
and the Bank encouraged BNDr to do so.    In 1971 and 1972, BNDE made 14 equity
investments for DH 26,8 million0
34.       BNDE's loans to industry have terms of 5 to 12 years with a weighted
average life of about 7.5 years including 1.5 vears of grace.    Following the
last Bank loan, interest is at 9 percent since January 1, 1972 but borrowers
can in principle benefit selectively from an interest rate rebate of 2 per-
centage points.   To date, hiowever, no rebate has in fact been granted.   The
Government has advised the Bank that ther-e will be no such rebate until criteria
for the eligibility of beneficiaries have been established. Loans are
directed primarily towards financing the import component of a project, but a
small portion of local cost is usually also covered.    Overall, about 90 per-
cent of BNDE's commitments are used to finaince imports.
Financial Results and Portfolio
35.       BNDE's accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse & Co., Casablanca,
and the 1971 accounts as well as those of earlier years were certified with-
out qualification. BNDE's balance sheets and income statements are summarized



- 9 -
in Annex III. BNDE's profitability is satisfactory, and it has been improving
due to increasing leverage and to the stability of administrative expenses
at 1.2 percent of average total assets. In 1972, BNDE's net profits before
provisions were 12.1 percent of net worth and 19 percent of share capital, and
they are projected to rise to 15.5 percent and 33 percent respectively by
1977.
36.       BNDE's liquidity position is satisfactory and its loan portfolio
is sound and well protected by mortgages and suitable guarantees. On December
31, 1972, BNDE had loans totalling DH 374 million outstanding in some 180
companies. Arrears over 3 months represent 5 percent of total portfolio and,
although higher than in recent years, are at a manageable level; reserves
exceed by a considerable margin realistic estimates of possible losses.
37.       BNDE's equity portfolio consists of investments in 34 companies
totalling DE 50.4 million, out of which DH 47.2 million has been paid in.
BNDE's dividend income increased about five times between 1968 and 1972,
from DH 387,000 to DH 1,807,000.   The latter figure still represents a return
of only about 4 percent on equity portfolio. The equity participations made
in 1971 (DH 17.9 million) to help increase Moroccan participation in foreign
firms should increase the return on BNDE's equity portfolio in the future.
38.       An agreement with the Government made in 1962, allows BNDE to retain
tax free provisions. BNDE has taken full advantage of this privilege
and considers the whole amount of the provisions so established as part of
its net worth. Only part of these provisions are needed to cover BNDE's loss
risk on its loan portfolio, and the rest could be considered as free reserves
and counted as part of BNDE's net worth. A careful review of BNDE's
portfolio has shown that, of the 5 percent of this portfolio affected by
arrears of over three months, 3 percent represented real loss risks. The
analysis of BNDE's projected financial results uses this percentage which
needs to be reviewed every year.
BNDE's Future Operations
39.       To meet its forecast commitments through 1977, BNDE will need
resources of about DH 676 million ($161 million equivalent). Over the two-year
period 1973/74, BNDE's projected commitments amount to DH 279 million and
projected resources to DR 163 million, leaving a resource gap of DH 116 million
($28 million equivalent). However, in order to enable the Bank to appraise the
results of the organizational improvement referred to in paragraph 31, it
seems prudent to have the proposed sixth Bank loan cover a shorter period
than the usual two years. On the basis of the above projections, the resource
gap for 18 months starting January 1, 1973, would be $21 million. Neither
the $28 million nor the $21 million resource gap take into account one large
project which has not yet been approved by BNDE because of difficulties in
negotiations with the sponsors and which would require an additional $3 million.
BNDE's management is confident that this project will be finalized during the
period of the loan and in order to make allowance for this possibility, a loan
of $24 million equivalent is recommended.



- 10 -
40.       Over the next two years, the proposed Bank loan and other foreign
exchange resources obtained by BNDE will amount to DH 199 million equivalent
while the needs for import financing by BNDE are forecast at DR 237 million.
BNDE will thus have to use some of its local currency resources to finance
imports. This will be possible thanks to the recent improvement in Morocco's
balance of payments and the ready access to foreign exchange through the
central bank.
Terms of the Proposed Loan
41.       The terms of the proposed loan would be those normally applied to
Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard com-
mitment fee. Unlike the fifth Loan Agreement with the Bank, there should be
no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for public sector projects eligible
for BNDE's financing under its policy statement. The proceeds of the loan
should be used to finance direct imports, or the equivalent of 65 percent
of off-the-shelf procurements, representing the import element of these costs.
The free limit should remain $500,000, with an aggregate free limit correspond-
ing to S6 million. The maximum amount of Bank funds to be used for a single
investment project should be fixed at $3.5 million. The definition of BNDE's
borrowing basis should be amended in order to exclude the part of provisions
needed (see para.38) to cover realistically estimated loss possibilities,
and BNDE should seek annually its auditor's opinion regarding the adequacy
of this estimate. Under the proposed definition, BNDE's limit on term debt
should be set at 6 times its borrowing basis. BNDE does not place the foreign
exchange risk upon its borrowers and as in the past this would be assumed by
the Government.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banque Nationale
pour le Developpement Economique, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for
development finance companies.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.



- 11 -
PART VI - RECOIMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  PROJECTS'IN EXECUTION
1.        Delays in disbursements of several loans and credits have been
caused mainly by cumbersome budgetary and accounting procedures and by
administrative inefficiency in submitting disbursement applications, rather
than by delays in the implementation of most projects. A Bank disbursement
officer visited Morocco in November 1971 to investigate the problem and to
propose solutions. The situation improved significantly in 1972.
Cr. No. 79  First Education Project:   US$11 million Credit of October 11,
1965; Closing Date: postponement being considered.
Considerable delays have affected the implementation of the project
but performance has improved significantly during the past six months;
construction and equipment of all schools in the project is almost completed,
project management is now satisfactory, construction aiccounts have been brought
up-to-date, funds have been released for the project, and the Association's
procedures for international bidding for furniture and equipment are being
followed. However, the Closing Date of the credit has had to be extended
twice, from the original date of June 30, 1971, to March 31, 1973, and since
almost $2.0 million remained undisbursed as of end March 1973, a further
postponement of the Closing Date is being considered.
Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August18 ,
1971; Closing Date: April 30, 1976.
This project is about ten months behind schedule due to delays in
recruitment of project staff and in the appointment of consultant architects
and no disbursements had been made by the end of March. The situation remains
under constant review with the Government, and was last reviewed by a super-
vision mission in March.
Ln. No. 643 Irrigation Project; US$46 million Loan of November 13, 1969,
Closing Date: November 30, 1978
The Sebou irrigation project is now processing well, after encounter-
ing initial delays. However, substantial cost overruns have been identified
and the Bank is currently discussing the implications of these cost increases
on the project, and on the Sebou development program, with the Government.
Land reform in the project area has not proceeded rapidly and has been brought
to the attention of the Government. A second project is due to be appraised
in September. It is expected to provide for flood protection works, roads
and a sugar cane processing factory.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses :-n project execution.

Ln. No. 642, Cr. No. 167 Highway Project; US$14.6 million of November 13,
1969; Closing Date: February 28, 1974.
The first highway project is progressing satisfactorily, after some
initial delays. By March 31, 1973, only $7.1 million had been withdrawn
out of the combined credit/loan mainly because of cumbersome government
disbursement procedures. A recent mission discussed ways of expediting
payments.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Water Supply Project has not yet been declared effective because
of the Government's failure to transfer certain assets to the Borrower, to
enforce water tariffs applicable to distribution agencies and to adopt neces-
sary legislation, all as agreed during negotiations. The Bank has kept in
close touch with the situation through different missions and latest informa-
tion indicated considerable progress in taking remedial action. However, more
concrete measures are required before the loan can be made effective.
