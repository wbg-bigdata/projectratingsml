1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most promis-
ing at some 100 GW of capacity and 250-300 TWh of annual energy capability,
as shown by the preliminary investigations made by the Government. Colombia
is also endowed with very large coal and gas deposits. Over 1970-77 crude
oil output declined at an average rate of 6.5%/a. Over the same period,
consumption of petroleum products increased by 5.5%/a. As a result, Colombia
is now a net importer of crude oil (it was a net exporter until 1976) and
prospects are for these imports to rise sharply by the early 1980s unless
additional reserves are discovered and developed quickly. Measures are being
taken to deal with this problem and to develop alternative energy sources.
In the case of coal, there have been various obstacles to more adequate utili-
zation of the existing potential: low prices rompared with those prevailing
on international markets, the competition of low-priced petroleum, fragmen-
tation of production among a large number of very small mines with low output
and productivity levels, and lack of efficient marketing and transport infra-
structure. However, the Government is currently taking action to address
these problems, and large-scale development of coal reserves is planned.
With respect to natural gas, a previous decline in known reserves and output
has been dramatically reversed with the discovery of large deposits in the
Atlantic Coast region.  These reserves (estimated at over 5 x 10 12t ') will
provide energy and petrochemical feedstock to this rapidly industrializil,g
region.
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1965-75 (see table next page)
has not kept pace with overall economic expansion. It increased only 3.6%/a
during 1965-70 when it reached its peak at 690 x 1012 Btu, and declined since
then to 637 x 1012 Btu in 1977, mainly due to falling crude oil output. in
contrast to the declining energy output, final energy consumption has grown
by 8.9%/a during 1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic growth was
high and energy prices declined sharply in real terms. During 19/4-77, the
economic downturn and increase in real energy prices had a dampening effect
on consumption, which now has settled at a growth of about 4.5%/a compared
with a GDP growth of some 6%/a in recent years.

products, 1 MBtu/103ft3 for gas and its products and 28.69 MBtu/t for coal
and coke.
1.03      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use, by utilizing more
fully those energy sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
natural gas and coal. The Government is planning a large-scale development
of coal deposits by state entities in association with foreign investors. For
this purpose, a new enterprise, CARBOCOL, has recently been created and has
emerged as the Government's chief agency in coal-related matters. The Govern-
ment attaches high priority to developing the thermal coal deposits at El
Cerrejon (reserves 600 Mt and production target 10 Mt/a) near Riohacha in the
department of La Guajira on the Atlantic coast under CARBOCOL's responsibility



in cooperation with foreign investment.  The Government also intends to step
up surveys of identified coal fields in the departments of Santander and Antioquia
and to study the feasibility of using low grade coal for firing large thermal
plants required in the early nineties when potential hydro sites are expected
to be increasingly more costly to develop (1.25). Small private firms which
own coal mines are pursuing plans to expand output in order to supply fuel for
heat intensive industrial processes and in-plant power generation. In order
to expand potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government program is
needed to provide a more rational price structure, improvements in mine
safety, credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure.
Such a program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from
abroad and the Bank is providing guidance to the Government in the preparation
of a proposed coal engineering project.
1.04      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to stimu-
late investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after
1971 because of low prices applied to domestic sales which were below economic
value. The Government is encouraging foreign participation in exploration and
development on the basis of association contracts with ECOPETROL (the Government
oil agency). The prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from
existing fields and from new fields have been raised, the latter now being
close to world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petro-
leum has been eliminated. As a result, interest among foreign petroleum
companies to expand or start operations in Colombia has been intensified and
an upturn in exploration has taken place.
1.05      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has concluded an exploration contract with the French Minatome
group. The development of any uranium potential that might exist would provide
the country with another long-term energy option.
Sector Organization
1.06      Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy use in Colombia;
its share in overall energy consumption has grown from 14% in 1960 to 25% in
1977. This process has been assisted by the gradual consolidation of isolated
facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of these systems to
facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources. The main
systems are (see Map 3948) the Central System, covering the interior and the
Pacific coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) system covering the northern
part of the country. The proposed EEEB distribution project is located in
the Central System. Also located in the Central System are the Mesitas and
San Carlos I and II hydro projects for which Bank loans totalling US$282
were approved in 1978 and 1979 (Attachment 1.1). By 1982 a national grid
will have been established with the completion of a 500-kV line interconnect-
ing the Atlantic and the Central systems, for which a Bank loan of MUS$50
(1583-CO) was approved in 1978.
1.07      Public electricity services are presently provided by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, independent of the Central
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medelliti
(EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);



- 4 -
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), the Corporacion Autonoma Regional deL Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlanticsa
(CORELCA);
(c)  a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA Arid
CVC 1/; and
(d)  a generating and transmission company, Interconnexion Electrica
S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL
and CORELCA.
1.08       Colombia has a number of public entities knownl as Regional Autonomouis
Corporations with a range of functions related to development of the regions
under their jurisdiction, including legal capacity to generate, transmit and
distribute electricity. CVC is the largest of these entities. The tlinistry
of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly through ICEL and CORELCA.
EEEB and EPM, presently the largest utilities, are controlled by autonomous
municipal governments. CVC reports to the National PlanninTg Departmnenlt as
do some other regional development corporations. ISA was established in 1967
to provide a rational framework for sector development by interconnecting
the systems of its shareholders, thus creating a national grid capable of
sustaining large hydroelectric developments. By pooling their financial
resources through ISA, its shareholders have been able to undertake miuch
larger and more economical projects than would have been feasible tinder the
previous arrangements for independent growth.  ISA's shareholders, and their
holdings as of December 31, 1978, are:

Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.09       The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating a
national policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of electri-
city although it shares responsibility with the NPD in defining investment

priorities. The Ministry discharges its functions through its Electric
Energy Division and was also given the responsibility for coordinating and
supervising power sector planning. This division is small and does not have
the powers assigned to similar agencies in other countries (issuance of
licenses, regulation of tariffs, approval of expansion programs) to enforce
its policies and programs. Public utility retail tariffs (including those
for electricity) are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios
Publicos in the NPD, which has customarily approved requests for rate
increases. However, utilities are free to set tariffs at levels lower than
those approved by the JNT and have done so in the past. EEEB (as decided
by the Municipal Council) has been doing so during the past one and one half
years by not applying the allowed maximum monthly rate increases to consumers
using less than 300 kWh/m (5.05). Although the Government cannot enforce
its policies directly on the municipally controlled power companies, a
mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues affecting the sector is
provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major although not controlling
interest.
1.10      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly, as illus-
trated by the following:
(a) In line with its recently revised bylaws, ISA defines the
generation and transmission expansion program for the inter-
connected system. On the basis of studies carried out by it
and its shareholders, ISA executes simulation studies and
ranks plant in order of economic merit. After approval by its
Board and NPD, this becomes the national expansion program. As
specified in these bylaws, all plants requiring a joint effort
of all its shareholders are constructed, owned and operated by
ISA. Plants of regional interest may be built by one or several
shareholders, subject to ISA's approval of such regional plants.
Under these arrangements, ISA is, in effect, responsible for an
important part of sector regulation and planning; only a small
number of utilities which do not participate directly in ISA and
the national enterprises, other than CVC, are not covered by its
decisions. Voting arrangements in ISA have been restructured
to require the concurrence of Eour of its five major shareholders
in all important decisions, thus protecting the interests of the
municipal utilities and encouraging a positive participation in its
deliberations;
(b)  As part of the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its shareholders agreed
to prepare and present to the Government and the Bank for comments
by December 31, 1979, a Power Sector Development Master Plan. This
plan is to cover the period 1980-1990 in detail and 1991-2000 in
general terms and consolidate the programs for generation and
transmission expansion. Similarly, ISA's shareholders undertook,
under the coordination of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, to
prepare and present, as part of ISA's Master Plan, to the Government
and the Bank for comments by December 31, 1979, a 1980-2000 Sector
Development Master Plan for Distribution consolidating all existing



- 6 -
and future programs for distribution and covering the period
1980-1985 in detail. 1/ Overall, the Master Plan is expected to
provide a valuable framework for long-range decisions on sector-
financing, pricing and rural electrification which have in the past
been based on partial and uncoordinated information. With respect
to generation, the Master Plan will be based partly on an ongoing
sector study which is expected to be submitted to the Bank for
comments by early 1980, and for which assistance was obtained
from the Federal Republic of Germany. The first part of this
study, which has been completed, concentrated on sector institu-
tions and financing. The second part, which is being carried out
with assistance from ISA, will comprise a comprehensive survey of
the country's hydro resources;
(c) As agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based on
marginal costing is underway covering the most important supply
areas in the country. With Bank guidance, this study is being
carried out through a committee in which experts from the Government,
ISA and its shareholders participate; and
(d) Also under the aegis of San Carlos I, a study is being executed by
consultants to assess the extent and causes of losses in the main
power systems down to the level of distribution with the objective
of identifying and carrying out actions which would minimize such
losses.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.11      Since 1950, the Bank has made 22 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$682 million (Attachment 1.1). In addition, the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the integrated Rural Development
Project (1352-CO, 1977). A report of the Bank's Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) on the "Third Power Expansion Program Loan 537-CO" (Report
No. 536, June 29, 1977) concluded that the objectives of the 1968 (MUS$18)
loan to EEEB for expansion of its generating capacity (by 200 MW) and trans-
mission, subtransmission and distribution systems had been met, despite some
delays and a 12% cost overrun. A previous OED report, "Third Medellin Power
Project - Loan 369-CO" (Report No. 450, May 24, 1974) concluded that the
project had been very well executed despite considerable geological difficul-
ties; although EPM's tariff levels were adequate to generate sufficient funds,
1/   The completion of this study has been delayed.  No Government action has
been taken to coordinate the study and no information has reached the
Bank from ICEL and CVC as to study progress. CORELCA and EPM expect to
have their reports available for review by early 1980. EEEB will have
the study executed by the same consultants to be engaged under the
proposed loan and it would not be completed before mid 1980 (4.09).



-7-
anticipated revenues did not fully materialize because of power losses in the
distribution system, a problem which has since been rectified. The most
recent projects, evaluated by OED in a single audit, pertain to ISA (Power
Interconnection Project, Loan 575-CO and Chivor Hydroelectric Project, Loan
681-CO). The audit report concludes that the projects underwent engineering,
physical, financial and institutional difficulties. The estimation of oper-
ational and investment requirements for an institution so financially dependent
as ISA, without provisions for price contingencies in an inflationary environ-
ment led to severe financial difficulties. The shareholders had to redefine
their role in the sector and, in the process, execution of the projects was
delayed. The experience gained under these projects has had a considerable
impact on the shaping of Bank policy for further lending for San Carlos I.
Adequate provisions for price contingencies have been introduced; local
financing is being secured through long-term financial commitments of the
shareholders to ISA; improved financial planning was instituted by ISA and its
shareholders as well as continuous monitoring of their financial performance.
Overall bank operations in the sector have also been reviewed in two OED
reports 1/ which concluded that the Bank's financing had been successful in
assisting the power companies to develop hydroelectric plants at lower unit
cost than they otherwise would have been able to do. This permitted greater
urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable electricity supply to
industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the establishment of the central
interconnected system which facilitated further power sector development. In
addition, OED identified as important considerations for possible future loans
in the Colombian power sector: the need to give greater attention to power
distribution; the need for improvement of financial recording and financial
planning capabilities; and the need to give more attention to public utility
tariff structures.
1.12      The first OED recommendation (distribution) was addressed in
Loan 874-CO (EPM, 1973) which included expansion of electricity distribution
in low income areas. However, between 1973 and 1978 Bank objectives could not
be pursued through lending because of institutional difficulties. The
municipal utilities were reluctant to relinquish their independent role in
generation and also experienced severe financial constraints (because of the
Government's reluctance to press for rate increases under inflationary condi-
tions) which reduced the availability of funds to ISA. Decisions on system
expansion required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and the
Government; those negotiations were further complicated by the original
1/   "Operations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power " (Report No. Z-17, dated
March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation"
(Report No. Z-18, dated May 25, 1972).

shareholders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA.
Throughout these negotiations, the Bank continued to support the concept of
centralized planning, construction and operation of the national grid and
resisted proposals that would weaken ISA. Because of the time required by the
shareholders to arrive at decisions on these fundamental issues, Bank consider-
ation of San Carlos I, the 500-kV Interconnection and EEEB's Mesitas hydro-
electric project, all of them urgently needed to avoid power rationing in
Colombia, suffered considerable delays. A solution finally evolved after
extensive discussions between the Bank, the Government and the shareholders,
and the four loans made in 1978 and 1979 served as a vehicle for addressing
again the various OED recommendations.
1.13      The developments in the sector indicate the possibility that
through further lending, the Bank's objectives in the sector can be more
fully realized in the medium term. They are in general: coordinated
sector planning, efficient organization and operation, and sound financial
management; within the general scope of these objectives specific attention
in the short term should be given to: least-cost operations, rational
urban and rural distribution developments, improvement in financial record-
ing and financial planning capabilities and development of adequate tariff
structures and levels based on common concepts throughout the country.
Power Market and Supply
1.14      Sector.  Electricity generation in Colombia increased by an average
of 9.5%/a over the period 1960-70 and then slowed to about 9% on average until
the end of 1977 1/ due to the slackening in industrial growth after 1974
(industrial consumption decreased to 7.2%/a compared with 9.5%/a during the
sixties). Present annual per capita electricity generation is estimated at
about 610 kWh, which is below the average for Latin America. Installed
capacity at the end of 1977 was 3,765 MW, including self-production. Hydro
stations accounted for 68% of total energy generation.
1.15      Colombia has about 2.2 million electricity subscribers with an
average of 7 beneficiaries per subscriber in an estimated total population of
25.2 million; 88% of these subscribers are residential, and electricity
service reaches 62% of the population. Studies by the Bank's Development
Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been able to provide electricity
service to a very high proportion of its urban population (with the connection
rate exceeding 90% in the larger cities). However, only 36% of the families
in small towns (500-2,500 inhabitants) and 16% of other rural families had
service in 1976. Of the electrified municipalities, about 90% have continuous
service, while the remaining have service only during certain hours of the
day. In many towns the quality of the service is unsatisfactory because of
lack of maintenance.
1.16      Residential consumers were responsible for the largest share of
electricity sales by the major utilities in 1977, followed by industry:

1.17      Public utilities accounted for 93% of total electricity supply; the
rest was provided by self-production. EEEB generated 24%, EPM 22%, CORELCA
14%, CVC and ICEL 13% each, and ISA 7% of total supply. Self-suppliers
(mainly oil refineries, petro-chemical plants, steel mills and cement works)
owned 5.7% of the country's installed capacity; these plants are also connected
to the public electricity service. The public-service labor force totalled
13,445 at the end of 1977, including 6,690 manual workers; this gives ratios
of 262 kW/employee and 162 subscribers/employee, which compare favorably with
the average for Latin America. The following table summarizes (Attachment 1.2)

During 1972-1977 gross production of electricity increased at an annual average
rate (adjusted for about 10% rationing due to hydrological conditions in
1976-77) of about 9.6% compared with a GNP growth rate of 6%. Growth of sales,
which averaged 9.5%/a, varied from 7.2%/a for the EPM system to 11% for EEEB's
system. Apart from an upward trend in the share of residential consumption,
the pattern of supply and demand has not changed materially: the share of each
system in the market has hardly varied. Commerce and industry together had Lhe
same share in 1977 as in 1972. The main change is the increase of the share of
residential consumption by 3 percentage points while "Others" declined by
3 percentage points. EEEB's historical growth is shown in paragraph 3.03.

interconnected system, an additional 4,766 MW is planned to be added by 1985
to the existing 1977 capacity of 3,552 MW. Details of the generation expansion
program are shown in Attachment 1.3. The 1977-1985 balances for energy and
capacity for the sector are summarized below:

Because of the large percentage of hydro capacity in the system, total
effective capacity could be reduced by as much as 20% during dry years.
Because of delays in plant construction, this could result in load shedding
during times of peak demand up to 1983, should the years be extremely dry.
Rural Electrification
1.22      About 36% of the population lives in areas classified as rural.
Although most of the rural villages with electricity service are close to the
urban centers, connection density is modest (1.15). It is estimated that the
present cost of a rural electrification network, for the country as a whole,
would be about US$800 per household; assuming that, over a period of six
years, electricity could be brought to about 20% of the rural population
presently without service (about 40,000 dwellings a year), the cost would be



- 12 -
some MUS$200. The lack of comprehensive data with respect to ongoing and
expected rural electrification efforts is expected to be remedied through
preparation of the Master Plan (1.10).
1.23      Rural electrification programs are currently underway in a number of
regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a)  the electrification subproject of the 1977-79 Integrated Rural
Development Program supported by IDB, Canadian International
Development Agency and Bank financing (Loan 1352-CO);
(b)  the electrification program in the department of Choco financed
by the Netherlands Government; and
(c)  the electrification program in the coffee-growing areas,
financed by coffee sector resources.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.24      The total 1978-1985 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
(except for ICEL's subsidiaries for which reliable information is not available),
excluding interest during construction, amounts to about Col$340 billion in
current prices (about US$4.2 billion in mid-1979 prices), with a foreign compon-
ent of about 60%. Of the total, 65% pertains to ISA, 1/ 16% to EEEB, 9% to
CORELCA, 7% to EPM and 3% to CVC. Taking into account that the shareholders'
portion of the program also includes considerable investments in generation and
transmission, some 70-75% of total investments would pertain to generation,
which is extremely high (a range of some 40-60% would be the norm).  Because
the new generating capacity would be of little use without a network path to
the consumers, upward adjustments in investments for subtransmission and
distribution can be expected and it is therefore probable that the estimated
cost of Col$340 billion is understated. The master plan for power develop-
ment to be prepared by ISA and its shareholders (1.10) is expected to provide
a basis for firmer total investment estimates. ISA is now regularly updating
its study of economic ranking of projects which indicates that the 1984-88
portion of this program, on which decisions still have to be taken (the program
up to 1984 is being executed), would be the least-cost alternative for system
expansion.
1/   EEEB has informed the Bank that it requested ISA's Board to allow the
entity to construct the Guavio hydro plant (first phase 1,000 MW).
ICEL similarly has requested to construct Betania (500 MW). In view
of the important sector policy issues involved, the Bank has communicated
to the Government its concern that decisions on ownership, construction
responsibilities, and operational responsibilities in the interconnected
system be taken in the national interest. This matter is currently
under discussion between the Bank and the government.



- 13 -
1.25      The introduction of large thermal plant later in the century is ex-
pected to play an important role in ISA's planning for the sector in the next
few years (lead time for mine development and power station construction may
aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of some 100 GW (1.01)
would be completely utilized by about year 2020 and the use of the country's
large coal reserves for firing of thermal plant may become more economic than
hydro well before that time. The Government is aware of this problem 1/ and
the Bank (through preparation of proposed coal development) together with the
Government agencies involved, is addressing it. It is expected that the
Government, without abandoning the-objective of appraising all of the country's
potential coal fields will focus on surveying and studying two areas: Tasajero
in North Santander and Bolombolo in Antioquia. The use of coal for thermal
plant firing and the substitution of coal for oil would be the primary objec-
tives. It is anticipated that preliminary surveys and project preparation
for a full study will warrant financial assistance in about a year.
1.26      The generation investment program will impose a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances have been obtained under the San Carlos loans that ISA
and its shareholders would not undertake construction of any generating plant
or combination of plants of more than 200 MW (ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders)
capacity prior to completion of San Carlos unless satisfactory evidence has
been presented to the Bank that it is economically justified and that adequate
financing is available to carry it out without jeopardizing the project.
Finances and Tariffs
1.27      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost systems
and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have, therefore, been
able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance of borrowings
and cash generation while charging relatively low rates. Because there has been
no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the sector from the more
affluent areas to the less affluent, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA, which operate high-
cost systems in lower income areas than EEEB and EPM, have had to rely on
budgetary contributions from the Government and subsidies. In recent years,
however, the opportunity of sharing in relatively low-cost investments through
ISA has provided an indirect transfer mechanism.

/1   On the basis of the consumer price index.
The positive trend in rate setting which began in 1977 is expected to continue
as a result of the agreements reached under the Mesitas and San Carlos I and
II loans. In view of the importance to economic growth of adequate electricity
service, the Government has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in
order to ensure that the sector generates internally a reasonable portion of
the funds required.
1.29      In view of the considerable imbalances that exist in the structure of
tariffs and rates in the power sector (5.05) the Government and ISA's shareholders
are executing under San Carlos I (Loan 1582-CO) a country-wide tariff study with
a view toward assessing the cost of supply to each consumer category. EEEB had
agreed under the Mesitas Loan to prepare a program by October 1, 1979, and to
introduce gradually revised tariff structures and rates in accordance with the
above objective (with the exception that the revised tariff structure would take
into account the government's social welfare policies with respect to the lowest-
income consumers) and the tariff study findings, between April 1980 and June 1982.
Since the country-wide tariff study, orginally scheduled for completion in
December 1978, is delayed (ISA has recently requested a second postponement,
for the completion of the study to June 30, 1980, and for receLpt in the Bank of
the Government comments thereon, to September 30, 1980) the date for EEEB's
preparing a program satisfactory to the Bank would also be delayed. The
program, is to be prepared by April 30, 1980 and put into effect June 30,
1980. In the event that EEEB would be unable to meet the agreed schedule
because of the delays related to the country-wide tariff study, an interim
program of adjustments satisfactory to the Bank will be implemented by EEEB
beginning June 30, 1980. The delay in completing the countrywide tariff study
is due to the fact that the execution of the study has been divided among
numerous entities and some have been unable to meet the previously-agreed
deadlines. EEEB interim program will further the abovementioned objective,
bringing the average residential tariff to parity with the average industrial
tariff over a period ending no later than October 1, 1982. However, at such



- 15 -
time as the above tariff study should become available, the interim program
will be superseded by one conforming to the requirements and objectives set
forth in Section 5.09 and related supplementary letter of the Loan Agreement.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.30      In the past, the large number of entities associated with the power
sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning at the
national level and low electricity rates constrained the sector's ability to
make rational use of Colombia's abundant hydroelectric resources.  The
regionalized nature of the sector, reflecting the political and economic
decentralization of Colombia, precluded technical cooperation and engendered
difficulties in coordinating investment allocation; decisions were made on a
local basis without due regard to overall country planning for power develop-
ment. This situation, together with the lack of funds, resulted in recurring
power shortages, a problem that will not be solved before well into the early
eighties, and then only if the agreed development program is implemented
expeditiously (the latter in turn, being largely dependent on adequate rate
setting). To date, the sector's organization has precluded the usual practice
of diverting resources within the sector from well-developed urban markets to
support service in rural areas (1.27), except indirectly by investments of
the shareholders in ISA's generating and transmission plant, which may provide
supply to these areas.
1.31      The Government has recently taken a number of positive measures to
address the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975, it eliminated the
jurisdictional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast by
transferring control over the electricity distribution companies in that
region to CORELCA. Another positive measure was the reorientation of ICEL,
which, in the future will be responsible basically for electricity development
in rural and semi-rural areas, where the Government will continue to subsidize
the service since ICEL cannot be financially self-supporting in those areas.
In order to remedy the problems that exist between the generating and distri-
buting companies in the Cauca Valley, as a consequence of the complex organi-
zation of electricity service in that region, the Government has supported the
establishment of a regional power company whose basic function would be to
consolidate that region's electricity sector in a single enterprise. With the
addition of CORELCA as an ISA shareholder, most of the sector is represented
directly or indirectly in ISA's Board and coordination of power sector
planning in Colombia has improved. ISA's effectiveness in maintaining this
coordination, however, will depend on its ability to sustain the consensus
developed over the past two years among its shareholders.

2. THE BORROWER
General Description
2.01      The proposed borrower, Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB),
is an autonomous company owned by the Municipality of the Special District of
Bogota. It was established by private Colombian interests and has operated
the city's electric service for the past 79 years, since 1951 under municipal
ownership. It has an installed capacity of 719 MW, 582 MW of which is hydro and
the balance coal-fired thermal. It served about 500,000 subscribers at the
beginning of 1979.
Prior Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made four loans totalling MUS$169.6 to EEEB: 246-CO in
January 1960, 313-CO in May 1962, 537-CO in June 1968, and 1628-CO approved
by the Board in November 1978 and signed in April 1979. The first two loans
helped finance hydro and thermal generating plant additions of 304 MW, includ-
ing the Sesquile Dam for the Guatavita Reservoir, and transmission line and
distribution system extensions. The third loan, helped finance the completion
of the El Colegio hydroelectric plant of three 50-MW units and associated sub-
stations, construction of the Canoas hydroelectric plant of one 50-MW unit,
another expansion of the transmission and distribution systems, and engineer-
ing services (see 1.11 for OED's conclusions on this loan). The fourth loan
MUS$84.0 is helping finance part of the 1978-82 national power expansion
program including: (a) construction of the Mesitas hydroelectric facility
consisting of two surface powerhouses, each with three generating units
totalling 600 MW, and tunnels and penstocks, as well as a pumpting station
for an existing head pond, and three 230-kV transmission lines; (b) strengthen-
ing of the Sesquile dam against possible future earthquake damage; (c) an asset
valuation study; and (d) technical assistance to EEEB on financial planning
and staff training. Works financed by the first three loans were completed
successfully although with delays (of about one year and a half for the first
two, and three years for the third) because of a variety of problems. The
disbursements of the fourth loan began last September.
Organization and Administration
2.03      EEEB is directed and administered by a seven-member Board of Directors
and a General Manager appointed by the Board. The Board of Directors is headed
by the Mayor of Bogota, and consists, in addition, of two members elected by
the Municipal Council, three members chosen by the Council from lists submitted
by associations representative of banks, commerce, and industry in Bogota, and
one member chosen by the President of Colombia. This composition was worked
out in connection with the Bank's initial loan to EEEB (246-CO) and has gen-
erally proven to be satisfactory.



- 20 -
2.04      EEEB's management is entrusted to a General Manager assisted by four
Deputy Managers, respectively responsible for (a) Administration; (b) Commercial
and Financial; (c) Technical; and (d) Operations. There is also a Planning
Division which provides support to the General Manager. The current organiza-
tion chart is shown in Annex 2. Although EEEB has had a history of stable and
competent management during most of its association with the Bank, turnover
in its senior personnel increased during the past three years resulting in a
significant reduction in the number of experienced senior officers. The new
financial manager and main financial staff appear to be competent and an
important first step for strengthening of financial management has been taken
in January 1979, when EEEB hired Peat, Marwick, Mitchel and Co., Management
Consultants, to carry out a study on managerial, budgetary and accounting
systems and financial planning. Under the Mesitas loan EEEB undertook to
enhance the effectiveness of its then-financial management by employing a
senior financial adviser, with qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment satisfactory to the Bank, who could aLso carry out
periodic training program for key members of its financial staff; however
the entity proposed, and the Bank agreed, that certain additions to its regular
staff, together with the aforementioned consultants, would be acceptable in lieu
of the appointment of a senior financial advisor. Therefore, EEEB will employ by
June 30, 1980 at least 2 senior financial staff whose qualifications should be
acceptable to the Bank and will carry out periodic training programs for its
financial staff.
Employment
2.05      EEEB had 2,254 employees at the beginning of 1979, including a tech-
nical staff of 152, an administrative staff of 608, and operations personnel
of 1,348 and 146 construction personnel. The history of the company's staff
growth over the past eleven years in relation to the number of customers served
and energy sold shows a continued trend of improved efficiency:
Number of      Number of Customer        Total Sales, MWh /1
Employees          per Employee            per Employee
1968          1,422                  174                    1,021
1971          1,520                  198                    1,317
1974          1,896                  213                    1,359
1977          2,234                  216                    1,587
1978           2,278                 220                    1,603
/_   Includes bulk sales to other utilities.
The number of EEEB's employees is projected to grow at an average of about
6.0% per year. The trends of improving ratios of the numbers of customers to
employees and of the annual sales of MWh per employee are also expected to
continue (Annex 1).

Accounting and Auditing
2.06      EEEB's data processing and accounting are satisfactory.  Internal
auditing is carried out by a separate department under a General Auditor
responsible to the Board of Directors and appointed by the Mayor of Bogota.
Independent auditing of EEEB was carried out by an external auditor acceptable
to the Bank until 1977, at which time the function was taken over by the
"Contraloria del Distrito Especial de Bogota," an auditing organization which
belongs to the Municipal Government of Bogota. Although the auditors appear
to perform their duties as a private auditing firm and the qualifications and
competence of the staff and the auditing standards used seem to be adequate,
the audit report is signed by the Controller, who is the head of the organiza-
tion and usually a political appointee of the incumbent Government administra-
tion, as are the General Manager of EEEB as well as most of the Board. In
order to insure audits in accordance with sound banking principles, EEEB has
agreed to appoint an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank (in place or in
addition to the Contraloria), based on the need to obtain a greater degree of
organizational independence between auditor and auditee. EEEB has informed
the Bank in detail the bidding process underway to select and appoint its
external auditors, who will audit the fiscal year 1979.
Billing and Collections
2.07      Billing is carried out by a computerized processing system and mailed
in bimonthly cycles to all customers. Payment must be made in cash at various
company offices and banks located throughout the city. As of December 31, 1978,
accounts receivable was 19% (about 70 days billing) of total annual sales, which
was an improvement over the performance in recent years; EEEB is expected to
reach 17% by 1981, as agreed under Mesitas. The relevant covenant will be
repeated for the proposed loan.
Insurance
2.08      EEEB's assets are not adequately insured and EEEB's new management
has questioned the appropriateness of the current amounts and forms of coverage.
For this reason EEEB submited to the Bank a detailed proposal for carrying
out a study of its insurance requirements, form of insurance and staffing
for the purpose. To this end, EEEB will engage the services of an expert or
specialized consultants by not later than June 30, 1980, under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, to carry out a study, to be financed by the
loan, by February 28, 1981. EEEB's observations and recommendations for
implementation will be sent to the Bank for review and comment by April 30,
1981. An agreed program will be implemented as of December 31, 1981.

3. EEEB's M4ARKET
3.01      EEEB's service area includes the District of Bogota, the capital
of Colombia, and also extends to more than 55 municipalities within the
department of Cundinamarca in the Central Zone. EEEB's estimate of the popula-
tion in the service area is five million people, about 20% of the total
population of Colombia; the service area accounted for about 28% of national
gross electric energy requirements in 1977.
Historic
3.02      EEEB 1973-1978 consumption and supply data are shown in Attach-
ment 3.1, excluding supplies to other utilities to which it transfers from the
Interconnected System (ISA) to such utilities at no charge. Summarized, its
consumer data in 1973 and 1978 were the following:

Residential consumers increased their share in the market substantially,
together with commercial consumers which advanced marginally, while industry
and government consumption decreased commensurately. Residential and commer-
cial consumers also showed the largest annual growth rate, which may be
due, at least in part to the low average rates for these consumers (5.05).
Losses, including station use (the latter is largely pumping for storage and
head pond which are about 10% of total losses) are relatively high and may
contain a substantial amount of thefts. This problem is presently being
studied (1.10) throughout the sector and remedial action is expected to be
instituted as a result of the study. Gross per capita consumption in 1978 in
Bogota was in the order of 850 kWh/a.

Forecast
3.03      EEEB's sales are expected to grow at an average of 11.0%/a, (Attachment
3.2). This forecast was prepared essentially on the basis of historical trends
and recorded consumption indices from the period 1968 to 1978. Consumers were
divided into four main categories, residential, commercial, industrial and
Government and these categories were further subdivided according to monthly
and annual consumption patterns. Trend curves were derived to project require-
ments by categories for the period 1979 to 1985 which were subsequently
adjusted to reflect population trends, sector economic conditions and market
saturation effects. Comparing the 1982 and 1985 forecasts with the 1978
figures (3.02), the following table summarizes the results.
1978             1982             1985          Annual Growth

7i   % of total requirements.
3.04      Residential and commercial consumers are expected to continue increas-
ing their share of the market at a relatively high growth rate. Growth in
sales to Government (which include public lighting) would accelerate primarily
due to improvements and expansion of public lighting, financing of which has
been included in the project for 1980-1982. The number of consumers is
expected to increase by about 8.5% due to the accelerated expansion of the
distribution networks. Total energy requirements would grow less than sales in
view of the expected lower losses due to the actions to be taken against
thefts (1.10). The load factor is expected to remain about 60% during the
period, resulting in a growth of maximum demand commensurate with the growth
of energy requirements.

Integration of Electrificadora de Cundinamarca
3.05      Electrificadora de Cundinamarca is a minor electric company that
belongs to the ICEL group and serves the market of Cundinamarca department
in Bogota's surroundings. It might be possible over the long-term to achieve
certain economies of operation through a merger or another form of joint
operation of the EEEB and Electrificadora de Cundinamarca systems. Because
the agreement and cooperation of ICEL, as well as EEEB, would be required
in order to carry out a study to identify such economies, the Bank intends
to pursue this matter under the next proposed operation that would involve
these companies as shareholders of ISA.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01      By 1985 EEEB's system should have been expanded to serve about
910,000 customers, a peak demand of 1,600 MW and a total energy demand of
about 8,400 GWh (Attachment 3.2). The ongoing national generation develop-
ment program, including Mesitas (1.21) would assure the supply. In addition
EEEB must expand its transmission -and distribution systems to serve its
growing market and rehabilitate the older sections of the distribution system
to improve quality of service. The principal objectives of the 1979-1985
"sixth" transmission and distribution program (Attachment 4.1) are:
(a) Expansion of the existing transmission and distribution system
through two sub-programs, 1979-1982 and 1983-1985, to meet projected
energy demands of existing and new customers throughout the period.
(b) Improvement of the level of street lighting in the service area.
(c) Modernization and improvement of the existing distribution system
and ancillary facilities to improve the quality of service.
4.02      EEEB's Program.  EEEB's 1979-1985 investments include:  (i) the
"fifth" program comprising Mesitas, Sesquile dam reinforcement, a dispatch
center, a maintenance facility, a data processing unit, a new administration
building, the Santa Ana Power Plant and La Muna Dam; and (ii) the "sixth"
program, comprising ongoing distribution works, the proposed distribution
project, future distribution (1983-1985) and rural distribution (1980-1985).
The detailed investment costs, in current prices, of the 1979-1985 program
are shown in Attachment 4.1 and are summarized below:

Total              24,197           24,104           48,301
The above estimate was prepared by EEEB on the basis of prices prevailing in
mid-1979 and includes 10% physical contingencies and appropriate price contin-
gencies (4.07). Generation costs consist principally of the Mesitas hydro project
(Loan 1628-CO). Distribution costs are based on similar work now in progress.
The cost estimates are reasonable. The investment program is well balanced to
serve adequately the projected loads to 1985.

The Project
4.03      General.  The project proposed for Bank financing consists of the
1980-82 part of the 1979-85 development program for urban subtransmission and
distribution, excluding ongoing works. The transmission lines and substations
component of the project would allow EEEB to transmit the energy to be gene-
rated by existing and future plants, as well as energy purchased from ISA, to
the service areas to meet the projected load growth. The project was designed
to meet EEEB's requirements for 1980-1982. Reasonable design alternatives are
limited because the project consists of improvements in, and expansion to, the
existing system. Least cost solutions were investigated and applied for the
main components such as extension of existing substations compared with new
substations, routing of transmission lines, location and dimensioning of
secondary feeders, transformers and capacitors (6.01). The distribution
expansion would improve quality and reliability of service to residential,
commercial, industrial and low-income urban customers. Operation and design
practices would be improved during the course of the project as a result of
implementing recommendations to be made by consultants to be financed by the
loan (4.05). The addition of capacitors and voltage regulators would reduce
losses and improve service. Targets are to improve the power factor from 0.84
to 0.90, to increase the distribution transformer utilization factor from 47%
and 56% and to reduce distribution transformer failures from 3% to 2% by 1982
through improved protection and maintenance. The project includes procurement
of 331 utility vehicles which are necessary for construction, operation and
maintenance of the EEEB system. EEEB now has a total of 410 vehicles of which
352 will be over 7 years old by 1982. Vehicle maintenance is very good, proven
by the fact that EEEB is operating 98 vehicles which are between 15 and 20 years
old, well beyond their economic life of 7 to 10 years. However, the distribution
system to be renovated under the project would not be adequately maintained un-
less EEEB has available a sufficient number of vehicles to cover the entire system
as the project is system-wide (Map 14375). Considering the size of the utility,
serving an area exceeding 5 million people, EEEB's fleet requires urgent renova-
tion and expansion. Financing under the proposed loan would enable EEEB to
procure the necessary vehicles through international competitive bidding and
thus realize substantial savings. It is estimated that some 253 vehicles will
have to be replaced in the coming 3 years, and that an additional 78 vehicles
will be required to accommodate the 6% annual growth in number of employees
during the period.
4.04      Description.  The project to be initiated by January 1, 1980, and
completed by December 31, 1982, consists of the following:
(a) Subtransmission: installation of 450 MlVA of substation
capacity at 230 kV, 390 MVA at 115 kV and 42 km of lines
at 115 kV.
(b) Distribution: (i) line extensions and improvements at 11.4 kV
or 13.2 kV, and 34.5 kV aggregating about 1330 circuit km;
(ii) installation of about 630 km and improvements to about
1150 km of lines at 120/208 V; (iii) installation of about



- 29 -
250 MVA of distribution transformer capacity at 120/208 V and
66 MVA at 480 V; (iv) installation of about 3 MVA of voltage
regulators and 200 MVAr of capacitors; (v) installation of about
48,000 meters and (vi) installation of about 33,000 street lights.
(c) Acquisition of about 331 utility vehicles, maintenance equipment
and 300 mobile radios for operation and maintenance of the system.
(d) Consulting engineering services for distribution planning (46 m.m),
dispatch control center -(46 m.m)., insurance requirements (7 m.m),
and training (10 m.m).
4.05      Design.  A study of the existing EEEB distribution system was
completed by J.G. White, a U.S. consulting firm, in October 1975. This study
evaluated past design practices and recommended improved basic design criteria
for future expansion and rehabilitation of the overhead and underground distri-
bution system including primary and secondary circuits, transformers, system
loading and protective devices. EEEB, incorporating the consultant's recommen-
dations, presented to the Bank in August 1977 a transmission and distribution
expansion program for 1978 through 1982. This program was revised in accordance
with the Bank's comments during 1978 and served as a basis for the recommended
1980-82 project for Bank funding. The project includes the services of consul-
tants (4.09) to improve EEEB's distribution planning and design practices (6.01);
these services are scheduled to commence by March 1980 so that the preliminary
report will be available prior to contract award for distribution substations
and transformers except that the first group of transformers will be specified
for dual primary voltage as is present practice. The system is designed for
future operation at 13.2 kV but now operates at 11.4 kV and the study is
necessary to determine if the conversion should be made or not.
4.06      Engineering.  EEEB's practice is to use local engineering firms to
assist its staff as needed for detailed design, procurement, and supervision of
construction; this practice would also be followed for the project. Most of
the construction would be performed by local contractors, including 230-kV and
115-kV substations, 115-kV lines and primary distribution circuits. EEEB,
like most utilities in Colombia, does not maintain a staff to implement and
supervise large construction projects. The practices of utilizing local
engineering and construction firms has proven successful in the past and no
major problems are expected in using this method of project implementation.

The base cost estimates were prepared by EEEB using mid-1979 price levels.
EEEB has ongoing work which is very similar to the Project and, therefore, cost
estimates for the most part are based upon actual construction work in progress.
These costs are considered realistic. Engineering and administrative costs
are based upon past experience with this type of Project using similar imple-
mentation procedures and are estimated at 8% of total equipment cost. An
8% physical contingency is included for foreign costs and 10% for local costs
which includes installation and erection. Total engineering consultants costs
are estimated at US$1,200,000. The joint venture contracts (between one local
and one foreign firm) provides for 109 man-months of consultants' services, and
the cost of vehicles, test equipment, local transportation, local engineers and
technicians and some other minor items. The average man-month cost (including
salary, fees, international travel and subsistence) is US$8,100; the average
local man-month cost is US$4,500 (53 man-months) and the average foreign
man-month cost is US$11,500 (56 man-months). The foreign personnel input
comprises senior level expertise in the appropriate fields of engineering.
The estimated base cost is in prices calculated for mid-1979, to which a price
contingency has been added as follow: local cost was assumed to decrease from
26% in 1979 to 15% in 1982, remaining constant thereafter; foreign equipment
and civil works 10% in 1979, 9% in 1980, 8% in 1981 and 7% thereafter. The
average exchange rate (Col$42.06 per US$ in 1979) was assumed to increase to
Col$74.46 by 1985.

Financing
4.08       A Bank loan of MUS$87 is proposed, representing 100% of the foreign
exchange component as follows or 48% of total cost:
MUS$
Subtransmission                            24.1
Distribution                               54.2
Other equipment                             7-2
Consultants, studies, training              1.5
Total                                87.0
Local cost would be financed by EEEB.
4.09      Consulting Services and Training.  The proposed project includes the
services of consultants, will be engaged by EEEB under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, to assist EEEB with respect to: (a) distribution
planning, (b) a distribution control center study (c) insurance; and (d)
training (4.04(d)).
(a)  Distribution Study:  EEEB's present distribution planning and
design procedures should be improved so that they are in accord
with economic utility practices (6.01). The consultants will render
advice and recommendations to EEEB concerning technical and economic
aspects of project design and future system expansion including the
master plan terminating in the year 2000. The terms of reference
and conditions for this study have been approved by the Bank and
proposals have been evaluated. The consultants will be engaged
to complete the assignment not later than September 30, 1980.
(b)  Dispatch Center Study:  EEEB is considering the construction of an
energy control center and has included such a project in the
1980-1985 Capital Investment Program. A study is needed for economic
project justification, preliminary design and a cost estimate. The
terms of reference are being prepared by EEEB for Bank approval and
the consultants will be engaged not later than July 31, 1980.
The study, which will be completed by June 30, 1981 will be
submitted to the Bank by August 31, 1981, together with EEEB's
proposals for implementation, for review and comments.
(c)  Insurance Study:  EEEB has no appropriate insurance policy nor
any specialized department in its administrative organization
to deal with insurance matters; the proposed loan will finance
the services of an expert or specialized consultants (2.08).
(d)  Training.  About 25 of EEEB's supervisory level distribution tech-
nicians will receive special training in the operation and
maintenance of the distribution system. Particular attention will
be given to safety regulations and use of new equipment such as
capacitors not previously used in EEEB distribution system. The
distribution planning consultants will make recommendations for



- 32 -
executing the training program within 2 months after their assign-
ment and either the same consultants will be engaged by EEEB within
3 months thereafter, or a specialized training consultant by the
same date, for training of staff. Training will be completed
by August 31, 1981. The cost is expected to be about MUS$0.2.
4.10      Implementation Schedule.  The Project implementation schedule
envisages completion by December 31, 1982, which is reasonable. The key dates
as shown in Attachment 4.3 would be used to monitor progress during project
implementation.
4.11      Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed by
the proposed loan, except for consulting services and training, will be
through international competitive bidding (ICB) under Bank guidelines for
procurement. Colombian manufacturers will receive a margin of preference of
15% or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower for purposes of bid
evaluation. It is expected that local manufacturers and contractors might be
the successful bidders on up to 10% at the equipment. EEEB will procure 125 MVA
of distribution transformers (representing less than 1% of project cost) from
local manufacturing through local competitive bidding and will finance these
items from internal sources. Such procurement is necessary for timely project
execution.
4.12      Disbursements.  Funds from the proposed loan will finance.  (a) 100%
of foreign expenditures for imported equipment; (b) 94% of the ex-factory cost
of locally manufactured equipment and materials, and (c) the foreign expendi-
tures and 50% of total for consultant's services and training expenditures.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is based on the formulated procurement
program which envisions final material delivery in the second half of 1982
and completion of the works by December 31, 1982. The closing date should be
December 31, 1983 to allow for payment of retention monies and unforeseen
delays. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Attachment 4.4.
4.13       Retroactive Financing.  Retroactive financing up to US$500,000 is
proposed for payments made for consulting services for the Distribution Study
after January 1, 1980 (4.09).
4.14      Environment.  EEEB has carried out previous projects with due regard
to environmental protection. Under the proposed project, all high voltage
line structures will be of a design consistent with minimal effect on land
usage. Line routes have been selected to follow existing right-of-ways
adjacent to rail lines, highways and roads so that clearing of land will be
kept to a minimum. Distribution system construction and rehabilitation will
be executed with due regard to safety and reduction of adverse visual impact.
4.15      Project Risks.  The procurement and construction schedule assumed
for the project is reasonable and takes into consideration normal engineering,
administrative and construction procedures; no unusual delays are anticipated.
Timely completion of the project by EEEB will depend to a large extent upon
appropriate use of local consultants for assistance on detailed design and
procurement activities and upon the ability of local construction firms to
maintain schedules (4.06).

5. FINANCE
Summary
5.01      EEEB has maintained a satisfactory financial position through an
almost 20-year relationship with the Bank. The extra-fiscal measures that
have been taken under the existing agreements with the Bank, including reval-
uation of assets, for monitoring financial performance, have considerably
strengthened EEEB's financial structure. EEEB investments for the period
1979-1982 are forecast at MCol$47,079, of which MCol$9,133 or 19% correspond
to the proposed distribution expansion project. The net internal cash
generation will finance MCol$17,845 or 38% of total requirements and the
remaining 62%, MCol$29,234, is to be covered by loans; the proposed loan
amounts to MCol$4,328. The present financial projections are based on EEEB's
plan of tariff increases and on external and domestic inflation assumptions
(4.07). The net operating income with the above plan is expected to produce
annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 10.5% in 1979 to
15.4% in 1982 and the company is expected to maintain an adequate financial
position throughout the projection period.
Earnings History
5.02      EEEB has a history of satisfactory financial performance.  Its
internal cash generation during the last twelve years has been sufficient to
provide more than 50% of its average annual investment needs, including sub-
stantial recent contributions to ISA. This may be attributed in large part to
the high density of its market and low-cost facilities, given the area's
geographic advantages for hydro generation. The balance of the company's
investment funds has been obtained through borrowings, generally at reasonable
costs; no government funding has been required.
5.03      Over the period 1970-1976, EEEB's average tariff declined in real
terms to a level of USU1.2/kWh in 1976. It increased rapidly in 1977 and 1978
to approximately 1.5 and 2.1 US4/kWh respectively under a program of fixed
monthly increases which is expected to result in an average of USd3.5/kWh in
1980. However, the rate of return achieved in 1978, 6.6%, was lower than the
7.8% expected for this year because sales and other operating revenues were
less than expected. At the end of 1978, EEEB's debt/equity ratio was 34/66,
calculated on the basis of revalued assets, and the debt service coverage
ratio was 1.6. The company's cash and working capital have been adequate in
recent years; the current ratio has exceeded 1.5 since 1974 and reached 2.0 in
1978. Although accounts receivable as a percentage of annual sales had grown
to 27% by the end of 1976, they decreased to 19% in 1978, which is below the
20% agreed for that year under the Mesitas loan.
Rate Base
5.04      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's public utility regulatory
law does not allow full revaluation of fixed assets but only revaluation to
match the revaluation of outstanding foreign debt for changes in exchange
rates. To reflect the international and domestic inflation and awaiting a



- 38 -
more satisfactory valuation of fixed assets, an agreed fixed value of EEEB's
assets and accumulated depreciation was assumed as of December 31, 1976 for
the Bank's purposes of monitoring the financial performance of the company.
Starting from this date EEEB revalues its assets quarterly by the Colombian
cost of living index for purpose of monitoring its performance with respect to
rate of return. Under the Mesitas project EEEB agreed to commission a consul-
tant's study by April 30, 1979 to establish the value ot its assets. The
study would be completed and made available to the Bank by March 31, 1980 for
discussion with the Bank on the advisability of revising the gross and net value
of assets, the valuation methodology and the rate of return req;uirement. It
took longer than expected to reach agreement on the terms of reference and be-
cause there is no urgency attached to revising the asset value, the Bank has
extended the above dates as follows: engagement of consultants by April 30,
1980, and study completion by March 31, 1981.
Tariff Structure
5.05      Although EEEB's average rate has improved significantly and is
expected to continue to improve (5.03, 5.11), its tariff structure lacks
appropriate balance among various major components (1.29). The spread between
average residential and average industrial/commercial charges is widening
because in September 1977 Bogota's municipal authorities exempted residential
consumers of 300 kWh/m and less from the monthly rate increases. By the end of
1978 residential consumers up to 300 kWh/m paid an average of USJ.95/kWh and
residential consumers of 301-400 kW/m paid an average of USi1.04/kWh, compared
with an average of USJ1.57/kWh for a residential consumer of 401-500 kWh/m and
USi2.86/kWh for a medium type industrial consumer (25,000 kWh/m).
5.06      Under the Mesitas loan EEEB agreed to prepare by October 1, 1979,
a program satisfactory to the Bank to revise the structure of its tariffs
and rates, and to implement the program by April 30, 1980.  Because the
completion of the country-wide tariff is delayed, this agreement would be
modified to take into account this circumstance and the possibility that
the tariff study would be further delayed, which would require an interim
program of adjustments (1.29).
Financial Structure
5.07      As a result of the extra-fiscal measures that have been taken under
the San Carlos and Mesitas loans, including revaluation of assets for monitor-
ing financial performance, EEEB's financial structure has been strengthened.
As of December 31, 1978, EEEB's capitalization was:

Total                                21,051               100
5.08      EEEB's principal creditor is the Bank; in 1978 debt under its first
three loans from the Bank amounted to MCol$2,313 (50% of total long-term
debt). The second largest creditor is the IDB with MCol$927 (20% of total
long-term debt), followed by two private banks: The Merban Corp. MCol$287 (6%)
and First National City Bank MCol$139 (3%) see Annex 3, Attachment 5.5. The
pension and other liability reserves (noncurrent and contingent liabilities)
are estimated in MCol$1,091 (5%).
Investment and Financing Plans
5.09      EEEB's 1979-1982 investment program including its own construction
program (4.02), investments in ISA, interest during construction and require-
ments for working capital, amounts to MCol$ 47.079, of which MCol$9,133
or 19% correspond to the proposed distribution project. The Mesitas project
(included in the Fifth Program), partially financed by loan 1628-CO, is the
largest component of the 1979-1982 program, calling for an investment of
MCol$14,994 or 32% of the total. The capital and bonds contributions to ISA
amount to Col$8,820 or 19% of the total. 1/ The proposed financing plan for
EEEB's investment program is summarized on the next page.
5.10      EEEB's net internal cash generation would finance MCol$17,845 or
38% 2/ of total requirements of the 1979-1982 program (for 1979-1985 see
Annex 3, Attachment 5.3) and the remaining 62% would be covered by loans
amounting to MCol$29,234 (Annex 3, Attachment 5.6). Of this figure, MCol$966
comes from undisbursed proceeds of existing loans and MCol$8,850 from the
1/    The feasibility of EEEB making additional capital contributions to the
Empresa de Acueductos y Alcantarillados de Bogota (EAAB) for the Chingaza
project was under discussion until November 1979, but further contribu-
tions are not envisaged by EEEB. Concommitantly, the financial projec-
tions of EAAB, prepared by the Bank (Loans 741 and 1697.-CO) do not
assume any such contributions.
2/    1979-1982 average self-financing ratio calculated as agreed under Mesitas
is 40%.

Mesitas financing package, that included the MCol$3,936 of Loan 1628-CO. The
proposed loan for the 1980-1982 distribution expansion project amounts to
MCol$4,328 equivalent. The balance of MCol$15,090 is expected to be covered
by future loans as follows: (a) MCol$343 for financing rural distribution
which EEEB hopes to obtain from K.f.W. and suppliers; (b) MCol$4,033 of medium-
term loans from local commercial banks for financing local components of the
construction program; (c) MCol$1,680 of revolving loans from local commercial
banks to cover the balance of local currency requirements; (d) MCol$1,978 of
medium-term loans from external commercial banks or suppliers for financing
the balance of foreign currency required for complementary works of the fifth
program; and (e) MCol$7,056 of medium-term loans from external commercial
banks for financing the long-term debt service 1980 to 1982, in order to
increase the availability of the local currency. It is reasonable to expect
that EEEB will be able to obtain the financing estimated above in view of its
satisfactory financial position, its planned tariff increases and the interest
shown by commercial domestic and external lenders.  As an indication of availa-
ability of adequate domestic financing, the Government has confirmed that
arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, will be made to provide EEEB with the
additional financing required for the adequate and timely execution of the
project, the details of these arrangements will be provided by the Government
no later than March 31, 1980. The effectiveness of the proposed loan would be
conditional upon receiving evidence that EEEB has made satisfactory arrange-
ments for financing the balance of its requirements for the period 1980-1981.
Future Finances
5.11       Present financial projections (Annex 3, Attachments 5.2, 5.3 and
5.4) are based on the updated assumptions for inflation and rate of exchange
devaluation (4.07) and on EEEB's plan of rate increases. This plan, designed
to meet a significant part of the local currency requirements, assumes the
following: (a) a 2.2% monthly rate increase through 1980 as approved by
J.N.T.; (b) an additional lump increase in June/July 1980 in order to achievle
an average annual 12% rate of return in 1979-1980 (such an increase would
amount to 12% based on the present forecast), EEEB would request J.N.T.'s
approval for this lump increase in early 1980; (c) a continuation of the 2.2%
monthly increase through 1983, for which EEEB would request J.N.T's approval
by mid-1980; and (d) starting January 1984, the monthly increase will be
adjusted downward to 1.2%. The effectiveness of the proposed loan will be
conditional upon receiving evidence that EEEB has made arrangements satis-
factory to the Bank to achieve the average 12% rate of return in 1979/1980.
Under the Mesitas project, EEEB assumed that, as of 1978, capital contributions
would be required from industrial and subdivision developers for the cost of
new transformers. This policy, which has not been implemented, is still under
consideration in EEEB, but no cash contribution for this purpose has been
assumed in the forecast. The financing plan as presented here assumes the
rate increase exemption for consumers of up to 300 kWh/m would be terminated
from January 1979; although this has not occurred the resulting revenue short-
fall has no significant financial effect. The financial forecast assumes a
Bank loan of MUS$87 for the proposed project with an interest rate of 8% 1/
and a term of 17 years including a grace period of 3 years.
1/   The financial forecast is not affected by the new Bank lending rate
(8.25%) effective after December 31, 1979.



- 42 -
5.12       EEEB's net operating income with the above plan is expected to
produce annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 10.5%
in 1979 to 15.4% in 1982 (Annex 3, Attachment 5.1) compared with not less than
12% covenanted under the San Carlos and Mesitas loans starting as of 1978. l/
These rate of return covenants will be amended for the proposed loan (in order
to achieve a 12% average for 1979-1980 and 14% thereafter) in line with the
present internal cash generation requirements to maintain the acceptable
financial performance forecast in debt service coverage, debt/equity and
current ratio. The method for calculating the rate of return and the method
for monitoring and implementing required adjustments of rates covenanted under
San Carlos and Mesitas will be repeated for the proposed loan. Although in
1978 EEEB did not meet the required rate of return (5.03) and would also fall
short of the targeted 1979 rate of return, it is expected that by 1980, it
would reach a rate of return of 15.0%. Under Mesitas, the Bank and EEEB had
accepted the figure up to 12% starting in 1978 despite the forecast of lower
incomes for 1978 and 1979, because the forecast average for 1978-1980 as a
whole (in accordance with the existing agreements for calculating the rate of
return: i.e. to carry forward for shortfall or overrun) would be 12%. The
present forecasted 1978-1980 average is 10.5%; it is acceptable to the Bank
because EEEB's financial performance remains satisfactory. However, EEEB has
agreed under the proposed loan to a 12% rate of return average for 1979-1980
and 14% thereafter in order to generate sufficient funds for planned investments.
5.13       Under Mesitas, EEEB agreed to a contribution to investment covenant
to assure the income needed during 1981-1984 in excess of that implied by the
covenanted rate of return. However, with the proposed rate of return covenant
(5.12) the contribution to investment covenant is no longer necessary and,
therefore, will be eliminated for the proposed loan. Under the San Carlos and
Mesitas loans, EEEB agreed to furnish to the Bank quarterly financial reports
on cash generation, rate of return and adequacy of its tariffs; these covenants,
including the provisions for submitting semi-annual financial forecasts,
will be repeated for the proposed loan.
5.14       Under Mesitas, EEEB agreed not to construct generating plant e7cceeding
100 MW unless economically justified and adequately funded; additionally EEEB
would not undertake without Bank concurrence any further projects (excluding
certain projects among which was 1979-1982 transmission and distribution develop-
ment up to MUS$45 in each year) costing in excess of 1% of the net current value
of net fixed assets. This undertaking, which will be repeated for the proposed
loan, will be amended by restricting annual additional investments in trans-
mission and distribution to MUS$9 (average annual investments foreseen by EEEB
for rural development plans). EEEB has furnished to the Bank a letter confirm-
ing that, in accordance with their understanding of the above-mentioned
agreement, the company will not undertake capital expenditures related to the
Guavio project until presentation to the Bank of a satisfactory financing plan.
1/    It was recognized previously that a 12% annual return wou!Ld not provide
adequate internal cash generation over 1981-1984. However, because of
external circumstances at that time it was not feasible to covenant a
higher rate of return. Therefore, an internal cash generation covenant
under 1582-CO, 1628-CO and 1725-CO was used to achieve this (5.13).



- 43 -
5.15       The financial position as measured by the debt/equity ratio (34/66
in 1978) would be maintained at safe levels throughout the projected period
(Annex 3, Attachment 5.1); despite the borrowing required for construction
of Mesitas and the distribution expansion it would not exceed 50/50. Debt
service coverage on an annual basis would not descend under 1.7, which is satis-
factory compared with the agreed 1.5 under Mesitas. The debt service covenant
will be repeated for the proposed loan.
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solutions
6.01      The subtransmission and distribution program of which the project is
a part (1980-1982) was designed on the basis of the EEEB load forecast for
1979-1985 (3.03). Since the objective is to provide electric service to some
40,000-50,000 new consumers each year and to improve service coverage and
quality through improvement and expansion of the existing system, reasonable
alternatives are limited. EEEB has made economic comparisons where applicable
to select the least-cost solution, e.g., routing of transmission lines, power
factor correction and location of new substations. However, the following
two important aspects of the system still require technical and economic
evaluation to determine the least-cost solution (4.05). (a) Selection of a
standard primary voltage either at 11.4 kV or 13.2 kV for urban distribution,
which now operates at 11.4 kV but was designed and constructed for future
conversion to 13.2 kV. (b) Whether to service rural areas by double trans-
formation 34.5 kV and 13.2 kV or by direct primary distribution at 34.5 kV.
The project includes the service of consultants to evaluate and recommend the
economic choice for the above (4.05). EEEB has agreed to seek the Bank's
concurrence to the consultant's recommendations and to design and construct
the program in accordance with the least-cost alternatives.
Return on Investment
6.02      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate equalizing
the present values of the streams of benefits and costs associated with EEEB's
1979-1985 development program of which the Bank project is a part. The cost
streams comprise the capital costs of this development program and incremental
operation and maintenance costs related to the incremental sales associated with
the program. These costs were converted to border prices by means of weighted
average conversion factors based on conversion factors for individual local cost
components (comprising costs for materials, machinery, equipment, labor, consum-
ables, etc.). As a proxy for benefits, revenues were used, derived from incre-
mental sales associated with the program and the 1982 average rate used in the
financial projections, deflated to 1979, and adjusted to border prices by the
standard conversion factor.
6.03      The rate of return is about 12% (Annex 4, Attachment 6.1) which
compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Colombia estimated
to be 11%. This rate probably understates the socio/economic justification of



- 44 -
return of the program, as revenues from sales of electricity may not fully
measure social and indirect benefits. For example, the program includes
connections to over 57,000 households in the lower income bracket (those
consuming less than some 200 kWh per month) and provides improved lighting to
streets and public areas.
6.04      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of major
uncertainties underlying the return calculation. The analysis shows the
following:
Rates of Return
------------ Change from Base (%) -----------
Parameters                           -20        -10       Base        +10        +20
--------------Rate of Return (%) ------------
Benefits                              8.3       10.2       12.0        13.5       15.0
Capital Costs                        14.5       13.1       12.0        10.9      10.0
Operation and Maintenance Costs   13.0          12.5       12.0        11.3       10.7
The results indicate rates of return which compare reasonably with the oppor-
tunity cost of capital except in the case of a reduction in benefits and of
a 20% increase in capital costs.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
During Negotiations
7.01      Agreements were reached on the following principal points:
(a)  EEEB, by June 30, 1980, will appoint two senior financial experts
satisfactory to the Bank and will carry out periodic training
programs for its financial staff (2.04);
(b)  EEEB will execute an insurance study and engage the services of an
expert or specialized consultants by June 30, 1980, for completion
of the study by February 28, 1981. The study will be sent to the
Bank for review and comment by April 30, 1981, implementation starLing
December 31, 1981 (2.08);
(c)  EEEB will engage consultants to carry out and complete by Septem-
ber 30, 1980, a study of distribution (including the Master Plan to
the year 2000), planning, design procedures and training (4.09(a)),
(d)  EEEB will engage consultants by July 31, 1980, to carry out and
complete by June 30, 1981, a study of a dispatch center. The study
will be submitted to the Bank for review and comments by August 3L,
1981 (4.09),



- 45 -
(e) EEEB will engage consultants 3 months after the engagement of the
distribution consultants, to carry out and complete by August 31, 1981,
a training program in maintenance and operation of the distribution
system (4.09(d)).
7.02      Agreements were reached that the corresponding provisions of Loan
1628-CO will be amended:
(a) The revision of EEEB's tariffs as follows: (i) preparation of program:
April 30, 1980, putting program into effect: June 30, 1980; (ii)
should the national tariff study (Loan 1582-CO) be delayed, EEEB
will implement an interim program beginning June 30, 1980 and
ending October 1, 1982; the interim program will be superseded by one
conforming to the Mesitas undertaking, once the tariff study becomes
available (LA Section 5.09) (1.29);
(b) The consultants to carry out the study of valuation of assets will be
engaged by April 30, 1980 and the study completion by March 31, 1981
(LA Section 3.02(b)) (5.04),
(c) The rate of return on fully resolved net fixed assets in operation
will be: 12% average for 1979-1980 and 14% thereafter (LA Section
5.06) (5.12);
(d) The investment restriction covenant: reducing investment in rural
distribution from MUS$15 to MUS$9 (LA Section 5.04) (5.14).
7.03      The agreement under Loan 1628-CO on self-financing will be
eliminated (5.13).
7.04      The following main provisions of Loan 1628-CO will be repeated
under the proposed loan:
(a) Auditing and financial statements (LA Section 5.02(a)) (2.06),
(b) The collecting period convenant (LA Section 5.08) (2.07),
(c) Dam monitoring (LA Section 4.04),
(d) Insurance (LA Section 4.03);
(e) Implementation schedule (LA Section 3.01) (4.10);
(f) The financial reporting convenants (LA Section 5.02 (b) and (c))
(5.13);
(g) Quarterly review and adjustment of tariffs (LA Section 5.07) (5.12),
(h) The debt service coverage covenant (LA Section 5.08) (5.15).

Conditions of Effectiveness
7.05      Prior to declaring the loan effective, the following cond(itions will
have been met:
(a) Evidence that EEEB has made satisfactory arrangements for financing
the balance of financial requirements for the period 1980-1981
(5.10).
(b)  Evidence that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank hiave been made
by EEEB to achieve 12% rate of return averag,e in 1979-1980 (5.11.).
Recommendation
7.06      With the above assurances the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of MUS$87 equivalent to be made to EEEB with the guiarantee of the Govern-
ment of Colombia. The loan would have a repayment period of 17 years Lnclujding
a grace period of three years.
