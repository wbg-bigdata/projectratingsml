MEMORANDUM AND RECaMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO UGANDA
FOR A FIRST HEALTH PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Uganda for SDR 38.0 million (US$52.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA ternms with 40 years maturity and help finance a first health
project. The project would be cofinanced by SIDA (Sweden) for
US$6.5 million.
2.        Background.  The political tu-zmoil and civil strife of the past
two decades in Uganda resulted in the almost total collapse of the public
sector health services. Facilities have been destroyed and looted and
equipment stolen. Staff have remained unpaid for long periods and drug
supplies are intermittent. Furthermore, the organization and management of
the health sector is weak with lack of clarity in the respective roles and
responsibilities of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Local
Government (MLG). Funding of the health sector is inadequate with a
decline from estimated expenditures of US$128 million in 1982 to less than
US$70 million in 1986. As a result, the health status of Ugandans has
deteriorated dramatically: immunization programs now reach only 15-25Z of
the population against up to 70 in 1971; there is a resurgence of diseases
such as measles and malaria; and there is a growing AIDS epidemic. Host
Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs have been abandoned. The level of
mortality in Uganda has become significantly higher than in other major
East African countries. This situation needs to be redressed and urgently.
3.        With the return of peace to much of the country since 1986, there
are fortunately a number of elements of hope upon which it will be possible
to build a revitalization strategy for the sector. First of all, non-
government organizations (NGOs) and private practitioners, though subject
to the same difficult environment as the public sector, have been able to
restore a reasonable provision of services in the areas where they are
located. Second, a number of community level initiatives are being
initiated to effect minimum maintenance and repairs to health facilities.
Third, Government has provided for the managerial and financial autonomy of
the country's main public hospital. Finally, the Health Policy Review set
up by Government in 1986 has just issued its recommendations, which would
help put the sector on a sound administrative and financial path. The
proposed strategy, to be supported by this project, would be to initiate
actions necessary to deal with both immediate problems and longer term
challenges. To address the immediate needs of the health sector, urgent
action is required to provide drugs, equipment, restore health education
programs, and reconstruct damaged health facilities. At the same time, and
to achieve a permanent impact, these efforts need to be complemented by
measures addressed to the longer term and more fundamental issues of health
sector planning and programming, financing, manpower development, and
management strengthening.



4.        Proiect Objectives.  The project has three major objectivess
(a) reestablish the provision of health services by physically
rehabilitating a number of strategically located hospitals and health
centers; (b) promote the population's health status by strengthening
preventive health programs; and (c) ensure the long-term sustainability and
viability of the health care delivery system.
5.        Prolect Description:  The proposed project has therefore three
major components:  (a) essential rehabilitation of Mulago Hospital, eight
district hospitals, thirty rural health centers, and the central blood
transfusion center, and building of a new hospital in Rakai District
(particularly affected by AIDS); (b) a health and hygiene education program
using a wide variety of media; a community based distribution program for
drugs and supplies; and a program for counselling and managing AIDS
patients and their families; and ic) the strengthening of planning and
management capabilities In MOH and the hospitals; a study of alternative
schemes for financing the health sector; and support to NGOs.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvements  IDA has been concerned with the
health sector since the early 1980s, initially through a sector report and
thereafter through a series of studies financed under a technical
assistance project (Credit 1434-UG) which have formed the basis for the
current project. The reestablishment of a viable health sector is part of
IDA's overall strategy in support of the country's economic recovery.
IDA's financial support for the health sector would therefore be intended
to generate a momentum towards revitalization of essential programs,
institutions, and staff morale within the context of a feasible health
development plan, as well as preventing and controllin, the spread of AIDS.
It would also aim at attracting coordinated support from bilateral and
multilateral agencies. This project is intended to be the first in a
series of projects to the health sector.
7.        Atreed Actions:  During negotiations Government agreed that it
would: (a) by credit effectiveness: (i) appoint a qualified and
experienced project coordinator; and (ii) prepare an acceptable timetable
for finalization of civil works documentation. (b) by December 1, 1988:
submit to the Association evidence that it has secured from other donors
the equivalent of not less than $6.5 million for the financing of the
project. To ensure the sustainability of the project-supported
investments, Government would also:
(a)  by June 1989, prepare a staffing plan for each facility under the
project, including proposals to deal with redundant staff;
(b) by December 1989, prepare a staffing plan for each of the
project-financed workshops; and establish Management Committees
for each facility under the project;
(c)  introdu-  :ternate schemes of health financing including cost
recovery at facilities rehabilitated under the project; and



-3-
(d) by December 31, 1990, carry out a comprehensive mid-term review
of progress made in the implementation of the project. The
review would focus inter alia on (i) overall financing of the
health sector, including recurrent costs, to ensure that adequate
funds are made available to sustain health services and'
(ii) financial plans of project-financed facilities, with details
on alternative schemes for the generation of resources (including
cost recovery) to ensure that such schemes are properly
established and appropriately implemented.
To ensure the sustainability of the health system as a whole, Government
has also agreed to:
(a) by December 1988, prepare a timetable of actions to improve
organization of the health system; and complete the National
Health Plan;
(b) by December 1989, prepare a proposal and implementation plan to
improve the hospital referral system; and
(c) by December 1989, prepare a staffing plan for the health sector
as a whole.
Other covenants are: i?) appointing, by December 31, 1988 a health
education coordination committee; (b) providing IDA with the results of
studies within six months of their completion; (c) by June 30, 1989
allowing funds generated through community and health-related financing
activities, including cost recovery on drugs, to be rechannelled to the
respective health facility; and (d) obtaining IDA's agreement to proposals
for income generating activities, NGO activities, and related accounting
mechanisms prior to their implementation.  Disbursement conditions are
(a) for funds relating to the construction of a hospital in Rakai district,
selection of an acceptable site, and (b) for the hygiene education sub-
component, completion of detailed preparation.
8.        Benefits:  The proposed project would improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of the health system by (a) rebuilding health personnel
morale and beneficiary trust in its services through rehabilitation of
facilities and the provision of essential equipment and supplies;
(b) strengthening a number of key preventive health programs; and
(c) addressing planning, managerial and financial issues. Several of these
interventions at the hospital/health center level and at the community
level would help slow down the spreading of HIV infection.
9.        Risks.  The project faces three main risks.  The first relates to
the implementation capacity of the MOH which is understaffed and
organizationally and managerially weak. The project therefore provides
systematic support to the MOH and structures the implementation program so
as to avoid overextending the MOH staff. The second risk relates to the
feasibility of developing additional methods of financing the health
sector. The establishment of hospital and health centers management
boards, the launching of local self-help programs to maintain and expand
facilities, and the emergence of the Resistance Committees as strong
community forces should alleviate this risk. The third risk concerns low



-4-
staff motivation due to low levels of pay and poor working conditions. The
introduction of new management systems and practices, the rehabilitation of
facilities and the increased community involvement should reduce this risk
considerably.
10.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit and that the
Association administer the SIDA grant.
