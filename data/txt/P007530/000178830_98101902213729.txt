INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR PANUCO ('IRST STAGE) IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$77 million to Nacional Fi-
nanciera, S.A. (NAFIN) to assist in financing the Panuco (First Stage)
Irrigation Project. The loan would be guaranteed by the United Mexican
States and would have a term of 25 years including five years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        "The Economy of Mexico: A Basic Report" (192-ME) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on June 26, 1973. It was designed to provide a
long-term perspective and a framework for the assessment of short-run trends
in the Mexican economy. An updating report will be prepared this spring and
is scheduled to be distributed to the Executive Directors in mid-1974.
Country Data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the success of the Mexican system, measured in terms of GDP growth,
has been outstanding. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate has ex-
ceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950's to 1972 Mexico was among the few
countries in the developing world to combine a sustained high rate of
growth with monetary and balance of payments stability. The average annual
rate of inflation was less than 5 percent and the dollar value of the peso
was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
4.        Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector re-
sources.  The role of Government in promoting economic growth was concerned
on one hand with the development of strategic infrastructure and major uti-
lity industries and on the other with development policies which featured,
in the agricultural sector, the development of price support, import control
and agrarian reform measures, and in the industrial sector external pro-
tection and the provision of fiscal incentives.
5.        The sectoral allocation of public and private investment was
reflected in a changing structure of output and employment. This featured
the growth of manufacturing industry and the relative decline of agri-
culture, although agriculture remained the chief source of employment, ac-
counting in 1970 for 39 percent of the economically active population.



6.        Rapid economic growth has not generated sufficient opportun-
ities to create employment for the labor force which has recently been
growing at about 3.5 percent per year. In 1970 it was estimated that
40 percent of the labor force was either engaged in marginal occupations
- relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid - or totally unemployed.
Partly as a consequence of rapid population growth, but also as a result
of the distribution of incomes and assets in the Mexican economy, the
strategy which succeeded in promoting rapid growth was not comparably suc-
cessful in spreading its benefits. The incidence of poverty had by 1970
been much reduced from the level of 1940. But the differentials between
rich and poor, both between people and between places, had probably
increased.
7.        There was, until recently, little evidence (apart from the con-
tinuation of the land reform program begun in earnest during the Cardenas
regime in the 1930's) that Government policies were much concerned with
these problems. By 1970, however, it was apparent that a revised economic
strategy - one which would focus on the improvement of the living conditions
of the poor - was required. It seemed to be understood that this goal
should not be pursued at the expense of rapid growth or of the monetary
and balance of payments stability which appeared to be a sine qua non of
sustained economic expansion. The events and trends of the last three years
have demonstrated the Government's determination to develop such a strategy.
They have slso revealed some of the constraints to doing so.
8.        There are several types of distributive measures which do not
depend heavily on the growth of budgetary expenditures. Among those
introduced since 1970 are a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new Water
Law (1971) and a revision of instructions concerning the allocation of bank
credit (designed to increase the flow of resources to low income farmers
and ejidatarios).l/ These measures are all responsive to the needs of
the rural sector and demonstrate the Government's concern to confront them.
Another recent initiative is the introduction (1972) of a 5 percent payroll
tax 2/ to finance a new housing program for workers in the lower-middle
income groups. It is clear, however, in the light of the experience of the
last three years, that neither the needs of the poor nor those of the public
sector industries (on which the growth of the economy as a whole partly
depends) can be met unless the Government takes new measures to mobilize
additional public sector resources.
9.        In 1971 the Government acted to restrain the growth of the economy
in order to preserve stability and, partly as a result, the growth rate
fell from the 1960-1970 decade average of 7.1 percent to only 3.7 percent,
while prices increased by 4.8 percent. In 1972 renewed expansion was
stimulated by public sector expenditures and the GDP growth rate rose to
7.5 percent, while prices increased (in terms of the GDP deflator) by
slightly more than 5 percent. In 1973 there was a further substantial

increase in public expenditures which was largely financed by recourse
to increased internal and external borrowing. This expansion coincided
with and was partially responsible for an acceleration in the rate of
domestic price increases. These increases are also, however, a conse-
quence of imported inflation (the impact of which was especially serious
because of the poor harvest in 1972 and the resulting need to import
basic foodstuffs in a year of high commodity prices). Prices increased
by roughly 20 percent during 1973 - somewhat more in the case of whole-
sale prices and somewhat less in the case of consumer prices.
10.       In the light of these trends, the Government is introducing
substantial new resource mobilization measures to generate the funds
required to support the growth of public expenditures. Following some
changes in the tax structure in 1972 and 1973, it is understood that there
will be a more substantial increase in taxation in 1974. The action which
was taken in October 1973 to adjust electricity rates (by an average of
almost 30 percent) was followed by substantial increases in hydrocarbons
prices in December 1973. The total of the revenue measures which have been
taken or are under consideration is expected to yield the equivalent of
approximately 2 percent of 197h GDP.
11.       These measures to increase public sector revenues are clearly
needed and they will permit a reduction in the public sector deficit as
well as a moderate increase in expenditure in 197h. The rate of increase
in the latter, however, is likely to be slower than in 1973. There
should be some deceleration in the rate of inflation in 1974 compared to
1973, but the rate will still be higher than in other recent years, both
because of further expected increases in international prices and because
the inflationary trends of 1973 have resulted in substantial wage adjust-
ments which are likely to be reflected in higher costs and prices.
12.       It is unlikely that the rate of economic growth in 1974 will be
as high as the level of between 7 and 8 percent which is estimated for
1973.  Growth will almost certainly be restrained by the capacity limit-
ations derived from the low level of private investment in the last three
years and because the Government recognizes the need to limit imports in
order to contain the balance of payments deficit to an acceptable level.
It is quite probable, therefore, that 1974 will be a year of fiscal and
financial retrenchment and of moderate growth.
13.       The events of recent months have illustrated the dangers inherent
in large scale deficit financing, but also the willingness of the Government
to take the kinds of corrective action which become necessary. The record
of the Mexican authorities in economic management over the past two decades
is such that there is reason to give credence to the Government's assurances
that it will act to restore the relative price and balance of payments sta-
bility which, in terms of the recent experience of the Mexican economy, ap-
pear to be necessary conditions of sustained growth. The Bank, as well as
the Fund, is in a continuing dialogue with the Government regarding these
issues.



- 4 -
14.       As of December 31, 1972, Mexico's outstanding disbursed ex-
ternal public debt was US$4.0 billion as compared with a total of US$3.5
billion a year earlier. The IBRD share in the former total was US$723
million as compared with a level of US$659 million a year before. For
1973, net public medium and long-term external borrowing is estimated
at about US$1,300 million. This represents a sharp increase over the
1972 level ($h51 million), and reflects the larger public sector defi-
cit in 1973, a greater reliance upon external rather than deestic bor-
rowing to finance the deficit and some borrowing undertaken to offset
short-term capital movements. The substantial revenue measures re-
cently taken will reduce the public sector's needs to borrow in 1974.
15.       Annex I, Page 4 shows that 41.3 percent of public external ca-
pital contracted in the period 1968-1972 was obtained from private banks
- the largest single source and that international organizations ac-
counted for the next largest share (22.2 percent). The World Bank ac-
counted for 14.7 percent of total commitments. Annex I, Page 4 also
shows the sectorial allocation of public external capital and reveals
that power, transport and manufacturing were the dominant sectors. The
terms of recent public external borrowing have continued to improve in
the light of (a) the availability of capital in international markets
and (b) Mexico's reputation as a creditworthy borrower.
16.       During 1974, assuming normal private capital movements, it is
expected that the level of net external borrowing by the public sector
(or guaranteed by the public sector) will decline to around US$950 -
US$1,000 million. Net borrowing of this magnitude is consistent with
Mexico's debt service capacity. As a result, particularly of longer
maturities on borrowings from financial institutions, Mexico's external
public debt service ratio has declined over the last several years and
was 18.2 percent in 1973. Assuming that the average terms in the future
are about the same as those which have been recently obtained, the debt
service ratio is expected to remain in the 18 to 20 percent range during
the remainder of the 1970's. The Bank's share in public debt outstanding
and disbursed is presently about 14 percent while its share in the corres-
ponding debt service is about 10 percent. These ratios are not expected
to change significantly during the remainder of the 1970's.
17.       Mexico thus continues to be creditworthy for borrowing on con-
ventional terms, always provided that the additional public savings
measures are taken without undue delay. The rate increases recently
enacted by the publicly owned electric power sector and the recent in-
crease in the prices of the publicly owned hydrocarbons industry, suggest
that the Government will continue to handle its financing affairs prudently.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
18.       The Bank has made 33 loans, for a total of US$1,599 million net
of cancellations, of which at the end of December 31, 1973 the Bank held
US$1.3 billion including US$0.5 billion not yet disbursed. Most of these
loans have been made for power, roads and agriculture. Execution of Bank-
financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. However, disburse-
ments on the US$125 million loan for the Fourth Power Sector Program were



delayed because the Government found it impossible to effect necessary
power tariff changes on schedule.  The problen was resolved when tariffs
were increased on October 16, 1∞73.
19.       IFC has made eleven investment commitments in Mexico amounting
to US$53.1 million, of which as of December 31, 1973, US$35.4 million had
been sold, terminated or cancelled. The US$17.7 million held by the Cor-
poration consists of US$15.9 million in l.-ans and US$1.8 million in equity.
Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans3 .ad IFG investments as of Decem-
ber 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Bank lending to Mexico in FY73 consi.-stqd of two loans, for agri-
culture and water supply, totalling US$200 TAnIion. The FY74 program in-
cludes, in addition to the Las Trichas Stee&i.. Project approved last
September,  the  VII Highway  2roject  rnd the   Sinaloa  and Panuco
Irrigation Projects under consideration today. Tin addition, work is under
way on rural development, i.rrigation, forest industries and transport projects
for possible consideration by the Executive W,rectors during the next two
years.
21.       In lending to Mexico, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major objectives. These objecti4es are interdependent and
complementary; hence, it is not possible to rank them in order of priority
or importance.  One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more
widely than before and, more particularly, to begin to address the problem
of rural poverty. A second objective is to help Mexico continue to achieve
the remarkable growth of output of the past two decades, both by investing
in projects that directly or indirectly make large contributions to produc-
tion and employment, and by supporting changes that will make existing
institutions function more effectively or by creating new ones that will
perform presently neglected functions. A third objective is to contribute
with funds and expertise to the solution of critical adjustment problems
that are themselves a result of Mexico's continued growth; noteworthy among
these are the problems attendant on a rapid urban expansion, and the
emerging need to exploit scarce water resources more efficiently. A
fourth objective is totransfer sufficient external resources to complement
Mexico's quite appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds
for sufficient economic and sociA. investments in a framework of sound
domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
22.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of
the Bank's program in Mexico, the other three joinatly determine its struc-
ture. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed
and may, moreover, support more specific Government objectives.   Thus the
Sinaloa and Panuco Irrigation Projects are designed not only to help expand
production but also to sulpport the Government's policies on income redistri-
bution as expressed in the Land Reform and Water Laws, both of 1971. Con-
cern with the vital issue of better water management also induced the Gov-
vernment, the Bank and UNDF to organize, jointly, a national water study;



the Bank serves as Executing Agency for the UNDDP. The Study has the prin-
cipal objectives of formulating alternative water development programs for
the short, medium and long-term and of adopting key policy decisions con-
cerning water development and management. It is expected to use the results
of the Study - as they become available - for the identification and
analysis of future irrigationi projects. Loans in the transport and power
sectors are designed explicitly both to transfer resources to Mexico and
to help improve institutional structures and policies in sectors that play
a vital role in industrial and agricultural production and in the genera-
tion and utilization of public sector resources. At the same time, the
Government, together with the Bank, is attempting to prepare integrated
rural investment projects in regiorns in which income levels are low but
where some productive potential can be identified.
PART III - THE AGRICULTHURAL SECTOR
23.       Agriculture has been a dynamic element of Mexico's economic de-
velopment. The sector's growth of close to 6 percent p.a. in real terms
over nearly three decades (l940-1965), is a record matched by only a few
countries. It has managed to satisfy the demand of a rapidly growing po-
pulation and to transform the country from a net importer to a net exporter
of agricultural products. While the growth of agricultural output has been
attributable primarily to expansion of the area under cultivation, it has
of late become increasingly dependent on productivity increases and on
changes in composition to higher valued crops. Public investment has
played a key role in these processes, However, the share of agricultural
investment - primarily irrigation - in the public budget declined after
1950 (from 19.3 percent to 13.6 percent in 1970). This shift is one of
the causes accounting for the reduction in sectoral growth from an annual
rate exceeding 7.5 percent in the forties to less than h percent in the
sixties.
24.       Although agriculture contributed only 10.1 percent to GDP in
1972, the sector is still the largest employer, with nearly 40 percent of
Mexico's labor force. It is also the most important foreign exchange
earner outsido of tourism; agricultural exports amounted to US$673 mil-
lion in 1972, nearly half of total commodity exports.   Favourable external
factors have benefited exports and-have led to an increasing integration
of Mexico's northern agriculture with the U. S. market. The most important
e;port products are cotton and livestock, each accounting for about 21 per-
cent of total export value, followed by tomatoes, sugar and coffee.   Res-
ponding to trends in domestic and foreign demand, livestock has developed
more rapidly than crop productior.n incrc-sing its share to nearly a third
of total output in 1972. However, cona and beans continue to be the basic



- 7 -
components of the Mexican diet and remain the subsistence crops for most
of the peasants; together they account for nearly 70 percent of the rain-
fed and 10 percent of the irrigation cropland.
25.       Irrigation has traditionally accounted for about three-fourths
of Government investment in agriculture; a reflection both of Mexico's
climatic conditions and the technical competence of the staff of the
Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRH). Irrigation is a sine qua non of
agricultural production in most of Mexico's cultivable areas, and public
irrigation programs have in fact been a chief source of output growth
since 1940; over 25 percent of total output expansion originated in irri-
gation districts which contributed 40 percent of total agricultural and
60 percent of total crop output in 1972. Public irrigation projects
have laid the foundation for a modern, sophisticated, commercial sector
which helped the country to earn the foreign exchange needed to industri-
alize, but at the same time they tended to benefit, principally, the
large-scale farmers and hence to accentuate the skewness of the rural
income distribution.
26.       Thus, although until recently agriculture policies were success-
ful in raising production, they were not capable of solving the pressing
problems of rural unemployment, high degrees of income concentration and
accelerated rates of rural-urban migration. The Revolution of 1910 led to
the far reaching Agrarian Reform Legislation of 1917, under which nearly
half of Mexico's total land area was redistributed. The rural society
has nevertheless undergone little change. It is still polarized into a
small, highly efficient and rich class of rural entrepreneurs and a large
class of poor peasants and ejidatarios which have, to a large extent, been
bypassed by the rapid economic growth of the post-revolution period and
even today barely participate in the market economy.
27.       The rural poverty problem is a compound of an overall shortage of
productive land, inequality in land ownership and inadequate public services.
According to a recent study, only 7 percent of the almost 3 million farms in
Mexico are modern while 53 percent are classified as subsistence units and
another 40 percent as traditional, producing only small marketable surpluses.
The rural population has grown faster than the land under cultivation, lead-
ing to excessive fragmentation of holdings in many parts of the country and
a landless rural labor force of close to two million. At the same time,
only 1 percent of the farmers still controlled more than 30 percent of to-
tal cropland in 1960 and 5 percent of the farms in public irrigation dis-
tricts owned more than 40 percent of the area in 1965. The skewed land
distribution is reflected in the distribution of rural income. It is es-
timated that 10 percent of the farmers accounted for 40 percent of total
rural income including proceeds from sources other than agriculture.
28.       President Echeverria's Administration, which has been in office
since the end of 1970, is attempting to reconcile the twin objectives of
economic growth and income redistribution. It has given particular at-
tention to agriculture and has substantially increased the budget alloca-
tions to this sector in absolute terms and relatively to other sectors.



- a -
While the expansion of the irrigation, credit and externsion programs is
expected to raise the growth of output to the rates achieved in the past,
the Government has initiated several measuires to ensure that the earnings
and living conditions of the rural poor are improved at the same time.
These include the enactment of a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new
Water Law (1971), instruction to the banking system to channel part of
its resources to small farmers and ejidatarios, and large appropriations
for an integrated rural development program.
29.       The new Agrarian Reform Law is directed to strengthening the
legal and institutional bases of the ejido, to transforming the ejido into
an efficient production unit and to accelerating the granting of' definite
land titles. The agricultural credit program, supported by the Bank-
financed Fourth Agricultural and Livestock Project, seeks to gear credit
institutions more to the needs of the small farmers and to enable then
to benefit from modern production technology. The rural development pro-
gram, for which US$200 million have been appropriated in the 1973 budget.
with a total investment of about US$1.5 billion planned for 1973-1976, is
the most ambitious Government effort to mitigate rural poverty by helping
the landless and seasonally unemployed as well as improving the productive
base of the smallholders and ejidatarios.
30.       The new Water Law reduces the maximum permitted holdings in new
irrigation districts from 100 has per owner to 20 has. The excess land is
to be distributed to small farmers and landless families. While the new
ceiling is still large enough to permit the application of modern methiods
of production, it will significantly change the distributional incidence
of new irrigation projects. At the same time, SRH has diversified its
policy; considerations of income distribution and employment are given
more importance in project evaluation and more emphasis is placed on al-
ternative investment options including conjunctive ground and surface
water use, phasing of construction and non-structural alternatives like
intensified grassland utilization with drainage improvement. Notably
among the new or expanded activities of SRH are also e program specially
designed to increase efficiency of water use and yields in existing ir-
rigation districts (PLAMEPA), and a small-scale irrigation programL which
is addressed exclusively to the poor peasants; both prograrm are fi-
nanced with IDB assistance.
PAR-T II - THE PROJECT
31.       The proposed project would be the tenth Bank operation for
agriculture in Mexico, including the Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project.



Previous lending in the sector consisted of four loans for agrizultur-
al credit and four for irrigation.
32.       The Panuco Project was appraised in May 1973. Negotiations
took place from January 14 to January 18, 1974. The main negotiators
were Ing. Ignacio Aguilar Alvarez (Ministry of Hydraulic Resources),
Lic. Fernando Torres (NAEIN), and Lic. Narciso Acevedo (Ministry of
Finance) assisted by seven members of the Guarantor's and Borrower's
staff. A report entitled "Appraisal Rio Panuco First Stage'? (No. 30Oa-ME
of February 4 , 1974) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Lnnex III contains a loan and project summary.
Project Description
33.       The proposed project would develop intensive agriculture and
livestock operations on 137,000 has in the coastal plains of the Panuco
Basin. The project would consist of three separate water supply, dis-
tribution and drainage systems in:
a. Las Animas (State of Tamaulipas): diversion dam on
the Guayalejo River and upstream reservoir to serve
48,000 has;
b. Pujal-Coy (States of San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas and
Veracruz): diversion dam, two pumping stations and
two regulating reservoirs to serve 72,000 has; and,
c. Chicayan (State of Veracruz): storage dam and reser-
voir on the Chicayan River to serve 17,000 has.
34.       The project would also include, in all three areas, land level-
ing and clearing where necessary, intensive extension services over a
four-year period and access roads to facilitate operation and maintenance.
35.       Presently, only about 78,000 has are cropped on the average in
the project area because of the concentration of rainfall in a short period
and lack of irrigation facilities. The project, through control of the
Guayalejo, Tampico and Chicayan Rivers together with modern irrigation and
farming techniques would make it possible to bring 50,000 has under peren-
nial crops, i.e. sugarcane, fruit trees, pasture, and to double crop
40,000 has on the average per year resulting in a cropping intensity of
129 percent of the total project area of 137,000 has.
Project Objectives
369        The proposed project is probably the single most important
public investment project of the present Administration to increase agri-
cultural production. The incremental production value from the project
area - Mex$1,438 million (US$115 million) after full development, equiva-
lent to about 3 percent of Mexico's agricultural production in 1972 -



- 10 -
will help to reduce Mexico's expected deficit in foodstuffs and to im-
prove the balance of payments both through export expansion and import
substitution.
37.       Compared to present domestic production levels, the project
will produce significant quantities of sorghum, rice, soybeans, saf-
flower, fruits and cotton as well as relatively smaller quantities of
corn, beans, vegetables, sugarcane and beef. Most of the production
will be sold domestically. The private sector is expected to provide
for the processing, packing and transportation facilities, as it has
done in other parts of the country.and the Government has taken steps
to ensure adequate and prompt availability of credit. Fruits, sugar and
a small portion of the vegetable production will be exported and are ex-
pected to find ready markets in the U.S. The cotton production will
balance the expected continued decline in other parts of the country and
help to avoid a further reduction in cotton exports.
38.       The second major objective of the project is to mitigate the
problems of rural poverty and unemployment in the Panuco Basin.   The
project will make it possible to settle some 5,300 landless ejidatario
families, equivalent to approximately 30,000 persons in total.  This
may be compared with the entire basin population of 200,000 of whom
70,000 are considered as rural. The 5,300 families will be settled on
80,000 has of the project area which are being redistributed accord-
ing to the new Federal Water Law. The redistribution will affect both
private farmers and existing ejidos. All private farmers in the proj-
ect area will be expropriated and compensated either in cash or irri-
gated land. The maximum size of their new holding will be 20 has,
the ceiling set by the new Federal Water Law. The existing ejidos
will be reorganized to give each ejidatario a holding of approximately
15 has. The Government's objective in choosing this size is to create
economic size units and to allow efficient livestock operations.
39.        The project will create approximately 15,000 full-time jobs
in agriculture. It will benefit, in addition to the 5,300 landless
ejida'iarios, some 1,850 existing ejidatarios and 1,500 private farmers,
about 50,000 persons in total. The average farm income of the ejida-
tarios will be raised substantially, i.e. income after full project
development is expected to be seven times the present level in the
least favourable case, while the private farmers, on the average, will
have more modest gains even though their absolute income will continue
to exceed those of the ejidatarios. The income situation of the
ii,dividual farmers and ejidatarios will vary considerably as can be
seen from the following table:

40.       The less lucrative livestock operations would mostly be on comm-u-
nally operated ejidos.  Their income, however, is expected to be generally
above the level estimated for exclusive livestock operations as part of the
ejido land will be cropped.  In total, 82 percent of the benefits from the
project, as measured in incremental net production value, will accrue to
ejidatarios who are among the lowest 40 percent of Mexico's income reci-
pients.
41.       Finally, the project is the first phase of a broader effort to
promote rapid economic and social progress in the Panuco Basin. It is ex-
pected that indirectly the project will help diversify and expand the eco-
nomic activities of the ba3in which, so far, have been concentrated in the
harbour town of Tampico. Moreover, under the project the planning and or-
ganizational capability of SRH staff in the region will be strengthened so
as to enable it to tackle the complex tasks of developing the full agricul-
tural potential of the basin, estimated to be close to 750,000 has.
Water Charges
42.       The Government proposes to levy water charges in two components.
The operation and maintenance component will be on a per ha basis and re-
cover the costs of operating and maintaining the irrigation and drainage
systems. The compensation charges for the recovery of capital investment
will be linked to water volume and land use. Progressivity will be built
into the compensation component to reflect the varying income levels ac-
cording to land use. The actual compensation charges will only be deter-
mined once the detailed socio-economic studies - prescribed by the Federal



- 12 -
Water Law - on the payment capacity of the individual farmers are com-
pleted. The Bank will be given an opportunity to comment on the con-
clusions and recommendations of the study promptly after completior..
Inves-tment Recovery
43.       While it is the Government's objective to recover the project's
investment costs at the earliest possible time, estimates on the time span
of repayment can only be made with accuracy once the socia-economic stucLes
have been completed. It will depend on (a) the farmers' net income after
meeting all crop production costs, taxes and project operation and main-
tenance charges less (b) the amount he needs to cover his family livinsg
costs and have a reasonable incentive to continue irrigated farming. Pre-
liminary estimates indicate that full recovery of investment costs, with-
out interest, might be feasible within ten years through water charges
alone. The Government would also receive substantial revenues from taxes
on incremental crop proaduction.
Management and Organization
44.        The project was planned and prepared by the Comision de Estudios
del Rio Panuco created in 1957 as a semi-autonomous agency within SRH to
work out development plans for the Panuco Basin. Responsibility for proj-
ect execution and operation rests with the SRH office in the Panuco Basin.
Both entities count on the same staff and are fully supported by SiH head-
quarters on technical matters, The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAAC)
would be responsible for the legal and organizational aspects of the land
expropriation, the settlement of new farmers and the reorganization of
existing ejidos. While SRH has long established an international reDuta-
tion for the excellence of its technical staff, DA4C has only recentiy
been transformed into an effective instrument to carry out the Agrarian
Reforma  DAAC's staff has been strengthened and is expected to discharge
its responsibilities for the project in a satisfactory and expeditious
way.
45.        Separate irrigation districts will be established in each of
the three project areas in Las Animas, Chicayan and Pujal-Coy-. Each dis-
trict will have a Management Committee - comprising representatives of
SRH, DAM, the Ministry of Agriculture, participating Banks and the far-
mers - responsible for agricultural development; in particular, annual
cropping pattern, water allocation, technical assistance, credit and
farmer organization.
Costs and Financing
46.        The capital recuirements of the project - including interest
during construction on the proposed loan (US$11.0 million) - are US$206.4
million. The Bank loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange
costs of the project, except for US$14.0 million consisting of material
and equipment which the Government furnishes directly to the contractors



- 13 -
and of negotiated contracts other than those for land clearing and level-
ing, plus 50 percent of the local costs of extension services during the
development period ($1.8 million). The remaining costs would be met
through Government budgetary allocations.
Pro curement
47.       Contracts for civil works would be let under international com-
petitive bidding and, whenever feasible, be grouped into large packages
of at least $1.8 million. International competitive bidding would not be
required for land clearing and leveling and instead SRH would contract for
them with local groups of farmers. This procedure has the advantage of
associating the ejidatarios and farmers ultimately benefiting from the
project in the execution of these works and, even more importantly, pro-
vides them with training for adoption of soil conservation practices under
the proposed loan. International competitive bidding would also not be
required for smaller contracts which, because of nature or timing, cannot
rationally be included in the major contracts. The items exempt from in-
ternational competitive bidding would account for less than 20 percent
of civil works contracts to be financed by the Bank, which has been the
limit for awards on local bids and negotiated contracts under the previous
irrigation loans. Building materials and standard equipment items pur-
chased in bulk orders by SRH under local bidding and furnished to the
contractors would not be financed by the Bank loan.
Disbursement
48.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against (i) 38 percent of pay-
ment to contractors of civil works let under international competitive
bidding and land clearing and leveling and other negotiated contracts not
exceeding the equivalent of Mex$1 million each up to an aggregate maximum
of Mex$30 million, (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditure of equipment
purchased under international competitive bidding, (iii) 50 percent of
the cost of intensive extension service during the initial period of the
project and, (iv) 100 percent of interest during construction on the loan.
The loan would be disbursed in seven years, 1974-1980.
49.       Retroactive financing not exceeding $3.0 million is recommend-
ed for advance contracts of civil works for Las Animas and Pujal-Coy.
Economic Evaluation
50.       The project is the first significant step of the Government to
realize the agricultural potential of the Panuco Basin, one of the most
promising of the remaining underexploited river basins.   The overall
economic rate of return of the project excluding secondary benefits is
estimated at 21 percent, and the individual rates at 19 percent for
Las Animas, 20 percent for Pujal-Coy and 22 percent for Chicayan.   The
economic rate of return would not fall below 12 percent in either of
the three project areas, even if a combination of very unlikely unfa-
vourable events were to ensue.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AN'D AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan A,reement between the Bank and Nacional Finan-
ciera, S.A.; the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Mexican
States and the Bank- the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III (Section 4, iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and a draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.        In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However, available information indicates that the proposed loan remains
fully justified.
54.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION  1/
in. No. 450    Third Irrigation Project:  $19 Million Loan of May 25, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The revised project costs are about 33 percent higher than
estimated, but the project rate of return will not be affected
because of~ higher than anticipated returns. The Closing Date has
been extended by one year to December 1973. In spite of delays in
construction and land levelling, agricultural development has pro-
gressed satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38-45 per-
cent, and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are ejida-
tarios.
Ln. No. 527    Fourth Irrigation Project:  $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Estimnated project costs have risen by about 36 percent.
Project benefits will be higher than estimated at appraisal, but
probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases. Civil
works are about 50 percent complete. The original Closing Date
(June 30, 1975) has been extended by one year to enable comple-
tion of works.
Ln. No. 528    Third Road Project:  $27.5 Million Loan of January 26, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project, initially delayed by increased earthworks, the
need for additional drainage structures and heavy rains, was com-
pleted in early 1973. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1972
has been extended to December 31, 1973 to permit completion of
disbursements.
Ln. No. 695    Fourth Road Project:  $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project is slightly behind schedule because of initial
delays in budgetary allocations. This problem has now been re-
solved, and disbursements have accelerated during 1973.
Ln. 1No. 747   Third Livestock and Agriculture Project:  $75 Million Loan
of June 9, 1971; Closing Date: September 30, 1975.
Progress continues at a satisfactory rate. Loan funds are
expected to be fully committed by the end of June 1974 and fully
disbursed by the end of September 1974, ahead of schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
theme They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 793    Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:  $22 Million Loan of January
22; 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Though the loan became effective only on March 31, 1973,
the physical performance under the project is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 820    Ports Project: $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976.
nie execution of the project is proceeding satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents. The
operations consultants financed under the loan have completed
much of their work, although an extension of their contract will
be necessary in order to allow time to implement their recommenda-
tions and to complete tariff studies. The National Ports Develop-
ment Study, carried out as part of the project, is progressing
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 824    Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project: $35 Million
Loan of June 2, 1972;  Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. FONEI had
a slow start because of problems in organization and promotion,
but operations have picked up and several sub-loans have been
approved recently.
Ln. No. 825    Second Railway Project: $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The new management of the railways, appointed in May 1973,
is capable and recent changes in operating practices are expected
to improve operations.  Significant progress has been made in pro-
curement and orders have been placed for most of the major items.
Recent wage awards and fuel price increases caused deterioration
in the financial position of the railways and a tariff increase is
urgently needed.
Ln. No. 834    Fourth Power Sector Program:  $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The loan became effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in
power tariffs by December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of
effectiveness of the loan.  In December 1972, however, the Gov-
erment and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), the Bor-
rower, informed the Bank that for reasons of domestic economic
policy it would not be possible to effect the electricity rate
increase by December 31L The loan included $35 million for pay-
ments due on orders placed before December 31, 1971, and which
were being jointly financed with other creditors. With the ap-
proval of Executive Directors (R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the
Loan Agreement was amended to separate this $35 million from
the remainder of the loan. The loan was made effective, although



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
Ln. No. 834 (contid)
the $90 million which were not being used for joint financing
with other creditors were not eligible for disbursement until
the power tariffs were increased consistent with the require-
ment that the Government and CFE take measures to improve the
comnpany's financial position. Power rates were increased on
October 17, 1973.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:  $90 Million Loan of
June 18, 1973;  Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Effectiveness of this loan has been delayed because of dif-
ficulties in establishing contractual arrangements between the
Water Coumnission and the State of Mexico. The Commission has al-
ready constructed facilities to provide 700,000 inhabitants in the
Valley of Mexico with water. Slow progress has been made in engag-
