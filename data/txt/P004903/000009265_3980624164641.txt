SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2821-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second National Water
Supply and Sewerage Project funded by Loan 2821-AL in the total amount of US$ 250 million.
The project was appraised in July 1986. The loan was approved by the Board on May 5, 1987,
signed on June 24, 1987, amended in December 4, 1987 to take into account a restructuring of
Algeria's water sector utilities, and it became effective on March 2, 1988. The amended loan
agreement of December 1987 was amended several more times during project implementation to
adjust to changing water sector requirements. An additional US$20 million B loan, financed by
commercial banks, was approved on January 29, 1988, bringing the total financing package to
US$270 million. However, the B loan was contingent on a riparian agreement with Tunisia,
which was never implemented. The original closing date for the project, December 31, 1993,
was extended four times, and the loan finally closed on April 30, 1997. The last disbursement
was made on August 25, 1997. The undisbursed balance of US$ 25,767,900 was canceled.
The need to reorganize the water sector and consequently redefine the project was
identified in late 1989/early 1990, and a loan-financed study to restructure the sector was
launched in 1990. After completion of the study, an amendment to finance additional technical
assistance was signed in July 1993. Shortly thereafter, the recommended reorganization of the
water sector became the objective of another loan, Loan 3743-AL, for US$ 110 million,
approved on June 16, 1994. The latter loan aimed at rationalizing arrangements in the urban
water sector and making the utilities self sustaining (see SAR for Loan 3743-AL, dated May 5,
1994).
Because of the difficult security situation in Algeria from 1993 onward, the project was
not supervised in the field after 1993 and an ICR mission was not carried out. This
Completion Report has been prepared on the basis of available data in the Bank's project files.
The objectives and components of the amended Loan 2821-AL are, from the project
documentation, basically the same as those of the original loan, except that one of the four
regional water supply subprojects was dropped because of the inability to reach an agreement
with Tunisia on riparian rights.
This ICR was prepared as a desk study by the Infrastructure Development Group, Middle
East and North Africa Region (MNSID), with the assistance of Charles Sterling (financial
analyst), Ahmed El-Hamri (economist), Alexander Velderman (sanitary engineer), and Deborah
Davis (operations analyst and editor). The report was reviewed by Jean-Claude Villiard, Director,
MNSID; Amir Al-Khafaji, Lead Operations Specialist, MNSID; and Marisa Fernandez-Palacios,
MNCMG. Since July 1997, ICR missions were scheduled and rescheduled five times. The
Borrower's Completion Report was submitted in March 1998 and is included as an annex. The
Borrower's comments on the ICR are also included in the annex. Due to the lack of information,
this ICR contains no economic analysis. Also, due to the short length of the ICR, no Evaluation
Summary is provided.

DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOANS 2821-AL)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    The Second National Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 2821-AL) was approved
by the Board on May 5, 1987. The project, the fifth in the water supply sector, was considered
an essential part of the Bank's strategy to address continuing problems in Algeria's water supply
and sewerage sector, including inadequate and deteriorating quality of water supply and
sewerage facilities in cities and towns during a time of rapid population expansion. The Bank's
strategy toward Algeria at that time was to support the expansion of infrastructure and assist the
Algerian Government in developing a strong institutional framework. The aim was to create the
capacity for sound investment programming, improve operational efficiency of the regional
water utilities, and ultimately improve and expand consumer services.
2     To achieve these objectives, the project was designed to support the Government's
strategy for the sector as defined in its Second Five-Year Plan (1985-89), which included
investments of US$ 2.2 billion to increase water supply and provide sewerage and sewage
treatment facilities to major, intermediate, and small-sized cities and towns nationwide. The
Bank reviewed the Plan's overall investment program and considered it well formulated and
technically sound. However, the Government's financial resources fell short of requirements and
it requested the Bank's assistance to fill the financing gap. This project was the Bank's response
to that request.
3.    The project was appraised in 1986 and negotiated in early 1987; the Loan Agreement was
signed on June 24, 1987. About five months later an Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement
was signed to take into account a reorganization of the water supply and sewerage sector utilities,
whereby the responsibility for carrying out the project was transferred to the national water
supply and sewerage organization (Agence Nationale de / 'Eau Potable, AGEP).
Project objectives and design
4.    The project objectives defined in the Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement, signed
on December 4, 1987, were as follows:
(a) increase water production through development of new water sources to meet present
demand and future requirements in the areas served by the water companies;
(b) expand the distribution networks of the water companies;
(c) increase the waste water treatment capacity of several water companies to protect the



2
Borrower's water resources and environment;
(d) financially strengthen AGEP and the water companies; and
(e) improve the efficiency of the Borrower's construction industry in the water supply and
sewerage sector.
5.    The project included the following physical components:
(a) four regional water supply subprojects, including water productioni, treatment, and
transmission works:
* Ain Dalia - Souk Ahras - Ouenza Subproject. A multipurpose dam on Oued
Medjerda near the Tunisian border was under construction at the time of
appraisal to serve the cities of Souk Ahras, Ouenza and El Aouinet and some
minor towns located in the Guelma and Tebessa provinces. The dam, along
with a treatment plant to be constructed under this component, was expected
to raise total production capacity from 7,100 m3 /day to 119,000 m 3/day --
enough to satisfy demand in those cities and the northern region of Tebessa
province until 2010;
X In Am2uel - Tamanrasset Subproiect. This subproject vvas designed to
alleviate the severe water shortage in the city of Tamanrasset, in the Sahara
Desert, by pumping water from a wellfield that was the city's closest
available water source, 131 kms away. This subproject was expected to
increase production from 700 m3/day to 5,900 m3/day, sufficient to meet
demand until the year 2000;
*  Ain Skhouna - Saida Subproject. This subproject was similar to the one
above. A wellfield at Ain Skhouna, 106 km from Saida, was planned to raise
production capacity from 12,500m3/day to 47,000 m3/day and satisfy demand
until 1997;
*  Mexenna - Annaba Subproiect. This subproject was intended to serve the
counties of Annaba and Drean. The Mexenna Dam on Oued El Kebir was
under construction at the time of appraisal; water from the reservoir formed
by this dam was to be treated in two newly constructed water treatment plants
with a combined capacity of 1.5m3/s. Water production was expected to
increase from 85,000 m3/day to 216,000 m3/day, to meet demand until 1995;
(b) three Sewage Treatment Works (STW) subprojects:
* Tlemcen STW Subproiect. This subproject was designed to treat the waste
water from Tlemcen, a city of 110,000 inhabitants, and discharge its effluent
into the Oued Chabet El Horrah, a tributary of the Oued Tafna, which is an
important raw water source for the city of Oran. The treatment works were to
have a capacity of 30,000 m3/day, sufficient to meet the need tntil 2005;



3
*  Maghnia STW Subproject. This subproject was designed to treat the sewage
from the 55,000 inhabitants of the city of Maghnia, through construction of
treatment works with a capacity of 14,500 m3/day, sufficient to meet
treatment needs until 1989. A second phase, not part of this project, was
scheduled to begin in 1989;
* Setif STW Subproject. This subproject involved construction of treatment
works for Setif, a city of 177,000 inhabitants. The works were to discharge
the effluent into the Oued Bou Sellam, which had already been dammed 25
km downstream to provide raw water for the city of Setif and the surrounding
region. The works had a planned capacity of 44,000 m3/day, sufficient to
meet treatment needs until 1990.
(c) construction of water production and treatment facilities and installations, and
expansion of the distribution networks of all thirteen regional water utilities through the
provision of some 1,500 km of new water supply networks, representing about 63,000
tons of ductile iron pipes and fittings;
(d) training of managers from AGEP and the thirteen regional companies in the
management of water and sewerage installations;
(e) a study of the construction industry in the water supply and sewerage sector;
(f) studies of four potential water transfer systems for the northern areas of Algeria:
*  from the Taksebt Dam to Algiers and Tizi Ouzou;
*  from the Oued Cheliff to Mostaganem and Oran;
*  from the Beni Haroun Dam to Mila, Constantine, and Batna; and
*  from the Koudiat Affren Dam to Bouria.
(g) development and implementation of organizational, managerial and financial
structures for water companies.
Evaluation of project objectives and risks
6.    The project was judged at appraisal to be well conceived from a technical standpoint,
with the exception of the controversial decision (taken jointly by the Bank and the Borrower) to
have civil works carried out by national contractors. This assessment turned out to be overly
optimistic. The project was too broad and ambitious considering the adverse socioeconomic
climate in Algeria, the institutional and managerial inadequacies, and the degree of resistance
to reform. Another problem was that no key development outcomes were set for the project's
institutional objectives. In addition, the experience gatheredfrom three previous Algeria water
supply loans, Loan 1545-AL, Loan 2461-AL, and Loan 2591-AL, was not adequately taken
into account in formulating the project. Although the lessons leamed from these projects were
not put into formal reports until after 2821-AL had started, the difficulties encountered were well
known and could have been incorporated into the project design. In particular:
*  as noted in the Project Performance Audit Report dated June 21, 1990 for the Bank's



4
first project in the Algeria water sector, 1545-AL, the Algerian Government lacked
the will to implement necessary restructuring of the sector and to increase cost
recovery. Also, the country lacked the sanitary engineers and other technical
personnel necessary to handle large and complex projects;
* as noted in the Project Completion Report for 2461-AL dated June 14, 1995, the
water sector was characterized by weak institutional linkages and there was a bias
against investment in maintenance, and reluctance to rely on external assistance.
Bank supervision missions for 2461-Al were unable to convince authorities at the
ministerial and enterprise levels that carrying out maintenance, leak detection and
repair was as important as investing in new water works;
* a project should not be designed on the basis of project summaries; the details of
project design and the bidding documents should be available at the time of appraisal.
In addition, to avoid coordination problems between the civil works contractor and
the supplier of equipment, contracts for civil works and the related supply of
equipment should be awarded to a single contractor responsible for implementation of
the entire works.
Loan amendments
7.   In addition to the Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement of 1987, several other loan
amendments were agreed upon during project implementation to reallocate loan funds and to
take account of organizational changes in the water supply and sewerage sector, of which the
most important was the Amendment of February 1993, which took several years to implement.
8.    The amended project included the following additional components: (a) organizational
studies, earlier launched in April 1990; (b) a national survey of the water sector; (c) additional
supplies, operational equipment and water supply infrastructure projects, compensating for the
elimination of the controversial Ain Dalia-Souk Ahras-Ouenza subproject; and (d) additional
water transfer studies, technical assistance, and training.
Implementation record
9.    From the beginning, project implementation was undermined by the failure to proceed
with the civil works as planned, and by the weak institutional capacity of the Borrower to carry
out procurement according to the Bank's procurement guidelines. This weak institutional
capacity resulted in the preparation of incomplete bidding documents, unsatisfactory evaluation
reports, and sometimes misprocurement of goods under reserved procurement practices, which
did not involve open bidding and therefore could not be monitored. The largest misprocurement
was related to the supply of water meters, where the contract was awarded to a local company at
about US$ 10 million, when the lowest qualified bidder offered about US$4 million.
10.   These weak procedures caused unacceptable procurement delays and generated extensive
correspondence between the Borrower and the Bank to allow for appropriate review of the
procurement process. The loan amendment of February 1993 included an increase of US$11
million for the civil works component, but this amount was never disbursed because the



5
Borrower preferred to have the civil works built by local contractors not subject to the Bank's
competitive bidding procedures. However, the local contractors did not complete the civil works,
resulting in costly treatnent equipment that was delivered to the construction site not being
installed for several years. One exception to the above was the timely procurement of about
1500 km of steel pipes by the national steel company, SIDER. The procurement division of this
company prepared satisfactory bid and evaluation documents and played a proactive role in
obtaining no objections to proposed contracts from the Bank.
11.   Although the original loan agreement included US$ 3 million for construction
supervision, no consulting engineers were financed under this component. This was not the case
for the training and study component, where the original loan amount of US$ 6 million was
increased to US$ 27 million ( reduced to US$ 18.6 million by amendment of July 95) to finance
studies related to organizational, water supply and water transfer studies needed to improve water
supply sector performance. Only about US$ 13 million had been disbursed for this component.
The reports prepared by the consultants charged with the organizational studies, which carried
out their study in a satisfactory manner, are available on file. It is remarkable that no other
reports are available on file at the Bank on the output of consultants in other assignments
financed under the loan. As with the procurement of works and goods, the selection and
supervision of consultants was not carried out diligently. Repeatedly the Borrower prepared
shortlists of more than six consulting firms, often causing a low number of proposals, although
the Bank's guidelines strongly recommend a maximum of six firms. In many cases the Borrower
did not prepare a Letter of Invitation (LOI) but prepared documents based on the Bank's Sample
Bidding Documents for Goods. According to information received from the Borrower, some of
the studies financed under Loan 2821-AL experienced excessive delays, as demonstrated by a list
of studies contracted in the period 1990-1994 that were expected to be completed after loan
closing in 1997.
12.   The construction industry in the water supply sector consisted of seventeen specialized
firms that built dams, treatment plants, pipelines, etc. Construction costs for these firms were
higher than those of international companies and implementation periods were longer. Because
(a) the construction industry was weak in all sectors; and (b) the Borrower had delayed the
selection of consultants for the original study, the Bank and the Borrower agreed to carry out a
construction industry study for all sectors. The loan was accordingly amended in June 1989.
13.   The aim of the National Construction Industry Study was to determine the availability of
management personnel, technical staff, labor, materials, equipment, housing and other facilities;
review regulations, practices, and procedures affecting the industry in order to identify
constraints in its operations; and to compare the performance of foreign firms operating in
Algeria with that of the local firms. This study was never carried out. Part of the planned
technical assistance dealing with the sector survey was not implemented, and the training
component of the loan also was not fully carried out.
14.   Financial reporting was weak and only in March 1993 did the Bank receive the first audit
and financial reports from most of the participating water companies covering financial exercises
since fiscal year 1990. Since then only the Annaba and Oran Utilities have submitted their
reports on a regular basis. Project account audits are up to date. Because the Bank did not define
any performance indicators, no technical reports of the project's performance were submitted by
the Borrower.



6
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
15.   Project implementation started in mid 1987 and was expected to be completed by end
1993. At the request of the Government of Algeria, all civil works including pipe laying were to
have been carried out by national contractors and were therefore excluded from Bank financing.
The project as originally designed and as amended did not achieve its stated objectives.
Implementation was undermined by: (a) weak institutional setup, with an overly centralized role
for AGEP and lack of capacity for operation and maintenance of Bank-financed infrastructure;
(b) the security situation in Algeria, which limited Bank supervision; (c) the Government's
refusal to increase tariffs after the 1987 tariff study, in contravention of the loan conditions'
(such an increase was necessary to achieve financial viability of the water companies); (d) the
Government's failure to comply with resettlement covenants and to reach an agreement with
Tunisia on the Ain Dalia-Souk Ahras-Ouenza project; (e) excessive implementation delays
caused by inadequate procurement; (f) excessive delays in carrying out civil works by national
contractors; (g) excessive delays in completing studies; (h) failure to launch the training
program; and (i) repeated reorganization to address the general weaknesses of the water supply
and sewerage sector and its operators, which were identified during project implementation.
16.   Because of the security situation in Algeria it has not been possible to verify in the field
whether implementation of the civil works and the laying of pipes were completed to allow the
timely installation of treatment equipment and supplied pipes. In the absence of progress reports
from the Borrower on the implementation of project components, the achievement of the
physical objectives of the project is therefore not known.
C. Project Sustainability
17.   The Government's massive effort to build water supply and sewerage facilities to meet
increasing demand can only be sustainable if proper operation and maintenance is ensured.
Project sustainability is seriously threatened by the lack of proper operation and maintenance as
well as the weak institutional structure of the urban water supply sector. Although the ongoing
Loan 3743-AL aims at institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of water and sewerage
utilities, the Bank should intensify its dialogue with the Govermnent by advising on steps to be
taken to dramatically improve the operation and maintenance of the water and sewerage sector
infrastructure and most likely to eventually restructure tariffs and privatize operation and
maintenance.
D. Bank Performance
18.   The Bank's role in assisting the Algerian water sector to strengthen its capacity for
project planning, implementation and operation is unsatisfactory. Although all previous Bank
loans to the sector, as well as Loan 2821-AL, aimed at reinforcing the water supply and sewerage
sector's performance by  assisting  the Algerian  Government in implementing  needed
infrastructure investments and organizational restructuring of the sector's institutions, it seems
that the benefits of such assistance did not materialize. The Bank did not explicitly require, as a
' Tariffs were increased in 1994, too late to affect the project. Potable water tariffs were increased at that time from
DA I to DA 3.60 per cubic meter.. In 1 996,The Goverment conducted a study which determined the necessity of
implementing a regional tariff structure.



7
condition for lending, any reform of sector organizations or the granting of more autonomy to
sector institutions to enable them to provide better consumer services. Therefore, proposed
reforms were not fully followed up or not implemented at all. In particular, policies on cost
recovery were only partially implemented after considerable delays. According to the project
files, the Bank did not pay appropriate attention to the need for training managerial and
operational staff in the water and sewerage sector. The delays which held up the implementation
process, the amendmeints to the loan agreement, the subsequent changes and cancellation of some
components (water meters) and the inability to monitor the project on the field simply confirm
the unsatisfactory quality of the Bank's performance in its supervision function. Supervision
was undermined by poor project design which lacked the essential perfornance indicators
needed for effective monitoring.  It also is clear that the deteriorating security situation
contributed to weakening the Bank's performance in carrying out its fiduciary obligations.
E. Borrower Performance
19.   From 1970 to 1997, Algeria invested about US$ 20 billion in developing the water supply
and sewerage sector. Although this huge effort resulted in a satisfactory mobilization of water
resources from construction of impounding dams and large water transfer schemes, the
maintenance and operation of the water distribution and sewerage facilities were weak, leading to
a deterioration of consumer services. The high degree of centralization in operating the sector,
the lack of financial resources and shortage of qualified personnel contributed to lack of
reporting on the progress of works, and to excessive delays in the implementation of works and
studies. The water enterprises lacked the capacity to translate into operational terms what they
needed to do to achieve project objectives. These enterprises were unable to generate the
necessary cash to cover their operations and maintenance; their internal self-financing ratio was
well below the covenanted 15 percent, and tariff increases (in 1994) were not adequate to cover
the internal cash generation objectives. There are no records on the supervision of the works
carried out by AGEP and the water companies.
F. Future Operations
20.   Future operations in the sector require the implementation of a regional tariff policy (as
outlined by the project tariff study). Such a policy is a necessary step for reaching the objectives
of operational efficiency of the water enterprises. Furthermore, a sectoral institutional reform and
a strengthening of the managerial capacities of water enterprises are needed before the physical
components can be used effectively. Large-scale urban water supply projects, such as Gargar-
Oran (the country's seventh water sector project), which was appraised by the Bank in FY 1997,
require an enabling institutional environment in order to be successful.  In fact, further
processing of that project has been suspended, however, pending the Borrower's compliance
with conditionalities of the ongoing project (Loan 3743-AL). Gargar-Oran would include mainly
the construction of a 200 km transmission pipeline with related pumping and treatment facilities,
to convey water from the existing Gargar dam to the city of Oran. In addition, the project would
aim at a further restructuring of the water supply and sewerage sector being carried out under the
current Loan 3743-AL; that loan introduced a leasing system under which the water utilities were
reorganized as public water companies, and were supposed to pay leasing fees for utilization of
state-owned facilities. Until now no satisfactory progress has been made by the Algerian
Government in applying the agreed-upon restructuring measures or in granting the water
companies increased autonomy.

21.   In light of the outcome of this Implementation Completion Report, it is recommended
that there be an in-depth review of the institutional and legal framework needed for integrated,
systematic management and use of water resources. Before providing additional assistance in the
water supply and sewerage sector, the Bank and the Algerian Government should explicitly agree
on a national urban water sector strategy aiming at self reliance of the sector and improved
operation and maintenance of existing and new facilities.
G. Lessons Learned
22.   The outcome of this project suggests that the design was flawed from the beginning (in
view of the changes that occurred during implementation). The components were too large and
complex, and too difficult to implement and manage given the institutional capacity in the
country. In addition, Algeria's attempts at sector reform lacked political will at the time of
project implementation. In the future, necessary sector reforms should be in place before
projects are approved and implemented.
23.   Urban water supply projects should not be supported by the Bank without proper
commitment of the Borrower to carry out their objectives within a clear strategic framework for
sector development. Therefore, future lending in the sector should be directly linked to the
implementation performance of ongoing projects.
24.   Although the original project concept was to finance a three-year slice of Algeria's five-
year sector investment program, the Bank decided to reduce the risk by making the loan on the
basis of individually appraised projects, and therefore identified and appraised the individual
water companies and their proposed projects. Although this reduced the risk of unexpected
delays caused by inadequate project preparation, it did not address the need for appropriate
project management by experienced technical staff.
25.   The Bank should not have accepted reserved procurement for the civil works. The
weakness of the construction industry identified during appraisal was reflected in the slow
implementation of civil works. In particular, to avoid coordination problems between the civil
works contractor and the equipment supplier, contracts for water and wastewater plants should
normally be awarded to a single source (single contractor or joint venture of contractor and
supplier).  If this is not possible, the Borrower should be assisted by qualified consultants to
coordinate the operations of civil works and equipment, and to carry out construction and
installation design. Project implementation was seriously hampered by poor procurement
procedures and by lack of coordination between the supply of equipment and construction of
civil works.
26.   The Bank should be proactive in problem solving as part of its supervision, and should
mobilize teams with a high level of expertise and experience to assist the Borrower with difficult
issues. When appropriate, these issues should receive active input from Bank management. The
availability of such resources and commitment by the Bank will help the Borrower to achieve
much-needed success in projects in this sector.
27.   The Bank should not lend to national water agencies with weak project management
capacity, without insisting on the creation of a Project Implementation Unit with experienced
staff, assisted if needed by consultants. To increase ownership, whenever possible the Bank

should lend directly to beneficiary water companies, which should be held accountable for
project implementation.
28.   The Bank should insist on appropriate project performance indicators related to
implementation and sustainability to ensure effective project monitoring and evaluation.
29.   The Bank should provide assistance in project management and procurement to
Borrowers lacking experience and insist on appropriate reporting on project implementation.

2. CONTEXTE GEOGRAPHIQUE, ECONOMIQUE ET SOCIAL DU PROJET
2.1. Situation g6ographique et climatique
L'Algerie couvre une superficie de 2 381 741 km2 dont 90% correspond au desert du
Sahara ou les precipitations peuvent etre consid6r6es comme nulles. Seule la partie
au nord de l'atlas d'une superficie de 224 929 km2 dispose de ressources en eau
renouvelables. Dans cette partie du pays les precipitations sont caract6ristiques des
climats mediterraneens. A cause de son extension en latitude, l'Algerie est expos6e
. plusieurs zones climatiques dont la pluviometrie varie entre 100 et 1000 mm. La
saison des pluies s'etale d'octobre a mai. La moyenne des pr6cipitations y est de
l'ordre de 400mm par an sur les bassins c6tiers. Les precipitations sont
decroissantes d'est en ouest (de 540 mm dans le bassin du Constantinois-Medjerda -
Mellegue a 310 mm dans le bassin Oran-Chott chergui). Les cours d'eau (oueds.)
sont de type torrentiel, presque toujours secs. Ils charrient beaucoup de matieres
solides.
2.2. Ressources en eau
Le total annuel des 6coulements superficiels dans le Nord de l'Algerie est evalue a
12,4 milliards de metres cubes. On estime qu'un peu moins de 50% de ce volume
peut etre mobilise dans les conditions techniques et economiques actuelles. Les
eaux souterraines du Nord sont evaluees a 1,8 milliards de m3. Le volume total
annuel d eau disponible dans le Nord du pays est de 7,4 milliards de metres cubes,
en moyenne annuelle . en plus on estime a 5 milliards de metres cubes, les
ressources exploitables du Sahara (selon l'hypothese d'exploitation la plus
optimiste), ce qui donne un total de 12,4 milliards de metres cubes. Cependant, ce
volume n'est pas reparti uniformement sur le territoire par rapport a la distribution
g6ogrz;hique de la population.
La disponibilite de la ressource en eau est particulierement critique dans l'Ouest du
pays, ou elle n'est que de 185 m3 par habitant et par an, alors qu'elle est de 575
metres cubes pour la moyenne nationale.



5
L'6tat des ressources imposent les contraintes suivantes sur le secteur de l'eau:
1. coOt eleve de mobilisation impose par l'irregularite des apports et leur qualite
mediocre,
2. coOt eleve des transports d'eau important impose par la distorsion existante entre
la repartition des ressources et celui de la population et des activites,
3. demande de quantites supplementaires induites par la croissance economique et
celles du niveau de vie. Ce defi est d'autant plus difficile a realiser que le coot
marginal de l'eau est de plus en plus eleve du fait de l'accroissement rapide de la
population qui est estimee a 3% par an; suivant le recensement de 1987,on
denombre 3.488 agglomerations dont 447 agglomerations urbaines de plus de 5
000 habitants. Le taux d'urbanisation est 58,9%. La contrainte demographique
pese sur le secteur de l'eau dans quatre directions,
* elle impose un taux de d6veloppement au moins equivalent des ressources en
eau et des equipements pour maintenir le niveau de service,
* le taux d'urbanisation de plus en plus fort,  accroit la pression sur les
ressources et les equipements en place et necessite des extensions dans les
systemes de mobilisation et de distribution,
* le nombre considerable d'agglomerations impose une tres grande dispersion
dans les systemes techniques et les coOts,
* Ia necessite de mobiliser des ressources de plus en plus cooteuses compte
tenu de ce que les ressources (< faciles >> ont bte deja mobilisees dans le pass6,
* I'accroissement du coOt marginal de mobilisation de transport et de traitement
de nouvelles ressources requiert des besoins de financement du secteur de
plus en plus importants.
2.3.Alimentation en eau potable et Assainissement
Les investissements consentis par l1'tat avaient fait porter le taux de raccordement
aux reseaux de distribution de l'eau potable, de 60 % a 80 % entre 1976 et 1985.
Malgre ces resultats, le niveau de service demeurait mediocre. Cette situation
recouvrait des realites tres diverses et la dotation par habitant variait de 22 litres par
jour et par habitant a 286 litres par jour et par habitant selon les localites.
A la fin des ann6es 70, il y avait peu d'amelioration en matiere d'approvisionnement
en eau potable et d'assainissement des eaux usees dans les zones urbaines. II y
avait une penurie chronique d'eau potable dans les grand centres urbains et les
agglomerations de taille moyenne. Dans ces zones, il 6tait rare que les besoins
soient satisfaits a plus des deux tiers.
Environ 80 % de la population urbaine etait connectee a un reseau d'assainisserment
qui servait 6galement pour l'vacuation des eaux d'orages. Les eaux etaient
d6vers6es sans traitement dans les oueds (rivieres) et dans la Mediterranee.
Dans les agglom6rations rurales, les taux de raccordement a un reseau d'eau
potable et a un reseau d'assainissement etaient respectivement de 70% et 60%.
Les taux de raccordement des populations rurales etaient de 40 % pour l'eau potable
et de 25 % pour l'assainissement.

2.4 Cadre juridique et institutionnel
La p6riode durant laquelle a et6 prepare le deuxieme projet national d'AEP et
d'assainissement objet du pret 2821 AL a ete marquee par l'instabilit6 de 1'economie
algerienne liee a une baisse drastique des revenus generes par le secteur des
hydrocarbures pourvoyeur traditionnel pour le financement des  projets de
d6veloppement finances par des credits definitifs du budget de 1'btat. C'est dans ce
contexte que le projet a bt6 con,u pour financer la partie payable en devises du
programme de developpement du secteur de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement
L'organisation institutionnelle du d6veloppement et de 1'exploitation du secteur de
1Ieau potable en Algerie a connu un bouleversement important depuis, 1970 dans
deux directions:
Financement:
Le financement etait a l'independance assur6 sur des ressources locales (emprunts
+ tarifs + subventions communales). Compte tenu de l'insuffisance des ressources
degagees par le secteur et des besoins consid6rables de financement induits par le
d6veloppement economique et 1'explosion d6mographique, des financements en
concours d6finitif du budget de l'etat ont remplac6 le financement local. Les
equipements finances ainsi sont realises par les directions de Wilaya de I'hydraulique
(dependant du ministere de l'6quipement) et les agences centrales du rninistere de
l1'quipement .
Exploitation et gestion des infrastructures:
L'exploitation  des infrastructures qui etait assuree  par les communes par
l'interm6diaire des services communaux, des regies communales autonomes, des
syndicats intercommunaux et quelquefois des concessionnaires priv6s, a 6te une
premiere fois theoriquement confiee en 1970 a la societe nationale de distribution
d'eau Potable et Industrielle (SONADE). L'action de prise en charge de Ia gestion de
1'eau potable et industrielle de cette societ6 a ete un echec. Sa gestion a consiste a
exploiter seulement les ressources des barrages de BMni Bahdel (Oran ) et Cheffia
Donnees estimees a partir de 8 entreprises de distribution d'eau reprdsentant 90% des ventes d'eau



7
(Annaba) qui dependaient du ministere de I'hydraulique. La totalite des reseaux de
distribution est restee entre les mains des municipalites qui etaient sous la tutelle du
ministbre de l'interieur.
En 1983 une reorganisation de l'exploitation de 1'eau potable a abouti a la creation de
13 entreprises r6gionales avec le statut de societes nationales disposant a l'image de
la SONADE d'une tres large autonomie financiere. Ces entreprises ont tres vite
r6ussi a prendre en charge de maniere effective les reseaux de plus de 600 centres
urbains constituant plus de 75 % de l'eau distribuee dans le pays.
En 1987, dans un souci de deconcentration une reorganisation a ete mise en ceuvre.
Quatre entreprises regionales ont 6te dissoutes et leur activites transferes a des
entreprises de Wilaya . La taille des 9 autres entreprises a 6t6 r6duite. Cette
reorganisation a donne naissance a 26 entreprises de wilaya.
Les criteres qui ont preside au d6coupage territorial des entreprises sont les
suivants:
1. maintien dans une meme entreprise regionale de la gestion de (a distribution d'eau
quand deux wilayas ou plus sont interdependantes pour une ressource en eau ou
des infrastructures communes,
2. decentralisation vers les autorites locales de l'activite d'exploitation et de gestion
de 1'eau potable et de l'assainissement.
Pour l'assainissement, la gestion de la quasi totalite des infrastructures est rest6e a
la charge des services communaux . Cette gestion etait caracterisee par une
insuffisance chronique de fonds pour le fonctionnement des r6seaux
d'assainissement et des stations d'epuration. Les lois de finances pour 1993 et 1994
ont instaure une taxe d'assainissement de 20% sur le tarif de l'eau potable et
industrielle pour le financement des activit6s d'assainissement et d'epuration des
eaux us6es.
En d6finitive la gestion de la distribution d'eau est assur6e de la maniere suivante:
Nature des operateurs                          Nombre         Proportion de
1'eau potable
distribuee en
% du totale
Entreprises r6gionales a statut d'EPIC ( EPE)               9            54
Entreprises de wilaya a statut d'EPIC ( EPEDEMIA)          26            28
Regies ou services communaux                              980            18
11 faut noter que sur le plan juridique les activites de distribution de l'eau potable et
de I'assainissement releve de la responsabilit6 administrative et politique de la
commune. Le code communal en vigueur depuis 1990 a confirme ce fait, aussi, au
moins theoriquement; quel que soit l'op6rateurs exploitant (EPE ou EPEDEMIA), il
est concessionnaire de la gestion d'un service public relevant de la commune.

2.5. Actions de la Banque dans le secteur de 1eau potable et de
I'assainissement en Algdrie
La Banque Internationale pour ia Reconstruction et le Developpement (BIRD) a
accompagne l'Algerie, dans ses efforts d'investissement dans le domaine de 1'eau
potable et de l'assainissement., depuis 1978. Les investissements consentis depuis
1970 dans ce secteur sont estimes a 17 milliards de $US. Sur ce montant, la part du
financement de la banque a et6 la suivante:

secteur de 1'eau potable et de l'assainissement au titre des programmes centralises
et decentralises.
En plus du financement qu'elle assure aux differents programmes, la banque a tente
d'apporter son experience pour aider a l'efficacite du secteur de l'eau potable et de
l'assainissement dans les domaines suivants:
1. ameliorer la planification, le suivi et l'encadrement des projets,
2. accroitre les performances des entreprises de gestion du secteur de l'eau et de
l'assainissement,
3. generer des ressources d'autofinancement
3 OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
3. 1.Les objectifs 6conomiques et operationnels du projet
L'objectif du projet etait, au moment de l'evaluation, la participation a ia realisation du
programme et des projets retenus par le plan quinquennal 1985-89 decides par les
autorites algeriennes.
Les investissements a realiser durant le 2Ame   plan  quinquennal visaient
l'augmentation de l'approvisionnement en eau potable et la dotation des grandes
villes et localites de taille moyenne et petite en reseaux d'assainissement et
installations d'epuration des eaux usees. Le Ministbre de l'Equipement a retenu les
projets en fonction des besoins les plus pressants resultant de la forte croissance
d6mographique ainsi que du vieillissement et de l'etat de d6gradation des r6seaux
existants. Les stations d'epuration ont ete retenues pour la protection des ressources
en eau contre la pollution afin de reduire les risques sanitaires dans des zones ou les
oueds constituent une importante source d'eau pour l'agriculture et les plus grandes
agglomerations. Selon 1'evaluation de la BIRD, les solutions retenues par le plan
representent le meilleur rapport couts-avantages pour satisfaire les besoins en eau
potable et d'epuration des eaux us6es dans les regions concernees.
L'objectif du projet est le soutien aux autorites alg6riennes dans l'ex6cution du plan
de developpement quinquennal du secteur de l'hydraulique et de son programme
d'investissement dans le secteur de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement. Ce projet
permet notamment de:
1. etendre et ameliorer l'approvisionnement en eau potable, particulierement dans
les localites pour lesquels la production d'eau sera augmentee dans le cadre de la
realisation du projet,
2. realiser des installations d'epuration des eaux usees pour des villes qui rejettent
leurs eaux usees dans les oueds qui representent une importante ressource en
eau brute pour les besoins d'irrigation et d'eau potable,
3. soutenir la politique sectorielle des autorites tendant au recouvrement de
1'ensemble des couts permettant la viabilite des activit6s d'exploitation et
d'investissement du secteur ainsi que la mise en place de procedures de gestion
financiere et comptable adaptee pour les entreprises regionales d'eau potable et
d'assainissement

4. ameliorer les capacites de realisation du Ministere de l'Equipement et de I'AGEP,
5. etudier et definir les mesures permettant de renforcer le secteur de la construction
dans les domaines de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement,
6. etudier les projets de transfert d'eau identifies dans le schema directeur
d'approvisionnement en eau de l'Algerie du nord,
7. former les personnels du Ministbre de I'Equipement et des entreprises regionales
de distribution de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement en relation avec
l'Organisation Internationale du Travail.

TARIFICATION
Le tarif qui constitue l'element essentiel du revenu des entreprises de l'eau (EPE et
EPEDEMIA) est fix6 par decret. II n'a pas suivi le rythme de l'inflation int6rieure qui
s'est maintenu a un niveau eleve pendant toute la periode d'execution du projet
Le prix de l'unite de base qui etait de 1 dinar aurait et6 de 6.62 Dinars s'il avait ete
indexe sur l'evolution des prix a la consommation, alors que l'unite de base n'est
facturee qu'a 3,60 Dinars. Une structure nouvelle de coefficients a ete introduite en
juillet 1996. Cette structure penalise les tranches superieures de consommation et
devrait en principe faire augmenter le tarif moyen en vigueur en juin 1996 de 50%,
alors que l'unite de base n'augmente que de 20 %.
L'estimation du tarif  moyen  a ete etablie sur ia base de la structure de
consommation etudiee par le Ministere de l'Equipement a l'occasion de I'ajustement
du tarif decide en 1993 et qui est la suivante:

Si on considere la structure des ventes d'eau prec6dente le tarif moyen en vigueur
en juillet est 11,85 DA par m3. , alors qu'il aurait ete de 21,79 si le tarif de 1'eau avait
ete indexe sur linflation des prix.

5.EXECUTION DES PROJETS
5.1.Partie A Production d'eau
I . Construction des ouvrages et installations de production et de traitement d'eau,
destines a l'utilisation des ressources en eau mobilisees par le barrage de Ain
Dalia sur l'oued Medjerda au profit des villes de Souk Ahras, Ouenza, El Aouinet,
ainsi que d'autres localites des Wilaya de Gueima et Tebessa. Ce projet portera la
capacite de production et de traitement d'eau de 7 100 m3 a 119 400 m3 par jour
ce qui permettra la satisfaction de la demande en eau potable des villes
concern6es a l'horizon 2010
Le financement de ce projet sur les ressources du pret 2821 AL a ete abandonne
pour des raisons juridiques. Le projet a ete realise avec des financements fournis par
d'autres bailleurs en deux phases, une phase provisoire qui a permis de rendre
disponible pour la ville de Souk Ahras une ressource de 7 000 m3 par jour en 1989
et la phase definitive mise en service en 1995 qui permet l'alimentation des localites
retenues
Une troisieme phase a ete lancee. Elle est destin6e a l'extension du projet pour
l'alimentation des villes de Oum El Bouaghi, Sedrata, Ain Beida, Berriche et ain
Babouche. Elle apportera a ces localites un volume supplementaire d'eau potable de
34 500 m3 par jour. Elle necessite ia pose de 96 000 ml de conduites de diametres
compris entre 600 mm et 800 mm et la construction d'une station de montage.
Ce projet a te , en partie financee sur les ressources du pret pour l'acquisition des
conduites en fontes, des pieces speciales en fonte et des 6quipements electriques et
electromecaniques pour un montant total de 21 381 329,53 $ US. Cette partie du
projet dont la r6alisation se poursuit avec un financement local sera mise en service
en juin 1998.

En plus du grand retard enregistre les couts exprimes en dinars representent 645%
par rapport aux couts pre vus cet ecart resulte des devaluations massives qu'6 connu
le Dinar pendant la periode de realisation du projet. Les couts exprimes en $ US sont
de 8,9% superieur au budget total retenu mais les d6penses en devises etrangeres
n'ont ete que de 27% du budget. ll faut noter qu'en plus des villes initialement retenu
le projet permettra d'alimenter egalement cinq villes des wilaya de Souk Ahras et
Oum El Bouaghi.
Pour la conversion des monnaies nous tenons compte du taux historique du dinar par rapport au dollar US.

2.Construction d'installations de production, de reservoirs de service, de stations de
pompage et des installations d'adduction des eaux souterraines du champ de puits
de In Amguel. Ce projet permettra de porter la production d'eau de 700 m3 a 5900
m3 par jour destin6e 6 la avile de Tamanrasset.
La realisation du projet a ete confihe a l'entreprise locale Hydro-Traitement la
maitrise d'oeuvre au bureau d'etude local ENEP. La fourniture des equipements
electromecaniques des forages et des stations de pompage a ete confiee a
l'entreprise allemande BABCOCK La coordination des travaux et la maitrise
d'ouvrage ont 6t6 assures par I'AGEP en relation avec ia Direction de ['Hydraulique
de la Wilaya de Tamanrasset. La dur6e de realisation contractuelle etait de 24 mois.
Le projet a ete achev6 a 100 % en 1991 avec un an de retard.

Le cout final du projet exprim6 en dollars a ete superieur de 26.6 % au cout pr6vu,
alors que les depenses en monnaie locale ont ete de presque cinq fois superieure au
budget prevu. Cela resulte d'une part de I'acquisition de la canalisation des conduites
en acier sur le marche local et d'autre part de la d6valuation du dinar.
3 Construction d'installations de production, de r6servoirs de service de stations de

pour la ville de Saida de 12 500 m3 a 47 000 m3 par jour permettant ainsi la
satisfaction de la demande a Ihorizon 1997.
La construc-tion du projet est en cours. L'avancement des travaux est estim6 a 50 %.
Le projet sera probablement mis en service au 2eme trimestre 1999.

5.2.Partie B Epuration des Eaux usees
I . Construction d'une station d'6puration des eaux usees d'une capacit6 d'environ
30.000 m3/jour a Tlemcen (110 000 habitants). Cette ville rejette ses eaux usees
en amont de la prise d'eau de la Tafna qui represente une importante ressourcs
pour l'alimentation en eau potable de la ville d'Oran. La capacite pr6vu e,:
suffisante pour la satisfaction des besoins d'6puration a I'horizon -I05.

La realisation du genie civil de cette station d'epuration a subi un enorme retard a
cause des problemes juridiques et techniques lies au terrain d'assiette initialement
choisi. Au 31112/96, la construction se trouve au niveau du terrassement alors que
les 6quipement ont ete livres en 1991 par l'entreprise belge SEE. Ce retard ne
manquera pas de produire des contentieux avec les entrepreneurs et les
fournisseurs ainsi que des surcoGts resultant des avaries des equipements
approvisionnes et stock6s.
Ce retard a ete egalement caus6 par le choix inadequat de l'entreprise locale pour la
realisation du g6nie civil SEROR dont le contrat a ete resilii en 1995. Les travaux
ont ete confi6s a l'entreprise locale Hydro-Traitement. La mise en service de la
station d'epuration est pr6vue pour le deuxieme semestre 1999.

Chabet El Horrah. Cet oued est un affluent de l'oued Tafna qui repr6sente une
important ressource en eau potable pour la ville d'Oran. Le projet retenu permettra
de satisfaire les besoins en 6puration de la ville de Maghnia jusqu', lhorizon 1989, la
construction d'une seconde phase du projet est programmee pour demarrer en 1990.

3 . Construction d'une station d'6puration des eaux us6es d'une capacit6 d'environ
44.000 m3/jour destine a l'epuration des eaux usees de la ville de Setif (177 000
habitants) qui rejette ses eaux usees dans l'oued Bou Sellam en amont du barrage
de Ain Zada. Ce dernier constitue la principale source d'approvisionnement en eau
potable pour les wilayas de Setif et de Bordj Bou Arririj. La capacite retenue est
suffisante pour les besoins d'6puration a I'horizon 1990. La construction d'une
deuxieme phase est prevue a partir de 1991
La construction du genie civil de ce projet a ete confiee a l'entreprise locale Hydro-
Traitement et la livraison des equipements electriques et electromecaniques a
l'entreprise beige SEE. Le projet mis en service en 1995 a ete realise avec un retard
de 2 ans par rapport au delai contractuel et de 5 ans par rapport a l'valuation initiale
du programme. C'est ainsi que les deux phases ont 6te realis6es en meme temps.
La capacite de traitement mise en place est de 330 000 habitants au lieu de 177 000
habitants retenus pour la premiere phase soit un accroissement de 86 %, ce qui
permettra de satisfaire les besoins en epuration de la ville de Setif a I'horizon 2010.
Le financement local prevoit la prise e charge de i'activite d'exploitation pour la dur6e
d'une ann6e a l'issue de laquelle il faut v6rifie que les ressources gen6rees par la
taxe d'assainissement de 20 % sur les factures d'eau potable distribuee dans la ville
de Setif sont suffisantes pour l'exploitation permanente du projet.

5.3.3.Compteurs et debitmetres
La systematisation du comptage pour une facturation au reel concretise l'objectif
permanent des autorites de lutter contre le gaspillage des ressources en eau
potable. Dans le cadre du projet et pour faire face aux besoins r6sultants des
extensions de reseaux, de branchement de nouveaux abonnes et de la rehabilitation
des reseaux existants, I'AGEP a procede a des consultations pour l'acquisition de
800 000 compteurs d'eau et d'appareils de mesure destinees aux Etablissements de
distribution de l'eau (EPE et EPEDEMIA).
AMC Algerie a ete retenu pour la fourniture de: 400 000 compteurs de 15 mm de
diametre + 11 300 pieces de rechange. 53 500 compteurs de 20 mm de diametre +
2650 pieces de rechange pour un montant de 10 millions de $US
L'accord de non objection de la banque a et6 notifie a l'AGEP le 24 Avril 1996 pour
les quantites initiales et le 17 juin 19996 pour les quantit6s supplementaires de 20 %.
Le marche qui a ete signe le 17/06/96 a commence a etre execute immediatement..
L'entreprise AMC a livre 280 000 compteurs.
Le 11 Septembre 1996 La banque a notifie a l'AGEP sa decision de ne plus financer
le montant du contrat avec l1entreprise AMC sur les ressources du pret en raison
"d'irr6gularitfs" dans 1'evaluation des offres des soumissionnaires.
Cette decision a abouti a la suspension de l'ex6cution du contrat et la creation d'un
contentieux avec l'entrepreneur que les entreprises de distribution d'eau n'ont pas pu
payer dans les delais en raison de l'absence d'une source de financement de
remplacement.
L'acquisition de ces compteurs a permis d'ameliorer sensiblement le niveau du
comptage par rapport a la facturation au forfait. En 1996 le taux de facturation par
comptage a atteint 74 %.
Le taux de conversion applique est de 22 Dinars = I$US, qui prevalait en 1992 Annee de rdception de la plus
grande partie des canalisations.

5 Formation
L'etude organisationnelle portant sur les entreprises de gestion de l'eau potable a
abouti en matiere de formation a un organigramme de la formation, une procedure
de s6lection et a un plan de formation pour 1'ensemble des professions.
Les axes prioritaires ont 6te, la professionnalisation, la polyvalence ainsi que le
management.
Les effectifs vises par le plan sont les suivants:

Cet effectif constitue pres de 37 % des effectifs en poste dans les entreprises de
gestion de l'eau potable en 1996.
Des actions se sont d6roul6es dans les institutions sp6cialis6s de formation
suivants:
1. L'ISGP pour la formation au management des cadres dirigeants des
entreprises,
2. Le CNAT pour la formation des agents de gestion commerciale, des
ressources humaines de gestion financiere,et de gestion des stocks.
3. Le CIEFAC (centre interentreprises de formation administrative et comptable)
pour la formation dans le domaine de la comptabilite.
Ces actions concernent 150 a 200 agents par an
Un projet de renforcement des capacit6s du secteur a ete conduit avec l'appui du
PNUD. II a permis de r6aliser les op6rations suivantes:
1. Fourniture d'equipements pedagogiques,
2. Formation des responsables techniques des EPE et de I'AGEP
3. Formation de formateurs.

6.PERENNITE DE L'EFFET DU PROGRAMME
6.1. Approvisionnement en eau potable
En depit de resultats encourageants en matiere de realisation et d'extension
d'infrastructures d'approvisionnement en eau potable, les insuffisances persistantes
sont inquietantes dans les domaines suivants:
1. Le niveau de service est tres m6diocre, pratiquement la totalite des
agglomerations ne re,oivent l'eau au robinet que pendant quelques heures.
Certaines localit6s connaissent des ruptures d'approvisionnement pouvant
d6passer une semaine.
2. Le niveau de l'eau non facturbe s'est d6grade durant la p6riode en d6pit de
l'6quipement des EPE et EPEDEMIA en mat6riel ade&uat (la proportion d'eau non
facturee est passee de 40 % en 1986 a 47 % en 1996
3. La maintenance est insuffisante, en raison notamment de la p6nurie de tr6sorerie
chronique au niveau des Entreprises ce qui menace la perennite des installations
et 6courte la duree de vie des infrastructures.
6.2. Assainissement et epuration des eaux usees
L'effet sur la sante de la  population,  la protection de lenvironnement et les
ressources en eau de ces efforts d'investissement et de rbalisation est limite par les
insuffisances suivantes:
1. La construction des r6seaux accrolt la pression des eaux usees non trait6es sur
les oueds, les nappes d'eau et le littoral.
2. La penurie de financement de l'activit6 d'assainissement en dbpit de l'instauration
d'une taxe d'assainissement de 20 % sur l'eau potable (difficile 2 recouvrer en
raison de la mauvaise situation financiere des entreprises de l'eau charg6e du
recouvrement de cette taxe aupres de leurs abonnes), ne permet pas un
rendement suffisant des infrastructures
3. L'absence de maintenance menace de d6gradation rapide les infrastructures
r6alis6es.
7. PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE
Le r6le de la banque a travers ses prets et particulierement le 2821 AL a 6tb
d'accompagner l'Alg6rie dans ses efforts d'organisation et d'investissement dans un
secteur dont l'impact economique et sociale est considerable. En plus de son apport
financier, la banque apporte son exp6rience accumule dans 1'ensemble des pays du
monde dans la gestion des services publics de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement.
Cependant dans le cadre de ce pret il faut signaler l'incident particulierement facheux
sur le financement du contrat d'acquisition des compteurs aupres de l'entreprise
locale AMC, qui a perturb6 le programme d'6radication de la facturation au forfait e:
5 En raison de l'absence de mnaitrise du comptage au niveau de la production et de la distribution par les
entreprise. il faut considerer ces estimations avec pr-.caubon.

cre6 un contentieux entre les entreprises d'exploitation et le fournisseur . Ce litige
vient d'etre r6gie sur le fonds de developpement des ressources en eau et le budget
de l'6tat
8.PERFORMANCE DES INSTITUTIONS CHARGEES DE L'EXECUTION DU
PROGRAMME
Les autorit6s du pays maintiennent une tres grande attention au secteur de l'eau
potable et de l'assainissement pour lequel, durant la p6riode d'ex6cution du
programme sectoriel, les effort de financement ont ete maintenus a un niveau eleve
malgre les tentions sur les paiements exterieurs et le budget.
Les insuffisances dans l'approvisionnement du marche local en materiaux de
construction ont e  a l'origine de retards tres importants dans l'ex6cution du
programme.
Pour ce qui concerne la r6alisation des 4 projets de transfert d'eau potable et des 3
projets d'assainissement , le retard consid6rable montre que la maturite des projets
n'6tait pas suffisante au moment de la programmation de leur r6alisation. De plus la
proc6dure de selection d'entreprises locales n'a pas ete heureuse dans le choix des
entreprises de realisation, qui, pour certaines se sont revelees particulierement
inefficaces.   C'est ainsi que pour la r6alisation des stations de traitement, les
entreprises etrangeres ont livr6 les equipement dans les delais, alors que les travaux
de genie civil confies a des entreprises locales avancent a un rythme extremement
lent. Les equipements stockes pendant plus de 4 ans risquent de se reveler
det6rior6s au moment du montage.
Les retards de paiement aux entrepreneurs persistent, ils se sont quelquefois meme
aggraves en raison de l'insuffisance des autorisations de paiement.
Sur le plan institutionnel les mesures tendant au renforcement du secteur ont ete
prises, il s'agit de:
la loi No 83-17 du 16 juillet 1983 portant code des eaux a et6 compl6t6e et modifi6e
par l'ordonnance N 96-13 du 15 juin 1996 La loi permet notamment la concession
des services d'eau potable et d'assainissement a des organismes de droit prive
locaux et etrangers, ce qui permettra d'introduire la competition dans les op6rations
de gestion,
la decentralisation de la gestion de l'eau potable et de l'assainissement par la
cr6ation en 1987 de 26 entreprises de wilaya,
l'institution par lois des finances en 1994 d'une taxe d'assainissement dont le niveau
etait de 20 % sur les factures d'eau  elle est destinee au financement des activites
d'assainissement et d'6puration des eaux usees,
I'institution par la loi de taxes nouvelles sur la ""qualite de 1'eau" et sur "I'economie de

est de veiller a la gestion int6gr6e des ressources en eau dans leur bassin respectifs
9.EVALUATION DES RESULTATS DU PROGRAMME
9.1 Approvisionnement en eau potable
La realisation des quatre projets a pris enormement de retard. Ces perations n'ont
pas participe de maniere significative a l'approvisionnement en eau potable des
localites vis6es leur impact ne pourra etre complet qu'a partir de 1999.
Par contre la realisation des autres projets pr6vus par le plan sectoriel hydraulique a
permis de faire face avec succes au moins par certains aspects a la croissance de la
population agglomer6e. On a assiste 6    I'amelioration  sensible du taux de
raccordement de la population agglomeree, aussi bien pour l'approvisionnement en
eau potable que pour   l'assainissement des eaux usees..
Selon l'enquete "AEP assainissement" r6alisee par le minist6re de l'6quipement a
partir de 1990 et finance sur les ressources du pret, en terme de raccordement a un
reseau la situation se presente comme suit:
Acces a 1'eau potable selon le type d'habitat:
Forme de service                  Type d'agglomeration

I'eau potable)                               99                       95
La production totale d'eau potable a ete estim6e a 1 300 millions de m3 par an, pour
une population totale agglomeree de 14 500 000 habitants ce qui donne une
production de 246 litres par habitant par jour. La production au niveau des
agglom6rations non couvertes par une entreprise de l'eau est estim6e a 300 Millions
de m3.par an
Une enquete ulterieure realise aupres des directions de wilaya et portant sur 1000
communes sur 1561, donne des r6sultats sensiblement differents, elle confirme
cependant les ameliorations relev6es par l'enquete AEP-Assainissement.
Le raccordement urbain est de 85,5%, pour la population rurale agglomeree il est de
77,8 %.
On peut estimer qu'en d6pit de ia croissance d6mographique, sur le plan du
raccordement aux reseaux d'eau potable ia situation a 6volue positivement par
rapport a celle qui prevalait avant le lancement du programme sectoriel en 1986.

9.2 Assainissement et epuration des eaux us6es
Selon la meme enquete citee au paragraphe 6.2, le taux de raccordement de la
population agglom6r6e a un r6seau d'assainissement a 6te porte de 80 % en 1986 a
85 % en 1996.
En matiere d'epuration des eaux us6es l'equipement disponible a porte le nombre de
stations a 50 pour 2 900 000 equivalent/habitants. L'epuration touche moins de 20%
de ia population 6quip6e d'un reseau d'assainissement. II faut ajouter a cela 435
bassins de decantation touchant pres d'un million d'habitants qui ont et6 egalement
realis6 durant cette periode.
9.3. R6sultats au plan institutionnel
Malgr6 les d6cisions prises (4 relevements de tarif portant le prix de l'unite de base
de 1 Dinar a 3.60 Dinars, et l'etablissement d'une taxe de 20 % au profit de
l'assainissement, sur l'eau potable), les resultats sont largement en de ,a des
objectifs, notamment pour ce qui concerne, les ressources d'autofinancement des
entreprises d'exploitation dont le taux esp6re etait de 15 % pour 1988.
Les 9 entreprises regionales et les 26 entreprises de Wilaya  ont signe une
convention de remboursement des credits par laquelle les ressources du pret utilises
pour d6velopper les capacit6s des entreprises sont retrocedes par I'etat aux
conditions financieres: suivantes :10 pour cent d'int6r6t , duree 20 ans avec cinq
ans de differes .
Les montant des credits en Dinars a rembourser par chaque entreprise sont en cour
de determination par la banque algerienne de developpement , gestionnaire du pret
pour le compte de l'6tat. Le d6tail des montant utilises par chaque entreprise sur les
ressources des prets 2591 AL et 2821 AL sont donnes dans ['annexe N03.
L'objectif de reduction du taux d'eau non facturee, qui a atteint en 1996 le taux
inquietant de 47 % au lieu de 40 % enregistr6 en 19866, n'a pas et6 atteint.
6 L'absence de maitrise par les entreprises du comptage au niveau de la production et de la distribution invite a
considerer ces estimations avec beaucoup de prudence

Sur un total d'investissements 3 582 millions de $US, realis6s durant la periode, le
concours du pret a ete de 224 millions, soit pr6s de 6 %. ll faut souligne que le pret a
finance la composante en devises de projets d'importance moyenne a un moment ou
la p6nurie de moyens de paiements ext6rieurs 6tait particulierement s6vere.
9.4.2.Les resultats economiques et financiers des entreprises d'exploitation9
Evolution de la production et de la vente d'eau potable:

Ventes d'eau millions de m                   330       518        188      57%
L'evolution de la production et des ventes d'eau entre 1985 et 1996 (periode
d'6valuation et d'execution du programme) ne peut etre entierement  imputee au
programme de developpement applique durant la p6riode. Une partie r6sulte de ia
prise en charge de nouvelles communes par les entreprises
Le taux de comptage par rapport a la facturation au forfait a atteint 74 % en moyenne
dans les 9 entreprises r6gionales.
Le nombre d'abonn6s par employe est de 112
Les r6sultats  financiers des entreprises se sont tres largement d6t6riores. Le
coefficient d'exploitation est pour 1996 de 114,58 % alors qu'il etait de 96,30 en
Credits de paiement du programme sectoriel centralise et ddcentralise.
Estimes suivant le taux de change prevalent I'annee oui les credits ont ete consommes
9 Faute de donnees fiables la consolidation n'a porte que sur 29 entreprises representant 95% des populations
totales desservies et 93% de 1'eau potable totale produite en 1995
' L'evaluation de 1985 ne concernait que 8 entreprises sur 13 existantes a l'epoque et portait sur 90% de
1'activite



39
1985. Le ratio de 1985 tenait compte des amortissements des equipements fournis
par l'6tat et financ6 en concours d6finitif, ce qui n'est pas le cas pour 1996.
Si on tient compte de l'amortissement des seuis equipements realises au cour de la
periode au taux de 2%, il faut ajouter aux charges 1 365 millions de DA et le
coefficient d'exploitation deviendrait 137,80 %.
Cette situation rend la majorite des entreprises incapables de faire face a leurs
depenses courantes. Elles accumulent des dettes a court terme qui representent
pr6s de 2 fois le totale des produits. Les dettes sont dues surtout pour l'nergie , les
organismes sociaux et les organismes fiscaux. De plus, la p6nurie chronique de
tresorerie limite la capacit6 op6rationnelle des entreprises, surtout en matiere de
maintenance des infrastructures
Pour reequilibrer les comptes des entreprises d'exploitation le tarif moyen aurait du
etre en 1996 de 13 DA/m3, pour tenir compte de l'amortissement il faudrait un tarif
de 15,63 DA/m3.. Le tarif moyen en vigueur est de 11,85 DA/ m3.
10 PERSPECTIVES D'AVENIR
Les insuffisances constat6es dans 1'execution du programme couvert par le pret
2821 AL , se r6sorbent progressivement du fait des reformes economiques
generales r6alisees par les pouvoirs publics et des mesures sectoriels sur le plan
technique et institutionnel.
Les actions couvertes par le pret 3743 AL permettront de remettre a niveau les
systemes d'alimentation en eau potable pour les principales villes et la rehabilitation
des principales stations d'epuration des eaux us6es. L'instauration d'un tarif regional
de l1eau qui est une etape vers la d6finition de tarifs par systeme homogene de
distribution de 1'eau potable, permettra d'assurer l'6quilibre des charges et des
produits et de g6nerer les ressources financibres necessaires a la maintenance et a
1'extension des systemes d'alimentation en eau potable. La signature de contrats de
gestion comportant une redevance de gestion verse au fonds de d6veloppement des
ressources en eau est un debut encourageant.
L'ouverture a ia concurrence du secteur de la gestion de l'eau ne manquera pas de
stimuler les comportements garantissants 1'efficacite dans les entreprises
d'exploitation.

11. PRINCIPAUX ENSEIGNEMENTS RETENUS DE L'EXECUTION DU
PROGRAMME
Les principaux enseignements que l'on peut retenir de l'execution du programme
arret6 au titre du pret 2821 AL sont les suivants:
En matiere de realisation des projets:
1. Completer les etudes et les actions juridiques et administratives de maturation
suffisante avant le lancement des consultations d'entreprises de realisation et le
d6but de r6alisation d'une partie de projets complexes.
2. Veiller a la selection d'entreprises competentes, disposant des moyen suffisants
pour la realisation des projets
3. Eviter l'attribution part lot des projets qui peut entrainer des decalages importants
dans la realisation d'ouvrages techniquement interd6pendants.
4. Assurer les financements suffisants a chaque etape de la r6alisation des projets
En matiere d'exploitation des infrastructures:
i. Assurer  les  ressources  financieres  pour  l'exploitation  rationnelle  des
infrastructures d'eau potable par l'institution d'un systeme de tarification adapte a
chaque systeme homogene d'approvisionnement en eau.
2. L'exploitation et la maintenance des r6seaux d'assainissement et des stations
d'6puration des eaux us6es demeurent tres insuffisantes Pour assurer un
rendement maximum de ces infrastructures en termes de sante publique et
protection de l1environnement, il est necessaire de procurer les financements
suffisants destin6s a leur exploitation et leur entretien sur des ressources stables.
