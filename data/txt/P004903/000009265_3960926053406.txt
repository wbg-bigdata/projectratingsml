ALGERIA
SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAJ, REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a number of regional water supply and sewerage
works to be executed in Algeria during the Second Five-Year Development Plan
(1985-89).   These works,  together wi:h ongoing  projects  in  the  cities  of
Alg -rs, Oran and Constantine, constitute the core of Government investments
in the water supply and sewerage sector during the Plan period.  They will be
implemented  in  seven  provinces.   The  proposed  project  includes  the works
required to meet water demands and sewage treatment needs in most urban areas
of these provinces through the end of the century.  Water supply and sewerage
services would be expanded to serve 2.2 million people ind to assist
continuous industrial development in seven provinces.
1.02     Since Algeria's independence in 1962, its urban population has grown
rapidly in the medium-size cities and towns adjacent to che large metropolitan
areas of Algiers, Oran and Constantine.  The annual population growth rate in
these areas is estimated to be 3.8 percent.  Until the late 1970's, there were
few improvements in urban infrastructure, particularly in water supply and
sewerage.   Potable water is in short supply in most medium-size  cities  and
towns and it is estimated that available water producticr in these areas
berely meets two-thirds of water needs.
1.03     To correct  this  situation,  the  Government  plans  to  invest  about
US$2.2 billion in the water supply and sewerage sector during the period
1985-89.  Of this amotmt, US$1.3 billion of financing is committed.  Of the
remaining US$0.9 billion, US$0.6 billion is to be pro.ided to finance the
proposed project.   The Government is constructing a new water supply system
for Greater Algiers at an estimated cost of US$770.5 million, partly financed
by a 1984 Bank loan of US$290.0 million  (Loan 2461-AL).   The Government  is
also improving water supply and sewerage services in the metropolitan areas of
Oran and Constantine through implenientation of projects with an estimated cost
of US$539.4 million, partly financed by a 1985 Bank loan of US$262.0 million
(Loan 2591-AL).



1.04     With technical assistance provided under  the Algiers  Project  (Loan
2461-AL), the Government carried out a reorganization of the water supply and
sewerage  sector.    The  reorganization  -  under  which  thirteen  regional
companies, instead of municipalities, were made responsible for the provision
of water and sewer services - was necessary to improve management of the
services  and  to build up the sector's  finances.   Technical assistance  for
long-term institutional building is being  financed under  Loan 2591-AL.   The
next  steps  in  the  sector's  development  aim  at expanding  services  in  the
remaining urban areas and consolidating management of the new regional
companies.  The proposed project , for which the Government has requested Bank
assistance, addresses the twin goals of service expansion in all urban areas
and improvements in the sector's efficiency.
L.05     The  proposed  project  would  include  all  those  investments  in the
Development Plan that would be completed in the period 1987-1989.  The project
is technically sound and is the least-ccst alternative for increasing potable
water supplies and providing sewerage services in the areas of greatest need.
The project cost is estimated at US$630.5 million w4th a foreign exchange
component of US$330.6 million,  It would amount to an in,vestment of US$286 per
capita   (based  on  benefiting  2.2 million  people),   which  is  reasonable
considering the age of the existing systems and  the need  to reduce  severe
water shortages.   A Bank loain of US$250.0 million to finance direct foreign
expenditures  under  the   project   is   proposed.    A   Syndicated   Loan   of
US$200.0 million to finance the balance of the foreign exchange cost and part
of the local cost is being sought.  The borrower would be the Government, the
executing agency would be the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry
(MHEF), and the beneficiaries would be the regional water companies.
1.06     Project preparation was financed and carried out by MHEF with  the
assistance of foreign and local consultants.   The Bank actively participated
in project formulation.   A mission composed of Messrc.  Fritz Rodriguez  and
Sergio Contreras (Bank staff) and Mr. Abdeljelil Ben Abid (Consultant)
appraised  the  project  in  July  and  September  1986,  supplementary  project
components were appraised by Messrs. Sergio Contreras and Geoffrey Matthews in
March 1987.
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
2.01     Algeria is the largest country in North Africa with an area of about
2.3 million Km2 , divided by  the Saharan Atlas into two regions.  North of
the Atlas is a semi-arid area which, with more than 95 percent of the
population, encompasses a coastal strip along the Mediterranean, the interior
plains, some highlands near the coast and the high plateaux.  The mean annual
rainfall in the northern areas varies from 300 rmm to 1,000 mm, exceeding
600 mm only in the central and eastern coastal parts, where rich arable land
is found.  South of the Atlas is the Sahara where the mean annual rainfall is
less than 100 mm, but which is rich in mineral resources.  There are 17 major
river basins in the country.



-3-
2.02     Until   recentl.y,  Algeria  was  administratively  divided  into  31
provinces (wilayate), 160 counties (dairate) and 704 commu'ies.  There are now
48 provinces.1' The 1985 total population is estimated at 21.9 million.
Almost half of the population lives in urban areas located along the
Mediterranean.   About 41 percent of the urban population is concentrated in
the three largest metropolitai, areas (Algiers, Oran and Constantine), which
have an estimated combined population of about 4.2 million. Most of the rural
population reside in fixed settlements of which only a portion  is equipped
with water supply and sanitation facilities.  A small percentage of the rural
population, located in the high plateaux area, can be considered dispersed.
Recent Sector Development and Sector Organization
2.03     From  Independence  up to the  late  1970s,  an  agency  of  MHEF, the
Societe Nationale de Distribution d'Eau Potable et Industrielle (SONADE) was
responsible  for water  production.   Distributiona and  maintenance  were  Whe
responsibility  of  the  municipalities  (responsible  to  the  Ministry  of  the
Interior), which purchased  water  from  SONADE.   Investments  were  generally
financed by Government grant, tariffs were low and service and maintenance
levels poor.  During this period, furthermore, as Government sought to build
up the economic base of the country through establishment of heavy industry,
investment in basic infrastructure was neglected.   Systems laid down during
the colonial period were not expanded or maintained, and water supply
shortages became increasingly serious as population, and specifically urban
population grew.
2.04     In the late 1970s, Government strategy changed and increased emphasis
was  placed   on   water   resource   development   and   on   improving   basic
infrastructure.    A  reorganization  of  the  sector  was  undertaken  with
responsibility for all aspects of water resource planning, development, and
distribution for both irrigation and potable use, con^entrated under one
Ministry, MHEF.  Responsibility for management of water supply and sewerage
systems was delegated to thirteen regional public utilities companies,
established as financially autonomous publicly-owned entrepriEes, and managed
as  commercial  undertakings.   The first of  these,  the SociAt6 des  Eaux de
l'Agglomeration d'Alger (SEDAL) was established  in 1977.   The other  twelve
were established in 1983.  The reorganization proved successful.
2.05     In order  to coordinate  the operations of the regional authorities
satisfactorily, the "Agence Nationale de l'Eau Potable et Industrielle et de
l'Assainissement" (AGEP) was established in 1985, within MHEF. AGEP's role is
to assist MHEF in planning and implementing water supply and sewerage
investment programs, recommending nationwide tariffs for approval by MHEF and
the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  identifying  the  required  level  of  Government
contributions to the companies to optimize the use of financial resources in
the sector, and formulating detailed sector policies. AGEP is still in the

data for the newly created 48 provinces.

organizational stage, and technical assistance to refine its organization,
functions and responsibilities is being financed under Loan 2461-AL.
2.06     In conjunction with  the  1983 sector  reorganization,  the Government
issued  a  Water  Code  (Law  No. 83-17  of  July  16,  1983)  to  regulate  the
allocation and protection of water resources and to set out financial policies
for the sector.  The Code deals with ownership, concession and use of water
resources; it also prescribes that water utilities should be managed as
commercial enterpr4ses, settin6 tariffs that encourage economic use of water
and enable the entities to be financially self-supporting.
2.07     The  water  and  sewerage  sector  orgauiization  has  thus  undergone
substantial   reorganization  over  the  past  ten  years;    its   legal   and
institutional framework is appropriate and encourages national exploitation of
water resources.  Much remains, however to be done to strengthen  the newly

2.08     Total watez resources  in Algeria are estimated  at  16.8 billion m3
per  year,  comprising  13.5 billion m3  of  surface  water  and  2.3 billion m3
of  groundwater.   Suriace  resources,  however,  are  generally  difficult  to
exploit.  Most of the rivers are dry in the summer and their water,  of poor
quality,  cannot  readily be *used for domestic  or  industrial  supply.   Their
regulation through costly reservoirs is often required to obt in economically
exploitable yields.   On the other hand,  the rate of infilt  tion from storm
runoff and surface resources results in groundwater being available over much
of the country.  The total volume of water resources that can economically be
exploited  is  estimated  at  only  7 billion m3  with  full  development   of
storage, substantially less than the maximum theoretically available.
2.09     Most  urban areas are presently supplied with groundwater, which is
also the main source of water for irrigated agriculture.  While surface water
is under-exploited, groundwater resources are already utilized to full
capacity.   Domestic and industrial uses currently account  for about  25% of
water used.  These needs will expand rapidly, however, as population grows and
water consumption, currently below tne desirable minimum in many areas,
increases.  It is estimated that only about 35% (300,000 ha) of irrigable land
is currently exploited.   As irrigated agriculture develops,  its water needs
will also grow.
2.10     The following table gives a very broad indication of the present and
future  pattern  of  water  utilization.    Serious  water  deficiencies,   and
potential conflicts of use, are likely to develop in the more densely
populated watersheds, and along the coastal areas where the majority of the
population  is  concentrated.   Water  shortages  already  exist  in  densely
populated river basins (Algiers and Oran are examples),  where present demand
exceeds   available   supplies   necessitating  costly  inter-basin  transfers.
Reclamation of wastewater and eventually desalination will become necessary to
meet demand.

Government Sector Strategy and Sector Investments
2.11     Government's sector strategy has recently been articulaced  in  the
1985-89 Second Five-Year Plan.  Water demands are to be met in the following
order  of  priority:   firstly,  domestic  requirements;   secondly,  irrigated
agriculture;   thirdly,  industry.   Its objectives for the water and sewerage
sector are to:
(a)    improve water storage capacity;
(b)    increase the extent of the water distribution network and number
of household connections;
(c)    improve drinking water supplies in sparsely populated areas;
(d)    satisfy industrial needs;
(e)    improve sewerage and sanitation,  specially in low income areas
and in big cities; and
(f)    improve management of water supply and sewerage systems.
These objectives indicate that for this plan period, priority has been given
to overcoming  water  supply  shortages.   The  target  is  to provide  serviced
population with 150-200 lcd by the year 2010.   In the next plans,  increasing
emphasis will be given to sanitation.
2.12     The  table below illustrates  the increasing importance allocated to
the water and sewerage subsector over successive plan periods.
Assumptions:   Population 44 millions; domestic  and commercial  water
consumption  200  lcd;   industrial  consumption  40  lcd;   irrigated
agricultural area doubles to 600,000 ha;  water utilization per ha is

2.13     The    Second    Four-Year    Investment    Plan    (1974-77)    included
DA 4.0 billion (US$800 million) or about DA 240.0 (US$48.0) per capita for
water  supply and  sewerage works.   About  DA 1.0 'illion  (US$200 million)  of
this amount was to complete works initiated during the previous investment
plan  (1970-73).   These  investments  were  financed  entirely  by  Givernment
grants.   It is estimated that during  the First  Five-Year  Plan  (1930-1984),
investments in the order of DA 6.0 billion (US$1.2 billion) or about DA 300
(US$60.0) per capita were made in the sector.   During  the Second Five--Year
Plan (1985-1989), MHEF plans to invest DA 10.4 billion (US$2.2 billion) in the
water  supply  and  sewerage  sector.   It  should  be  noted  that  this  figure
represents only  1.7% of total public investment for the period.   Given the
continuing need to make up for backlogs in water infrastructure provision, the
Government is not considering curtailing investments in the sector in the wake
of reduced revenues from falling oil prices in 1986.
2.14     The water supply investment program contained in the Second Plan has
eleven major projects, of which three are ongoing in Algiers, Constantine and
Oran.   The remaining eight,  in seven different  provinces,  aim at  providing
improved supplies to 3.4 million people living in about 39 towns and cities
ranging  from  15,000  to  800,000  inhabitants.   Their  present  consumption
averages about 78 lcd ranging from a low of 31 lcd to a high of 188 lcd.
Unacccounted-for water  is estimated at  28%.   A breakdeown of  the estimated
water sales by categoLy for 1987 is in Annex 1 and is suimarized below.

2.15     Sewerage projects are coordinated with the water supply projects in
keeping  with  the  Government's   integrated  approach  to  water  resources
management and environmental protection.  At this stage of development,  the
sewage treatment projects are selected according to the necessity to protect
raw water sources from pollution so thay they may be used for irrigation and
potable water needs.
Service Levels
2.16     The Government's sector strategy and investments over the last decade
or so have greatly improved the level of service from an estimated 60% of the
urban population having direct connection to water service lines in 1976 to
about 802 by 1985.  Despite this achievement, attained in a period of high
urban population growth, much remains to be done as only a third can be
considered well served. The overall consumption varies widely, from 20 lcd in
Chegoun in the Kabylie Mountains to 286 lcd in El Golea in the central part of
Algeria, but in most cases is considered inadequate.   This consumption has
been limited by inadequate production capacity and the high volume of
unaccounted-for water, which in some cities reaches 50 percent of production.
Improvements of the metering systems and renovation of the distribution
networks, which are currently in progress, would reduce unaccounted-for water
to the acceptable levels achieved in the larger towns (e.g. Oran and
Constantine),  where unaccounted-for water  is under  25% of  production.   In
general, water supply in nmost cities is intermittent and available no more
than 12 hours a day.
2.17     About 80 percent of the urban population is connected to public sewer
networks, which in most cases are combined systems which also carry stormwater
runoff. Wastewaters in the cities are generally discharged untreated directly
into the Mediterranean or into rivers.  Treatment facilities being built in
Greater Algiers and in Constantine are expected to become operational in 1988
and 1989 respectively.  Although about 70 percent of the rural locations  I/
are  provided  with  public  water  svpply  systems  and  60 percent  with  sewer
systems, only about 40 percent of the rural population has direct access to
public water supply networks; and only 25 percent to sewerage.
Previous Bank Loans in the Sector
2.18     The  Bank  became  involved  in  the  sector  in  1978,  when  the
US$82.0 million Loan 1545-AL was made for the Algiers Sewerage Project, to
help finance the construction of sewer interceptors and a sewage treatment
plant in Greater Algiers and management and engineering studies in the cities
of Algiers, Constantine and Oran.  One of the objectives of this project was
.o strengthen the sector organization in Greater Algiers, which ultimately led
to the recent Government decision to set up similar authorities in the rest of
the country.
2.19     To help improve water supply and sewerage services in the Algiers
area, the Bank in 1980 made a US$5.0 million loan (S-17-AL) to finance a water
I/       Defined as agglomerations with less than 2,000 inhabitants.

resources study, the Water Master Plan tor the Algiers/Sebaou Area.  Upon the
recommendations of this study, a water supply project, which is the first
construction stage of the Master Plan, was defined for Greater Algiers and is
now under construction.   In June  1984  the Bank made a US$290 million loan
(2461-AL)  to  partly  finance  this  construction.   This  loan  also  assisted
institutional development of the sector by partly financing the setting up of
AGEP, the implementation of a sector eurvey, and organizational, managerial
and financial studies for the Algiers company.
2.20     The execution of the works included in the Algiers Sewerage Project,
after some  initial  delays,  has  progressed well.   The project,  however,  is
expected to be completed only by the end of 1987, some four years later than
foreseen dt appraisal, because of delays in inscribing the project in the
national budget and appointing consultants, additional review by MHEF of the
project design, and slow procurement of the works.  All these problems have
since  been  resolved.    Loan  S-17-AL  was  closed  at  the  end  of  1984.
Implementation of the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project is progressing
extremely well.
2.21     More recently, the Bank made a US$262 million loan (Loan 2591-AL) to
partly finance water supply and sewerage works in Oran and Constantine and
technical assistance for the thirteen regional companies in the areas of
organization,   management,   finance  and   training.    Project  execution   is
underway. The loan was declared effective in December 1986.
Constraints to Sector Development
2.22     Until recently, lack of sound sectoral financial policies was a major
constraint to sector development.   Water tariffs, all over the country,  had
generally remained low during the past decade. The municipalities, which were
responsible for water supply and sewerage services, were under no pressure to
implement realistic tariffs which could have encouraged consumers to save
water because, until recently, investments in water supply and sewerage were
financed by Government grants to the municipalities.  The Government has now
decided that the regional companies should finance a substantial portion of
their investments with borrowings and progressively with their internal cash
generation.
2.23     Administrative burden has also been another constrairt to the sector
development.   MHEF has been slow in implementing the sector's work programs.
In some cases, delays in procurement have resulted in cost overruns.   Though
procurement regulations and schedules are well defined in codes, they have not
always been followed.   A project  objective  is to help MHEF  streamline  the
procurement process and project e;ecution.
2.24     Other difficulties  that  the regional  companies  are  facing are not
particular  to the sector.   They are  the  product  of  general  institutional
deficiencies  in  Algeria.   Some  basic  equipment  and  materials  needed  for
operating and maintaining the systems, such as vehicles, water meters, pipes,
etc. are supplied by state monopolies, and are not readily available.
2.25     Another major difficulty confronting  the regional companies  is the
lack of qualified  staff.   Prior  to  the  creation  of  the  companies,  water



- 9 -
services were provided by a central operating organization, EONADE, and the
municipalities.  SONADE was short of staff, and with the decentralization of
operations into thirteen companies, the staff shortage has become more acute.
A large staff training program for MHEF and the regional companies has been
prepared by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and is scheduled to
start in August 1987. Its cost would be partly financed under Loan 2591-AL.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
4
2.26     Since  the beginning of  its  involvement  in the sector,  the  Bank's
lending strategy has been geared essentially towards the development of a
strong institutional framework for the sector, that should result in sound
investment programming, improved operational efficiency of the regional
companies and ultimately in improved and expanded services.  To this end, the
Bank  is actively assisting  the Government  in putti.ng  in place  financially
strong and viable organizations in the recently created regional companies and
in expanding wat, r supply and sewerage services in the large and intermediate
cities, as outlined  in the Second Five-Year Plan.   Important  institutional
reforms have already taken place under the four previous Bank-financed
projects.   The proposed  project  would extend  these  reforms  by helping  the
Government  to  implement  financially  efficient  tariff  policies  on  a  cost
recovery basis through the development of a financial  planning  and  control
system based on appropriate managerial, technical and financial objectives.
The proposed project would also provide technical assistance  in the form of
specialized training for the management of AGEP and the regional companies, a
study of potential inter-basin water transfers and a study of the water supply
and sewerage segment of the construction industry.
2.27     The Algerian Government has prepared an investment program for the
1985-89 period for water supply and sewerage which it has the technical and
managerial capacity to implement.   The Bank has reviewed the overall program
and  considers  it  well  formulated  and  technically  sound.    However,   the
Government's financial resources fall short of requirements and it has
requested Bank assistance to fill this financing gap.
m. THE PROJECT
Sector Investment Program
3.01     Investments to be made during  the Second Five-Year Plan,  1985-89,
(Annex 2), are intended to increase water supply, and provide sewerage and
sewage treatment facilities in major, intermediate and small-sized cities and
towns nationwide.  The individual water supply projects were selected by MHEF
based on the most severe water needs arising from high population growth
coupled with the age and deficiencies of present water systems.  The sewage
treatment projects were chosen to protect raw water sources from pollution and
thus reduce health hazards in areas where rivers are important sources of
water  for  irrigation  and  for  major  urban  agglomerations.   Plan  proposals
represent the least-cost engineering alternatives to meet water demands and
wastewater treatment in the concerned regions.   In all, about 60 percent of
all consumers in the country would benefit from these investments.



- 10 -
3.02     The total cost of the 1985-1989 investment program in current prices
is estimated at DA 10.4 billion (US$2.2 billion) with a foreign exchange
component of DA 5.1 billion (US$1.1 billion) or about 50 percent of the total
cost.
3.03     The investment program includes three large water supply and sewerage
projects for the Algiers, Oran and Constantine areas, currently under
construction, eight regional water supply projects located in seven provinces
nationwide and three sewage treatment projects.  In addition to these regional
subprojects, the water supply and sewerage networks of all thirteen regional
companies would co 'inue to be improved and expanded.  The implementation of
ongoing technical assistance and training programs would also continue
throughout the Plan period.
3.04     In the project,  investment in four out of the eight regional water
supply systems, benefitting five provinces, and the three sewage treatment
plants, have been grouped together and are referred to hereinafter as
"subprojects".  The appraisal mission carried out a detailed review of these
seven subprojects and is satisfied as to their appropriateness, priority and
technical integrity.   Implementation of the seven subprojects is due to begin
in 1987 and would be completed by 1989.
Projet Objectives
3.05     The   objectives   of  the  proposed  project  are  to  support   the
Government's Five-Year Development Plan and investment program in the water
supply  and  sewerage  sector.   Specifically,  the  project  would  assist  the
Government to:
(a) improve and expand water supply services, especially in the
cities for which water production would be increased through the
proposed project (paras. 3.10, 3.11, 3.14);
(b)  provide sewage treatment facilitieE to townz which are presently
discharging untreated sewage into rivers whicit are important raw
water sources for irrigation and potable water (paras. 3.12,
3.13);
(c)  support the Government's sector policy for cost recovery which
takes into account the overall financial viability of the
sector, while ensuring adequate financial accountability of the
individual   regional   water   supply  and   sewerage   companies
(paras. 5.09, 5.10);
(d) enhance the project implementation capabilities of MHEF and AGEP;
(e) study and define measures to strengthen the water supply and
sewerage   sector   of   the   Algerian   construction   industry
(paras. 3.16 to 3.18);
(f) study the viability of water transfer projects identified in the
Water Supply Master Plan for Northern Algeria (para. 3.19); and



- 11 -
(g) train management personnel in water and sewerage installations
management (para. 3.15).
3.06     The project aims at providing:
(a)    water supply to 750,000 people living in five provinces through
the construction of four water supply subprojects; and
(b)    sewage  treatment facilities  in  three  towns,  with  a  combined
population  of  340,000.   Two  of  the  towns  are  situated  on
tributaries of the Oued Tafna upstream of the Tafna intake and
water  treatment  works  (Loan  2591-AL);   the  sewage  treatment
facilities  would  thus  protect  the  water   supply  of   the
700,000 itihabitants of Oran.  The third town is located 25 kms
upstream from the Ain Zada reservoir, which is a raw water
source for 425,000 inhabitants in the Setif area.
3.07     About 80Q  of the population in the project area is served directly by
water companies and their average consumption is 74 lcd, ranging from a low of
31 lcd to a high of 99 lcd.  The remaining 20S obtain water from wells and
standpipes.  Water production is about 38 Mm3/year, of which unaccounted-for
water is estimated to be 29X and domestic and industrial consumption
20 Mm3/year and 7 Mm3/year respectively.
3.08     The  proposed  project  goal  is  tc 9ttain  the  water  supply  levels
indicLted in para 2.11 while maintaining an 801 service level, accommodating a
population growth of 41 per year and protecting major raw water sources as
explained in para 3.01.   Water supply and sewerage subprojects designed to
achieve these goals are outlined in paras. 3.10 and 3.12 and are described in
more detail in Annex 2.
Project Description
3.09     The proposed project would be part of the investment program to be
implemented during the last three years (1987-89) of the Second Development
Plan (Map IBRD N' 19898). It would consist of:
(a)  four   regional   water   supply  subprojects,   including  water
production, treatment and transmission components;
(b)  three sewage treetment plants;
(c)  expansion  of  the  water  supply  distribution  networks  of  all
thirteen regional companies;
(d)  a  study  of  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  sector  of  the
construction  industry  leading  to  measures  to  improve  its
efficiency and competiveness;
(e)  four water transfer studies for the northern areas of Algeria;
and
(f)  training of AGEP and the thirteen regional companies' managers
in management of water and sewerage installations.

A detailed description of the regional water supply and sewage treatment
subprojects  is  in Annex 2.   A  brief  outline  of  the  proposed  production,
treatment and transmission works included in the water supply subprojects is
given in para. 3.10 and a description of the sewage treatment subprojects is
given in para. 3.12.  The expansion of the distribution network is discussed
in  para. 3.14;   management  training  in  para. 3.15;  the  study  of  the
construction industry in paras. 3.16 through 3.18; and the water transfer
studies in para. 3.19.  The population increase and the water made available
under the proposed project are as follows.

Regional Water SuDDlY Subprojects
3.10     The four regional water supply subprojects are:
(a) Ain Dalia - Souk Ahras - Ouenza Subproject
A multipurpose dam on Oued Medjerda is under construction and
will serve the cities of Souk Ahras, Ouenza and El Aouinet and
some minor towns located in the Guelma and Tebessa Provinces.
The  dam  and a treatment  plant,  with a capacity of  1.3 m3/s
constructed  under  this  component,  would  raise  the   toLal
production   capacity   from   7,100 m3/day   to   119,400 m3/day,
which would satisfy demand in the above cities and the northern
region of the Tebessa Province until the year 2010.
(b) In Amguel - Tamanrasset Subproject
Under this subproject, to alleviate the severe water shortage in
the city of Tamanrasset, which is located in the Sahara Desert,
watei will be pumped from a wellfield located some 131 Kms from
the city.  The proposed wellfield, the closest available water
source for Tamanrasset, would increase the production from
700 m3/day  to  5,900 m3/day,  wh4ch  would  be  sufficient  to
meet demand until the year 2000.



-  13  -
(c) Ain Skhouna - Saida Subproject
In the Ain Skhouna-Saida region, a similar subproject would be
constructed.   A wellfield at Ain Skhouna,  106 kms from Saida,
would raise the product:on capacity from 12,500 m3/day to
47,000 m3/day, satisfying demand until 1997.
(d) Mexenna - Annaba Subproject
The Mexenna-Annaba subproject would primarily serve the counties
of Annaba and Drean.   The  Mexenna  Dam  on  Oued  El  Kebir  is
currently under construction;   water from the reservoir formed
by this dam would be treated in two plants with a combined
capacity  of  1.5 m3/s.   Water  production  would  increase  from
85,000 m3/day  to  216,000 m3/day  which  would  meet  the  demand
until 1995.
3.11     The  proposed  Bank  loan would  finance  the direct  foreign exchange
component of the cost of the mechanical,  electrical and treatment equipment
for the water treatment works and pumping stations, the transmission pipelines
for raw and treated water, including telemetry equipment of these four
subprojects.   These  works  are  self-standing and would be  put  to use upon
completion.

3.12     The three sewage treatment works (STW) subprojects are:
(a) Tlemcen S.T.W. Subproject
The Tlemcen subproject would treat the wastewaters of this city
(110,000 inhabitants) and discharge its effluent into the Oued
Chabet El Horrah.  This river is a tributary of the Oued Tafna,
which is an important raw water source for Oran. The treatment
works would have a capacity of 30,000 m3/day, sufficient to
meet the treatment needs until the year 2005.
(b) Maghnia S.T.W. Subproject
The sewage from the 55,000 inhabitants of the city of Maghnia
would be treated under this  subproject.   The  treated effluent
would be discharged into the Oued Ouendeffou, a tributary of the
Oued Tafna, which is a raw water source for Oran.  The treatment
works  would  have  a  capacity  of  14,500 m3/day,  sufficient  to
meet the treatment needs until 1989.   Construction of a second
phase of this project has also been programmed to start in
1990. This is not part of this project.



- 14 -
(c)  Setif S.T.W. Subiroject
This subproject would serve the city of Setif.   The treatment
works would discharge the effluent into the Oued Bou Sellam
which has been daoned 25 kms downstream, at Ain Zada, to provide
raw water for Setif and the surrounding region.  The current
population of Setif is 177,000,  The  treatment works  capacity
would be 44,000 m3/day, sufficient to meet the treatment needs
until 1990, after which a second phase is programmed to start in
1991.
3.13     The  proposed  Bank  loan would finance  the direct  foreign exchange
component of the cost of the mechanical, electrical and treatment equipment
for these sewage treatment works. These works are self-standing and would be
put to use upon completion.
Water Distribution Pipes
3.14     At the average current growth rate of about 42 per year, the urban
population is expected to double in the next 17 years. To meet the additional
water demand, all thirteen regional water companies are expanding their water
distribution networks at a relatively fast pace.  It is estimated that the
current expansion would  require some  1,500 kms  of  new  pipes.   The  direct
foreign exchange cost component of these pipes, which represents about 63,000
tonnes of ductile iron pipes and fittings, would be financed by the Bank under
the proposed project.
Management T 
3.15     The project would provide a small training program (US$200,000) for
the management personnel of AGEP and the thirteen regional water companies.
The training would be composed of seminars to be given by internationally
recognized experts and training visits to research centers atid leading water
authorities that would assist the participants to enhance their management
skills in the day-to-day operations of water and sewerage installations.
Study of the Local Construction Indusry
3.16     The Algerian construction industry is made up of state-owned  firms
specialized  in specific sectors and patronized by ministries;   for example,
there are construction firms for hydraulic works (water supply, sewerage and
irrigation) and those for public works such as roads, bridges, housing, etc.
In Algeria, the construction industry accounts for about 12 percent of GDP,
and during the period 1970-80, the value of construction amounted to almost
47 percent of gross  fixed investments.   In the water supply and sewerage
sector, there are 17 specialized construction firms, some of which build dams,
some  treatment  plants  and  others  pipelines,  etc.   Because  of  the  highly
developed specialization, and very often due to the scarcity of firms for a
specific task, construction costs and implementation periods are greater than
those of international companies.



- 15 -
3.17     To improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the water supply and
sewerage sector of the construction industry, the proposed project would
include a study of its procedures and activities.  A survey of the industry
would be carried out to determine the availability of management personnel,
technical staff, labor, materials, equipment, housing and other facilities.  A
review of the regulations, practices and procedures affecting the industry
would be undertaken to identify possible constraints in its operations.  At
the same time, the performance of foreign firms operating in Algeria would be
evaluated  and  compared  with  that  of  local  firms.   Consultants  would  be
recruited by end-1987.
3.18     At the conclusion of the study, which is expected to take six months,
a report would be submitted to MEEF recommending measures to improve the
construction  industry's  efficiency  and  competitiveness.   Draft  terms  of
reference for the study are outlined in Annex 3.
Water Transfer Studies
3.19     The Water Supply Master Plan for North Algeria identified several
potential  water  transfer  systems.   The  studies  would  be  carried  out  by
consultants and would be completed by December 31, 1989.  The systems to be
studied  include the transfer of  water  from:   the  Taksebt  Dam;   the  Oued
Cheliff;   Beni Haroun Dam;  and the Koudiat Affren Dam;  to Algiers and Tizi
Ouzou;   Mostaganem  and  Oran;   Mila,  Constantine  and  Batna;   and  Bouira,
respectively.  The project would finance the foreign exchange component of the
cost of feasibility studies of these transfer schemes.
Cost Estimates
3.20     The    estimated    total    project    cost    is    DA 2,963.3 million
(US$630.5 million)  with  a  foreign exchange component of DA 1,553.7 million
(US$330.6 million) or about 52 percent of the total cost.  Detailed costs of
-he project elements are shown in Annex 2, a summary of the cost estimate is

3.21     Cost  estimates  are based  on detailed designs  for all  the project
components and on actual bids for recently awarded contracts for similar
projects.   Physical  contingencies  are  estimated  at  10 percent  which  is
considered appropriate given the nature of the works and degree of accuracy of
unit costs on which the estimates are based.   In addition,  the December 1986
local prices are projected tc increase annuall, by 8 percent cauring the period
1987-89, and foreign prices by 3 percent in 1987 and 1 percent thereafter.
Overall, the project cost in current prices is projected to exceed the 1986
estimates by about 7.8 percent.
3.22     Ihe  project  provides  for  an  estimated  150 man-months  of  foreign
consulting services for carrying out the construction industry study and
2,100 man-monchs for construction supervision, training and water transfer
studies.
Status of Prepar8tion
3.23     Detailed design of the seven subprojects has been completed and land
has  been   acquired.    Construction   of   the  Ain   Dalia-Souk   Ahras   and
Mexenna-Annaba  subprojects  is underway.   Both started  in 1985 and  the Ain
Dalia and Mexenna Dams are well advanced.  In addition, the bidding procedures
for the water treatment plant at Ain Dalia have already been initiated.
3.24     Construction of the other two water supply subprojects and the three
sewage treatments works is expected to start during the last quarter of 1987.
Distribution network expansion in all thirteen regional water companies is a
continuous process and pipelaying is ongoing as well as preparation of further
works.
inplementation
3.25     Project  implementation  would  begin  mid-1987  and  be  completed  by
end-1989 (Annex 5).  As in the case of previous  Bank assisted  projects  in
Algeria, project implementation would be carried out by AGEP, the specialized
agency  of  MHEF.   At  the  express  wish  of  the  Government,  civil  works
construction under the proposed project would be carried out by local firms
and has been excluded from Bank financing.  This arrangement is satisfactory.
To improve efficiency of the construction industry in hydraulic works of this
type, a study is included ir the project.   For construction  supervision  of
some specialized works, MHEF would be assisted by consulting firms which would
be retained in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants and
under terms and conditions satisfactorv to the Bank.  These consultants would
be appointed in the third quarter of 1987 as construction  of  the works  is
about  to  start.   Consultants  would  also  be retained  for  the construction
industry study no later than December 31, 1987.
3.26     The  Ain  Dalia  and  Mexenna  dams,  are  important  structures  whose
stability should be carefully monitored.  Consequently, during negotiations,
the Government agreed that no later than December 31, 1987, MHEF would employ
engineering experts to assist it in inspecting the dams and related structures
annually during con5itruction and the first five years after completi.on.
Thereafter, the inspections would be made once every five years.  The experts



- 18 -
would be retained in accordance with the Bank guidelines for the use of
consultants.   Following  an  inspection,  MHEF would  carry out  any necessary
remedial actions suggested by the consultants.
3.27     In the areas to be covered by the reservoirs at Ain Dalia and Mexenna
there are 684 inhabitants (115 families), who will be rese:ttled.  A total of
DA 130 million (US$28 million) has been budgeted for expropriation and
resettlement of all the 684 affected inhabitants.   Resettlement in Algeria is
carried out under Ordinance No. 76-48 of May 25, 1976, which is based on
similar  French  legislation.   This  law  includes  among  the  steps necessary
before  resettlement  takes  place,  the  following:    (a)  inquest  prior  to
declaration of a property as being of public domain; (b) approval by the
municipal assembly; (c) declaration of public domain property; (d) inquest for
final determination of which properties are to be expropriated and their
rightful owners; (e) negotiation of compensation; and (f) expropriation and
resettlement.   The declaration of public domain property  is establishcd by
decree issued jointly by the Miniatries of the Interior, Finance, Public
Works, and the government authority concerned (e.g. MHEF), in cases where the
beneficiarv is the state.
3.28     In the case of the Ain-Dalia dam,  the first  four steps  have been
completed and the fifth is in progress.  Construction of replacement housing
has alrealy startEl and expropriation and resettlement is scheduled for
October  i987.   In the case of the Mexenna dam, construction of which started
in 1985, to be completed by 1989, only the census of the affected population
has been carried out.  The resettlement plan for the area to be covered by
impounding at the Mexenna dam has been received but found to be insufficiently
detailed.
3.29     Expropriation and resettlement of inhabitants in the impounding area
at  Ain  Dalia  is  scheduled  to  be  carried  out  by  October  1987.   During
negotiations,  it was agreed  that  the Government would send to the Bank by
December 31, 1987,  an  implementation  schedule  for  executing  resettlement
legislation  for  the  inhabitants  at  Mexenna  which  would  consider  final
expropriation and resettlement  either before  impounding  should start  or by
December 31, 1987  whichever  comes  sooner.   The  Bank  will  closely  monitor
execution of the resettlement ptograms during project execution.
3.30     The  Oued  Medjerda,  which  is  the  raw  water  source  for  the  Ain
Dalia-Souk Ahras water supply subproject, is an international waterway flowing
from Algeria to Tunisia. The river basin is shared equally between the two
countries.   The total annual flow at Souk-Ahras is normally about 60,000 Mm 3
per year.  The water supply demand in Algeria would require about 40,000 Mm3
per year,  i.e. about 2/3 of the annual flow.  The Bank has not yet received
docuwentation that shows the agreements reached on riparian  rights.   During
negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would send this documentation
to  the  Bank  by  June  30,  1988.   Alternatively,  by  December 31, 1987,  the
Government may request the replacement of this project component by another
one which should conform to key Bank criteria for acceptability, namely that
the alternative component should be technically, economically and financially
feasible, be the least-cost technical alternative, be a part of the
Governments' investment program, have a high priority, detailed engineering
design for the component should be available and riparian rights, resettlement



- 19 -
and environmental issues, if any, should have been solved.    It was further
agreed that in the event that the riparian rights issue is not resolved or
that  an  acceptable  replacement  project  component  is  not  identified  by
June 30, 1988, then the Bank would cancel the amount of the loan that would
finance the Ain Dalia-Souk Ahras subproject (US$26 million).
Finawipg Plan
3.31     A Bank loan of US$250.0 million to finance direct  foreign exchange
expenditures   for  the  project  is  proposed.    .his  loan  would  finance
US$69.1 million  of  mechanical,  electrical  and  treatment  equipment   for
treatment works, wellfields and service reservoirs and US$61.2 million of
distribution pipes;  'JS$109.7 million for transmission pipes;  US$6.6 million
of   technical   assistance/studies;    and   US$3.4 million   of   construction
supervision.  The loan would be made  to the Government  to be repaid over
12 years after a 3--year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.
A syndicated loan of US$200.0 million to finance the balance of the foreign
exchange cost and part of the local costs is proposed.  Should this loan not
materialize, the Government is prepared to provide the necessary funds.   The
remainder of local cost would be financed by the Government and the regional
water companies in the proportions shown below:

&.32     The  regional  companies  would  finance  part  of  the  program  of
distribution network expaasion. The Government would finance the construction
of production and transmission works and the remainder of the distribution
network expansion program. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it
would promptly make available the above funds and any additional funds needed
to complete the project.
Reimbursement and Other Agreernents
3.33     Upon project completion, MHEF would transfer ownership of the works
to the regional companies, which are the beneficiaries of the proposed loan
and which are described in "hapter IV.  The legislation (para. 2.06) governing
water supply and sewerage operations in Algeria requires that the regional
companies firance their investments principally by long-term borrowings and
eventually develop a self-financing capability.   Hence,  it is proposed that
the companies reimburse the Government the equivalent of the Bank loan.



- 20 -
3.34     These reimbursements by the regional companies would start  in  1992
after a 5-year grace period, to be completed over 20 years, with interest at
102.   These  terms  are  appropriate.   The  102  nomnnal  interest   is  set
2 percentage points above the expected 82 inflation rate as the foreign
exchange risk on the loans would be borne by the Government.  Although  the
25-year life of the Government's loan is longer than that of the Bank loan, it
is still equivalent to about one-half of the useful life of the underlying
investments.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the details of the
reimbursement modalities, together with the Government's financing conditions
of works to be exploited by the regional companies, which would be set oLt in
Reimbursement Agreements between the Government and each of the regional
companies.   Copies  of  these  Reimbursement  Agreements,  duly executed,  have
already been received by the Bank.
3.35     Under  the proposed  procurement  arrangements  (para. 3.36),  a  large
quantity of ductile iron pipes and fittings, which are required for
distribution system improvements, would be financed by the proposed Bank loan,
imported through ICB by ENSIDER, a state enterprise specialized in such bulk
purchase of pipes and fittings (para. 3.37).  However, as the Government would
be the Borrower, in order for the Bank to finance these project-related
purchases, all disbursement requests would be made by the Government.  During
negotiations, the Government agreed to this procedure.
Procurement
3.36     Contracts for the supply of mechanical and electrical equipment and
materials and the distribution and transmission pipes for the project would be
awarded following international competitive bidding consistent with the Bank
guidelines  for  procurement.   In  evaluating  bids,  a  15 percent  margin  of
preference or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed
for goods manufactured in Algeria.  Most of the supply contracts are expected
to be won by foreign suppliers with the exception of the purchase of steel
pipes which are manufactured locally. All civil works would be carried out by
local firms selected by MHEF under LCB procedures, and are not financed under
the proposed Bank loan.   Local competitive bidding procedures  are generally
consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the
project.  There were, however, a few procedures which were inconsistent with
Bank procurement  guidelines  and others which required clarification.   These
procedures, and proposals to improve them, have been discussed during
negotiations and agreement reached regarding the needed changes to make the
current  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Bank.   Consultants  for  construction
supervision, training, the water transfer studies and the water supply
sewerage sector of the construction industry would be retained in accordance
with the Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.
3.37     Ductile iron pipes and fittings for distribution system improvements
and expansion would be imported by a state enterprise, ENSIDER, under ICB for
the account of MHEF.   By concentrating such purchases with ENSIDER, it would
be possible to secure competitive prices through bulk orders placed with
international  pipe suppliers.  All procurement documentation will be reviewed
by the Bank prior to ICB.

Note:    Figures  in parentheses  are the respective amounts proposed  to be

Disbursement
3.38     The  proposed  Bank  loan would be disbursed against  100 percent of
foreign expenditures for equipment and materials and for expenditures against
consulting services. A disbursement period of about 6 years, which is shorter
than the standard disbursement profile is forecast for three reasons.  First,
preparation of detailed engineering designs and plans are complete and
construction of some of the regional subprojects has started.  Secondly, about
25% of the loan would be disbursed against purchase of pipes and fittings
which are urgently needed for distribution network expansion program covering
a large number of various sized works within the thirteen regions, some of
which  are  ongoing.   Thirdly,  disbursement  performance  under  the  ongoing
project  (Loan  2461-AL)  has  been  excellent;   at  the  end  of  FY86,  actual
disbursements  were  running  substantially  ahead  of  appraisal   forecast.
Estimated quarterly loan disbursements for the proposed project are given in
Annex 4.  The closing date of the proposed loan would be June 30, 1993.   The
proposed Bank loan of Us$250.0 million would be disbursed as follows:

3.39     To make prompt payments to suppliers and consultants, a portion of
the proposed loan proceeds would be used to establish a Revolving Fund for
which a Special Account would be maintained at the Central Bank of Algeria.
This system has worked well with previous Loans 2461-AL and 2591-AL.  It is
estimated that the maximum amount of the Fund would be US$20.0 million, which
would be sufficient to finance the Bank's share of eligible project
expenditures  over a  four-month  period.   The  Fund would be maintained  in
US dollars.  Replenishments of the Special Account would be submitted on a
monthly basis for a minimum of US$5.0 million equivalent or when approximately
one third of the Special Account has been spent, whichever was the sooner.
Disbursement  applications would be fully documented except for withdrawals
made against distribution pipes contracts valued up to US$500,000 equivalent,
and treatment works, pumping station, service reservoir equipment contracts
valued up to US$50,000. equivalent. These would be presented on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) duly certified. Audit reports would include
a separate opinion given by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank as to
whether the SOEs submitted for reimbursement could be relied upon to support
the related withdrawls.

Rteport
3.40     In addition to monitoring arrangements for tariffs, staffing, water
sales   and  other   financial   parameters   (paras. 5.09  and  5.13),  during
negotiations, it was agreed that MHEF would submit reports to the Bank, which
should address, in particular, the following:
(a) quarterly:
(i)    progress in procurement of equipment and materials;
(ii)    progress in construction of the project facilities;  and
(iii)    expenditures on the project;
(b) annually:
(i)    updated cost estimates of remaining works.
3.41     During  negotiations,  it  was  also  agreed  that,  within  six months
following the closing date of the loan, MHEF, in conjunction with each of the
companies,  would prepare and submit tn the Bank a completion report on the
execution and initial operation of the project, its costs and benefits,  the
performance and fulfillment by  the Government, MHEF,  the companies and the
Bank of their respective obligations under the Loan and Project Agreements and
the accomplishment of the objectives of the Loan.
Project Accounts and Audit
3.42     MHEF  mai.atains  separate  accounts  and records of  its projects.   A
financial controller from the Ministry of Finance permanently controls the
accounts, which nevertheless should be audited regularly by independent
auditors.   To  this  end,  during  negotiations,  it  was  agreed  that  MHEF's
accounts for the project, including the Revolving Fund account, would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and submitted
to the Bank not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
Certified copies of the accounts as well as the auditors' reports would also
be furnished to the Bank.
Iv. THE BENEF'ICIARIES
Back=oro
4.01     The Borrower of  the proposed loan would be the Government and the
beneficiaries would be the thirteen regional companies.  Potable water supply
and sewerage services in Algeria are the responsibility of thirteen regional
companies, which were established by Presidential Decrees Nos. 83-328 through
340  of  May 14, 1983.   These  companies  have  been  gradually  assuming  this
responsibility  and   taking   over   sector   assets   and   liabilities   from
municipalities and SONADE, a bulk water production company which until then
operated in the concession area of eight of today's companies.   Many of the



- 24 -
existing systems, particularly in the smaller centers, have been poorly
managed and maintained, and it is the intention of the Government that the
newly established companies do not take over responsibility for new centers
faster than their physical and human resources permit.   In this connection,
Loan 2591-AL provides for the purchase of operational equipment, training and
other measures for the institutional deveopment of AGEP and all Regional
Water Companies (paras. 4.02, 4.05).  Each company has a corporate statute, is
financially autonomous and managed as a commercial  undertaking.   AGEP,  the
MHEF's agency, provides assistance to the companies in the setting of their
managerial, technical, financial and training objectives and plans and the
preparation of their budgets and monitors the execution of these plans.  The
sector's investment program, budgets, borrowings  and  tariff adjustments  are
approved  by  the  MHEF  and  other  interested  ministries.    Planning  and
construction of major works are carried out by AGEP.
Organization and Management
4.02     The companies are organized along similar lines, essentially as shown
in the organization chart in Annex 6.  A Board of seven members, chaired by
the G'neral Manager, supervises each company's activities and sets out general
policy guidelines.   Except for two Board members who represent Llic  workers,
the  other  members  are  full-time  managers  of  the  companies.   The  General
Managers are appointed by fresidential Decree upon nomination by the Minister
of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry.  The General Managers are responsible
for the day-to-day operations of the companies which are usually handled by
two departments:  engineering and operations, and finance and administration.
The Bank's Loan 2591-AL partly finances management consultants to assist the
companies to identify suitable organization structures and to bring into
operation acceptable operational systems and procedures.
Staffing
4.03     At the end of 1986, the staff of the eight major companies amounted
to 6,050 employees.  This represents a ratio of about 8.1 employees per 10,000
people served for all companies, which is acceptable, but varies from a low of
seven at EPET to a high of 19 at EPEOU.  All the companies are still in the
process of taking charge of the assets assigned to them , mostly in smaller
size towns.  Therefore,  the number of employees is expected to increase and
the ratio of employees to people served is expected to deteriorate in the
short term.  Over the longer term, however, after the companies have completed
their takeover program, efficiency improvements would be possible (Annex 10),
as reflected by this ratio, which would be monitored during project
implementation.
4.04     The  salaries  and  employment  conditions   in  the  companies  are
satisfactory but lower than in the industry and energy sectors.  Most of the
companies, therefore, are experiencing a difficulty in recruiting staff of
acceptable  quality  in  some  areas  such  as  fiaance  and  accounting.   This
difficulty is accentuated in companies located in places relatively far away
from Algiers.  The sector's national training program, described in the next
paragraph, would help alleviate some of the difficulty.  During negotiations,
the regional companies agreed that they would recruit financial and accounting
managers of adequate qualifications by December 31, 1987.



-  25  -
Trining
4.05     The project  includes US$200,000 for the training of the maniagement
personnel of AGEP and the regional companies.  In addition, the First National
Water Supply and Sewerage Project includes a comprehensive training program
estimated to cost US$3.6 million, with a US$2.0 million foreign exchange
component  partly financed under  Loan 2591-AL.   This  program  is intended to
help the regional water companies meet their training requirements in the
short and medium term.  The program provides for an assessment of the training
needs, design of instruction manuals, acquisition of teaching material and
equipment, selection and training of instructors, the selection and training
of personnel  and evaluation of  the  training  results.   Preparation  of  the
program has been entrusted by the Government to the International Labour
Organization of the United Nations.  The program has been under review by the
Government, is expected to be submitted to the Bank for review in June 1987
and signed by the Government  in July  1987.   Implementation  is expected  to
start in August 1987.
BfiUllg and CoUection
4.06     The billing and collection  systems of all  companies are generally
weak and need redesign and computerization. Major factors are:
(a)  The  absence  of  bulk  metering  at  both  the  production  and
distribution levels, faulty metering (meters out of commission
as well as out of calibration), and the existence of divisional
meters  (one meter  serving  many customers).   All customers who
have no meters or whose meters provide inaccurate readings are
invoiced at an estimated average consumption and charges are
assessed at the first tranche of the domestic tariff, that is at
DA 1.00/m3 , regardless of their estimated consumption.
(b)  There are unidentified customers;   the companies have to take an
inventory of them, provide them with meters and bill them.
(c)  All the companies that were cr3ated from the former SONADE and
from municipalities inherited uncollectable receivables, some
dating back for several years.
(d)  Collection  practices  and  performance  vary  from  company  to
company, but, in general, improvement is needed particularly in
collection of overdue accounts.
In general, there are only estimates of the extent of these deficiencies.
Although each of the companies is making an effort to resolve its difficulties
and visible improvemente are taking place, there remains a need for concerted
effort.   This is being provided under a plan of action which was prepared by
AGEP.  Progress is being monitored under the First National Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Loan 2591-AL).



- 26 -
Accounting Systems
4.07     Apart  from  the  accounts  of  the  former  SONADE,  which  were  kept
independently and on an accrual basis, the accounts for water supply and
sewerage services of the cities formed an integral part of the municipal
accounts.  In general, fixed assets aad inventories were not recorded.  These
accounts have now been separated but the companies' accounting systems and
practices need considerable improvement so that their accounts and financial
statements properly reflect their operations.   The counting and valuation of
fixed assets and inventories are progressing, although at different paces in
each company and without adequate standards.  Current assets and liabilities
of the companies include amounts due, and receivable from other water
companies,  most of which date back to the SONADE times.  AGEP has recently
hired a competent data processing and systems consultant who is in the process
of developing and setting up r. computerized monitoring system for AGEP while
at the same time helping the regional water companies to set up compatible
accounting systems.   Standards and an appropriate methodology, developed by
EPEAL a few years ago, are being provided by AGEP to the regional water
companies to assist them in the counting and valuation of their fixed assets.
Audit
4.08     The accounts of the en"tities which were merged into the newly created
regional  companies  have  not  been  audited  for  some  time.   As  public
enterprises, these companies are subject to audit by "La Cour des Comptes," a
Government  accounting office which carries out  limited  purpose  audits.   A
public utility requires more comprehensive audits directed toward operations
and arrangements similar to those made under Loans 2461-AL and 2591-AL for
EPEAL, EPEOR and EPECO.  Such arrangements should be made for the ten regional
companies which have not yet adopted adequate audit procedures.
4.09     The three regional companies mentioned above are currently audited by
"Societe Nationale de Compatibilite", a state audit firm, whose audit work is
satisfactory.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the remaining
companies to have their accounts audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank
and to submit their annual financial statements certified by such auditors as
well as the audit reports to the Bank no later than nine months after the end
of each fiscal year, beginning with 1987.
Insurance
4.10     The regional companies  carry insurance for workmen's  compensation,
third party liability and motor vehicles.   Other assets are insured by the
Government.  All supply and civil works contracts for the project would be
insured against loss or damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property
dawage in accordance with normal Government procedures.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past and Present Financial Performace
5.01     The recently created regional water supply and sewerage companies are
responsible for systems which for a large part were operated by the
municipalities.  The result of their operations - revenues and expenditures -
were integrated with those of the rest of municipal activities and for this
reason  no  reliable  data  were  available  at  the  time  the  sector  was
reorganized.   There  was no inventory of either fixed assets or stocks of
repair parts and materials.  As can be expected in similar situations,  the
newly formed companies are only gradually assuming responsibility for the
services of the numerous and varied-sized population centers in their area.
Thus, existing data are still deficient and the financial statements for 1984
and 1985 presented in Annexes 7 and 8 therefore include a mix of actual and
estimated  figures.   The  financial  analysis  covers  eight  of  the  thirteen
Regional Water Companies which, in terms of operating cost and size of
operations are representative of the sector and account for an estimated 901
of sector assets and revenues.
5.02     Because of widely different capital and operating cost  structures,
some companies were profitable and others were not. However, in aggregate, in
each of  1984 and  1985,  the  eight  regional  companies  made  a  loss.   This
indicates the overall insufficience of the then prevailing tariffs and in most
instances, the need for improving operating efficiency.  A substantial tariff
increase has since been introduced (para. 5.07) and plans of action to improve
efficiency are being implemented under the First National  Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Loan 2591-AL).
5.03     The  bulk  of  existing  fixed  assets  were  financed  by  Government
contributions and not surprisingly the regional companies' combined long-term
debt to equity ratio at the end of 1985 was 6/94.  At that time, receivables
were relatively high at the equivalent of 7.6 months of sales, reflecting
mostly the practice of billing only twice a year. Receivables are expected to
decline with the introduction of computerized quarterly billing already in
progress in some of the companies.
Revenues
5.04     Water supply and sewerage  revenues are derived principally from a
unique tariff which covers both water supply and sewerage services based on
metered water consumption. Charges are also assessed, although not uniformly
among companies, on new connections, water meter rentals, connection
maintenance fees, and service fees for meter reading and billing of consumers
living in appartment buildings.
5.05     Tariffs set the price per cubic meter higher for public, commercial
and industri,l consumers than for domestic consumers and contain steps with
price increasing with consumption for the latter (Annex 15).



-  28  -
5.06     The country's  cost recovery policy  is embodied  in  Decree N84-267
of October 29, 1985 which stipulates, inter alia, that tariff levels must be
sufficient  to  cover  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and  increasingly
contribute to the recovery of capital costs.  The revenue covenants contained
in existing Bank Loan Agreements for the Algiers, Oran and Constantine
companies already reflect this policy.
5.07     The   last  tariff  adjustment  of  November 1, 1985,  increased  the
aggregate revenues of the sector companies by about 40%.  However, tariffs had
been  too  low  for  so  long  that  even  this  substantial  increase  is  still
insufficient for the sector as a whole to finance a significant part of its
large investments, as can be seen in the estimated sources and application of
funds statements for 1986 (Annex 9).
5.08     A salient  feature  of  the November  1985  tariff  adjustment  was  the
introduction of a national, country-wide uniform tariff, regardless of the
widely different operating and capital cost structures of the individual
companies.  The average estimated cost per cubic meter sold for 1987 is about
DA 1.63, the lowest DA 1.10 and the highest DA 2.73.  While a uniform tariff
recovers the costs of the sector as a whole, it results in some companies
having large profits and others losses.
5.09     The introduction of a new tariff, coupled with existing income tax
and dividend policies, has led the Government to adopt the following measures:
(a)  set a tariff for the sector as a whole at a level sufficient to
cover operation and maintenance costs and debt service and to
recover a portion of the investments of the sector;
(b)  set each year appropriate  operating and financial targets for
each of the companies based on their individual cost structure
and approved investment plans; and
(c)  on the basis of each company's operating and financial targets
(b above), determine and earmark, in the Government budget, the
necessary capital and operating contributions to these companies.
The above measures would ensure that the sector, as a whole, is financially
viable,  that  the  individurl  companies  can  be  held  accountable  through
appropriate operating and financial targets (such as staff per thousand people
served, unaccounted-for water, operating ratio, debt service coverage,
collection ratio and self-financing ratio) and that all have sufficient cash
to meet their obligations and to operate efficiently.  The operating standards
envisaged and the overall sector development policies and control are
acceptable. During negotiations, its was agreed that, in conjunction with the
annual budget exercise, the Government would before each fiscal year discuss
with the Bank its tariff adjustment and capital and operating contribution
proposal for said year.

Future Financial Performance
5.10     Projected   income   statements,   balance   sheets   and  sources  and
applications of funds statements for the eight regional companies appear in
Annexes 7 to 9, and major assumptions in Annex 12.  In general, expenses have
been calculated as a factor of various operating criteria, adjusted for
estimated future inflation, and revenues on the premise that the tariff would
be adjusted  to enable  the sector as a whole  to  cover  its  operation  and
maintenance   expenses,   debt   service   and   contribute   towards   sector
investments -'  from  internally  generated  cash  (before  income  tax  and
dividends) of about 5% in 1987, 10Z in 1988 and 152 in years thereafter.  It
is estimated that tariff increases of about 15X, 20% and 302  in 1988, 1989
and 1990 respectively, would be sufficient to meet this objective in the short
and medium term. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would:
(a)  cause the water and sewerage companies to take measures to meet
their operating and financial targets and to adjust their water
tariff as necessary to generate in the aggregate during each
fiscal year, revenues sufficient to cover all of their operating
expenses (excluding depreciation), debt service (including
service of Government loans) , any increase in working capital,
and in 1987, 1988, 1989 and thereafter not less than SZ, 102 and
15% respectively of their annual average estimated capitsl
expenditures in the year considered and the two following
years; and
(b) discuss with the Bank the regional companies' proposal as well
as the Government's proposed actions (para. 5.09).
On these assumptions, the sector's projected investment and financing programs
for the period 1986-1991 have been estimated and are graphically illustrated
in Annex 11.
5.11     The  projected  sources  and  applications  of  funds  for  the  period
1987-91, based on the above assumptions, are summarized below.  The net flow
of funds resulting from either the payment of income tax and dividends by the
profitable companies or the subsidies to be received by the deficit companies,
has been included in Government equity contributions.
'/      For this purpose, sector investments of a given year mean one third
of the estimated investments to be made during that year and the two
years which follow.

regional companies would increase from 8/92 in 1986 to 38/62 in 1991, while
their debt service coverage would decline from 4.3 to 1.6, respectively, which
are both acceptable.
Monitorg System
5.13     Technical and financial indicators have been identified (Annex 10) as
a means of monitoring the performance of eight of the regional companies
during project implementation.  Annex 10 also shows the values forecast  for
these indicators  in the years 1986 through 1991.  These values were agreed



- 31 -
upon during negotiations.  Furthermore, it was agreed that the remaining five
companies  would  develop  similar  indicators  acceptable  to  the  Bank  by
December 31, 1987, and that the regional companies would:
(a) report the evolution of the indicators to the Bank on a
quarterly basis during project implementation; and
(b) carry out any reasonable remedial action suggested by the Bank,
aiming at meeting the targeted values of the indicators.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Objectives of the Proposed Investments
6.01     The need for improving and  increasing  urban  water  supply  to  the
medium-sized towns throughout the country is evident from the existing
widespread  and  severe  water  shortages.   The  current  average  per  capita
consumption in the project area is about 80 liters/day but this conceals large
variations among different income groups. The shortage of piped potable water
inside the dwellings, coupled with high density population, inadequate
sanitation, and inadequate sewage treatment facilities appear to be the
leading cause of infectious diseases in the urban areas.  Cholera, typhoid,
paratyphoid, dysentery and infectious hepatitis are endemic.
6.02     The proposed project would help to increase water production to the
levels required to reduce the current supply deficit in the project area with
the objective of meeting water needs of years 1995/2010, based on the
Government's  goal  to supply between 150 and 200 lcd.  The quality of water
served would also be greatly improved due to the combined effects of improved
water treatment and the protection of the raw water sources by the treatment
of sewage prior to its discharge to water courses and rivers.  The project
would  benefit  some  2.2 million  people  living  in  the  project  area.   The
extension of water supply networks in the thirteen regional companies would
help supply water needed in the rapidly expanding urban areas.  The proposed
works would also provide water for industry where industrial development has
been constrained by the inadequacy of basic services.   It is estimated that
about 20% of project beneficiaries would have incomes below the urban poverty
threshold,   currently  estimated  at  DA 2,193  per  capita.-I   It  is  also
estimated that about 302 of project costs and related benefits would directly
benefit the pcor.
Technological Aspects
6.03     There  are no  additional  readily  available  potential  water supply
sources near the cities in the project area. More distant dams and wellfields
The 1980 level of DA 1,270, the last available, updated by changes in
the CPI.  Approximately 15X of the urban population as a whole have
income below this level.



- 32 -
have therefore been selected as future sources of supply and provide least
cost solutions for meeting water needs.  The comparatively long transmission
lines, which are unavoidable whetL resorting to distant water sources, are
sized to provide the least cost solution, and in all cases, they would be
dimensioned  for  the maximum supply demand capacity in the year 2000.   The
major components of the water treatment plants, however, would be constructed
in stages  to meet demand.   The dams are multipurpose  supplying irrigation
water to extensive agricultural lands near these cities in addition to water
for municipal uses.  Sewage treatment works would be construicted  in stages
according to needs and have been designed to produce an e(fflulent which will
maintain receiving waters of acceptable quality.
Economic Acceptabiity
6.04     The overriding justification for the proposed investments is the neeo
to  provide  adequate  water  supply  and  environmental  protection  to  the
inhabitants of the project area, in accordance with the social objectives of
the Government of Algeria.   The internal  rate of return of the project is
about 3X.  However, this rate of return, which was computed on the basis of
current tariffs, gives a misleading picture of the real benefits of the
project.   Tariffs,  historically  very  low  in  Algeria,  have  been  adjusted
sharply upwards over recent years, by an average 40X in 1985, 1' and further
substantial tariff increases should take place over the next several years.
(See agreed  covenant  in para. 5.10).   If the 30% tariff inr.reases in real
terms estimated to be needed by 1990 were considered, then the internal rate
of return would increase to about 5%.  Also, the 3% internaL i-ate of return
obtained for the project ignores the effects of the nationwide application of
a unique tariff with its resulting surpluses and deficits for different
regions of the country.
6.05     The calculated return also understates other project benefits.  There
are many health, environmental and employment benefits that the project would
generate, such as:
(a)  reduced expenses for health care;
(b) higher productivity of children in school;
(c) improved welfare of the population, stemming from a cleaner and
better environment;
(d) workers' higher productivity as a result of better health,
leading to a higher economic return on the proposed investments;
(e)  increased    employment    opportunities    generated    by    tne
implementation of these works; and
(f) increased industrial production, currently constrained by lack
of water.
This average increase, however, hides the fact thac many consumers
are paying for water for the first time.



-  33  -
These benefits, however, are difficult to quantify and a more
comprehensive return was not calculated.
Affordability
6.06     The relative poverty level in urban areas is estimated to be DA 2,193
per capita per annum.  The results of a survey of household expenses for basic
items are given in Annex 13.  At present tariff levels, water supply accounts
for about 1 percent of a household's total expenses and is not considered a
burden on the household budget.   As an example,  to achieve an ERR of  102
(Annex 14),  expenditure  on  water  would  still  account  for  about  2X  of
households total expenses, which is far less than the usually accepted level
of 5 percent of average disposable income of the lowest income group.
Therefore, the service levels provided by the project are in accordance with
generally accepted  criteria  for affordability.   The analysis indicates  that
there is substantial scope for increasing water tariffs above their present
levels and increasing the self-financing ratio of the water supply companies.
Environmental impaCt of the Project
6.07     The proposed project  is not expected to have adverse effects on the
environment.   On  the  contrary,  it would  enhance  the  overall  environment
because  of  its  integrated  water  management  concept.   The  most  important
benefits are the improvements to urban health environment by the supply of
adequate quantities of safe water and acceptable waste water disposal measures
and improvement of the surrounding agricultural environment through the use of
less polluted  raw water for  irrigation.   There would be no destruction of
essential wildlands.
Risks
6.08     There are no special risks involved in the technical execution of the
project.  Regarding cost recovery, there is a risk that the Government may not
implement the tariff increases, projected to rise by about 302 in real terms
by 1990, in '-he time required to attain the sector's financial objectives.
This risk, however, is reduced by the Government's recent decision regarding
the financial framework and objectives for the sector, which emphasize that
the water companies would be managed as commercial enterprises and should
charge the tariffs necessary to finance their investments through a mix of
borrowings  and  internal  cash  generation.   The  general  lack  of  accurate
statistics in the sector introduces some uncertainty in the estimates used in
this report. The accelerated pace of development that the sector has had over
the last several years and which it will maintain at least over the next few
years raises the need for more reliable data, and these should gradually
become available with the implementation of the sector survey now in progress
and the program of technical assistance for AGEP and the regional companies
financed by Loan 2591-AL.
VI. A<;REEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreement having been reached on the issues outlined in Chapters III.
through V. 9 the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of $250.0 million
to the Government of Algeria for a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace.

SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SUBPROJECTS
Introduction
1.       This Annex describes the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
investment which would be made on four regional water supply and three
sewerage subprojects, expansion and renovation of water distribution systems
of the 13 regional water ccmpanies, construction supervision, interbasin water
transfer  studies,  a  water  and  sewerage  ctistruction  industry  study,  and
training, all of which constitute the proposed project.   Each regional water
supply and sewerage subproject is described individually in this Annex from
pages 1 to 8, followed by summary sheets for total cests for all subprojects
including construction supervision, cost of distribution pipes, a study of the
construction industry in the water supply and sewerage sector and regional
water production, consumption and sewage statistics on pages 9 to 12.
Finally, the sector invest.ment tables for the Second Five-Year Development
Plan are shown on pages 13 and 14.
2.        Im,lementation of the seven subprojects would start during the Second
Plan and wotld be completed and commissioned by the end of the Plan.  The four
regional water supply subprojects would be executed in five provinces (Annaba,
Guelma, Tebessa, Tamanrasset and S'ida) to serve 17 towns with populations
ranging  from  15,000  to 380,000  inhabitant .  The  three  sewage  subprojects
would be executed in two provinces (Setif and Tlemcen) to serve three towns
with populations ranging from 55,000 to 177,000 inhabitants. The water supply
and sewerage works would be operated by six regional water supply companies,
namely EPEA, EPEBA, EPEOU, EPES, EPET and EPEOR.
3.       Total investments in the water supply and sewerage sector during the
Second   Five-Year   Development   Plan   are   estimated   at   DA 10.4 billion
(US$2.2 billion)   with   an   estimated   foreign   exchange   component   of
DA 5.1 billion (US$1.1 billion) or about 50 percent of the total cost, of
which   DA 4.8 billion   (US$1.06 billion)   are   direct   foreign   exchange
expenditures.
A.       WATER SUPPLY SUBPROJECTS
AMN DALIA - SOUK AHRAS - OUENZA SUBPROJECT
4.       This subproject would be built to expand water supply services in the
provinces of Guelma and Tebessa.   Additional water would be provided to the
city of Souk Ahras in Guelma and the cities of Ouenza, El Aouinet and
neighbouring  towns  in  the  Province  of  Tebessa.   The  total  population  is
estimated at 196,000 of which 80X are serviced.   Presently, both Souk Ahras
and Ouenza are supplied with groundwater. Per capita consumption of this area
is about 31 liters/day. Under the proposed project, water production would be
increased by about 1,300 1/sec.  By the year 2010, water demand in Souk Ahras



-  36  -
Annex 2
Page 2 of 14
is projected to reach 680 1/sec, in Ouenza 340 1/sec and in El Aouinet
120 1/sec.   To  meet  the  demand  in  these  cities,  an  additional  flow  of
1,140 1/sec, to be provided under the proposed project, would need to be
allocated  to  them.   The  balance  of  260 1/sec  would  be  used  to feed  the
southern area of the Guelma Province and Tebessa's Northern Water System.
5.       The proposed subproject consists of the construction of a dam at Ain
Dalia  on  the  Oued  Medjerdah  to  create  a  60 Hm3  reservoir.   From  this
reservoir, raw water will be diverted and treated in a plant located about
1.5 Kms downstream from the dam site.  The Ain Dalia Dam would be a rock-fill
dam with an  impervious  element.   It is presently under  construction.   The
treatment  plant  would  have  an average  capacity  of  1.3 m3/sec.   From  the
plant, treated water will be pumped to a reservoir (Djebel Dekma) from where
it will flow by gravity to the Souk Ahras area.  Cities and towns in Tebessa
Province would be supplied from a pumping station (El Hanri) located on the
Djebel Dekma Pipeline.
6.       The  total  subproject  cost  excluding  the  dam and  DA 34.90 million
(US$7.4 million) for distribution pipes is estimated at DA 649.79 million
(US$138.3 million). The cost estimate summiary is as follows:

IN AMGUEL - TAMANRASSET SUBPROJECT
7.       Tamanrasset  is a city  located  in the heart of the Sahara Desert.
Current population is estimated at 15,300.   The population  is projected  to
reach 24,300 by the year 2000.  Potable water is in short supply in this city,
average consumption per capita being 41 liters/day.  To improve the situation,
a groundwater source will be tapped about 131 Kms to the north of the city.
The proposed subproject includes the construction of:
(i)    a wellfield at In Amgel,  comprising  eight  wells  equipped
with submersible pumps;
(ii)    two 1000 m3 storage tanks;
(iii)    two booster pumping stations;  and
(iv)    a  300 mm  dia.  transmission  pipe with a  total  length of
131 Kms.
8.       The average yield of the wellfield will be about 60 l/s, which should
be sufficient to cover water demands through the year 2000.
9.        The   estimated   total   subproject  cost  excluding  DA 8.80 million
(US$1.9 million) for pipes for the distribution network is DA 211.81 million
(US$45.1 million). A breakdown of the estimates is given below:

AIN SKHOUNA - SAIDA SUBPROJECT
10.      Saida  is a city  located  in the Sahara Desert with characteristics
similar to those of Tamanrasset.   Current population,  including neighbouring
towns,  is about  12i,000, of which 80X are served.  The existing water supply
restricts  consumption  to 99 lcd.   To  increase  the  supply  and  satisfy  the
demand to the year 1997, when the population is expected to reach about
160,000, groundwater will be tapped about 106 kms to the southeast at Amn
Skhouna. The proposed subproject includes the construction of:
(i)    a wellfield  at Ain Skhouna, comprising one well equipped with
submersible pumps;
(ii)    three 1000 m3 storage tanks;
(iii)    two booster pumping stations; and
(iv)    a 106 km long transmission pipe 1,000 mm in diameter.
11,      The average yield of the wellfield will be about 400 1/sec.   It is
envisaged that by 1997, a second phase would be implemented which would double
this yield and thus ensure the water supply beyond the year 2000.
12.      The   estimated   total   subproject    cost    is   DA 539.59 million
(US$114.8 million).   A  breakdown  of  the  estimates  is  given  below.   The
DA 10.80 million (US$2.3 million) for pipes for the distribution system are
not included:

MEXENNA - ANNABA SUBPROJECT
13.      A dam on Oued El Kebir at Mexenna is currently under construction and
would be used for potable water supply and irrigation in the Bouteldja
Valley.   The dam would  regulate a volume  of 174 Mm3/year.   Of  this,  about
48 Mm /year would be used in 1995 for potable water supply ana the rest for
irrigation. Water supply services would be expanded in the counties of Annaba
and Drean.   By  1995,  water demands are expected  to average 64 Mm3/year in
Annaba and  15 Mm3/year  in  Drean.   Current  available  production  for  these
counties stand at about 31 Mm3/year.
14.      Raw water from  the Mexenna Reservoir would be  treated in two new
treatment plants.  A first one with a capacity of  1 m3/sec  would be built
near  the  township of  Bouteldja  located about 23 Kms downstream the Mexenna
Dam.   Water will flow by gravity to this plant.   Another  plant,  with  an
average  capacity  of  0.5 m3/sec  would  be  constructed  opposite  to  the
Bouteldja Plant,  to serve El Kala Township.  A 1,200 mm dia. pipe would be
built  to convey raw water to the Bouteldja Treatment Plant;  a 700 mm dia.
pipeline will supply the El Kala Treatment Plant. A 1,500 mm dia. pipe will
be built to convey raw water tor irrigation.
15.      The   estimated   total   subproject   cost,  excluding  the  dam,   is
DA 382.62 million (US$81.4 million). The cost estimate summary is as follows:

B.       SEWAGE & WASTE WATER TREATMENT SUBPROJECTS
TLEMCEN SEWAGE TREATMENT WORKS SUBPROJECT
16.      Tlemcen  is  the  capital  city  of  the  Wilaya  of  Tlemcen,  with  a
population of about 110,000.  At present, all its waste waters are discharged
without  pretreatment   into  the  river  which  flows   through   this   urban
agglomeration, the Oued Chabet El Horrah, a tributary of the Oued Tafna.  The
proposed sewage treatment plant would be built  on  the  river bank near  the
industrial zone to the North of the city where the three main collectors
converge.
17.      The  function  of  this  treatment  works  is  threefold:  to  reduce
environmental pollution, mitigate the public health hazard potential where
river water is used for irrigation and protect the Oued Tafna which is a raw
water source.   This Oued has recently been diverted to improve the supply of
potable water to Oran, population 700,000, via the Tafna-Oran transfer now
under construction (Loan 2591-AL).
18.      The proposed treatment works would have a capacity of 30,000 m3/day
which would be sufficient to meet the treatment demand until the year 2005
when the population is expected to be about 160,000.
19.      The    estimated    total    subproject    cost    is   DA 89.42 million
(US$19.0 million). The cost estimate summary is as follows:

MAGHNIA SEWAGE TREATMENT WORKS SU)3PROJECT
20.      The  city  of Maghnia  in the Wilaya of Tlemcen discharges  its  raw
sewage directly into the Oued Ouerdeffou upon which  it  is situated.   This
creates a health hazard for its 55,000 inhabitants as the river water is used
for irrigation.  Furthermore, the Oued Ouerdeffou is a tributary of the Oued
Tafna which is an important raw water source for the Oran potable water supply
network, via the Tafna-Oran Transfer and its water treatment works now under
construction  (Loan  2591-AL).   The  proposed  sewage  treatment  works  would
mitigate the health hazards for Maghnia and protect the vital water sources
for the 700,000 inhabitants of Oran.
21.      The proposed works would be situated 3 km east of the city on the
Oued Ouerdeffou.   Phase I of  the proposed works would have a  capacity  of
14,500 m3/day, sufficient for 1989 and a population of 63,000 (4.5% growth
rate). Phase II would follow immediately. The sewerage network in Maghnie is
currently being extended to serve new urban development.
22.      The    estimated    total    subproject   cost    is   DA 68.98 million
(US$14.7 million). The cost estimate summary is as follows:

SETIF SEWAGE TREATMENT WORKS SUBPROJECT
23.      This  subproject  would complete  the sewerage system of the city of
Setif,   capital   of   the   Wilaya   of   Setif.    This   agglomeration   of
177,000 inhabitants is sited on the banks of the Oued Bou Sellam and its
sewage, including industrial wastewater, is discharged Jirectly into this
river without any pretreatment.  The sewage treatment works  'ould form part of
the water cycle management infrastructure of this area.  The other components
are the Ain Zada dam and water treatment works located 25 kms downstream of
Setif currently under construction.   This dan is  to be  the main  raw water
source for Setif, El Eulma and Bordi Bou Arridij, cities with a combined
population  of  425,000.   Therefore,  the main  function  of  the  Setif  sewage
treatment  works  would  be  to  protect  this  vital  water  soturce  and  its
surrounding environment.
24.      The proposed treatment works would have a capacity of 44,000 m3 /day
and  is to be Phase I and would serve the city to the year 1990.   Phase II
would follow immediately. By 1990, the population is expected to have reached
205,000 assuming a continued growth rate of 32 per annum.

ALGERIA
SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A REVIEW
OF
THE HYDRAULIC CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN ALGERIA
Introduction
1.       The construction industry can be a major contributor to the process
of development. In Algeria, the construction industry grew from 9.3 percent
of GDP in 1970 to 12.1 percent in 1980. The gross value of construction
during the period 1970-80 accounted for 47 percent of gross domestic fixed
capital formation. The construction industry in Algeria, however, is
suffering from administrative and allocative inefficiencies. It is evident
that improving construction capacity and capability in Algeria would be
beneficial for the economy. The Government is committed to improving the
efficiency, timeliness and quality of construction and maintenance work. Its
objective is to make the construction industry sector more compet'tive and
responsive to public investment programs.
2.       The review is concerned only with construction carried out in the
hydraulic sector. Possibly, the situation is identical in other sectors and
the conclusions and recommendations made under the present studies may be
applicable to the whole construction industry in Algeria.
Objectives
3.       The objective of the study is to identify the main constraints and
obstacles preventing the hydraulic sector of the Algerian construction
industry from becoming more comretitive with foreign construction firms, and
to develop appropriate plans of action to overcome those constraints.
4.       While the following sections attempt to present a comprehensive iist
of the aspects that need to be considered, the work process should be to
undertake a brief but balanced and careful overview, and then to focus on the
main issues on which action is needed. Most of the effort of the study will,
thus, be devoted to identifying and considering alternative, viable solutions
to the problems and to working up action plans for their implementation.

Anmex 3
Pap 2 of 7
5.       To ensure full commitment of the government and of the industry to
the execution of the strategy and action plans, they should be developed in
close collaboration with the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry
(MHEF) and the Ministry of Commerce.
Scop of the StudV
6.       The study of this sector and its environment and the formulation of a
strategy and action plans will be based on a careful consideration of the
following subjects:
6.1      Structure of the Iutry
(a) Historical development of the industry. Emergence of
entrepreneurs and leaders and ownership characteristics of
hydraulic construction enterprises. Traditional construction
technology.
(b) Participation of the sector in the economy of the country:
contribution to GDP, contribution to employment, nominal
productivity per capita, backward and forward linkages,
particularly with the construction materials industry.
Comparison with developed countries and with countries at a
similar stage of development as Algeria. Identification and
analysis of anomalies.
(c) Experience with joint ventures and domestic subcontractors of
foreign firms.
(d) General appreciation of the efficiency and efficacity of the
sector and its ability to respond to the demand for construction
maintenance services.
6.2      Demand
(a) Overall demand: historical series, fluctuation of annual growth
rates relative to the manufacturing industry in general and GDP,
identification of trends.
(b) The specialization of hydraulic construction demand arising from
the private and public sectors. Historical series and future
trends. Geographical distribution.
(c) Forecast future demand, identifying in particular:
(i)    Recurring demand for construction and maintenance services
which can potentially be supplied by the domestic sector;

Annex 3
Page 3 of 7
(ii)    Demand for larger construction works which can be handled
by domestic enterprises, either by slicing and packaging or
by providing those enterpri&es with technical and financial
assistance; and
(iii)    Demand for larger or highly specialized construction work,
requiring expertise or capacity that is not available in
the country.
(d) The process of generating demand. The influence of the
government's planning and work execution programs in the
generation of public and private demand for hydraulic
construction services. Policies (economic, financial, fiscal,
and so forth) influencing demand and their effect on specific
types of demand.
6.3      Procurement and Contract Administration
(a) Procedures for procurement. Regulations for bidding or
negotiating construction and maintenance work. Existence and
adequacy of contractor's registry. Time consumed and
difficulties encountered in the post-bid process, up to the
start of the work.
(b) Contract forms and contracting practice. Fairness of contract
provisions, particularly in the apportionment of risk between
owner and contractor; compensation to the contractor for
default by the owner (for example interest payable for late
progress payments, or compensation for delays induced by the
owner); adequacy of provisions for price escalation and
settlement of disputes. Existence of indices or data sources
for applying escalation provisions.
(c) Policy and legal framework for contracting with public sector
construction organizations.
(d) Adequacy of owner's establishment to manage contracts and
supervise construction. Autonomy of government supervisors.
Adequacy of delegation to consultants employed for supervision;
restrictions which may inhibit the engagement of competent
supervisors.
(e) Adequacy of the engineering process to the level of development
of the domestic construction industry (for example, is the
contractor required to tender on preliminary engineering and to
finalize engineering as part of his brief? Are method
specifications used to supplement performance specifications?)

(f) Procedures being used, or potentially applicable, to foster the
industry (or a sector). Special provisions which must be
introduced for this purpose.
(g) Anomalies and difficulties observed in the process of
procurement, management, and completion of construction

SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
EIGHT COMPANIES - ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. General
The financial projections were derived by adding the prijections for
each of the following companies: EPEAL, EPEOR, EPECO, EPEA, EPEBA, EPES,
EPEOU, and EPET.  No set-off was tmade among the intercompany receivables and
payables, which were assumed to be cancelled out in 1987 through offsets and
cash payments.
The financial projections for EPEAL, and for EPEOR and EPECO are
updates of those presented in the SARs for Loans 2461-AL and 2591-AL,
respectively. An 8% p.a. inflation rate was applied from 1987 on to the
operating expenses.
B. Income Statements
1.       Operating Revenues
(a)  Water production and sales for EPEAL, and for EPEOR and EPECO
were updated from the figures shown in the SARs for Loans
2461-AL and 2591-AL, respectively. For the other companies,
they were estimated to grow at tthe same pace as population
growth in each area. The impact of the companies' take over
program was estimated.
(b)  Given that there is only one national tariff and that financial
objectives have been defined for the sector as a whole, revenues
were computed for the addition of all eight companies. These
eight companies are an acceptable proxy for the sector, as they
represent about 90X of the whole sector. Water revenues were
first computed on the basis of existing tariffs. The 1987
average revenue per m3 of DA1.56 at current tariffs was
derived using the follawing demand structure for all eight
companies:
Consumption       Demand          4,verage             Weighted
__yt__      Structure (%)   Revenue (DA)   Average Revenue (DA)
Domestic            61.6            0.98               0.604
Commercial           7.6            2.50               0.190
Public              10.4            2.00               0.208
Industrial          14.6            3.00              0.438
Others               5.8            2.00               0.116
Total            100.0                               1.556

Annex 12
Page 2 of 4
The DAO.98 average revenue for domestic consumers was derived from
the records of some of the companies and were subject to several rather weak
tests, such as looking into the possible extent of metering problems and
others. Rate increases were computed so that by 1989, net internal cash
generation would be equivalent to about 15% of the companies' investment.
(c) Water rental and maintenance were calculated by multiplying the
number of connections by DA40.0, which is the estimated average
charge per connection. Actual rates range from DA26.0 to
DA54.0. The number of connections were derived by dividing the
population connected by the average family size of 6.8.
(d) New connections charges were obtained by dividing the revenues
from new connections for each year, by the average fee of
DA950. The average fee was inflated at 82 p.a. starting 1987.
2.       Operating Expenses
(a) Personnel:
The companies' estimates for number of staff and average cost
per staff for 1986, which are reasonable, were taken as a
basis. Expenses for 1987 on were computed assuming an
81 inflation rate. Changes in the number of staff in each
company was chosen to allow for improvement in the ratio of
staff to population served.
(b) Energy and Fuel:
Each company's estimate water production and energy costs for
1986, which are reasonable, were taken as a basis. Unit energy
cost per m3 of water production was inflated at 81 p.a. For
EPEAL, EPEOR and EPECO, from 1987 on, water production was
separated between existing (old) and additional (new)
production; an estimated 5% efficiency improvement was allowed
for existing production while a 301 cost decrease was allowed
for additional production as new plant is about 30S more
energy-efficient than existing plant.
(c) Materials and Maintenance:
Materials were computeA on the basis of estimates for the number
of new connections and the average cost per connection. The
average cost per connection of about DA460 was inflated at 81
p.a. starting 1986. Maintenance expenses were projected at 0.5%
of year-end gross fixed assets in operation.

Pop 3 of 4
(d) Taxes:
Calculated at 61 on salaries, 2.531 on gross revenues and 11.1%
on purchases of materials.
(e) Administrative Expenses:
The 1985 actual amount was taken as a basis and inflated at 8S
p.a. thereafter.
(f) Depreciation:
Calculated on a straight-line basis at average rates ranging
between 2.2S and 3.21.
(g) Labor Bonus:
Estimated at 91 of personnel costs.
(h) Income Tax:
Estimated at the current 551 rate.
(i) Dividend Payments:
Estimated at the current rate of 501 if there are profits.
C.       Balance Sheets and Source and Appliation of Funds
1.       Pixed Assets and Investment Prousm:
The investment program to 1989 is that described in Annex 5. The
average annual investments for the period 1987 to 1989 for each
company was taken as an estimate for 1990 and 1991.
2.       Finacing Propa:
EPEAL, EPEOR and EPECO's investment program carried out by MEEF, are
financed by Bank loans and Government equity contributions. Bank
loans are onlent to these companies as follows: Loan 1545-AL: 7.45X
interest rate, 17-year repayment period starting 1986; Loans 2461-AL
and 2591-AL: 101 interest rate, 20-year repayment period starting
1989. These companies finance their own construction with a mixture
of medium and long-term loans. MT loans carrr an average interest
rate of about 51, 2 years of grace and are repaid over a 5-year
average period. LT loans carry an average interest rate of 61,



-  67  -
Annex 12
Page 4 of 4
5 years of grace and are repaid over a 15-year average period.
Financing of the proposed project will be provided by the companies
(151) and by Government loans including relending of the proposed
loan and equity contributions. It was assumed that the proposed
syndicated loan would be re-lent to the companies. Government
relending terms on both the proposed Bank loan and the proposed
syndicated loan would carry a 101 interest rate, 5 years of grace and
would be repaid over a 20-year period.
3.       Equity Contributions
Were estimated to close any financing gap or to cover any foreign
exchange requirement not financed by borrowings.
4.       Current Assets
(a)  Cash:  requirements for cash on hand were estimated at 15 days
of cash operating expenses (including labur bonus and income
tax), investments carried out by these companies and debt
service requirements.
(b) Receivables: computed to reflect progressive improvements in
collection, as shown by the monitoring indicators.
(c) Inventories: calculated to reflect improvements in inventory
management to decline to 0.5 month consumption of materials by
1990.
(d) Other Receivables: computed at 15% of material and maintenance
expenses, 35S of the companies' own construction expenditures
(252 import deposits and 101 advances to contractors), 50% of
revenues from new connections and others to grow at the 81
inflation rate.
5.       Current Liabilities:
Payables were estimated at 15 days of personnel costs (including
bonus), 2 months of energy costs, 3 months of materials and
maintenance expenses and own construction expenditures, 6 months
taxes other than income tax, a full year of income tax, 251 of
personnel costs (consisting of social security, withholdings and
others) and customs deposits were inflated at the 81.

Notes
1.    O&M costs were estimated at 4-52 of investmer.t cost.  Incremental sales
were estimated on the assumption that water consumption per capita will
gradually increase from the present average of 80 lcd to about 200 lcd
by the year 2000 as per government policy.
Revenues  were  computed  at  the  current  average  revenue  per  m3  of
DA 1.56.   If revenues were computed  considering  the covenanted  tariff
increases  to 1990 of  302 in real  terms,  that  is at DA 2.06 per m3 
then  the  IRR  would  be  about  5.22.    Investments  included  in  the
c3lculations do not consider DA 575 million of distribution pipes, due
to the difficulty of establishing precise benefits.
2.    IRRs  for  each  subproject  range  from  negative,  that  is  incremental
revenues never exceed incremental costs, to 31X for the Tlemcen and
Maghnia S.T.W.  subprojects  considered  together  (para. 3 below).   This
discrepancy  anong  the  individual  subprojects'   IRRs  is  a  natural
consequence of the national, country-wide tariff schedule.
3.    The Tlemcen S.T.W. has been lumped together with the Maghnia S.T.W. as
the two subprojects have the same beneficiaries.   The benefits of the
three S.T.W. subprojects have been estimated as the incremental sales to
be derived from the water treatment works that would receive downstream
the water treated by the S.T.W.s.   The investment expenditures of the
water  treatment  works  have  been  considered  sunk  costs.   Under  this
assumption, the IRRs of the TIemcen/Maghnia S.T.W. subproject and of the
Setif S.T.W. subproject would be about 311 and 71, respectively.  If the
investment expenditures sunk in the water treatment works were included
in the computations, then the IRRs would be about 4% and negative 14.51,
respectively.
