INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A SECOND NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Democratic and Popular
Republic of Algeria for US$250 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years including a 3-year grace
period at the standard variable IBRD interest rate and would help finance a
water supply and sewerage project.
2.       E             Since  Algeria's  independence   in  1962,   its  urban
population has grown rapidly in the medium-size cities and towns adjacent to
the large metropolitan areas of Algiers, Oran and Constantine. Until the late
1970s, there had been few improvements in urban infrastructure, particularly
in water supply and sewerage, with consequent increasing shortages of potable
water.   Subsequently,  the Government began to give  priority  to  the water
supply  and  sewerage  sector.   With  Bank  assistance,  the  Government  is
constructing new water supply and sewerage works for the metropolitan areas of
Algiers, Oran and Constantine. Government efforts in the institutional area
have paralleled the physical investments. To improve management of services
and build up the sector's finances, it reorganized the water supply and
sewerage sector by creating thirteen regional companies in 1983.   Technical
assistance for long-term institution building, including a comprehensive
training program, is being partly financed by ongoing Bank loans.  The next
steps in t4e sector's development aim at expanding services in the remaining
regions and consolidating management  of  the new  regional  companies.   The
proposed  project,  for which the Government has requested Bank assistance,
addresses the twin goals of service expansion and improvements in the sector's
efficiency.
3.       Project Objectives  The proposed project is designed to support the
Government's  current  Five-Year  Investment Plan  (1985-1989),  and  continued
institutional   development  of  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  sector.
Specifically, the project would assist the Government to:  (a) improve and
expand water supply services and sewage treatment facilities; (b) support the
Government's sector policy for cost recovery which takes into account the
overall financial viability of the sector, while ensuring adequate financial
accountability  of  the  individual  regional  water  supply  and  sewerage
companies;  (c) enhance the sector's project implementation capabilities; (d)
study and define measures to strengthen the Algerian construction industry in
the  water  supply  and  sewerage  sector;   and  (e)  train  sector management
personnel.
4.       Project Descr4*ion   The  proposed  project  would  be  part  of  the
investment program to be implemented during the last three years (1987-89) of
the Second Development Plan.  It would consist of:  (a) four regional water



- 2 -
supply subprojects, including water production, treatment and transmission
components;  (b)  three  sewage treatment subprojects;   (c) expansion of the
water supply distribution networks of all thirteen regional companies;  (d) a
study of the construction industry in the water supply and sewerage sector
leading to measures to improve its effectiveness;  (e) four interbasin water
transfer studies; and (f) management training. The project is expected to
be completed by end 1989.
As in previous Bank loans to the sector, the executing agency would
be the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry (MHEF).  The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$630.5 million equivalent, with a
foreign   exchange   component   of   US$330.6 million   (52.42),   of   which
US$250.0 million would be financed by the Bank under the proposed loan.  The
remaining foreign exchange and a portion of local costs would be financed by a
US$200.0 million Syndicated Loan and the remaining local costs would be borne
by the Government and by the regional companies. A breakdown of the estimated
costs and  the financing plan are  shown in Schedule- A.   Procurement  and
disbursement procedures are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given
in  Schedules  C and D, respectively.   A map is also attached;   the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 6582a-AL dated March 31, 1987 is being distributed
separately.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement  Since the beginning of its involvement
in the sector, the Bank's lending strategy has been geared essentially towards
the development of a strong institutional framework for the sector, that
should result in sound investment programming, improved operational efficiency
of the regional companies and, ultimately, in improved and expanded services.
To this end, the Bank is actively assisting the Government in putting in place
financially strong and viable organizations in the recently created regional
companies and in expanding water supply services and sewage treatment
facilities in the intermediate cities, as outlined in the current Development
Plan.  Important institutional and tariff reforms have already taken place
under the four previous Bank-financed projects. Tariffs have recently been
set for the sector as a whole at a level sufficient to cover operation and
maintenance costs and debt service and to recover an increasing proportion of
investment.  The proposed project would extend these reforms by helping the
Government to implement financially efficient tariff policies on a cost
recovery basis through the development and implementation of a financial
planning and control system based on appropriate managerial, technical and
financial objectives. Government has the technical and managerial capacity to
implement its sector investment program for the 1985-89 period. The Bank has
reviewed the overall investment program as well as the investment program
proposed for each entity and considers their size, composition and financing
to be adequate.
6.       A&!eed Actions  The Government  and  the  regional water  supply  and
sewerage companies have agreed that they will:   (a) take action including
tariff increases, necessary to achieve the financial objectives which have
been defined as those sector revenues sufficient to cover sector operation and
maintenance expenses, debt service and contribution towards sector average
annual investments from internally generated funds of about 5% in 1987, 10% in



1988 and  15%  thereafter.   Tariffs,  which  have  been  historically  low  in
Algeria, have been adjusted sharply upwards in recent years (by about 40% in
late 1985) and current tariffs are expected to achieve the 1987 sector
objective; tariff increases of the order of 30% in real terms are expected to
be made in the period 1988-1990;  (b) hire financial and accounting managers
by mid-1987;   (c)  send  to  the  Bank by December 31, 1987, a detailed and
satisfactory resettlement plan for the Mexenna dam reservoir area and
implement  it  thereafter;   and  (d)  either,  send to  the Bank  information
regarding an agreement on riparian rights for the Ain Dalia project component,
or, replace this component by another which would conform to Bank criteria for
acceptability, by June 30, 1988. In the event that conditions un4er (d) above
are not met, the Bank would cancel the corresponding loan allocation
(US$26 million).
7.       Justification    The   overriding   justification   for. the   proposed
investments is the need to provide adequate water supply and environirental
protection to the inhabitants of the Project area, in accordance with the
social objectives of the Government of Algeria.   The service levels to be
provided by the Project (802 of population, 150 liters per capita per day,
minimum) are in accordance with generally accepted criteria and current and
future tariffs are affordable.   The Project would also provide significant
health and environmental benefits as well as generating some employment.  The
proposed investments represent the least-cost engineering alternatives to meet
the water demand.
8.       Proiect Risks  There are no special risks involved in the technical
execution of the project.   There is a risk that the Government might not
implement the projected tariff increases in the time required to attain the
sector's  financial  objectives.   This  risk,  however,  is  reduced  by  the
Government's recent decision and actions regarding the financial framework and
objectives for the sector, which emphasize that the water companies would be
managed as commercial enterprises and should charge the tariffs necessary to
finance their investments through a mix of borrowings and internal cash
generation.
9.       Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
